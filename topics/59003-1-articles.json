Everything works fine on the moon though. Ive got a network setup and a Rover on KSC with the best dish i have (Reflectron KR-7) pointed towards the Active Vessel. The Probes in Orbit have 2x Comms DTS-M1, one pointed towards Kerbin and the other towards the Active Vessel. Electric Charge is not an issue. My Space Probe has a Reflectron KR-7 also pointed towards Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy issue: Everything works fine until i pass Minmus orbit. The Connection is lost some hours before going into Sun orbit. I don\u0027t really understand why, maybe its something to do with the Rover?

TWO-WAY communications. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour KSC having all the range in the system is completely useless if the probe/rover doesn\u0027t have the range to talk back. For me, and for most communications and network science types, this would be clear as day. But I realize that as simple as the principle here is, this pushes into adv. telecommunications territory and a lot of the interconnectivity people take for granted these days doesn\u0027t necessarily impart unto them the knowledge of what\u0027s going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, any given computer communications connection can only take place if both parts can communicate across the medium. In the case of probes, the problem you have is not that KSC or your satellite rings don\u0027t have the range to talk to your probe, but because your probe\u0027s transmitter doesn\u0027t have the range to talk back. It\u0027s return signal is too weak and whatever data it\u0027s sending has deteriorated to background static by the time it reaches KSC. KSC sees nothing but static, so the computer connection handshakes required can\u0027t proceed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealistically, one could create a probe that would still work under these conditions. However, it would be no more than a multi-million dollar RC car with a rocket engine strapped to it. You can tell it what to do, but you can\u0027t actually see what it\u0027s doing because it can\u0027t talk back to tell you what it\u0027s doing. What good is a science probe you can tell to do whatever if it can\u0027t talk back?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sunsparc","CreatedById":57309,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T21:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve only done this in Sandbox mode so far, haven\u0027t gotten far enough up the tech tree to do it in Career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sent up 4 sats with 4 dishes and 2 antenna on them.
