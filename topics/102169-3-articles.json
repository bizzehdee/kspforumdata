I get the difficulty with the tech tree. A lot of people say it doesn\u0027t make sense in comparison to what a space-faring society would likely already have at the start of the game (and they\u0027re not wrong) but re-doing such a tech tree in a way that makes it very playable is another story. What one would likely end up having is having Kerbal Space Program turn into Kerbal Plane Program, where you get to fly probes...eventually. And maybe if you get enough science you might get equipment to eventually launch manned missions. But that\u0027s clearly not how the game was intended to be played.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only suggestion I would make is to move the probe parts up by at least one node (at least the starting ones). To wait until tech level 4 to get a now virtually useless probe part (the Stayputnik) given it\u0027s lack of SAS is kind of silly. I might move that all the way up to a level 2 node, and move all the others up one node level. I get that the point of the game is to fly Kerbals, but it would be nice to get probe parts a tad earlier. As for things like getting batteries and ladders later in the game, that\u0027s actually never really bothered me that much b/c we get a basic battery pretty early, and you can do a lot with that without needing other battery upgrades immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022peadar1987\u0022 data-cite=\u0022peadar1987\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan I please make a request?\u003Cp\u003ECan the crew name generator be made to pull from a .cfg file?

I use the Crew Manifest mod myself to do it (though I think you\u0027re asking about a pre-determined list of names, right?). More useful to me would be allowing the career type to be toggleable. I probably get why they don\u0027t - if it were toggleable you could just train a bunch of level 5 pilots, then \u0022retrain\u0022 them to be Scientists and Engineers, who are now all level 5 as well (because level and career type are separate values) and there would be no way for the game to \u0022know\u0022 that one made that change. So I suspect the career-type-by-hash has something to do with that.

Wouldn\u0027t the solution be to have a contract unlock the tech node, so every game has a different tech progression that doesn\u0027t require a tree, but can utilize a matrix so we have much higher replay value? You can even set the tech up in layers to match the contracts and use the difficulty setting to determine how many layers are revealed for early purchase (for those that don\u0027t like the idea of a procedural tech tree).\u003Cp\u003EIt just seems to me that going with the option that generates the most replay value and requires the least amount of work from you guys is win-win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause having a tree may require you to unlock parts that you frankly don\u0027t need or want to get to nodes you DO need or want.
