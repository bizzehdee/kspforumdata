Nor do I care, because I am a senior taking freshman biology, because I transferred in sophomore year and my university demanded that I take it (it doesn\u0027t really help that I came here immediately after my graduate-level advanced biochemistry course). That being said, I obviously have been nosing around the Kerbal forum shamelessly, and an unfortunate behavior seems to dominate the interpersonal interaction between you, my fellow Kerballers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis behavior in question: the tendency to propose/address scientific phenomena with scientific certainty, in turn causing others to debunk said phenomena in a totalitarian manner.Because of this, I\u0027d like to extend to you all, my favorite community, a public service announcement (I have recently broken up with Imgur because of the hypocrisy and self-righteousness that I hope to never see in my new lover, the KSP forum).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of you suggest or bring up excellent ideas and speculation about complex topics, with minimal research. I understand this, and do this sometimes myself, as it is an effective way to initiate conversation about something you either wish to know more about, or see implemented into the game (or has been already). While initiating conversation with a lack of knowledge due to incomplete research is a minor fiend, this leads to another problem: for others to debunk these ideas in full, while also either with a limited knowledge of the matter, or limited research on the matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that you simply have heard about a phenomenon does not mean that it is always the case. Galaxies and start systems form in BILLIONS of ways, maybe trillions. Please don\u0027t null someone\u0027s idea right from the start because YOU don\u0027t know about something, or whether or not it is feasible in the whole Universe (key concept: the Universe is large as balls). Contrary, simply because you have NOT heard of one phenomenon, does not mean it is wrong or impossible either. That\u0027s like saying CO2, for example, is NEVER a reactive gas, because it\u0027s predominantly inert. Under the right conditions, anything in our universe may be possible WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE HEARD OF IT OR THE CURRENT RESEARCH THINKS/KNOWS IT IS POSSIBLE (or not). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease offer reasonable discussion instead, about why you THINK the idea/phenomenon is improbable, since you are likely not an expert on the topic (if you are... prove it?). Be a little less ambivalent. Like any development in science, and has been the case thousands of times in the past, many previously \u0022impossible\u0022 ideas have proved to be, in fact, the way things are. Some of these things include: the earth being round, the ability for humans to move faster than 50 mph without exploding, and evolution). Be a little bit more amiable in your discussions, because by shutting down someone else\u0027s idea, you are hindering the forward-moving nature of scientific discovery, as well as even the development of the game itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf TL;DR, don\u0027t be a know it all douche. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll never see me personally respond to any topic about space with absolute certainty, just hopeful speculation, but if you want to talk proteins and biochemistry, get at me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHorndog, out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"electronicfox","CreatedById":43373,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T16:47:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly ever so slightly related to this, I find funky coloured hair and those cat-ear things adorable.
