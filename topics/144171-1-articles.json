Note I didnt said \u0022equals\u0022, since this is VERY rough estimate (some data may not be loaded in memory, others may be stored compressed).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nsince KSP load all assets on startup,\u00A0just fire up the game and look what it takes. Again, this is not precise since code may obviously allocate more memory while running.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMy very own slightly moded KSP installation weighs 2.8GB and takes 2.4GB \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, which is close enough to give it credit. So my estimate would be \u0022something under 3G\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that both of these are not established measurement methods, but creative misuse of known and special facts about KSP - that most of its memory are media assets that are pulled on start and remain constant. Most of the time art of memory measurement is not that easy, only way to be sure is to have unburdened system, tune down kernel swappiness, release every memory pressure you can think off (disk caches, DMA buffers, running daemons\u2026), then fire it up and see if it comes through ceiling. Outside of laboratory conditions, I\u0027d say that if you have lots of allocable memory, that is, free pages or pages that can be freed by kernel when needed (disk cache), you are good. (This is more complicated on windows since its kernel like to push pages to swap left and right, but more memory wont help with that anyway.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW all of above assumes that you can actually make use of all your memory (read: have 64bit system) have no memory leaks (no amount of memory will help you there) or mods that alter memory management. Just throwing hardware at unknown, like some other people here would have is, lets say, very kerbal way of doing things :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jarhead1145","CreatedById":31524,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T17:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16Gb of ram is fine, KSP probably would crash from instability if it used close to that amount of ram.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rudi1291","CreatedById":138990,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T17:43:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like KSP can only use a maximum of 16GB anyway due to a Unity problem:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/8422\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/8422\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T18:43:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat!
