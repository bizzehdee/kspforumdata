Landing in Lunar Lander is easier than landing on the Mun in KSP, so it would help newbies to know what to do. Star Plane would probably have some value for helping teach players how flying a plane into space works using a super-arcadified-aerodynamics system. Asteroids would perhaps further help in the aid of learning orbital mechanics in a finer-tuned way, after you\u0027ve learned the basics, and would help flesh out rendezvous skills. Super Kerman Bros would probably have a jetpack level or something to help you learn how to fly Kerbals, or maybe it would really be just pointless fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had this idea several months ago, but it was only when I saw that Take On Mars had a coinop in the Space Program Mode that I decided it might actually work in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR: Several arcade games in the astronaut complex that could actually act as tutorials for new players.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GiantTank","CreatedById":113180,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T12:39:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds like an awesome idea.
