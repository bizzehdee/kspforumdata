So instead, I just said \u0022What are they going to do after landing on Mun and/or Minmus?\u0022 And the answer was \u0022They might start playing around with spaceplanes.\u0022\n\nTier 3: Coinop Asteroids Game\n\n-Would be an asteroids clone except for the fact that this time you\u0027re orbiting a planet instead of a perpetual black space.\n\n-\u0022Training\u0022 for Asteroid Redirect Mission.\n\n-Since it\u0027s training for ARM, perhaps then instead of shooting the asteroids into oblivion, you\u0027re supposed to get the most asteroids into orbit with your fuel reserves. I guess then it would be slower paced...\n\nNow, these wouldn\u0027t actually be pointless throwaway easter eggs that serve no purpose, they could actually be really cool tutorials to help new players learn what they have to do. Landing in Lunar Lander is easier than landing on the Mun in KSP, so it would help newbies to know what to do. Star Plane would probably have some value for helping teach players how flying a plane into space works using a super-arcadified-aerodynamics system. Asteroids would perhaps further help in the aid of learning orbital mechanics in a finer-tuned way, after you\u0027ve learned the basics, and would help flesh out rendezvous skills. Super Kerman Bros would probably have a jetpack level or something to help you learn how to fly Kerbals, or maybe it would really be just pointless fun.\n\nI had this idea several months ago, but it was only when I saw that Take On Mars had a coinop in the Space Program Mode that I decided it might actually work in KSP.\n\n**TL;DR: Several arcade games in the astronaut complex that could actually act as tutorials for new players.**"},{"CreatedByName":"GiantTank","CreatedById":113180,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T12:39:31Z","Content":"That sounds like an awesome idea.

In fact, I registered in the forum just to reply!\n\nIt would help a lot introduce newbies in this very barebone-looking game.\n\nSome more here:\n\n- In authentical Kerbal style, games should look like an absurd mix between cheap coinops and huge military simulators. A paper sign \u0022Simulator room\u0022 should show loosely attached to a previous \u0022Videogames lounge\u0022 one.\n\n- Maybe old or silly graphics / playstyle from old KSP versions could be used. If I can\u0027t remember KSP started 2D, am I wrong?\n\n- As you said they could be an alternative/complement to \u0022official\u0022 tutorials. Asteroid (which I would put in the lowest tier) is excellent to teach how to move (in 2D) a spacecraft.\n\n- They could improve (more difficoult, more realistic, more levels, etc.) with next tiers\n\n- They will cost actual funds (say 1 fund for 10 coins) but you can win some jackpot after beating the final big bad kraken. The jackpot is always visible and is raising constantly with time, because pilots, engineers and scientists are playing in their spare time. Nobody will win the jackpot except the Player. Once the jackpot is won, the coinop is removed and a new (harder) one takes its place.\n\n- You can choose to play them with one selected pilot (or engineer os scientist) to improve his experience (be careful, thou: as we all know, videogames improve stupidity too!). Stats with \u0022videogame - pardon - simulation hours\u0022 would be included in the crew report.\n\n- Hi scores\n\n- The first one should teach you very basic tips to start the simplest rockets (how to thorottle, how to start engine, the most important keys...) or to build them\n\n- yes, phisically semplified \u0022simulations\u0022 of Real KSP life but also...\n\n- phisically respectful version of silly famous games: a low gravity Mario Bros clone, or a docking version of Pipemania, a VAB-based Tetris, or a Pong/Breakout with real ballistic and atmospheric drag, or a no gravity jet-assisted Doom/Wolfenstein3D...\n\nWell, thanks for your awesome idea!"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T03:55:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ... a no gravity jet-assisted Doom/Wolfenstein3D...\n\nYou mean *Descent*? ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nProbably the second best computer game ever."},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T14:11:13Z","Content":"I like this idea.
