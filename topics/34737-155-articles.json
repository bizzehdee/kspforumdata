Of course I had to replace the old version\u0027s parts with the new ones on my crafts. And it turned out the new version is better for huge crafts, like my Jaeger. The hinges and rotratrons seem to have stornger joints, so the attached part is much stiffer. Is it possible to make it even stonger, so that the connection is 100% fixed. In the gif you can see the hinges are not entirely stable, they wobble alot after the movement stops (hyperextending knees) and the joints are not fully stable. Also if the parts would have more power to move, lift, rotate things it would be awesome.

Sometimes there will be a glitch like in the video, sometimes the hinge will not move (the effect is consistent for a given craft). Here is a screenshot with two hinges, one on the Material bay and one on the decoupler. Both have identical orientation and IR settings and are controlled with the same group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/En4zyoJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022En4zyoJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecraft file: \u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BB\u00C2\u00BF\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/k9nkq7thecrph2e/irTest2.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/k9nkq7thecrph2e/irTest2.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T11:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shrx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shrx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnfortunately, the problem with the hinge is still here. It is actually caused by the decoupler. If I place the hinge on the material bay, it works fine. But when it\u0027s on the decoupler weird things happen.
