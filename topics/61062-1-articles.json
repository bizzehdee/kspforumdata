Because, in addition to everything that have already been written on it, we have to do manned missions even before launching a single working probe in order to get enough science points without mentionning working satellite can only be achieved after lot\u0027s of research . I know kerbals look as stupid as lemmings but not that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think IMHO science should be made such a way that we first discover upper atmosphere then space and survivability in it. For example, how kerbal scientists can design a proper shield for manned cockpits if they really ignore how deadly radiations are outside Kerbin atmosphere ? They can obviously put tons of steel outside but... it will be hard to put such weight in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we should first study survivability as well as science itself, materials/living organisms study, probe design, rocket engine design and aero and finally the important energy area. So with that, we should be able to design our first probes which can survive months and years in orbit, studying effect on them in long term by downloading data in a constant basis for example. Then, learn about orbiting stuffes and manoeuvers, launching probe even farer, then start to send kerbals in space, on Mun and other bodies. Leading to get more parts related to advances rocketry, rovers, landers, and so on. To do so, it needs to have something designed smarter than it is acutally (not a fixed amount of points between each step like 45 then 90 then 160, ...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn even more \u0022realistic\u0022 way is to first start with basic aircrafts as its happened in real world, then learned about jet engine then finally rockets. This of course can be an optionnal mode (as no space flights will be allowed initially), but gathering data about flying, efficient design, atmosphere, and some Kerbin\u0027s biome can start the \u0022science engine\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong with this, some proper scenarii and tutorials may be very helpfull for newcomers (better than discover basic things in a wiki).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s quite sad because career is a great idea as it allow to discover parts gradually and be familiar with them, knowing their bests and weaknesses, instead of staying stunned by hundreds of them in spaceport and don\u0027t know how and where to start. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for reading \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T03:35:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a sub-forum for suggestions about game development, which this thread (Presto!) now occupies. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T04:14:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that is a result of the fact that Squad is a game design studio, not an experimental aerospace company.
