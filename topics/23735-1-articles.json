THEY GIFTED ME KSP:D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter lots of time crashing... errrr, I mean, launching stuff in demo I can finally play with the full game! I must admit that I\u0027m pretty bad at launching rockets (that\u0027s why I generally use Mechjeb for taking off and some orbital operations) so basically there are lots of debris on kerbin, mun and mimbus\u0027s orbits. from the 100 (approximately) rockets I launched only 10 landed without any problem and 4 of them landed with a broken engine or a broken leg. Basically, I love this game (I don\u0027t know why because I get easily enraged when I lose in a game, and I keep crashing my rockets) and everything inside of it (especially jebedia, that kerbal is awesome, laughing while the rocket flies without any control)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Holo","CreatedById":39606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T21:52:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan I borrow your friends for a while?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T15:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
