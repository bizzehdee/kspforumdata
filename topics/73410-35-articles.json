I can\u0027t keep up with the number of engines in the system as it is (it\u0027s around 300 at the moment), so most of them are running through the generator. But, I don\u0027t have any templates to run the electric engines through. So, any of the arcjets, resistojets, ion engines, etc, have to be done somewhat by hand. Added to that, I just have no clue what the specs should look like for electric engines. And even further, electric engines generally like to have really long burn times (i.e. days), which KSP doesn\u0027t handle well (if at all).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter saying all that, I\u0027m gonna try and figure this one out, because it\u0027s a bit of a hole in the system.
