A rover that works wonders on Mun might be too light weight for Minmus so it keeps sliding around or it gets airborne after hitting a bump, breaking on landing. That Minmus rover might break down under its own weight elsewhere.\u00A0Consider which wheels you can use on the destination planet/moon. A rover with a mass of 1 ton weights 9.81\u00A0kN on Kerbin but only 0.490 kN on Minmus. If you want a 9.81 kN weight on the rover on Minmus then the rover would need a mass of 20 tons and a weight of more than 196 kN on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to place the command module? If you plan on having only 1 command module on the entire rocket\u002Brover then having the module upright works for the rocket but is less optimal for the rover, where flipping it 90* makes navigation a lot easier. Just remember to test it on Kerbin first to make sure you flipped the module the right way. Or, have 2 modules, one for the rocket and one for the rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T16:50:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUuuh...
