What is the name of the language? Did it exist before, was it invented by Squad, or was it extended from something else?\n2. Does documentation exist? Can you link it?\n3. In what order are statements evaluated?\n4. What are the types? When is a variable visible to the script?\n5. Are there any hidden name dependencies? (E.g. Maybe modules have to start with \u0022Module\u0022?)\n6. What do all the symbols (\\*, ~, #) mean?\n\nI added what I\u0027ve been able to figure out to [the wiki page on configs](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation). Assuming some comprehensive but impossible to find community documentation doesn\u0027t already exist, I\u0027d love it if you could add your answers directly there."},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T03:51:49Z","Content":"1) I do not know where the language used comes from. My best guess is a modified JSON objects list but that is probably wrong.\n\n2) Unfortunately documentation is pretty much non-existant. The best bet is to find a mod that does something similar and check out its code.\n\n3) Statement order: Not sure what you are asking, in the stock game it is simply done from top to bottom, there is only one .cfg per part. (See my note about Module Manager below.)\n\n4) Valid entries in a .cfg file are determined by the associated PartModule in code. Everything that is tagged KSPField will be imported from the .cfg file.\n\n5) None that I am aware of. PartModules starting with module is a naming convention to try and keep things straight for the humans reading it.\n\n6) The symbols are not part of the stock game. They are used by the mod ModuleManager to allow mod makers to edit part .cfg files without having to overwrite the file. For further info on this I\u0027ll have to direct you to the ModuleManager thread.\n\nI see you\u0027ve edited the wiki page to add the symbols in without making any note that ModuleManager is required for those to work, I\u0027d recommend removing those as I believe the intent of that page is to be stock-game compatible (so without ModuleManager installed.)\n\nD."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T04:44:21Z","Content":"Mike (Mu) created it for .20, IIRC. It doesn\u0027t have a name other than ConfigNode (the name of the object).\n\nI think you\u0027re confusing confignodes with what Module Manager does to them. ConfigNodes are just a way of parsing text: it\u0027s a simple tree composed of nodes and values.\n\nValues are\n\nname = value\n\nNodes are\n\nnode\n\n{\n\nstuff\n\n}\n\nwhere stuff can be values and/or nodes (or nothing at all).\n\nname, value, and node are all any-old-string. node names can\u0027t have spaces in them, but value names (and value values) can.\n\n// is a comment.\n\nThat\u0027s it."}]}
