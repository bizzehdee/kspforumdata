So I\u0027m taking the time from work to write this.\u003Cp\u003EHave been following the devnotes for the last 12 months and I\u0027m looking forward to this 1.1 update with Unity5. Have been playing KSP since 0.23. Just wanted to congratulate the entire KSP team, specially the developers and founders of this project. KSP made me understand a great deal of how astrophysics works in real life. Anyways, had a question about the 1.1 update that I may have missed on previous DevNotes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Are the developers noticing a highly noticable performace boost while unit testing KSP with Unity5? I ask this beacuse one of the reasons I stopped playiing since 1.0.3 was beacause my stations were getting to big and had multiple docked ships. This caused a huge performance slowdown while playing in the Windows and Linux versions. I know the slowdown could still happen when 1.1 is out, but at least it won\u0027t be like the 0.24 or 1.0.3 versions and can get back to visiting the entire system \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S: I hear one of the devs or memebers of Squad is/are from Mexico, if I\u0027m right make sure they/he/she/it gets the following message: \u0022A seguir jalando con huevos, VIVA MEXICO CAB... y saludos de Monterrey, NL, MX\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my investigation of the real world benefits that U5 will bring I would expect at least a 20% boost but not more than 30% although this will benefit larger craft (meaning more parts) more than smaller craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso what to do with eggs?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Errol\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Errol\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen/where can we can some details on the new comms mechanics?
