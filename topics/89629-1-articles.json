The 16 boards on the sides would then produce lift and either stabilize or amplify the yaw, depending what side of the center of mass they\u0027re on.

I figured the two side rows won\u0027t add any lift, and since one side each for the top and bottom row would have access to airflow, they would cancel and act as a single wing (high pressure underneath the part, low pressure above). So 16 doesn\u0027t feel cheaty to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m gonna mark this as Answered, but I\u0027d really love to see more engineering data for these kinds of parts. It\u0027s really hard building spaceplanes...which have had their importance increased dramatically since Funds! were introduced...without knowing the actual aerodynamic information. I\u0027m seeing lots of people putting in wing connectors that don\u0027t add any lift, or doing things to the lift vector that doesn\u0027t make sense.

In the SPH, the lift vector is calculated with airflow coming at you. Click the root part (usually the cockpit) and rotate the plane using shift-wasd.
