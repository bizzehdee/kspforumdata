I\u00A0know how to change symmetry mode with R and all that but its still really wonky.\u00A0Example:\u00A0I\u00A0tried using breaking grounds mechanical parts and wanted to make a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E with flip up wings but no matter what symmetry mode i used the motors would always rotate in opposite directions on either side. the same with structual parts. wings work with no problem but when i use a structual part wich is\u00A0 shaped like a triangle (so kinda shaped like a wing) it points two different ways??? Ive played ksp for quite some time now but have\u00A0never had problems like this. And now all i can do is just dont use symmetry when that happens and just place things really carefully. And one time i watched a matt lowe video where he placed the breaking grounds mechanical parts normally and they worked just fine???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelp\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthank you\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-29T18:12:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are confusing symmetry settings. Mirror and radial, but also oriented around part or craft. And if you place a part in one of these and then try to attach something to that in a different mode, it switches itself back to the mode of the parent part.
