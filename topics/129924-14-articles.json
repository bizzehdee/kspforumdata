Is a Star with a noticeable Cyan color. Much more energetic and hot than our home Star. With a diameter of three times Kerbol, is not that big, is just that Kerbol is by definition a Brown Dwarf Star. Vendela is an intermediate A-F type in the HR-Diagram, class I Orion subtype. With a surface temperature of 13.000k. By real life standards, is as big as our sun but 60 times less massive. Since Vendela is so big and brillant in comparison to Kerbin, solar panels and solar salis excels as propulsion method here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/f3w8w5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f3w8w5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVendela presents somewhat unique challenges. Upon arrival to Vendela, the first planet closest to it is Orgol, who is quite far away from it, orbiting a distance similar to Dres (36.000.000kms).

Adding more and more planets to the System can lower the value of the indivual bodies in Kerbol. I tend to like more the idea of somewhat little Solar Systems, with a variety of features each. In fact, I would already save GP2 for other Star Sytem, while tweaking what is already present here. Since Kerbin and his moons serves as a tutorials. Then is fair to think the entire Kerbol System as a tutorial also for other Stars Exploration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere you would find somewhat unexpected stuff. If you put almost eveything in Kerbol System, there\u0027s little incentive to travel all the way there just to see another bunch of spheres. :/ BUT a ringed Gas Giant that it cannot be found in Kerbol... well that\u0027s something else!. I suppose the main reason to travel further and further, is because in some other planets there\u0027s exotique materials that need to be collected, or the placement offers unique chances to discover new Solar Systems, make science that cannot be made anywhere. etc. Idk you guys, but is pretty apparent to me that more planets is not equal to make KSP better. Adding variety and a buch of stuff to do and discover, forcing you to move here and there is the main factor that drives KSP (Imho at least).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-28T14:55:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2013 02:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Iron4venger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Locopoop","CreatedById":80051,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T04:34:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis should be the top priority now that career mode is (partially) implemented.
