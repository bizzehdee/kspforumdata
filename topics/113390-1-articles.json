I was so used to it in Orbiter (an open source space simulator) that I sorely missed it. So much so that I jumped into coding (again) to make it happen.\n\nMy effects are based on my perception that Jeb wouldn\u0027t dock so much as \u0022participate in a controlled collision\u0022\n\n## \nInstallation\n\n**Be sure to have the latest version of [ModuleManger](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-110-module-manager-2622-april-19th-with-even-more-sha-and-less-bug/) installed!**\n\nUpzip it into your GameData folder, as with most other mods.\n\n## \nAPI Reference\n\nUsing a ModuleManager config, like below, you can specify your own sounds for any docking port in the game.\n\n    @PART[someDockingPort]:NEEDS[FP_DPSoundFX]\n    {\n        MODULE\n        {\n            name = DPSoundFX\n            sound_docking = CustomExample/crash\n            sound_undocking = CustomExample/radio\n            internalSoundsOnly = false      \n        }\n    }\n\n## \nHow-To-Use\n\nJust listen, when docking or un-docking of course!! (Now also when decoupling!)\n\nContributors\n\nGuru\u0027s who answered my questions:\n\n- Snjo\n- CrzyRndm\n\nAuthors whose plugins were studied for clues and code:\n\n- Pizzaoverhead\n\n## \nLicense\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V3 dated 6/29/2007\n\n**Download / Source**\n\n- **[Download](https://github.com/TedThompson/Docking-Sounds/releases) - GitHub**\n- **[Download](https://spacedock.info/mod/474/Docking%20Port%20Sound%20FX) - SpaceDock (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E enabled)**\n- [Source](https://github.com/TedThompson/Docking-Sounds)\n- Alternate Sounds\n    - ~~[Docking \u0026 Undocking](https://www.dropbox.com/s/caajo3nv306amf2/dock%20and%20undock.rar?dl=0) - by [Dashman](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/76878-dashman/) (RAR archive)~~ ^*[Link Reported Broken: 8/22/21]*^\n    - [Docking \u0026 Undocking](https://www.dropbox.com/s/txvp8i3jfpnt2i0/dockingsounds_akron.zip?dl=0) - by [akron](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/116554-akron/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-30T23:22:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2023 11:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by tg626**\n  \nMinor feature update"},{"CreatedByName":"Toyotawolf","CreatedById":75259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T03:50:39Z","Content":"lol again one of those why isnt that stock"},{"CreatedByName":"skykooler","CreatedById":60459,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T04:16:52Z","Content":"I didn\u0027t realize how much I needed this."},{"CreatedByName":"BlackHat","CreatedById":138278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T05:34:56Z","Content":"Loved it also....
