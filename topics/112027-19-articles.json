This focuses singularly on making the radiators play nicely with the 1.04 heat system (uses stock modules, balanced to stock costs) and is relatively trivial to implement. The only \u0022difficult\u0022 thing is quantifying a performance metric to allow people to compare between radiators, particularly between stock HRS parts and HC radiators. This is essential to maintaining usefulness with NFE reactors. It\u0027s not really difficult, just time consuming.\n\u003E \n\u003E The ancillary parts such as heat pipes and heat exchangers will still exist here. They function just fine, just aren\u0027t super useful.\n\u003E \n\u003E **Heavyweight:** not installed by default, but essentially restores 1.02 heat system behaviour. This means that instead of moving HC radiators to stock, this MM plugin will move stock radiators to HC, making changes instead to them.\n\u003E \n\u003E Balance should work out - because HC radiators can get really hot, moving your save to Light from Heavy will just mean you\u0027ll have too many radiators.\n\nGreat!\n\nWould this mean that radiators directly pull heat from the part they are attached to, like they did in 1.02? That might be a save-breaker, but IMO that\u0027s just fine.\n\nI quickly learned to like the idea in 1.02 that I could separately manage my engine heat and my reactor heat. In 1.04 I find that what happens is that the radiators pull heat from the reactor until you run the engines for a while. Once the engine temperature gets higher than the reactor temperature, the radiators switch to pulling the heat from the engines. Then the reactor temperatures climb, until eventually the reactors get too hot and start losing efficiency.\n\nWith a 1.02-type system, we could keep the reactors at their most efficient temperatures and let the engines get hotter than the reactors.\n\nThe reactor descriptions used to say how many KW of radiator heat rejection was necessary. It would be good if that came back, but also if your engine descriptions also gave some information on how many KW of heat is produced. This might be a little tricky, though, because they all work a little differently."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T00:53:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Great!\n\u003E Would this mean that radiators directly pull heat from the part they are attached to, like they did in 1.02?
