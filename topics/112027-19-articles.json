It\u0027s basically a Mondo 3.75m hydrogen tank in the middle with two FLAT reactors on the back and a command pod on front. Radially, I have two 2.5m hydrogen tanks, with struts and fuel pipes. There is a VASMIR 4-nozzle engine stuck onto the end of each of the side tanks. For heat control, I have 6 of the huge stock radiators. I\u0027m making a 1.5 hour burn to go from Moho orbit to Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u0027s happening with the heat? Well the radiators are overkill for just the reactors. The reactors are running at full power and have heated up to 720K. But the engines are each putting out a flux of 3700, and most of that heat is going into the side fuel tanks. The heat is then flowing into the center fuel tank, and from there the pod. None of it is going to the radiators, because they are all pulling from the hottest parts (the reactors). So the whole ship is starting to heat to a nice glow, and it\u0027s clear that nothing will happen to fix this until the engines get to be as hot as the reactors. But since they have great heat sinks attached to them, that means all the tanks will get as hot as the reactors too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat will eventually happen is that pretty much the whole ship will eventually get saturated in heat until it is 700K\u002B in temperature. Only then will the radiators start taking heat away from the engines instead of the reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the heat control mod, I could set up dedicated radiators for the reactors, dedicated radiators for the engines, and insulated protection for the rest of the ship.

It\u0027s basically a Mondo 3.75m hydrogen tank in the middle with two FLAT reactors on the back and a command pod on front. Radially, I have two 2.5m hydrogen tanks, with struts and fuel pipes. There is a VASMIR 4-nozzle engine stuck onto the end of each of the side tanks. For heat control, I have 6 of the huge stock radiators. I\u0027m making a 1.5 hour burn to go from Moho orbit to Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u0027s happening with the heat? Well the radiators are overkill for just the reactors. The reactors are running at full power and have heated up to 720K. But the engines are each putting out a flux of 3700, and most of that heat is going into the side fuel tanks. The heat is then flowing into the center fuel tank, and from there the pod. None of it is going to the radiators, because they are all pulling from the hottest parts (the reactors). So the whole ship is starting to heat to a nice glow, and it\u0027s clear that nothing will happen to fix this until the engines get to be as hot as the reactors. But since they have great heat sinks attached to them, that means all the tanks will get as hot as the reactors too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat will eventually happen is that pretty much the whole ship will eventually get saturated in heat until it is 700K\u002B in temperature.
