But, to be honest, an additional keyboard doesn\u0027t hurt, for action groups and such. But again, to be fair, I\u0027ve seldom used more than 4 action groups, and those could for instance be bound to the d-pad. I\u0027m using the Wiimote Classic controller, but I\u0027ve also tried to play with a DS4 and the game plays excellent with both. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFor building craft, there\u0027s a very well working touchpad on the DS4. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe CPU power of the PS4 isn\u0027t that bad. Each single bulldozer module may be slow due to the low clock rate (1.6 GHz base clock, but under load it clocks to a higher frequency, which we actually can only guess, as Sony afaik never revealed the maximum turbo core clock rate - speculations are it\u0027s 2.75 GHz), but it has 4 of them (or 8 cores, if you prefer AMD marketspeech). I\u0027m absolutely certain, that SQUAD wouldn\u0027t think about a PS4 port, if they wouldn\u0027t already have multithreaded physics up their sleeve. What this means is obvious: An \u003Cstrong\u003Eincredible\u003C/strong\u003E performance boost on the PC! And also, very likely acceptable performance on the PS4, probably comparable to what you get on \u0022high end\u0022 AMD hardware on the PC right now (depends on how well the calculations scale with number of threads, but Newtonian physics usually scales very well). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf one doesn\u0027t like DS4, one can always plug a keyboard and a mouse. You know, the USB ports on the PS4 aren\u0027t decoration. The only thing needed to get mouse\u002Bkeyboard working is support in the game, and I would be very negatively surprised if the standard input on PC would be disabled on the console for no reason. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Nevertheless, I do have two negative points: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMods. I feel kind of sorry for people going to play KSP on the PS4, as they will, if at all, only have a very limited number of mods available, and I guess all of those mods will have to go through an inspection by Sony before they can be released. Probably not many mod authors will want to waste their time with this process. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFonts. The UI is currently optimized for sitting close to the screen. There are several threads here where people complain that text in KSP is hard to read when playing on a TV screen. I\u0027m curious how the port will display stuff, as there is significantly less space on the screen available when a bigger font size is used. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For us PC users I think not much will change, apart from performance improvements. For instance I don\u0027t see how adding additional keybindings for a DS4 would negatively impact our keyboard bindings. Also, I don\u0027t expect the UI on the PC version to change, at best those of us who play on TV will get an additional option for a bigger UI (if code of the company doing the PS4 port flows back upstream...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: There\u0027s another thing that troubles me more: I don\u0027t think that the fraction of console users interested in a game like KSP is as large as the fraction of PC users. Is there a market for it?!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: Regarding the company contracted for the port: They will likely \u0022just\u0022 have to adjust UI and input.
