I can make a 6 syemetry asparagus that will fly with FAR, probably the most realistic model we can hope to get in the game for some time. you just have to make things taller and not flatter. The only reason alot of designs end up being pancakes is because we are not punished for it and sometimes it was needed due to lack of engines powerful enough to lift a huge payload. SLS didnt kill asparagus like some thought, it just reduced the number of parts and stages we needed to lift a payload, allowing for bigger payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESLS came about for several reasons. One, it was tied to the nasa pack and the asteroid redirect. Two, if we were going to redirect the larger asteroids we needed the ability to launch huge payloads and the smaller rockets were just not up to the task short of huge pancake monstrosities with thousands of parts. Three, people just wanted the larger parts and were turning to mods to get them. It was just silly haveing to strap togeather dozens of engiens just to get enough thrust to lift off so they made us bigger parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T09:16:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill...need...MOAR BOOSTERS!!!!!!!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KingPhantom","CreatedById":110881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T09:20:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECaptain?
