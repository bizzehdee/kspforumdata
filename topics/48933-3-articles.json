I will admit, \u0022a few flights\u0022 may be simplistic, but I was referring to gathering those points in sandbox mode. Since everything is unlocked in sandbox, how many flights do you think it would take to perform much of the science?

They\u0027ve been listening to the community clamor for a career mode for quite a while. So they take the time and put in the work to give us what we ask for, and along the way they choose not to implement a part for sandbox that basically makes much of their career work mute.

I feel like rather than experiments saying that they\u0027re pointless when you do them, I would prefer if they kept the experiment text in Sandbox mode, for example \u0022The goo feels right at home here\u0022, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for actual Science points in Sandbox mode, I don\u0027t really see the need for myself, but that\u0027s just me.
