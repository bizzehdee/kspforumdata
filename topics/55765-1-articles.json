One tank gets emptied of its fuel before the other causing craft imbalance. I\u0027m not at my comp, so I can\u0027t remember but only one of those engines is the culprit, the other engine balance fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHypothesis:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently symetrical fuel lines from the rocket tanks are not flowing symetrically, and instead only flow from one rocket tank. Also the one rocket fuel tank that does empty is not getting replenished from the Jet Fuel Tank via its connected fuel line. It\u0027s as if the affected jet engine only will pull in from one rocket tank, and the fuel line from the Jet Fuel Tank is not flowing to the emptying Rocket Fuel Tank. Is this working as designed? Anyone else run into this? I\u0027ve rebuilt my craft from scratch several times and each time it does this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-11T18:58:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2013 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by inigma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T01:03:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI also have the flow in reverse with symetrical fuel lines from the Rocket Fuel tanks back to the Jet Fuel tank. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a loop anywhere in your fuel flow, weird things will happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MircoMars","CreatedById":61811,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T01:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou can only feed in one direction. to avoid burnouts, connect a fuelline from your last full tank directly to the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T02:30:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not certain, but I believe that alternate paths in the middle of the fuel flow can be a problem (and loops to be avoided completely, as already mentioned above).

I know from experience that 2-into-1-into-2 works ok, at least in some cases, but more complex can be problematic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best advice I can offer is to try to keep fuel lines to an absolute minimum, if possible, and as simple as possible. Do a manual fuel transfer once you reach orbit, if there\u0027s a weight balance problem for descent. There are also some good fuel management mods out there, to make life more pleasant when pumping fuel around for balance \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC TAC Fuel Balancer is the one I\u0027d recommend.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtremespino","CreatedById":63473,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T08:26:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have had this problem before, I just re-placed the fuel lines until it worked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T08:31:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had symmetrical fuel loops work and fail.
