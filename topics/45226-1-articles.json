I then struck upon an Idea whilst watching one of the old re-entry demos on YouTube that I would like to share. Unfortunately, I have very limited experience when it comes to game development and modelling, so this is as much of a question as it is a suggestion, asking the more experienced among the community \u0022would this even work\u0022, as well as \u0022is it a good idea?\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than rendering more particles to simulate parts breaking up, or simply applying a charred effect, I wondered if the parts mesh could have a transparent \u0022disintegrating\u0022 effect applied to the sides being heated, along with a charring effect around the edges. This effect would be animated and slowly grow and eventually cover the part at which point it would become invisible and be deleted. The joints between parts would also break and fall off. I sketched up this diagram to visualise the concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4RWSr5H.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224RWSr5H.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing my nooby logic, I guess this would be easier to render as it would not involve the creation of new entities, only the modification of meshes belonging to the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love feedback on the idea, and maybe improvement suggestions (Provided the idea would even work, of course)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B I know re-entry damage is listed under the \u0022what not to suggest\u0022 thread, but I assume that means don\u0027t suggest it as a feature, rather than don\u0027t suggest ways of implementing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T21:17:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERealtime mesh manipulation is possible, but it would have to be done on the CPU because KSP is built for DX9 (which doesn\u0027t support geometry shaders).
