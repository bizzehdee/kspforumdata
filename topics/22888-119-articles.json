Second what was the purpose of the M-1 engine then?I mean if its a matter of adapter plates, and decouplers then I am now really excited for the Mercury IVA. I just wanted to make a real NOVA. Now that its possible I am less disappointed. For some reason i though that Three M-1s were on the second stage.
