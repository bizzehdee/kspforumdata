So far I listed about 80 different Biomes/Places to Visit in the Kerbal system (rows in the spreadsheet), 11 different ways of getting science points (columns in the spreadsheet). Ofcourse not all experiments are possible everywhere. Biomes have different Scientific Value (1x for Kerbin, 4x for Mun, 5x for Minmus, 8x for others) and experiments have different Data Gathered values (from 5 Crew report to 50 for Seismic scan). In total about 60.000 science points could be found i think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T20:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EatVacuum\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EatVacuum\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere is a good start - an addon that shows you what experiments you have done, how much science you have earned, and how much remains that you can earn by repeating the experiment...\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/rdoverview/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/rdoverview/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does not show you every experiment possible, only the ones you have done.
