It\u0027s like Mr. Baxter set out to tickle the hindbrain of Kerbal Space Program players with this novel; it\u0027s got loads of (very realistic) orbital mechanics, exploding rockets, detailed descriptions of rocket engineering, orbital assembly, NERVA engines, and an interplanetary voyage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe premise of the novel is this: Baxter imagines an alternate history, where NASA had just enough political support and acumen to push its late-60\u0027s Mars plans into actuality. The result is an interplanetary voyage to Mars that launches in March of 1985 using, basically, upgraded Apollo technology. He cuts back and forth between the Mars crew on their trip and the decade-and-a-half of planning leading up to it. The book is meticulously researched and very believable: a diamond-hard sci-fi with now-tech instead of future-tech. I thought a couple of things were particularly well done: it\u0027s clear from Baxter\u0027s postscript to the novel that he thinks the abandonment of the Mars project was a tragedy, but the novel itself is careful to show what trade-offs were made in the alternate history to make Mars happen. Solar system uncrewed exploration, near-Earth science, etc, all subordinated to the goals of the Mars mission. There is also a very poignant passage in the novel, where the Mars crew reveals the call-signs they\u0027ve chosen for the various independent components of their spacecraft; it brought tears to my eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if you haven\u0027t read \u003Cem\u003EVoyage\u003C/em\u003E, you should be heading out to your local library at this moment to check it out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-08T19:37:23Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2013 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sid","CreatedById":72855,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T15:35:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for that, I\u0027m definitely ready for some fiction having just finished Boris Cherkovs four volume history of the Soviet missile and space program...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tom1499","CreatedById":38308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T16:57:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout 25% through the book!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sid","CreatedById":72855,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T14:12:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENearly finished it already.
