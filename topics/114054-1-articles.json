These just direct airflow into the axial compressor at the proper angle/speed. The compressor is the part that actually spins.\n\nFor instance, the [Rolls-Royce Olympus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Olympus).\n\nMost turbofans have the fan in front. This design is more fuel-efficient than a turbojet, and is found on most modern airliners.\n\nThat being said, I have no idea about the part in question in KSP. ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T22:28:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 10:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DanJourney**"},{"CreatedByName":"SergeantBlueforce","CreatedById":73432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:24:31Z","Content":"I did wonder why the intake didn\u0027t have a fan, despite the description referencing to one; It\u0027s nice to see it has been added now though."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:25:29Z","Content":"It was updated in 1.0.3, along with the shock intake.
