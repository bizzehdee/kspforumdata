It\u0027s taken me a while to learn the necessary tricks and to gather the tools I needed to be able to fly an aircraft into space consistently, but I\u0027ve gotten to the point where I can do it consistently and have designs with specific purposes - such as lifting a full orange tank to orbit, delivering a Mun lander to orbit and bringing it back down to the runway, and delivering a space station crew to their post - around Mun. Now, from the beginning I\u0027ve been flying with the game\u0027s stock aerodynamic model, which everyone (including the developers) thinks is pretty heavily flawed and which is scheduled to be heavily overhauled with the coming KSP version 1.0. Given that the replacement system will handle closer to the way FAR handles things, I\u0027ve been considering making the switch from stock to FAR for the past couple of weeks. To that end, I built a challenge where I asked folks to lift the same Mun lander I did to LKO and bring it back down again using FAR (or NEAR), with the idea of learning a thing or two from the entrants. No one has entered, so at this point I thought I\u0027d take a slightly more direct approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I\u0027m looking for information on how to design a craft and fly it to orbit using FAR - that goes for both spaceplane and rockets. What I\u0027m really looking for is an answer to this question - \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eis it worth making the switch\u003C/span\u003E? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my specific questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Cstrong\u003ESPACEPLANE DESIGN\u003C/strong\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I design a spaceplane, I first and foremost use the principles listed in Keptin\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBasic Aircraft Design Explained - Simply with Pictures\u003C/a\u003E guide. I\u0027m assuming those principles will be all the more important with the FAR aerodynamic model. I also have been adhering to DocMoriarty\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/223333-ksp-space-plane-construction-and-operation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Space Plane Construction and Operation\u003C/a\u003E Guide for general figures on how to build craft (especially Chapter 2.4, \u0022Numbers You Should Know Before Construction\u0022). Those figures go like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A maximum takeoff mass of 10 tonnes for Basic Jet Engines (and these for aircraft and VTOLs only), 13 tonnes for RAPIERs and 15 tonnes for Turbojets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Approximately 2.3 tonnes of mass per delta wing; I myself use the easier-to-remember 1:1 ratio of mass-to-summed lift coefficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-1.5kN of SAS per tonne of takeoff mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-39 units of Liquid Fuel per tonne of maximum take-off mass (I use 40), and 23-24 tonnes for Oxidizer per tonne of take-off mass (I use 25).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe has other guidelines for number of rudders, number of ailerons and number of elevators/canards, which I do follow but don\u0027t really feel like discussing here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo these same guidlines still apply in FAR? The big one for me (and the one that may kill any notion of a switchover) is that I\u0027ve heard Turbojets are seriously nerfed in FAR itself. I have no intention of installing an aircraft parts mod (such as B9) at this time - I have a slow box and a fair number of mods as it is - and the Turbojet is what I generally use to get to space these days. How badly has it been nerfed? What is its maximum takeoff mass in FAR? Has the RAPIER been similarly nerfed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Cstrong\u003ESPACEPLANE FLIGHT\u003C/strong\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, my typical launch profile for a plane in the soup goes like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Above 45 degrees through the first ten kilometers of atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* 40 degrees from 10-15k\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* 30 degrees from 15-20k\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* 20 degrees from 20-30k\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* 10 degrees from 30k through switchover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s in general. I try to keep the rate of ascent about 100 m/s or as close to that as I can manage through the ascent, and will adjust my nose angle as needed. I\u0027m assuming in FAR that this is not how I want to do things, that I\u0027m going to want to keep the AoA closer to 23 degrees throughout the flight. Does that sound right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming that landing on the runway will still be the same; deorbit so that your periapsis is 44k over KSC and take it on in the rest of the way once you\u0027re subsonic. I\u0027ve heard that in FAR, you need to do a series of turns to bleed off speed. I\u0027m curious if there\u0027s a way to set up an \u0022airbrake\u0022 in FAR as well.

The basic jet won\u0027t get you supersonic, the other one is probably about half it\u0027s power and runs out at around 1300m/s. There are strong reasons for this though, given how the rest of FAR works. Rapiers are still suitable engines for spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the guidelines, forget it. For sanity\u0027s sake you want a minimum jet TWR of about 0.3 but that\u0027s pretty flexible - if you have a really slick low-drag design you can go lower. There\u0027s no real guidelines about control surfaces because that\u0027s also dependent on your design - fortunately FAR gives you a couple of tools you can check your craft with, you don\u0027t even have to understand them too well, just enough to either know \u0022red is bad\u0022 for the static tab, or what shapes are bad for the graphs. Wing area - well, divide the total area by the craft mass and you\u0027ll get the wing loading, higher means higher takeoff/landing speed but compensates by being lower drag ( relatively ) because you have less wing for the overall size of the craft. Countering that, you\u0027ll need to fly higher AoA angles which will increase drag again. So you can see there\u0027s no simple rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally if I was to try and analyse how I think I\u0027ve got enough wing - I look at the top of the plane, imagine it has straight wings who\u0027s span is about that of the fuselage, imagine their chord length is about 1/4-1/3 span and then start morphing that area into a suitable wing shape depending on the craft.

Deorbiting I start about half an orbit back, put peri about 15km over the landing site, and generally just stay flat, making sure I don\u0027t go over 40k Q ( dynamic pressure ). You don\u0027t need to bleed speed doing aerobatics if your descent profile is nice and gentle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpoilers are just aerodynamic braking devices. Flaps also slow you down, but they also provide more lift at lower speeds - they\u0027re giving part of the wing a higher angle of attack.

If your COP is above your COM, you need to be a little cautious with your gravity turn, go to far and you will go unstable. This is where people get turned off with FAR. A gentle turn will ease you right into orbit. Or you can do what I do, slap a couple lifting surfaces at the base of your center stack. You just need it to get you through the lower atmosphere. 30,000 meters up, it\u0027s not so much of a big deal.

Only the basic jet is not good for spaceplanes, Turbo Jets work just fine. They are nerfed but if you are ascending properly, that is ok. The nerf is there because FAR\u0027s aerodynamic reduces drag based on design and they become too powerful as a result (your plane gets ripped to shreds). The only downside to TurboJets is you need separate rockets, but in many cases you can build nothing more than an OMS out of O-10\u0027s to get you that final distance, unless it\u0027s just a really big plane or you are planning on going somewhere other than orbit.

A plane with 2 turbojets and 4 intakes with all the intakes on only 1 engine won\u0027t get you higher than about 25km-30km before needing to switch to rockets.

I generally design full \u0022integrated engine units\u0022 by starting with an Engine Nacelle set along the craft\u0027s centerline.
