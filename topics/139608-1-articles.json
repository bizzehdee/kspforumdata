Kerbin, and only 10% as powerful at Dres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom Jool to Eeloo, you need a Gigantor just to keep a probe core alive and use a bit of SAS now and again. \u00A0And beyond Eeloo (like if you\u0027re using OPM), solar panels are nothing but dead weight. \u00A0RTGs are by far the better option for simple domestic consumption even at Jool. \u00A0And to do anything else, you need considerably more power. \u00A0If you\u0027ve got a 1-way science probe that need to transmit boatlloads of data, you either need a huge battery (that solar and RTGs will take days to recharge) for the transmissions, or you need a fuel cell you turn on only when transmitting. \u00A0For anything having a long-term and high EC consumption (life support, Kerbalism, drililng, and refining), you need a nuclear reactor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that I didn\u0027t mention rovers above. \u00A0Even at Kerbin, solar panels are insufficient to keep crewed rovers moving
