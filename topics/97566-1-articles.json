If no engine has been activated than RCS responds to throttle control, firing in the heading direction and with throttle controllable thrust. I also can\u0027t disable any RCS ports. In the VAB it says they are disabled but they still work when launched and once the ship is launched there isn\u0027t even a button on the right click menu. This is true for all the RCS thrusters I have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a very heavy modded install but I can\u0027t find anything that would mess with RCS like this. The only RCS related mods I have other than parts are tweakable everything and rcsbuildaid. After some searching I found ModuleRCSFX on the forums and it seems to have the throttle functionality but I don\u0027t have it installed. Is it possible another mod implemented it and is causing the issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: After doing a search for \u0022RCS\u0022 in all the config files I found out that MechJeb is responsible for the throttle behaviour. Since I don\u0027t actually use MJ I uninstalled it. But the problem of disabling RCS jets is still there. I should add that I can disable them using action groups (Is there no toggle option? It is either enable or disable for all of mine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: The remaining problem seems to be an issue with tweakable everything. There is a .dll on page 44 of the mod thread that semi solves the issue. Guess I should have done a bit more searching before posting, hopefully this can help others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-23T21:15:21Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2015 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mreadshaw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
