I am totally hooked and must have played over 400 hours so far. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my last play through, I made a huge ship in orbit that totalled over 600 parts. I have pretty good PC but this was too much and the FPS took a huge hit. Looking online, I found that I should limit the number of parts since the game is not designed to handle this much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, how many parts should I limit myself too? I want to know a rough estimate so I can plan station and bases accordingly and make sure the FPS stays good even with other ships/modules attached. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile on the subject, do docking port assembly make a difference?

Computer specs vary, as does people\u0027s tolerance of lower framerates. My best advice would be to play with a few different part count vessels (outside the atmosphere) to get an idea of what your personal limit is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your second question: There is no difference between a ship assembled in orbit and the same ship launched in a single launch. However, the single launch method lets you eliminate the docking ports (saves a few parts) and use struts to make things more rigid (less frustration).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T18:21:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E200 parts is, IMO, a good limit for a single craft, but that largely depends on the computer you\u0027re playing on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of my Realism Overhaul ships come in at under or around 100 parts. This is due in large part to procedurals, which mean I can have a 30m x 50m main tank (if needed) without part spam. In fact, I can spend more parts on better looking rockets and craft because my lifters aren\u0027t sucking up the part count.
