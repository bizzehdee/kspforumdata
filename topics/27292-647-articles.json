Version Dua isn\u0027t exactly a true SSTO since it utilizes a couple drop tanks and engines, but for LKO work it certainly fits the bill compared to the cost of building disposable boosters. I neglected to take screenshots during the testing flights. Then I timewarped to the Eve launch window, periodically stopping to transmit science from my Ike based lab. Upon arrival of the launch window, the Gilly mission took leave of its 300km parking orbit and waved bye-bye to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/career/Gilly%20Mission/Screen-Shot-2015-06-11-at-7.44.06-PM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen-Shot-2015-06-11-at-7.44.06-PM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/career/Gilly%20Mission/Screen-Shot-2015-06-11-at-8.13.05-PM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen-Shot-2015-06-11-at-8.13.05-PM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enkiel","CreatedById":145063,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T15:07:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFixed my issue with Drill on my Mun base (for the record, no matter how long they are, keep them close to ground if possible)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s not pretty, its not light, but it filled all requirement (and yes, that is a big orange tank, without any way to detach it from the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k189/ankhiel/Kerbal/2015-06-12_zpse9p1erf0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222015-06-12_zpse9p1erf0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T15:27:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilt a Mammoth-based Asparagus launch stage.

However... the rescuee\u0027s orbit was in the opposite direction to MunRod, and I knew this didn\u0027t have enough to do that job.

The plan is to be just about suborbital when entering Minmus SoI, then adjust periapse so that getting orbit will lead to docking with the Minmus Lander in reasonably short order. Shortly after her departure burns, the new rescue ship encountered the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/q9Y74l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q9Y74l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/BT7TcH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BT7TcH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted this one to pick up Jebford and take some thermal readings at Mun, before heading directly home. Jebford happened to be in a Mobile Lab, so I may look into researching the grabber to avoid having to put one up myself just yet. Perhaps I\u0027ll send it to Minmus orbit, that shouldn\u0027t be too bad. As for the thermal readings, they were all quite low down and close-ish to the south pole, and two of them were landed in the highlands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/F4Xdgs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F4Xdgs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/y93Cjo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022y93Cjo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebford also got what science he could, and planted a flag for a contract at the second landing site. The first time I attempted to do this, the lander fell over and I couldn\u0027t get it back up. So, I quickloaded... all the way back to before Tamrie\u0027s departure. So, of course, I redid it, making sure to quicksave more regularly and also to touch down softly, then wrestle to stay upright. Unfortunately, I ran out of fuel after picking up the final reading in space and making a shot at escaping. This looks a bit far for a get-out-and-push to be worth the bother... so I guess its another rescue mission for Jebford.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T17:34:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nyY4ItE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nyY4ItE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DJlZANP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DJlZANP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EMIsoIO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EMIsoIO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking on escorting columbia\u0027s jumbo jets with two of my f22s.
