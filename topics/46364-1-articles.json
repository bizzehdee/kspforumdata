On numerous occasions, I end up making the desired node to get me wherever I\u0027m trying to go, but then something catastrophic happens (like a nuclear engine breaking off due to the buggy fairings) and I\u0027m forced to quickload and lose the node(s) that took me a good chunk of time to perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask that when you quicksave, if you have any nodes at the time, they should be saved along with everything else, and loaded along with everything else.
