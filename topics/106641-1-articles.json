Where are the \u0022Temp Gauges\u0022 they mention in the change log? I can\u0027t find any parameter that changes in the debug page when pressing F10 and see no change on-screen. I even went so far as to check the thermometer part for a display, based on myself being an idiot at times.

No colour change? No significant temperature change. But I could be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, and this answer I\u0027m definite on, you have to upgrade the runway itself. Just like you have to upgrade the launchpad, you\u0027re gonna have to right-click on the runway itself, upgrade it, and that\u0027ll...mostly smooth it out. It\u0027ll be totally smooth by the third and final upgrade, but it\u0027s 90% of the way there with the first upgrade (to tier two).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore verbose answers than Crown\u0027s.
