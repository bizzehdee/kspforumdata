I have pretty much put kerbal boots and rovers on most planets/moons (excluding eve.). I have also got a SSTO that can land on the mun, minmas and maybe next weekend Duna... All of this was accomplished through trial an error, and error and further error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this weekend I had my best feat. I had a SSTO parked by a rover on minmas and I thought it looked like a nice place for my 1st off world base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E30 minutes later I lifted 7 hitch hikers, 1 cupola, 8 Kerbals with 4 return vehicles capable of making minmas surface to kerbal. It made it to orbit on the 1st launch without error. I then manually flew it to minmas and touched down at 1m/s at a mere 159m from my parked Spaceplane. All without saving in under an hour built from scratch totally stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts amazing how one can learn the mechanics if one blows up enough things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"User Unrelated","CreatedById":74021,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T20:33:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was having a really hard time with rendezvous at first\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut one day, I was just messing around, and BLAM... now it\u0027s a simple as can be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used my kerbin orbit rendezvous approach to reach eve yesterday, too... not the most effective planetary transfer, and it took a bit more than 800 kerban days, but hey, it\u0027s a step in the right direction!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy kerbin station is getting a bit large \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E but it still needs a kethane tank and some other little knick-knacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe funniest \u0022EUREKA!\u0022 moment I\u0027ve had was with docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first couple of days that I had the game, I didn\u0027t know about translational RCS thrusting\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso as you could imagine, docking was IMPOSSIBLE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was getting so frustrated trying to dock something after attempt after attempt at rendezvous, and about 3 hours in, I just had enough, and smashed my hands on the keyboard\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the ship bumped off smoothly to the right...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWUT.
