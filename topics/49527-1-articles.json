Here\u0027s my thoughts on how the game is progressing and how it might go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe addition of science has changed the dynamic and put us in for the long haul to get farther out into the kerbol system. It\u0027s not enough to just know how to make a good rocket. I found myself following NASA\u0027s mission history rather closely. There was a lot of science to gather from the Mun and plenty of reason to find a way to get there and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem with science is right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Once you visit a place, you milk it dry and never need return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: There is no reason to send more than one of everything on a one way trip, and since probes cannot preform a number of tasks that kerbals can, landers start to look exactly the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to suggest a way that science might work better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbes can preform simple tasks. They get one large payout for each \u003Cem\u003Enew\u003C/em\u003E data. If it is not new they get nothing. The logic being: they are limited in what they can preform but can last indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals however, gather science continuously at a much slower rate. The value of this being that making a giant science station would have a point. This is hard of course because of Time Warp. Now we get to a sticking point, and I\u0027d have to say it\u0027s time to add life-support. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiving the the kerbs limited time to preform a mission brings in many real world problems with space travel and in a lot of ways exactly the step we want to improve on the immersion and mission complexity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELife Support\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would mean that ships and stations would need to have enough air and food stores to keep them going. Often requiring restocks. Docking missions now becoming paramount. With the upcoming addition of money, and skills, I imagine kerbalnauts will become something much more valuable and necessary steps be taken to keep them alive and get them back after a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course as the tech tree grows, you\u0027ll see larger life-support pods, more efficiency, hibernation chambers for long trips, and large sub-sustainable life support which require massive energy, harvest resources and/or man power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also go so far as suggesting that kerbs have a life span. That would suggest that if you could keep them alive forever they would eventually die of old age. (or have children?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience Devices\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, as the game progresses we will see variations of the existing modules so we can build different ships from them the same way that there is more than one battery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to this I might suggest things like, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea robot arm, so surface samples might be gathered without a kerbal in the lander, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor large or small drills for getting under the surface for further examination of a planets surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps a water sampler that could be dropped in one of the few planets with with standing water or ice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECom Systems\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve seen now that coms are very useful and I like the way they work. I noticed though that the step between the first battery and the first solar panel is very small. Ideally there would be a point when sending data was possible but extremely delicate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally it might be interesting if each com was given a minimum range. This would mean that getting data back from Duna or Laythe might require a network of relay satellites. I don\u0027t know the exact details of radio waves. However my understanding is they continue going forever if now blocked or bounced away. Because space is space I\u0027d say it\u0027d be more likely that the message would travel fine. The only issue might be distortion. If my suggested change to Science was done, this might be measured in 1 point per minute for distorted signal or 5 per minute for a clear signal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also might be fun if you had to point your coms at target to send and receive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMoney\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we\u0027ve made the leap from sandbox game to more of a goal oriented game I think it\u0027s important to discuss what money will change and how it is rewarded differently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously science often has real world application and is worth money and will likely be added as well too. However there are other things which are worth money which might be important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially I imagine it\u0027d be possible to fail a new game if you ran out of money. However if you do the right things early I imagine a growing sustainable income.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: mapping Kerbal or other planets via satellite. This would only require a telescopic camera part be added. This also might lead to creating a Hubble-like telescope for viewing stars and planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing might just be launching satellites to get income from say, cell phone companies for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdditional Thoughts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding gear spike clamps for low gravity landings would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFreely attachable fuel or power (or oxygen) line via Kerbal for systems which require more power or fuel transfer without needing to directly dock. (EVAs can be fun!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
