Example: you have 950 Reputation (your scale is almost reached the striped section). You take a contract with a reward of 51 Reputation and complete it. You will not get 1001 (950\u002B51), and you will not get 1000 (950\u002B50); your Reputation will stay at 950, although Contracts app will tell you that you received your 51 Reputation points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soldeed","CreatedById":126804,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T03:17:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI still dont know how many reputaions I got!

Second, rep also has a law of diminishing returns. The more you have, the less of the contract amount you actually gain. This makes it pretty much impossible to max it out. Now, I myself have never seen much use for rep except as something to convert into science and/or money.
