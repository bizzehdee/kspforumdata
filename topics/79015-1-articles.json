The player does missions to accrue funds to pay for his own missions for his own research. With higher reputation comes access to higher quality kerbals. Kerbals can be recruited to be pilots or to the research team. Higher quality pilots yield higher quality science from experiments, and higher quality research team yields higher quality science transmitted from probes (this also gives us a reason to actually use probe cores as well). Higher reputation also gives access to bonus mission objectives that otherwise would not appear for a given mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think that we should do away with part tests past tier 2 or tier 3 parts. Instead there should be actual missions- investigate anomaly on Mun @ X,Y,Z coordinates (with a marker on the Mun to show where). Or put this company\u0027s satellite in orbit at X altitude and Y inclination. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think that part costs should be re-balanced to be a little more expensive. As it stands, it feels like funds are just a trivial way of keeping score. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my 2 copper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~ash\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T17:12:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with most of this, especially the generated orbits for Kerbals, but instead of removing science payout from contracts, because it makes sense in many instances, increase the science costs for each science node. In fact, I\u0027d go so far as a three- to five-fold increase in node cost because it is so easy to gain science now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as parts costs needing to be increased, there has actually been word from the devs that more costs are on the way, so I\u0027d wait to see how that plays out. It\u0027ll still be pretty easy for long time players, though, so difficulty options should be added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, of course, the caveat on launching craft for the talking heads should be that they can be removed once the mission is done so that we don\u0027t have to look at them past the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steampunked","CreatedById":22771,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T17:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, to your response about spawned items in orbit... the game could simply have a limit on the number of items spawned around a given body. I would actually like to see some persistence here... in fact there could be a whole series of missions that result in slowly building a station for a client (and possibly de-orbiting it eventually). Also, I think that entities spawned around a body should have less random orbits... instead of randomly spawning at 127567 meters, they could spawn at 5,000 meter intervals on varying inclinations at 5 degree intervals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day, I think the devs need to realize that career mode is not a sandbox and that they need to foster more interaction with game created objects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T18:05:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steampunked\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steampunked\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, to your response about spawned items in orbit... the game could simply have a limit on the number of items spawned around a given body.
