It\u0027s always bothered me that you get science by putting mystery goo on Mun and that somehow let\u0027s you build a better rocket, as I\u0027m sure most people agree. My thinking is to tie research to how many flights you\u0027ve had certain parts which would unlock further improvements. So you start with very basic 1.25 m tech, and each time you launch more 1.25 m flights with the latest equipment it gives you more science towards the next level. But to get better 2.5 m tech you have to use more 2.5 m parts. And to get more solar panels you need to deploy more solar panels, etc. Going to different planets and moons would give a boost, but maybe not biomes. And each part progression is independent, but can be simultaneous. However, you have to cough up some money to actually purchase the next upgrade once you have the science for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has probably been suggested before, but I want to add one more component: money. Basically, you will have a budget that you can assign to rockets or to improvements or to science, so that you can get quicker science progression at the cost of not investing in other improvements. And your budget goes up with reputation, but you can supplement it with private sector contracts. The science experiments would contribute to rep allot, which means biomes remain an important part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, your rep would fall pretty quickly if you don\u0027t launch anything or only launch to Mun a million times (repeated launches to the same body would give a penalty to any rep you gain, that goes away as you launch less to it). So if you try and cheat by just time warping until you get money you\u0027ll see your overall budget grow slower and slower until it\u0027s 0.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T18:46:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I agree.\u00A0But the career can be overhauled without the need of science points AKA \u0022The Closed Loop Career\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience experiments feed into reputation, reputation feeds into annual income, annual income feeds into science experiments (you build vessels that can perform science with and get you rep that way).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will draw it at some point just so it\u0027s easier to understand\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229hvSW37.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9hvSW37.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, so here\u0027s the explanation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. - Using money you build and launch vessels capable of doing science experiments\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. - Science experiments show the HQ that you are not passive (useless); reputation increases\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. -\u00A0Reputation proves you useful; annual funding increases\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EMONEY\u003C/u\u003E - You get more cash for accepting programs; spend it (and time) on tech (parts\u0027 research).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cu\u003ESCIENCE EXPERIMENTS\u003C/u\u003E - No longer rewarded with science points (now they get you rep); each experiment is weighted based on how hard it is to perform (the closer to the\u00A0surface of a planet/moon it\u0027s performed the more rep it gets you).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cu\u003EREPUTATION\u003C/u\u003E - If you do experiments, then it means you are not sitting on your butt all day long; income increases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPrograms\u003C/strong\u003E - this is what is offered in the Admin Building instead of strategies; programs influence the theme of your missions (if you\u0027ve picked the Jool Exploration Program then you should expect missions to be based around Jool\u0027s SOI).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMissions\u003C/strong\u003E - Those are what you get based on what kind of program you\u0027ve picked (previously called \u0027contracts\u0027) .\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETech\u003C/strong\u003E - The tech \u0022tree\u0022.
