It worked before! I tried deleting and downloading it again from Steam and from KSP website. So my question is: How can I fix it and will the full KSP work on my Mac? (if you want I can send you a crash report)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tom7896","CreatedById":140502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T17:15:09Z","Content":"Hello VPS2A1. A crash report would most likely be needed to help in this case, but I would like to say that the full KSP on Mac does work very well. Does it usually crash or has it only happened recently? It may be an issue with the \u0027integrity of the game cache\u0027, but I\u0027m no expert - sorry!"},{"CreatedByName":"VPS2A1","CreatedById":140690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T18:51:55Z","Content":"It happend recently.
