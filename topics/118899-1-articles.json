I figured I should try my hands on salvaging the remaining, still functional hardwares left on them and make a Franken laptop from whatever pieces that are compatible instead of leaving them there in the dust. Anyone got resources for a complete beginner to read for doing that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, can anyone familiar with ubuntu tell me how to access some diagnostic tools? This one laptop I have refused to boot with Windows, and even in safe mode, it is stuck at disk.sys. I managed to get an ubuntu boot USB and was able to boot into ubuntu, but I am not familiar with it.

You can\u0027t swap motherboards, keyboards, screens, or video cards on them. The CPUs or RAM are swappable but there are many different socket types, so you\u0027ll be lucky if two of them share the same connectors. CDROMs and HDDs are the easiest parts to swap. You can also try to swap the wireless LAN/BT cards if you\u0027re lucky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PC that refuses to boot Windows probably has a corrupted filesystem or a dead HDD.
