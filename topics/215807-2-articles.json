I got into KSP1 when it was in early access and it wasn\u0027t anything like how it ended up after eight years of development. In fact, it was a complete mess. I was okay with that because it was an early access product (although I was not okay with the complete lack of a plan on how the game would evolve from Squad). Same with KSP2, it\u0027s a mess right now but it\u0027s getting better, and should move along at a much faster pace due to having a bigger staff behind it. Plus, Intercept actually has a public roadmap so we know (largely) what to expect. Squad ultimately failed me with KSP1; the direction of the game was completely uninspired beyond the basic build/fly/repeat gameplay. KSP2 looks to repeat the basic build/fly/repeat gameplay, which is fine and well, but they have yet to let me down with further gameplay elements. Unfortunately I have to wait to see how that pans out. If they\u0027re just going to warm over KSP1\u0027s gameplay I\u0027m going to be right mad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think there\u0027s a tendency to read too much into positive statements from forum-goers; I\u0027m not exactly sitting here with a big dumb grin on my face regarding the game right now but I have no reason to be up in arms either. Maybe I just don\u0027t buy into hype or something, don\u0027t read statements as promises, who knows, but when it\u0027s time for me to grab a pitchfork you can be damn sure I will.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketRockington","CreatedById":223189,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-24T21:53:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224265043\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022215807\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221679688353\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113880\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shdwlrd\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, shdwlrd said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t disagree.

I still gave them the benefit of the doubt when it launched, however, in less than an hour and a half of fighting the game just to try to do simple things I refunded it.
