I do everything that the mission says. However, when my ship reaches the intercept point, it seems as though I reach the intercept point before the asteroid does. I am matching the orange dotted recommended orbit path as closely as possible but i always reach the intercept point before the asteroid does. What am i doing wrong and what can i do to fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your help!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-21T17:11:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2014 05:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Buttkracken\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T17:36:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you reach the point labeled \u0022Intersect\u0022, the asteroid should be at the point labeled \u0022Target Position at Intersect\u0022.
