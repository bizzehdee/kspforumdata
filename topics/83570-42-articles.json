The first is to add a few more intakes and to only use the shock cone intakes in areas where your the flow is still supersonic (this is assuming you\u0027re using FAR) i.e. Put the cone intakes at a wider sweep from the nose of the craft than your wings (not too much though!). Also, if you can manage it, try to keep your wings as sweeped as possible, the smaller the angle between the leading edge of the wing and the craft, the lower the drag will be at supersonic and hypersonic speeds. Also only use precooled SABRE\u0027s or you will not function nearly as well in the high supersonic ranges. Lastly, be careful with radial attachments, they frequently add enormous drag in weird ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smunisto","CreatedById":57789,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T17:48:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/fx8edykplre8fy3/Screenshot%202014-10-03%2020.34.46.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/fx8edykplre8fy3/Screenshot%202014-10-03%2020.34.46.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/frubrrd7nqv1y9b/Screenshot%202014-10-03%2020.34.53.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/frubrrd7nqv1y9b/Screenshot%202014-10-03%2020.34.53.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/6imtztvk7o5mob8/Screenshot%202014-10-03%2020.44.57.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/6imtztvk7o5mob8/Screenshot%202014-10-03%2020.44.57.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I am using currently.

And I don\u0027t remember if B9 had it in r4, I almost did not use it. Maybe I missed it.\u003Cp\u003EOkay then, if the engines have some throttle curve...how do I make them PUSH MOAR. For example, during an ascent with an SSTO with 4x D-30F7 Turbojet Engines, I reach about 25 000 meters ceiling at ~1170 m/s speed. At this point the engines throttle down and I am unable to increase my speed anymore, so I am forced to switch to rocket engines and start the orbit insertion. Any suggestions on increasing air breathing efficiency? More turbojets won\u0027t help, since they will reduce throttle due to the velocity curve. Should I just accept that this is the speed/altitude ceiling and adjust my rocket engines accordingly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the part description, the D-30F7 is listed as having a max design speed of Mach 3.2 - if we say the speed of sound in 343 m/s, that\u0027s just under 1100 m/s. It\u0027s basically impossible for those engines to push you much faster than that. You get forward thrust by accelerating air backwards in an engine, but the engine can only push the air out the nozzle so fast- if the exhaust velocity is the same as the intake velocity, there\u0027s no net acceleration of the air and thus no thrust. Adding more intakes or more of the same turbojets won\u0027t change that. If the engines are running low on air, having a higher intake/engine ratio will help, but you\u0027ll still run up against the same VelocityCurve limitation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BarnaclesG","CreatedById":77563,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T18:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know why, but for some reason even with 8 GB of RAM, I can\u0027t seem to get the game to load with B9 installed.
