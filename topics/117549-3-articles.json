Perhaps the smallest size should in fact have been 1.75m, or 1.9m. That or they could have arbitrarily made kerbals X% smaller. Whatever path they take/took, the IVAs should be 100% inside the actual part model (with appropriate thickness of those external walls), and the kerbals should fit inside, fully suited if that is something the part requires (any part that allows EVA).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat we are possibly saddled with parts that break this is bad, but it would be worse to add new parts that knowingly break this notion, IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I just looked at the 2 mk1 parts in question, and there is room for the helmets.
