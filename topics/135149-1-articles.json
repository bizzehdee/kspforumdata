If you are not intercepting Minmus near its AN/DN, and you are coming from an equatorial orbit, then you will struggle to get an encounter. Even a large normal component during your transfer burn will not help you - that just twists your orbit around the axis drawn through your vessel and your orbit\u0027s primary focus. In this case, while making a transfer burn, this equals the axis drawn through the apses. So you\u0027re twisting the orbit without moving the apses themselves. You would however need to move your apoapsis up or down relative to Kerbin\u0027s equatorial plane... and there simply does not exist a maneuver that can do this, apart from an in-flight course correction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good thing about Minmus is that there are no transfer windows to worry about. You can wait in orbit until it nears its AN/DN so you can plot a direct transfer. With your Mars window, you don\u0027t have that luxury: you need to transfer \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result of that, to avoid the in-flight plane change, you have only one option: you must match inclination with Mars\u0027 orbit before you perform your transfer burn. You can do this either by launching directly into a properly inclined orbit, or by performing the plane change in low Earth orbit. The latter may be very expensive. So the former is really the way to go. I\u0027m sure there are tutorials for launching into inclined orbits around the forums somewhere. If you have MechJeb (or any other tool that can show you your current deviation from a target orbit\u0027s inclination), it becomes much easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-29T08:22:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2016 08:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T15:24:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are basically two common ways to get to Mars...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/pics/fig5-05.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022fig5-05.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/pics/fig5-06.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022fig5-06.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Figure 5.5, what you first do is launch from Earth into a zero-inclination ecliptic orbit.\u00A0 Then, when you are 90 degrees from Mars, you perform a plane change.\u00A0 As you said, however, this can be a fairly large burn -\u00A0800 m/s\u00A0sounds reasonable.\u00A0 The other thing you can do is to launch directly into an inclined orbit as shown in figure 5.6.\u00A0 Figuring this our gets messy.\u00A0 If you don\u0027t mind using mods, you might try \u003Cem\u003ETransfer Window Planner\u003C/em\u003E, which is the in-game version of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis web tool\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 I\u0027ve only used \u003Cem\u003ETransfer Window Planner\u003C/em\u003E in the stock game, but its my understanding that it pulls its information from the game\u00A0files and will work with RSS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
