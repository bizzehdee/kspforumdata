The \u0022merge\u0022 button responds to being clicked and released, but that\u0027s it. This happens in both the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and switching to another file doesn\u0027t change this.

If you send the craft out to launch first, you can once again merge other vessels with it if you revert back to the vehicle assembly/spaceplane hangar, however it may have to be done each time you load another vessel, so it is time consuming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
