As you know, President Kerbama has tasked us with the insurmountable goal of landing a Kerbal on Duna and since we were going to be in the neighborhood, to check out that rock floating about as well, what was it called? Mike? Ike? Whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur job is to land on Duna and Ike, and bring back as much science as possible. For this mission we have hired the following misfits and miscreants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah Kerman: Mission Captain. Jeb, we will be putting you in our cozy command module, complete with viewing cupola, plenty of extra deltaV and no missions to the surface. You will be monitoring the situation from your command post high in the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWehlro Kerman: Chief Science Guy. Wehlro, you\u0027re only here because Bob is on mission around Minmus, so don\u0027t screw this up ok? All you have to do is hang out with Jeb while he bosses everyone around ok?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill Kerman: Head Engineer. Bill, we\u0027re putting you on this mission to fix anything should it break. Although, let\u0027s be honest, if we really need your help, we\u0027re probably already doomed anyway. Yes, I know you\u0027re supposed to retire in a year, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be back by then. What do you mean the launch window isnt for another year and half? Don\u0027t you have an orbital taxi to catch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESigley/Muncan Kerman: Duna Lander Engineer/Pilot. Sigley and Muncan, our newest additions to the team. Brothers that were raised in the circus as sideshow acts, and now here you are being launched into space. You guys have the fun job. Muncan, you\u0027re going to land this tin can onto Duna and bring it back to Kerbel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESigley, it\u0027s your sole duty to repack the shoots so that when you brother brings you two back you don\u0027t die hitting the ground at 200\u002B m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Germy\u0022 Kerman: Ike Explorer. Let\u0027s face it Germy, the only reason you have to be all alone in the Ike Lander is because you smell so bad. Sorry, better bring a book.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this mission we\u0027ve assembled a small armada of craft to explore the Duna system.

We will be parking this baby in orbit right above duna as a headquarters if you will. Missions to duna and ike will meet and refuel here if necessary. This station will be left at duna to assist in future endeavors.

Any experiements we forgot were packed with the command station in KAS boxes. We\u0027ll fly this sucker down to duna, assisted by parachute of course and perform various experiments. Hopefully it will be able to leave Duna as well, but with x16 Rockomax 48-7S\u0027s, i think we will be ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zdiz3O2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Zdiz3O2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Gypsy Girl\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGermy will be riding this one alone, there is room in the crew cabin, but nobody could stand the smell coming out of the cockpit.

Not sure how I will rendezvous them once I get to Duna. I guess very carefully. Anyway, hope you enjoyed. I was gonna just launch it but, considering how much work went into planning just these 3 ships, I just had to share with you guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falloutaddict","CreatedById":140606,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T07:40:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECitizens of Kerbal, it is with a heavy heart and a very sad emoticon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E(( that I announce today the tragic loss of two or our esteemed kerbonauts, Sigmey and Muncan. At approximately 12:30 in the afternoon, supposedly after they had just had a light lunch and presumably a nap, their vessel experienced sudden, and unexpected part malfunction and instantly exploded into a horrific fireball of shredded metal and other \u0022stuff\u0022.

Long story short, we have cloned our beloved test subjects and are ready to launch them into space for another go at it.

For aerobraking we set our periapsis at 13,000 meters precisely. Germy, who was commanding out Ike lander and probe station, was the first one to Duna SOI by about 3 days which was good, because there was a lot of work to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur first job was to drop one of our probes into low polar orbit around Duna. Then we hopped on over to Ike where we dropped off our other 2 probes. One to be sent into a high polar elliptical orbit around ike and the other in a very high orbit around Duna.

That means EVA for everybody.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: B-b-but, KSC, Germy\u0027s only got 4 extra seats over there and there\u0027s 6 of us!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSC: Yes, yes, we know.

Sigley and Muncan will stay behind until we can get someone out to rescue them. There is enough fuel for them to make one more trip down to Duna if they can get the docking ports working. Overall, I would say the mission was a success. We complete numerous contracts for both Duna and Ike, got loads of science, and had quite an adventure doing it. I hope you all enjoyed my first mission control story. It was definitely a little rough around the edges but with a Eve mission ahead of us, I hope to make the next one that much better. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
