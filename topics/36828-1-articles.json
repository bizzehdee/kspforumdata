Notice how they never seem to sleep, they are always terrified, excited, etc during missions. This is because of the substance created by the KSP called \u0022Koffee\u0022. Koffee consists of 4 major ingredients: Kocoa Beans, grown and found in the Island and tropical regions of Kerbin, it gives the Koffee a better flavor, Water, this gives the Koffee a liquid state, (preferably making it easier to consume by the kerbalnaut). Other ingredients added by the Kerbals, such as Milk, fresh from the Dairy farms to north of the K.S.C, sugar, to sweeten it, etc. And finally a classified substance to extend the Koffee\u0027s effect at keeping Kerbals awake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how Kerbals never, EVER sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T16:46:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECoincidentally, that mysterious substance is also main ingredient in Solid Rocket Booster\u0027s fuel.
