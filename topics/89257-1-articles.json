It\u0027s core is a T-800 with a Mark 1 jet fuselage behind it. It has 4 more T-100 tanks mounted on radial hardpoints. The main engine is a RAPIER, with 4 ion propulsion units serving as orbital maneuvering engines and landing legs. It also has 6 LV-1R mini-engines for initial takeoff assist. As documented in the album, on its maiden interplanetary voyage it landed on Mun, then on Minmus, and then made it back to the KSC. I was pretty sloppy about it too, so I think I could manage something more impressive if I planned more carefully. Abandoning the VTOL capability for longer range yielded the Model 2, which I\u0027ll post separately.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-03T00:52:11Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2014 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
