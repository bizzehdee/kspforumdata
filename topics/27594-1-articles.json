But a cylinder that size with 2.5 meters diameter would have something like 7,000 liters volume. Even if you count in the rescale factor of 1.25 cubed, around a factor of 2, it is still 3,500 liters, more than twice the actual capacity.

They aren\u0027t hard-tied to any measurement at this point, so just use them as a guideline for building your tanks.
