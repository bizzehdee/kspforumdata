So recently I was thinking about my old Internet names when I got an idea to turn this into a thread. So, what are your old Internet names?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first internet name was, I believe, StackODiamonds. This was on a youtuber\u0027s fan site forum, and the name was in hopes he\u0027d mention me in a video like \u0022StackODiamonds, awesome name dude!\u0022. But, alas, that never happened. The site is still around (though I don\u0027t think my StackODiamonds posts are), and I still watch that YouTuber. My second Internet name was TheX. This was inspired by a YouTuber named davidr64yt, who still makes videos. Anyways, his nickname was X. I was (and still am)\u00A0a big fan of him. I liked\u00A0(and still do) his Minecraft videos.\u00A0TheX was going to be my YouTube name when I started a channel, but sometime in late 2012 that changed to my current YT name. Those are my only two old Internet names I can remember right now. Technically, there\u0027s a 3rd, but I still have that account on that forum, so...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yeah, back in 2012 I was a big Minecraft fan. That helps\u00A0explain\u00A0both of my old Internet names.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T15:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve actually had this one since I first got a hotmail account way back in the mid-late 90\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T19:49:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeen ZooNamed for over a decade, and added Games portion when I joined this community.
