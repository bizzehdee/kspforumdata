That\u0027s mostly because of the eye position of kerbals in contrast to humans, kerbal heads take up like half of their body height, there\u0027s at least 5 times more foreahead sitting above their eyes making it impossible to position them high enough under the ceiling without tricks. As a result, you can get the kerbal to barely peek over the ledge of a canopy, let alone see the ground below properly.
