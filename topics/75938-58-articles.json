It\u0027s a basic course, close to KSC with a red gate, my first attempt at doing Blender, Unity and KSP together so nothing special. If someone wants to make a better gate that appears in KK the correct way up I\u0027d be happy to swap it. It should be available in Scenarios, the gates will appear anyway if you have KK installed but if you don\u0027t start the scenario they wont have the probe core landed on each one for the gate number and to see the direction through the hills and stuff (you\u0027d of laughed at my attempts to land a ship on each gate to drop the probe core). The gates are numbered 1 to 8, start from the launch position on the runway and end by going back onto the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure about the size of the gates, the track layout, the look of the gates, or anything else really. I just made it close to KSC a bit on the water and quite short. Opinions/suggestions/criticism is needed please. You should be able to unzip the contents into your main KSP folder, that\u0027ll need testing as well, it adds the scenario, a red gate and the latest Kerbal Konstructs.
