It doesn\u0027t show the trajectory line, but it does show you prograde, retrograde, radials and normals, and is very intuitive if you\u0027re used to using the stock navball.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also vaguely recall the Trajectories mod having a bug where the trajectory line would draw in ship mode. It was a bug because (IIRC at least) it blocked a lo of the view with a large line. It might be possible to take that original bugged code and - instead of removing it - modifying the way its displayed to show a more palatable line that matches the actual patched conics of the game (instead of the predictions in Trajectories based on atmosphere).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d be down for a mod that does this, especially if it was as lightweight as (and was compatible with) NavHud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
