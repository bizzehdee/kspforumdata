A number of stock modules were harmed in the process. It has proven to be reliable in my own testing, but I\u0027d like to get it out to a wider audience to see the interesting ways it might be abused and/or broken. I\u0027m very interested in feedback on this device and how it functions.\n\nThe pack contains 4 parts: The Kinetic Penetrator, a small monopropellant tank, a small monopropellant engine, and a tiny airbrake. \n\nThe Kinetic Penetrator itself is a self-contained unit including battery, micro-RTG, probe core guidance with basic SAS, and reaction wheels. It is also equipped with a seismometer/accelerometer, thermometer, and deployable antenna for data transmission. The majority of the main device is not surface attachable to prevent attaching other devices to it, and out of necessity in regards to impact survival. A small area near bottom of the main device is attachable to allow airbrakes to be deployed. As it relies on a slightly abused landing gear module to soften impacts to prevent bouncing and allow the KAS harpoon module to take hold, the device does have options related to landing legs within it\u0027s action menu. Unfortunately I do not believe there is anything I can do about this short of writing some C# code, which I cannot do, so I don\u0027t expect that to change. \n\nKnown Issues:\n\n1. The main device has landing leg related options in the action menu.\n2. On occasion, the device will explode on impact even at \u0022safe\u0022 velocities.\n3. The device may bounce if it impacts the surface at speeds exceeding ~110 m/s\n4. Landing on a planet/moon may fail to complete a \u0022Land on...\u0022 objective. If this occurs, right click on the device and select \u0022Detach\u0022. The collider should then fall a short distance and make contact with the surface. This is mainly an issue at low impact speeds or in very low gravity.\n5. On rare occasion, you may be unable to leave the scene due to the device being registered as still in flight. Right clicking and selecting \u0022Detach\u0022 will correct this, however the device may explode. (This has happened only twice in my testing)\n\n* * *\n\nWhat do I do with this thing?\n\nIt\u0027s simple, really: Crash! The device will (fairly) reliably perform at impacts up to 100 m/s. Use the fuel tank and engine included in the pack to decelerate to a safe speed (don\u0027t forget to decouple the tank and engine afterwards, and also don\u0027t forget that you will begin to accelerate again after slowing down. Plan accordingly) before impacting the surface of whatever you want to land on. Point the nose of the device at the surface, and it should sink a ways into the ground and stick. Once stuck, you can collect data and transmit it back to Kerbin!\n\nNote that in an atmosphere of any thickness, you will likely need airbrakes to avoid disaster.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/u-wT_2uluFI?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-26T01:48:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2016 01:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocketfeline","CreatedById":137938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T00:12:13Z","Content":"Ooh boy..

The antenna would look lovely if it were significantly lengthened into a long whip antenna.)\n\nWith love c:\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T23:30:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 11:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cleric2145**"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T23:34:06Z","Content":"RemoteTech patch should be easy enough, but it sort of defeats the purpose of the device in my opinion.
