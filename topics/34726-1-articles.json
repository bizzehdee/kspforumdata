I believe what Darth is hinting at is that you need to look in the parts files for the KW Rocketry pack that you installed, find the specific folder that contains the 3.75m fairing, then open its \u0022part.cfg\u0022 file in something like Notepad (or equivalent Linux text editor). I\u0027m not sure exactly what the part is called, but generally they are named similar to their in-game function. In that file, add a new line that says:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ErescaleFactor = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave the file, then restart KSP.
