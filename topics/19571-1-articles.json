Better yet, we need a dedicated Mod download link section on top of the current \u0022Addon Release and project showcase\u0022. It\u0027s pretty hard to find the exact mod you want, you always have to read the thread continuously for new cool mods. Wish there were just a plain list, with categories, of dl links for mods. Yes there\u0027s an official mod page, but it\u0027s never up to date and has just a handful of the stuff out there. There are generally will have plenty of landers though, check the rocket and parts packs on the addon releases, they generally will have them. For sure, check Nova Silisko\u0027s page. That dude is a BOSS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kevinlacht","CreatedById":14955,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-18T18:30:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the mem lander from luigio97 (the mem mod pack, you have a working camera and your countryflag with song when you activate it, really cool)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
