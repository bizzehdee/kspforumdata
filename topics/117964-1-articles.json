I am a little new to this math stuff in terms of science, so bare with me. First and foremost, to determine the total delta-v of a spacecraft, you must express it as: Delta-v = Effective Exhaust Velocity * log(total, fueled mass (wet) / final, drained (dry) mass).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer for the Saturn V I got was ~17,862 m/s delta-v. I am asuming that this is for the three stage assembly itself, not including the Lunar CSM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, additionally, I decided to calculate the initial thrust of each stage for the SV, using the equation F(thrust) = Ve * (delta-m/delta-t), where delta-m is the flow of mass over delta-t, the time being in seconds. Ve is effective exhaust velocity (expressed as Isp in seconds * 9.81 m/s^2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifics (based on some onlinep research):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage burn time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES1: 161 s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES2: 390 s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES3: 475 s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage masses\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES1: Dry = 135 t, Wet = 2,286 t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES2: Dry = 39 t, wet = 490 t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES3: Dry = 13 t, wet = 119 t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES1: 265 s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES2: 200 s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES3: 200 s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy math could be way off, and if so, tell me where I went wrong and what it should be.
