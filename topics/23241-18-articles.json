The stock drag model multiplies the part\u0027s maximum_drag value by its mass; the stock intakes only include the mass of the intake, while the adapter-intake combo includes the mass of the central adapter section; this leads to the latter having a much larger amount of drag than the former.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, I think that the intakes should be separated from the central adapter so that the S2 widebody parts are more useful; currently it\u0027s functionally worse than every other stock intake (though much prettier than those) which makes using it somewhat difficult for me to justify.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T05:00:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be really simple to make your own intake adapter for now, though it certainly wouldn\u0027t look as pretty; attach the engine adapter imversely and put intakes on those four spots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit after hours of playtesting: I really want to use and love this pack, but everything\u0027s just too goddamned heavy \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 especially ****ing adapters \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 I can\u0027t accomplish anything.
