It\u0027s just blank. All other data is present.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of my existing contracts have names. And they all have the flag graphics loaded up. Some tests seem to suggest this is only for modded providers, since things like \u0022Kerbin\u0027s First\u0022 and \u0022Sean\u0027s Cannery\u0022 still show up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea what could be causing this. I went ahead and installed Contract Configurator, which was something I\u0027d overlooked, but the new contracts generated don\u0027t seem to be fixed. If I open up the actual save file, my contracts all seem to have agent names listed in the file, the game just...doesn\u0027t want to load them up?
