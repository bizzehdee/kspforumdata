The IVA models must have tight constraints, since they\u0027re part of the scene during flight.\n\nTrue, it needn\u0027t be as cluttered as the real life labs. But the large cockpits don\u0027t look to constrained, so polygon limits mustn\u0027t be too small. Going all out modeling many different components would be excessive, but like in those other IVAs, using a few repeated elements would let you achieve a lot. There are already buttons, computer screens, and various dials that could be used to make it look more lab-like.\n\nWorse than the lack of instruments is the lack of workstation like areas. Even if everything is packed away(borring), there\u0027s not a lot of space to put equipment, apart from on floors, that narrow bench. Plus, it would\u0027ve been nice to see some attempt to design it for both vertical and horizontal orientations. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T15:28:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 03:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tw1**"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T16:20:04Z","Content":"The lab seems to have some influence from the American Skylab module, which had a similar vertical orientation since it was a converted Saturn fuel tank.

I always land my Hitchhiker pods vertically for this reason. Who knows, maybe in a future update Squad will have some parts with surface habitation in mind.\n\nThat lab is awesome though Frizzank.
