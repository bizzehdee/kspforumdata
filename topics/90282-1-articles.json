After ruling out flameout it wasn\u0027t really solved. I ended up recreating the plane from scratch and living with the fact that at any point my jet will just randomly tumble to the ground - problem is that its a rare event so I can go a whole mission and recover the craft with no ill effects happening. Anyway I upgraded twice and have switched from 64bit to 32bit versions of the game. I\u0027m getting stuck in to a new career game and now all of a sudden one of my craft is getting the same issue. This time however it a nuke engine which is having the problem!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship has managed to make various manouvers in LKO. Then transported itself all the way to minmus - its been alive and well and performing perfectly for over 9 days. Now in minmus soi - circularising my orbit one of the engines suddenly start to cut its thrust. Reducing its twin to about 50% thrust balances it out but thats hardly a solution to the issue.
