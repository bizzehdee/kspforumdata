In this case, they were the same thing!\u0022\u00A0 The science is also pretty good -- the author, Harold Goodwin (writing under the penname \u0022Blake Savage\u0022), was the director of atomic test operations for the Federal Civil Defense Administration at the time that he wrote \u003Cem\u003ERip Foster\u003C/em\u003E, and the world of Rip Foster employs nuclear thermal rockets and pulse propulsion (concepts that were being seriously studied at the time) to explore the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is also definitely a work of its time, in a sort of charming way -- our hero is a Planeteer (think \u0022space marine\u0022) fighting for the Federation of Free Governments against the evil Consolidation of Planetary Governments (abbreviated as Consops and \u0022Connies\u0022...), and he does his calculations with a slide rule and radios his figures back to the ship or Headquarters for checking by \u0022electronic computer\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe story goes that Lt. Richard Ingalls Peter \u0022Rip\u0022 Foster has just graduated from the academy, and his first assignment (given with great urgency) is to get to the asteroid belt.\u00A0 A Federation cruiser found an asteroid of nearly pure thorium (valuable nuclear fuel -- especially since it\u0027s already in space), but tongues wagged in the bars at Marsport (as they do) and now the Connies know about it as well.\u00A0 Rip and his squad are to bring this asteroid back to Earth orbit while keeping the Connies off it...and they\u0027ll do anything short of starting a war to get it from him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, while the book was written to set up a character and setting for a series of stories, no further adventures of Rip were written.\u00A0 I\u0027m usually dismissive of the endless Hollywood retreads, but this is one book I wouldn\u0027t mind seeing a movie version or remake -- and as fun (and cinematic) as it is in its original state, I think a setting update could also work really well.\u00A0 With the fall of the Soviet Union and the entry of other nations and private corporations into the aerospace world (including interplanetary exploration and prospecting), a remade \u003Cem\u003ERip Foster\u003C/em\u003E could approach the conflict from a space piracy and intrigue perspective, in addition to (or instead of) the usual clash of superpowers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you all think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-16T06:36:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2015 06:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbas_ad_astra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-16T19:19:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the spaceship on the cover is utterly awesome.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-16T21:00:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222325321\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127970\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450293558\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the spaceship on the cover is utterly awesome.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Federation\u0027s American-designed \u0022snapper-boats\u0022 (fighter craft, so named because their sudden accelerations would snap an unsecured pilot right out of his seat) are described as being streamlined, even though it\u0027s not necessary (and since the main gun is fixed in the nose, it usually flies at one angle and points at another anyway) -- the Americans just like clean lines.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T16:28:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the few books that actually has a countryman of mine (Filipino) as part of the crew (Paulo Santos). \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E This book, and Heinlein\u0027s Starship Troopers (in the book Rico was from Manila, Philippines and not Buenos Aires).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-18T16:28:28Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2015 04:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rodion_herrera\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
