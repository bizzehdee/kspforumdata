However, Windows doesn\u2019t divide the address space evenly between the active process and the system, but instead defines a region in the address space for the process and others for various system memory resources, like system page table entries (PTEs), the file cache, and paged and non-paged pools.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe size of the process address space is different on IA64 and x64 versions of Windows where the sizes were chosen by balancing what applications need against the memory costs of the overhead (page table pages and translation lookaside buffer \u2013 TLB \u2013 entries) needed to support the address space. \u003Cstrong\u003EOn x64, that\u2019s 8192GB (8TB)\u003C/strong\u003E and on IA64 it\u2019s 7168GB (7TB \u2013 the 1TB difference from x64 comes from the fact that the top level page directory on IA64 reserves slots for Wow64 mappings). On both IA64 and x64 versions of Windows, the size of the various resource address space regions is 128GB (e.g. non-paged pool is assigned 128GB of the address space), with the exception of the file cache, which is assigned 1TB.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/en_en/library/windows/desktop/aa366778(v=vs.85).aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/en_en/library/windows/desktop/aa366778(v=vs.85).aspx\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cpre\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EFrom error.log:\u003C/span\u003E\n134217728 MB user address space [134215289 MB free].\nWrite to location 0412e270 caused an access violation.\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the above is not conclusive, it hints at the OS directing KSP.exe to use memory locations that aren\u0027t in the virtual space (which is perfectly manageable); the result could very well be crashes when the OS function allocating memory returns a invalid location.
