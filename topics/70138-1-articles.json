Maybe use staging/a prepared game file and only have them calculate it for the second stage once it\u0027s already in orbit? Calculations of the delta-v requirement for apoapsis/periapsis adjustment might be reasonable. You could also do something with looking at how the orbital period depends on the various orbital parameters, and check that it follows Kepler\u0027s Laws. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that a highschool physics lab is generally going to be 45 minutes to an hour and a half in length, you\u0027d want to make sure that the students don\u0027t waste too much time on e.g. failed launches and things like that. From launch to orbit in KSP is generally about 5 minutes if everything goes well, but kraken attacks, bad TWR, things like that may mean you have to try that a couple of times before it works (certainly if you\u0027re new to the game), so I\u0027d guess that for the lab itself you\u0027ll burn 20 minutes teaching the basics of how to use the game interface, 30-40 minutes getting them to figure out how to get into orbit, etc, and then you can actually start doing things which have simple calculations. I\u0027d start with Kepler\u0027s Laws, go over them in a class before the lab, spend 10 minutes at the start of the lab reviewing them, and have them set up a series of different orbits and measure them in game. Maybe something like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Get your craft as close as you can to a 100km x 100km orbit. Write down the apoapsis and periapsis from in-game here. Wait for your ship to go around (using time acceleration) and measure the orbital period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Put your craft into a 100km x 400km orbit. Write down the actual apoapsis and periapsis here. What is the semi-major axis of this orbit? Measure the orbital period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Put your craft into an inclined orbit. Write down apoapsis, periapsis, inclination, and semi-major axis. Measure the orbital period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Put your craft into two more orbits of your choice, write down the orbital parameters, and measure the orbital period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Now we will see if these results follow Kepler\u0027s Third Law. Compute the ratio T^2/r^3 for each of these orbits. Using the gravitational constant G, estimate the mass of Kerbin. Compare with the values from the in-game dialog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make it more fair (especially if the lab is being marked), it\u0027d be reasonable to provide a save state with a craft with ample delta-V or infinite fuel cheats enabled sitting in Kerbin orbit, but part of the fun would be designing your own experimental craft and getting it up there yourself so I\u0027d have that as a fallback option if people are having trouble - maybe check on everyone at the 50 minute mark and if they aren\u0027t in orbit yet, switch them to the save file.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hazarada","CreatedById":72036,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T15:23:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egetting them to just play the game would have its own reward, if they\u0027re into it, rocket science can come later \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E maybe he can check out algodoo too\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-22T15:30:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2014 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by hazarada\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T15:29:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGetting to orbit is, relatively, hard.

KSP is like this: I wasn\u0027t even trying to learn -- I just wanted to put my Kerbals into the sky. It wasn\u0027t until \u003Cem\u003Eafter \u003C/em\u003EI had devoured the wiki and gotten into orbit for the first time that I realized I now understood why the Saturn V turns sideways during launch.

They have absolutely nothing to do with KSP or physics, but I\u0027m doing it anyway because I\u0027ve suddenly regained my enthusiasm for the subject. You may teach this for the physics and math, but if you do it right they\u0027ll go on to history, literature and art.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd they never even have to know. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was inspired and re-inspired in the same way.
