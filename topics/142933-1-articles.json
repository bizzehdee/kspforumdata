I had it in a perfect 122 km equatorial orbit, and I went back to the space center. When I looked for it in the tracking station however, I couldn\u0027t see it, nor can I find it in map mode. However, it says there are 12 flights in progress which would indicate that it\u0027s still there. Has anyone ever had anything like this happen to them? Is there a way I can get to my space station again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrangeRush","CreatedById":166129,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-01T21:59:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem solved, and I feel like such an idiot. I used a landing can as the control unit for the station, so it was listed as a lander.
