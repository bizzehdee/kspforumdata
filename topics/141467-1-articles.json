I have no problem with long burns (and I usually install BetterTimeWarp anyway), so I go for the highest Isp engines I can get. Ergo, Poodles and Rhinos, LV-N\u0027s, or even electric engines powered by reactors (those are modded parts, obviously - see signature link).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing you need to keep in mind that the total mass of your vessel has a large impact on your ability to capture asteroids. You can build a vessel weighing 50 tons that has 5,000m/s dV, and you can build a vessel weighing 500 tons that also has 5,000m/s dV. And if you attach them to similar asteroids, the small vessel will see its dV disintegrate to near-nothing, while the large vessel will lose much less. This happens because you\u0027re attaching extra payload in flight, and the rocket equation runs off of mass ratios.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result of this, while electric engines are great at downsizing the vessel while still obtaining big dV values, and they sometimes make for great tugs, they won\u0027t necessarily translate into \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E being the best option. Sometimes stupid amounts of liquid fuel and a couple of Nerv\u0027s is better, just because the mass difference between vessel and rock is so much smaller than with an ultralight electric space cruiser. Ideally, you would pre-plan this in the VAB by estimating - or even simulating - the potential extra mass you can expect the asteroid to add depending on the size class the tracking station gives you. Each class has a fixed range. They\u0027re probably in the KSPedia ingame, and if not, they most definitely are on the official KSP wiki.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T19:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222622953\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141467\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465422301\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151345\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wcmille\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/8/2016 at 10:45 PM, Wcmille said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m building a reusable craft that can capture asteroids in the Dres SOI.
