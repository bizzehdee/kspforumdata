(And it does this by encoding a bit mask in base64 or something very close.) Deposit locations and sizes are produced mathematically from a seed number selected when kethane plugin first loads in a save file. The amounts of a resource contained in a deposit are stored separately, and drilling a deposit drains every tile in the entire deposit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, you can alter the amount of kethane in a given cell, but you cannot introduce kethane into a cell that does not have it, without changing whether \u003Cem\u003Eevery other cell\u003C/em\u003E also contains kethane or not -- you can do it by repeatedly selecting a different seed number until there\u0027s a seed that results in a deposit underneath a specific cell. What happens to the rest of the map is essentially random. You can also duplicate deposit positions from one save file in another save file, but you cannot directly edit cells at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mihara","CreatedById":59752,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T23:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sumghai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sumghai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf I recall correctly, the current version of Kethane has a debug option to \u0022spawn\u0022 a deposit right underneath the active vessel\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a debug part a few versions ago.
