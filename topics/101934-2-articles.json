There are a couple ways to \u0027cheat-out\u0027 a few of the contracts, in scripting them there were unavoidable tradeoffs to avoid glitches and \u0022chicken before egg\u0022 problems. It\u0027s on the roadmap to re-visit the script logic for the cheatable contracts for a future update, but not sure when that will be. The next update will be adding additional \u0022late game\u0022 focused contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerb O\u0026#039;Naut","CreatedById":67847,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T23:46:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehey well done! just wondering, does Time to Completion calculate in background while away from vessel?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tjsnh","CreatedById":108021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T11:41:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerb O\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerb O\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehey well done! just wondering\u0027 date=\u0027 does Time to Completion calculate in background while away from vessel?[/quote\u0027]\u003Cp\u003EIt did in testing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E For example, I did the \u0022spend 6 months on a space station\u0022 contract and left it going while I was handling a duna probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mokmo","CreatedById":62363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T00:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think i didn\u0027t read through the whole thing... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if my Kerbal goes on EVA, it resets the timer for the 2-day orbit mission ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh wait, i can\u0027t be away from it at all... 8 days will be quite complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: I guess something broke the tagging, now with image goodness\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ztt5Cf5.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022ztt5Cf5.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T01:02:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 01:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mokmo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T02:45:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mokmo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mokmo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think i didn\u0027t read through the whole thing... \u003Cp\u003ESo if my Kerbal goes on EVA, it resets the timer for the 2-day orbit mission ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh wait, i can\u0027t be away from it at all... 8 days will be quite complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: I guess something broke the tagging, now with image goodness\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ztt5Cf5.jpg?1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/ztt5Cf5.jpg?1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the two day timer breaking when you leave the vessel, that\u0027s a hard one for tjsnh to fix in the contract, and a hard one for me to fix in Contract Configurator. The problem is that when you EVA, the original vessel no longer meets the conditions (it has no pilot on board). The EVA Kerbal now *does* meet the condition and gets picked up. When you go back on board, the Kerbal disappears, but the capsule now meets the requirement again, so the timer starts over. You could \u0022hack\u0022 it by having two pilots on board, but I really don\u0027t see a better way for tjsnh to do that part of the of the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the vessel tagging, everything looks right to me. tjsnh - I\u0027d suggest changing from using the Timer parameter to putting the duration attribute in the VesselParameterGroup. It\u0027s effectively the same thing, but should look a little bit clearer to the player (because it\u0027ll change the vessel name in the parameter at that point to their vessel).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T05:57:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, I love the look of this mod.
