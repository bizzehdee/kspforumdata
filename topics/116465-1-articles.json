It\u0027s about human nature in a way. We dream about even a small town, village, hamlet even on the Moon or Mars but in a few thousand years, if we don\u0027t destroy ourselves by then or a natural disaster destroys our civilization, It\u0027ll probably be ancient history and we\u0027ll have expanded to the stars. But, the nutty thing is, is that we\u0027ll still want to expand more. We could find the theoretical edge of the universe and we\u0027d still want to break through to get more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also agree with Shpaget. If you don\u0027t like a radio station or book, you don\u0027t get mad at the author or host, you simply don\u0027t read that author or tune that station. And sometimes people that are \u0022on the outside\u0022 of discussions or interests can bring a unique, sometimes controversial element to the discussion within. Just because someone isn\u0027t interested in a topic doesn\u0027t mean that their views towards it are completely false. One could be totally disinterested in, say, politics, but when asked about it they could say that politics brings unnecessary conflict to the world. There is, as observed by Shpaget, too much information in the world for any one person to know it all, and that you must pick and choose what you want to know about. This cartoonist obviously knows more about cartooning, being a cartoonist, and current events, being a newspaper cartoonist. And, in the fast-paced industry of news, there probably isn\u0027t much time in a day to pick a current or near-current event, conceive an idea for a cartoon it, draw it, and send it off to the paper to be approved and publicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, isn\u0027t it a bit silly and a waste of ones\u0027 time and energy getting angry at a cartoon in a newspaper when you could use that time and energy helping people or learning about whatever it is you wish to know more about?
