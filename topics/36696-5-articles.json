The appeal is that it opens the game up for all different types of people to customise the experience of the game to suit them, and given that its not multiplayer, what difference does that make really? It keeps the game alive and encourages creativity. Some of the mods I have seen actually add aspects that increase the difficulty of the game or make it more realistic, and if you don\u0027t like any of these things, then you don\u0027t have to have them.
