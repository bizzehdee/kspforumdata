just put it there to hide the ugly look of where the wings meet each other.also thats where its lasers go cause its a good place to put them.in my minds concept those things are supposed to be short

pack of different ships.i made many different smaller ones that were a lot easyer to control and launch(they launch as spaceships not as aerospace craft).in the final version they will all have cheat
