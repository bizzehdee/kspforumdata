The enclosure is subdivided into panels, which can break off individually or in groups, which means we can have full control over how the fairing will come apart once it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s jettisoned. During construction, you can place a fairing and build it up immediately after placement, or you can use Tweakable actions to edit it later. There are actions to delete, re-build and edit fairings at any time in the editor.\n\u003E  Next up is implementing the actual jettisoning behavior for the panels, and also writing in the enclosure detection, which is already being handled by the cargo bay module. There is quite a bit of work still left to be done, but I dare say what we have is looking pretty good already. .\n\u003E \n\u003E  The fairings are very customizable via the part.cfg, so we can determine the number of panels, the amount (if any) of edge smoothing between panels of different angles, as well as a number of other parameters, on a per part basis. And yes, we are planning on a number of different sizes of fairing parts (at least covering 1.25m through 3.5m profiles).\n\nThis shouldn\u0027t really be a debate. You can have it separate however you want! You don\u0027t need to worry about potato chips.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nDon\u0027t rep me for this! I didn\u0027t find this!
