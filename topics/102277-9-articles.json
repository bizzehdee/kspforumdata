Hence, it seems it is not saving settings when switching vessels or going back to the Space Center. Installed via Ckan, version 0.5.3. Any ideas?\n\nEdit: Checking the PersistentRotation\\_\u0027Savename\u0027.cfg, it seems to write the values except for the relative body rotation, but isn\u0027t picking it up after switching back to the vessel.
