And now half the nation is in a rage over this, posting and spamming every single crevice with their disapproval of this happening. Meanwhile the regular watchers are in celebration and are all screaming about how good it is he was sent out of the show.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to sum it up the nation somehow got into a genuine storm over some god damn TV show about dancing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all truth it was all so, so, SO predictable, the show only invited the guy because they knew it would attract a lot of new viewers, hence more money, that much is obvious. And now that the whole thing has spiraled out of control they are trying to initiate damage control so the cash cow isn\u0027t killed by the football fans that wont watch a new season if some football icon isn\u0027t involved, that has since led to more chaos with even a police report being filled against TV-network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts almost too good to be true, but eh, I\u0027m just sitting on the sidelines enjoying the bonfire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow a more concrete reason for a thread, is the question; What kind animosity is it going to take to get in to a fit over a freaking TV-show that will be milked to eternity any way, and on the other side then get in to a fit when a simple joke is killed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know, I just wanted to share some funnies, have a good evening, morning, or what ever timezone you are in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-25T22:06:27Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2013 10:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMildly languagey.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Requiem762","CreatedById":82185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T19:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe network will probably milk the controversy as long as they can to keep interest in the show up and I feel they may try to do the same thing next season.
