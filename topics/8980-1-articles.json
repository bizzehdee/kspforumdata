Sorry, that probably means redesigning your ships! Drop the last boosters in the upper atmosphere, and use some of your descent module fuel for circularisation and Trans-Munar Injection. Or something similar. I like to leave intact descent modules landed on Mun; to me they\\\u0027re like little trophies and don\\\u0027t get in the way there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut an easy way to keep your sky clean is to time your launch so that you can burn straight into the transfer orbit. Just interrupt your gravity turn at 35 degrees or so, and then \u0027steady as she goes\u0027 until your apoapsis is 11.4M KM. (When we were playing the demo this was easy; Mun was always in the right place for immediate launch.) If you skip making the parking orbit, all your boosters and junk will have a periapsis of \u0027squish\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"randyrules711","CreatedById":13988,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-01T23:44:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJump from an active flight to a piece of junk you want to remove, then hit \\\u0027End Flight\\\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eldestish","CreatedById":19668,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-02T00:22:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are going to the mun another thing you can do is hang on to the engine you used to get you there and use it to slow you down on decent and let it hit the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-02T01:56:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou could just reduced the debris setting in the options.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
