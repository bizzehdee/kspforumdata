Also note the cuppola needs to drop -straight- on its top; if it comes down at even a slight angle then the bottom cylindrical collider will hit the pad and trigger the explosion.  Also try using -just- the cuppola module; other parts may interfere with the testing.\n\nWhat collider is indestructible -- any collider that is not set to the part.collider field; it only supports collisions for a single collider, and **only** if that collider was present on the prefab part.  As my modular parts are all setup in the editor, there is no collider on the prefab part, and as such they don\u0027t even have that single collider that will trigger explosions.\n\nNo, the impact resistance field does not effect this issue; setting it to 0.001 will not change the fact that the collisions are simply not being handled by the part.  In order for the impact resistance to matter the collision must first be passed to the part.handleCollision() method (which is where it checks impact velocity).  Sadly for these parts the part.checkCollision() method is returning false; meaning it does not think it needs to handle the collision.  As near as I can tell this is caused by it only checking for collisions vs. a single collider; the collider that is set in the part.collider field; any other colliders are ignored/rejected in the part.checkCollision method.  This is stock code that **I cannot**  **change**.  Until that bit of code is fixed I\u0027m afraid the modular parts will be indestructible.\n\nI\u0027ll do more testing on the cuppola/stock parts when I get home tonight.  When I was testing it on Friday/Saturday though I could drop the cuppola on its bottom and it would explode; but if I dropped it from the same height onto its top it did not explode.  When I added a debug module that monitored the explosions (to tell me what collider/impact velocity), I could tell that the collision -was- occurring, but the part was rejecting it for internal handling.\n\nSo basically, to fix this issue, one of two things need to happen to the stock code (preferably both...):  \n\n1.)  Remove the single-collider restriction.  \n\n2.)  Do not rely on the prefab part to have colliders on it; set the part.collider field from the part once it is active in the flight scene.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For the cupola, it need to hit the pad at over 17 m/s.

Even if it did, it would still only respond to collisions with that single collider that is referenced via the part.collider field.\n\nThe command pods are setup mostly like normal parts; thus the stock code sets up their collider (mostly) properly.  They also only use a single collider; so there is not really any chance for problems.\n\nAnyway, you are arguing a moot point.  It is a known issue, and it is already fixed in dev code (or at least as fixed as I will be able to get it given the silly stock stuff going on)(will be available whenever I post the next update); any further fixes will need to come from stock code."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T19:38:01Z","Content":"Gotcha, had it loaded up, so I figured I would test.

This is all code that was added/changed in the 1.1\u002B updates as this problem did not exist in 1.05;  in 1.05 **ALL** colliders properly triggered explosions, which is how it -**should**- still be (and **needs** to be).  (Really, this is not a problem that I should need to fix, or deal with, or even hear about; it is a problem with the stock implementation of colliders and needs to be fixed on their end; so if I sound frustrated... that is why... it is not my problem to fix).\n\nI\u0027ll still do some more investigation this evening to see if I can duplicate your results with the cuppola, provide some screenshots to show how the colliders are set up for many stock parts, and provide the logs/debug output to show how it is simply not handling collisions at all for colliders that are not the single collider that it is expecting.\n\nIn other more positive and far less frustrating news, I think I\u0027m working towards some decent \u0027tutorial\u0027 images for the modular parts (... just the fuel tanks so far);  very much a WIP -- have posted the album rather than specific images as I\u0027ll likely be updating the images more throughout the day.  Will likely make up a similar set for the Modular SRBs and Engine Clusters tailored to their customization options.   Yes, the lighting is a bit off between the nosecones/tanks/adapters -- I\u0027ll likely have to setup a more consistent lighting environment in the various files and re-render them all before I\u0027m done.

This is the collider that is referenced in the part.collider field.  With higher impact velocities you will often see \u0027punch through\u0027 for other (non-exploding) colliders where the part.collider will still make contact and register an explosion.\n\nBut, at the range of velocity below that needed for punch-through, these parts will simply not explode if they collide using the collider(s) that are not referenced in the part.collider field.  This is why the cuppola will -sometimes- explode at \u003E~17 ms/; the \u0027base collider\u0027 will still impact the launch pad.  Below ~17m/s only the top collider is involved and you can easily see that it is -not- triggering an explosion properly.  If none of this makes sense, please go read up on video game physics engines to see how velocity is integrated and how collision checks are done (hint: it is because of discrete update \u0027ticks\u0027 or \u0027frames\u0027); it -will- make sense when you are done learning.\n\nThis can only be seen on a handfull of stock parts; all other parts have only a single collider:\n\n- Cuppola; this is the only one with a low enough impact velocity that it actually matters in-play; all others have a high enough impact velocity that they will always \u0027punch-through\u0027 and have their part.collider trigger explosions\n- Mk3 cockpit -- the top window area on the cockpit will not trigger explosions (50m/s impact tolerance; punch through always occurs at these speeds and it will still explode)\n- Mk2 Cargo Bays -- doors will not trigger explosions (50m/s impact tolerance; punch through always occurs at these speeds and it will still explode)\n- Mk3 Cargo Bays -- doors will not trigger explosions (50m/s impact tolerance; punch through always occurs at these speeds and it will still explode)\n- Service Modules -- doors will not trigger explosions (high impact tolerance; punch through always occurs at these speeds and it will still explode)\n\n![uAeMyBS.png](http://i.imgur.com/uAeMyBS.png)\n\n![VTaZQTp.png](http://i.imgur.com/VTaZQTp.png)\n\n![RtcB4a9.png](http://i.imgur.com/RtcB4a9.png)\n\nAs you can see the cuppola impacts the pad but does not explode at ~32m/s impact speed as long as it lands on the top.\n\nNow, this does not happen 100% of the time; this is due to a complex interaction of velocities, impact speed, and the precise physics update sequence.  Sometimes the \u0027base\u0027 collider for the cuppola will still impact the pad and trigger the explosion (known as punch though; well technically the top collider is punching through...).  But -- if only the top collider is involved it will -not explode-.\n\n    [LOG 17:40:23.891] On Collision Enter for part: cupola\n    [LOG 17:40:23.892] part.collider = collider_base (UnityEngine.MeshCollider)\n    [LOG 17:40:23.892] Collider Hit: Launch Pad (UnityEngine.MeshCollider)\n    [LOG 17:40:23.893] Contact  Colliders: collider_top (UnityEngine.MeshCollider) :: Launch Pad (UnityEngine.MeshCollider)\n    [LOG 17:40:23.893] Collision speed 16.02857\n    [LOG 17:40:23.894] Part check collision: False\n\nThe \u0027important\u0027 part of that log is the last line -- \u0027Part check collision: False\u0027 line;  this means that I manually passed the collision data to the part and it rejected it as \u0027not colliding\u0027 (or at least should not trigger an explosion) even though the impact velocity is obviously higher than the parts crash tolerance rating.  Note how the cuppola collider involved in the contact point info is not the collider in the part.collider reference.  THIS is the root of the problem.  If I manually pass the collision data to part.handleCollision (bypassing the part.checkCollision() method) the part will properly explode; this is how I know that the issue is in the part.checkCollision method, and that it is for some reason rejecting valid collisions.\n\nNow, as a workaround, I have added a generic collision handler to SSTU parts that will properly trigger a collision/explosion regardless of what collider is involved.  However, please not that **this is a stock problem with their implementation of collisions and only allowing a single collider for any part to trigger explosions** **, and that this solution is a hacky workaround at best.**  Until the issue is fixed in stock there may well be some... oddities... involved.

Using LH2 instead of LFO also increases tank sizes, so ships look pretty realistic. It\u0027s not THAT bad.\n\nYou could ofcourse add 30 tons of ore to the payload so you need more fuel/thrust, haha."},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T15:47:34Z","Content":"There\u0027s also a lot of system rescale mods out there.

Quite a convoluted, painful, illogical, and inefficient process.  But at the end of it all I had a few new blank pages displaying in the KSPedia.\n\nNow I just need to come up with the content for them.  Current intent is to use the promo/tutorial stuff that I had posted earlier in the week (cleaned up of course) for several of the pages.  Will have brief tutorials explaining the functions of the MFT/MUS tanks, engine clusters, and a few of the other modular parts.  A few pages will be dedicated to details for the ship-core parts, lander-core parts, and other XXX-core stuff as it becomes available (station, base, probe, rover).\n\nHow detailed should I get with some of this information?  For example, should I create a separate page for each engine detailing its stats and intended purpose, or just leave that up to the currently available in-editor part tooltip info?  How much data is needed regarding the ShipCore parts?\n\nAnything else you guys would like to see added in for tutorials or informational pages?\n\nShould (hopefully) have the first of these pages available with this weekends\u0027 update.\n\nOn the subject of upcoming updates:\n\nI\u0027m hoping that this weekends\u0027 update will mark the transition into the \u0027public stable\u0027 release branch.  The number of bug reports coming in is pretty low, and they are mostly cosmetic or interface enhancement bugs, so I feel that the mod is in a pretty good state currently.  The balance is mostly where I would like it;  I *might* take another look at the ShipCore part stats (mass/delta-v) and make them a bit more \u0027sane\u0027 for stock setups... but honestly any large changes there would merely diverge them further from \u0027scaled stats\u0027 (e.g. you would end up with huge and heavy parts with very little fuel in them);  they are pretty good at their 40% mass scaling factor, though of course they seem overpowered compared to the massively overweight stock parts (srsly, why does the mk1-2 pod have a mass \u003E 4t ? did they use lead for the bulkheads?).\n\nIf/when I switch over to the \u0027stable\u0027 releases I\u0027ll start up a second branch on the repository for the future dev/testing/pre-release builds and will start using the save-upgrade-process to hopefully maintain compatibility with prior \u0027stable\u0027 builds whenever possible (sometimes things will still get broken, but should be much less often).\n\nFor a few weeks after the initial stable release is available I\u0027ll be doing maintenance and bug-fixing only;  I\u0027ve got a bit of a project on my hands regarding creating a new wheel collider component which I expect may take a few weeks/month or so before it is even usable.  Have been putting it off for a couple weeks now so that I could wrap things up with SSTU, but need to start working on it in earnest."},{"CreatedByName":"Drakenex","CreatedById":114246,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T19:42:20Z","Content":"Do you plan to add the umbilical port to the Orion capsule?\n\n![Zf67IbG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Zf67IbG.jpg)\n\nJust a suggestion, don\u0027t be mad! thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T19:54:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 minutes ago, Drakenex said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Do you plan to add the umbilical port to the Orion capsule?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just a suggestion, don\u0027t be mad! thanks!\n\u003E \n\nNope; in fact I had it on earlier versions models (from KSP 0.90-\u003E~1.02) and removed it.
