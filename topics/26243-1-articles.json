Jeb is tickled pin...er green at being on Mun in one piece and went for a nice EVA. After fully exhausting his jet-pack investigating a crater he posed for a few mug shots near his craft, the K.R.A.L.K mkII (Kerbal Rescue and Lander Kraft). Next is a return to Kerbin, hopefully there is enough fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis kraft is part lander, part rescue pod manned by a single Kerbal with room to pickup 4 more. No docking ports on this model. The 4 LV-N engines and bottom fuel tanks eject after re-entry and the Rockmax 24-77 radial engines are there to provide retro thrust so the Hitchhiker can doesn\u0027t explode on impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t attempted a return flight yet, it was enough to land on the Mun tonight. Although I have tested re-entry on previous failed attempts and the top portion will float or land successfully on its legs as long as you slow down enough. 4 parachutes on the top helps to reduce the over-all speed of the kraft but not quite enough to survive a landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took a few shots of the flight, an evening launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/10m6X#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/10m6X#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking forward to more landings, maybe Minmus next.
