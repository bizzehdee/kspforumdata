There are several prime desert locations on kerbin, and at night it\\\u0027s mostly not cloudy (leading meteorologists are still discussing what a \\\u0027cloud\\\u0027 is, since none of them have ever seen one in the wild), so all that\\\u0027s needed is the expertise to pull off such a stunt. This is where you come in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge is, essentially, somehow take a lunar lander and/or rover to a desert or beach somewhere on kerbin, and make a fake lunar landing video using the stuff there.
