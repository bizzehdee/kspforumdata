That will begin to form an orbit around the Mun. Make sure you don\\\u0027t go sub orbital! Circularise your orbit by burning at the apoapsis/periapsis, and there you have an orbit! If you have enough fuel, you can now choose a good Mun landing site!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radzaarty","CreatedById":26678,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T09:45:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe craft is in the attached file \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radzaarty","CreatedById":26678,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T09:46:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd thank-you very much for the info!
