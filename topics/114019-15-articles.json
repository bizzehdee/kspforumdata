I have lots of crazy Pics done... \n\nI had a bad high speed sideways stalling event in the last round while trimming the plane by pumping fuel around and fine trimming the pitch... more than 20g brakedown from 1500m/s to 700m/s... i was shocked... but luckily the plane was still stable and heading front ahead...![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)\n\nok, this is a slightly enhanced Mk3 plane, same thing, just changed the landinggear and added more wingtip and a rudder for additional pitch and roll authority.
