(the light wasn\u0027t good enough for a picture when *Alouette* was docked). I played for a while after taking this picture, and after two docks of *Alouette* and one of *Kranefly* there are about 20,000 units (100 tons) of oxidant in the M7. The OX is the rate-limiting step, as *Kranefly* can carry a huge amount of LF from the surface but only about 9 tons of OX plus 15 tons of ore. *Mortingale* is in Eve orbit and will be at Gilly in five days, by which time I think the M7 will be full.\n\nIt\u0027s actually surprisingly fun for me to grind this out rather than just \u0022take it as read\u0022 and hyperedit to full tanks.
