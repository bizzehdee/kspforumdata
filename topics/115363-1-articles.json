I\u0027d love to be able to point the camera at it from the surface, zoom in with Camera Tools and see planets/moons transiting. Right now tho that all gets drawn over by the textures\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nSo thx to removing the asset files I can lose the glare and flare the blocks any planets/moons that are in the immediate area of the sun. However there\u0027s still the bright texture that blots out the central part of the sun I\u0027d like to see removed as well, as it removes features of the sun like sunspots from direct view. I saw in KittopiaSpace folder from KittopiaTech a glow.png texture that I modified to be fully transparent but that didn\u0027t have an effect\n\n[![fBG5rdKm.png](http://i.imgur.com/fBG5rdKm.png)](http://i.imgur.com/fBG5rdK.png) [![fJGc0mcm.png](http://i.imgur.com/fJGc0mcm.png)](http://i.imgur.com/fJGc0mc.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T20:17:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 08:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaiiden**"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T03:03:09Z","Content":"you could delete the sharedassets file,but I have no idea which one it is.

More information could be found in the old Universe Replacer thread If you feel up to it. (someone in that thread posted an alternate sunflare texture and included a decompiler).\n\nUnfortunately that\u0027s the best I can do off of memory, good luck with the edit!"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T05:20:36Z","Content":"thx for the suggestions guys.

By removing the whole file, you\u0027re also losing Eve.mat, Jool.mat, Kerbin.mat, LoadingBackground.mat, 04\\_jool.tex, 02\\_eve.tex, LoadingBackground.tex, 03\\_Kerbin.tex, and about 10 other assets that the game uses.\n\nSo I\u0027d imagine there are several spots in your game (though you may not have noticed them yet) that are missing backgrounds and textures. There\u0027s also some AUDIO in that .assets file that you are losing."},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T20:18:39Z","Content":"Updated the OP with one more issue I\u0027d like to fix - central sun glare that blots out the sunspots"},{"CreatedByName":"boomfox","CreatedById":189577,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-11T12:27:22Z","Content":"What do if \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia, serif;\u0022\u003ECORON\u003Cstrong\u003EA don\u0027t go with sun\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E **i have mod otherworlds and why i have 4 suns 2 suns 2 coronas how clean it? ksp version 1.3.0**"}]}
