The main one is that its algorithm seems a bit picky about the orbit you start in. Generally it seems to prefer somewhere around 100-150km. It works for higher orbits but uses a lot of excess fuel, but it has great difficulty with lower orbits. Besides this, it doesn\u0027t like to use parachutes at all unless that\u0027s the only way to get slow enough to avoid a crash. If it can land without using the parachutes, it will, even you tell it give it permission to use the chutes. I assume this is because it is, after all, trying to hit a precise point on the ground and wants to maintain control as long as possible. But this becomes an issue for you if you designed your lander to rely on the chutes for landing to save fuel for taking off again afterwards, because MJ will use fuel instead of chutes on the descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as to your problem with MJ saying its doing the de-orbit burn but nothing actually happens, this is because the landing engine isn\u0027t activated. The usual cause of this problem is not having the lander engine in the same stage as the decoupler below it, so you have to hit spacebar twice, once to drop the stage and again to activate the lander engine. If you only hit spacebar once, the engine won\u0027t be activated and MJ won\u0027t turn it on by itself. So either you have to hit space again or right-click on the engine and select the activate option. Then MJ will use the lander engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve got the engine turned on MJ has another little quirk. It will never finish a deorbit burn until it hits the atmosphere or gets below a certain altitude on an airless world. Instead, it will constantly burn at minimum throttle all the way from where the burn started to the edge of the atmosphere, saying it\u0027s doing a course correction of like 0.1m/s. This makes the landing process take a huge amount of time (no warping during this) and burn more fuel than you\u0027d like. But if you use MJ for landing, you\u0027ve got to deal with this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T00:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the fantastic advice in the rest of the thread, MJ has trouble with really low and really high TWRs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe high TWR (over 4 ish) will give it trouble with the fine-tuning burns.

The biggest problem I have with MJ\u0027s landing at the moment is that it over-does its deorbit burn (at Kerbin) by 20-200km short of the target and then wastes time and fuel turning prograde to correct it (abort and re-issue fixes that too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*actually, this happens so much that once the ship\u0027s nearing full-deployment altitude (ie; 500m for normal chutes) I \u0022abort auto-land\u0022 then tell MJ to \u0022land somewhere\u0022 once they are safely open]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T02:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it refuses to open the chutes if you\u0027re going (or will be going) above ~105 m/s (Kerbin landing) to prevent chute tear-off.
