This requires you to zoom your camera again and drag the frame around to search for your Kerbal in order to see him or her again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pre-release phase seems like a good time to change this camera behavior if many others find it as annoying as I do. It seems like the better option is to reorient the camera so that it always shows the Kerbal from behind and at the previous zoom level, or simply not shift the camera at all. It would also be helpful for the camera not to zoom out again after boarding the craft as well (which is especially annoying after boarding command chairs on rovers.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone else see this as a problem? Is it worth adding to the bug tracker?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-15T17:36:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFocusing behind the kerbal when they leave on EVA sounds pretty obvious to me.\u00A0 Not sure it\u0027s even worth the bug tracker -- it\u0027s kind of a no-brainer that people would want it.\u00A0 It\u0027s not always that easy to determine what \u0022behind\u0022 means in all situations.\u00A0 If your ship\u0027s a stack of 5 tanks, relatively easy, if it\u0027s not, how to get a view that doesn\u0027t obscure your kerbal?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot zooming when they board could be a problem -- the camera view is always fixed on \u003Cstrong\u003Esomething\u003C/strong\u003E, and when they board, the something ceases to exist.\u00A0 1.2 supposedly is a step towards allowing you to focus on part of a craft though, which sounds close to what you want if not quite.\u00A0 Focus on the cockpit / chair when they board, rather than the center of mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEVA uses a different camera mode and flight model, too, which may be forcing the switch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-15T17:37:46Z\u0022 title=\u002209/15/2016 05:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Corona688\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
