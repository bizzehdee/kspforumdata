You, my dear sir, have never heard of the charity events the brony fandom organises in order to spread the virtues the show promotes. They give things to charity, help in soup kitchens, make donations and just all around volunteer to do good deeds. If that is not a way in which the mere presence of MLP has contributed at least something to society, then I don\u0027t know what is. The only people it has proven immature is the masses of people who can\u0027t shut up about how much they hate everything MLP related and who constantly whine about how bad it is instead of doing the mature thing, which is acknowledging that they don\u0027t like the show and moving on with their life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the creepiness factor, a lot of adults like Adventure Time, the Transformers, TMNT and Kirby, all of which have been developed for and marketed to children, but are still widely enjoyed by children and adults everywhere. So, no, I do not find it creepy that a group of full-grown men like a thing originally meant for children. If you are going to make a comment on pornography, I shall remind you in advance about the infamous rule 34, which states that mere existance of the item dictates the coexistance of pornography of that item. No exceptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing about MLP leaking over to other things that were \u0022completely fine without it\u0022 are mostly limited only to bronies who happen to enjoy that thing as well and also has no effect on anyone but them. Not to mention that joining two items of popular culture has been a mainstay of popular culture for a long before MLP came around. Look at all the things Star Trek has spread into with fan fictions, drawings et all over the last half a century of its existance. Take another look at comic books wherein crossovers are incredibly popular and happen incredibly often, to much joy or dismay of some of the fans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for you taking comfort that you have a higher IQ level and are more mature than your average brony: Just by claiming that you are smarter than a person who takes no shame in enjoying what they like you have proven that you are, in fact, not mature at all. The fact that you have a higher IQ has been denied by your obvious lack of research into the topic and the tendency to make grand, sweeping statements, most of which are incorrect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T18:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m disgusted by the macho mentality and the advertising of gore and all that stupid crap that\u0027s the industry trying to label as \u0022male\u0022, but not only I find bronies a bit odd, but exactly \u0022people with sanity problems\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cartoon is tailored for small children and is tailored for small female children, where \u0022female\u0022 stands for the gender, not the sex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the stuff is made for the stereotype of little girls.
