This would be useful, and consistent as you can already disable things on rover wheels. In the meantime, FAR allows you to specify for what purposes you want to use a control surface. The downside is it overhauls the aerodynamics model, which I guess isn\u0027t really a downside but it does make a lot of pre-existing rockets that work fine in stock KSP fail... So really it\u0027s up to you how badly you want this feature. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spectrhz","CreatedById":69106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T16:28:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes!
