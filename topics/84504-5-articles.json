If they\u0027re deployed really high up then you\u0027d expect them to fall faster than they would, but otherwise they\u0027d fall straight down. Probably only a few kilometers different there as well, the error being from Kerbin rotating less than it should(so it\u0027d \u0022land\u0022 East of where it would if it was followed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConceivably it would be possible to do that (override the KSP behavior), but it wouldn\u0027t be easy. It would be simpler to draw the trajectory and some symbol on it even after the vessel is destroyed, but keep the vessel in memory to then spawn on the surface. You\u0027d have to stop drawing the vessel as soon as it hits atmosphere though (it\u0027s not destroyed until about 22km) since the trajectory provided by KSP doesn\u0027t account for air resistance (obviously).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027d be too much for me, personally, as semi-realistic landing zones are more of a novelty for a stage recovery mod than a requirement. If you really wanted to tackle that and add stage recovery features into this, that would be an awesome way of doing it though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-18T17:02:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mandelbrot\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mandelbrot\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe reverse descent issue is known and they are planning a fix for 1.0, just so you know.

The mod should do nothing in this state. Another test you could do is download version 0.2.0, which disables prediction completely when you\u0027re not on the map view (unless you\u0027ve set a target impact point). If you still have performance issues in this situation, I would tend to think it\u0027s not related to Trajectories.
