The station itself is ofcourse not further funded, and will become EOL at some point as onboard hardware will start to decay. I understand all that, including that many of the scientific experiments have already been done in LEO, so at some point theres little use for having a orbital science station in LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLuckily theres still SpaceX, russian, japanese and european missions intended to go to the ISS before the stations demise, so theres still time for plenty of experiments.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know these decisions are based on political and economic reasons, and at any point theres little use in discussing the science behind these decisions as it\u0027s not always scientific reasoning that determines decisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe STS is EOL and theres no transport system, or rocket to further supply the ISS with heavy hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill I\u0027m annoyed by the attitude that is \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Something is no longer usefull, oh dammit, let\u0027s just take the sucker out of the sky\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ISS, ladies and gentlemen is a artificial monument, and at some point in the future will be regarded as a museum piece. A sample of one of the first megastructures ever assembled into space, a stepping stone off artificial creation that contributed scientific progression to future manned pressence in the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the attitude that is represented by political and economical decision making is that of barbarian goths, that set flame to the collosseum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the ISS is on a decaying orbit, and yes theres little use for it at some point. But I would like mankind, or more specifically the people in charge of the spaceprograms to show a little more respect for their own achievements. Instead of letting the ISS decay or be de-orbitted, launch 1 or 2 rockets up their, be it american, european or whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese rockets could have ION thrusters on them, and put the ISS in a higher more stable orbit so people can still admire the ISS in the next few thousand years.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust like I can still admire the Collosseum when I take a trip to Rome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI kinda wished the Mir space station would have had the same fate, but the fall off the soviet union was mostly responsible for that. Maybe current economic mayhem in all countries across the world are causing the same decisions to be made by which the Mir suffered a ocean splash down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill I think you could atleast put a few more billion in the project so this project can endure as a monument for atleast a few more millenia.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI like seeing the ISS zip through the sky, and I expect to still see it by the year 2030.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe pressence of the ISS still reminds people that there really is a pressence in Earths orbit, especially a contribution to the people ignorant and usually in denial about human pressence in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few weeks ago, I had one of those guys that didn\u0027t believe in spaceflight and debunked the apollo missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI always have real issues to maintain my nerves in the presence of these people, atleast it wasn\u0027t a bad person.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I invited him for drinks and dinner and the ISS was about to fly over my region during sunset. I gave him my binoculars and told him where to look.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince then his views one human pressence in space changed for the good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still expect to evolve peoples consciousness about spaceflight just for this reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is your opinion about the fate of the ISS?\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd would you like to see the ISS be brought into a higher orbit, and how and by whom would you like to see it done?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr you don\u0027t want to see the ISS remain in orbit, perhaps for very valid reasons besides politics and economics?, please share.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-16T11:50:36Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2016 11:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporized Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-16T11:51:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that it doesn\u0027t create a debris field.

While a lot of the technologies are well understood, using them in a space-station is not so well understood.\u00A0Like all complex machines,\u00A0the older it gets, the more it breaks down.\u00A0Many parts were custom-made and are irreplaceable, such as the reaction wheels of which they now have no spares working. (IIRC, if one more fails then the ISS will be dependant on reaction thrusters for some of its attitude control and will start to use excessive amounts of fuel.) At some point it is going to become unfeasible to keep it working. Another example is\u00A0the solar sails:\u00A0These were over-specified when they were fitted (quite a lot of the time some are \u0022parked\u0022 not facing the sun)\u00A0but are slowly losing generating capacity due to micro-meteor strikes and radiation damage to semiconductors.Eventually they will cease to generate enough power to run the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are also some political problems. The ISS was created by an international agreement with Russia for it to use some of their modules. This agreement is NOT open-ended, and the Russians have already expressed an interest in separating their modules once the agreement ends and using them as the core of their own space-station. At that point NASA has to provide a new thrust system or decommission the ISS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, the ISS is\u00A0an experiment. It, like previous space-stations, is a testbed for technologies and techniques.
