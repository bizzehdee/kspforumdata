This is much better than my first attempt but seems to have its own set of problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I really like the idea I have here, but the execution is proving problematic. The idea is that the fuselage of the shuttle is made from fuel tanks, and these feed the engine below. Any fuel not used on mission can be burned off before/during re-entry, then the engine detached. With the dry tanks the glider should be fairly light and (hopefully) controllable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObservations and problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I seem to have plenty enough thrust and fuel to get to orbit. This isn\\\u0027t a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Massive problem 1: It\\\u0027s stable enough (with ASAS) to go up just fine. But something is making it flip if you so much as try to turn slightly to get to orbit. I\\\u0027m thinking it\\\u0027s either the wings or the top-heavy nature of the craft. Can fix by lowering thrust quite a lot while turning but this presumably mess up orbiting attempts and is terribly inefficient anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Massive problem 2: Since the engine is made to drop off along with unnecessary RCS/RCS fuel/ASAS the fuel doesn\\\u0027t flow, and since the engine is direcly below, I can\\\u0027t seem to get a direct line of sight for the fuel duct. This is annoying. Can I reroute the fuel through say, the wings? I don\\\u0027t want to move the tanks because they are the crux of what makes this design pretty neat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Maybe the best idea is to use less RCS thrusters (there are so many from when the craft was so unstable that it needed them just to remain stable), swap the ASAS for a SAS and put an ASAS between the coupler and tricoupler and put the engine directly underneath the fuel tanks. I don\\\u0027t really like this idea since I\\\u0027d probably need bigger wings and thus more thrust and more stability tinkering. Also that is the boring way out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. It\\\u0027s still pretty unstable, even with all those struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Maybe I should move the wings forward a bit? dunno. Can\\\u0027t test the glider until I can get the fuel out of the tanks anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I would like some suggestions from my fellow engineers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Knyght","CreatedById":22035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T19:11:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, woops. apparently you can re-route fuel through the wings.

It took me a little bit to understand the wings of the shuttle were affect the craft as a whole despite being under power from below.
