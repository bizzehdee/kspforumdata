Such an idea would make sense if we were a part of a large community/group of planets, we would need something to represent our planet, but we haven\u0027t yet discovered even another planet with sentient, complex life and societies on it, so there is no need for such an invention. And if we\u0027d ever need one, I\u0027d say that the UN logo on a flag would be sufficient. Also, how does does a symbol comprised of a circle of circles represent Earth or remind us to \u0022take care of each other\u0022? I think seeing pictures and film of average people in other places around the world and their daily lives would inspire people to care more for others than a simple flag. The flag has a detailed explanation as to how it represents Earth, but shouldn\u0027t symbols on a flag that might be seen by other beings who might have a totally different conception of language than we do be self-explaining and self-evident? In addition to the UN logo (or potentially replacing the UN logo) another flag design might just be a simplified map of the world; There would be very little, if any bickering between nations about what design to use and the flag would represent Earth very literally without any sort of incredibly well-hidden or designer-formulated symbolism that might mean something totally different to somebody else.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T01:37:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 01:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAddendum\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T02:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got some pretty awesome flag designs i found, they are perfect for a united earth flag:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Earth_Flag.svg/2000px-Earth_Flag.svg.png\u0022 alt=\u00222000px-Earth_Flag.svg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cache.desktopnexus.com/thumbseg/195/195305-bigthumbnail.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022195305-bigthumbnail.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFFFFF;\u0022\u003E(I\u0027m joking pls don\u0027t hurt me)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T02:38:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebest flag ever ... i just hesitate a little ; ) wich one to pick out and throw in the queries results ( because it\u0027s a we le\u0027ave it premise promise \u0026amp; \u002B\u002B \u0026amp; \u002B\u002B; )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CAXIQOM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CAXIQOM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T02:52:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WinkAllKerb\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Enice one fish ; ) btw\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T03:29:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think a global flag is a fantastic idea!
