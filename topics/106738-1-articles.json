The directly attached engine was much better, with its heat seemingly being dumped into the tank and dissipated well from there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good solution also seems to be to use stack couplers. Before 1.0 I didn\u0027t use them because they were heavy and you could do a better job with some Cubic Octagonal Struts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere the temp of the engines in the same time reached 820 and rising. So better than the other part-based attachment methods, with the coupler and tank dissipating heat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U8ENObM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022U8ENObM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the best way I\u0027ve found so far to manage heat (other than straight onto a coupling point) is like this. The temp only got to 640...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7x81g9i.png\u0022 alt=\u00227x81g9i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you are going to run nukes for a long time then I\u0027d suggest the following order as best for avoiding the engines blowing up through overheating:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Directly attach to tank(s) coupling point. If you have, say, four engines then use four smaller tanks rather one big one to give four direct attachment points. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Radially attach the engines to the side of a big tank with small tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Use a stack coupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Use Cubic Octagonal Struts or BZ-52 Radial Attachment Points only if you must, as the temp could reach exploding point on a really long burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T00:55:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 12:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
