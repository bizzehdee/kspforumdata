He\u0027ll file a report about whatever region of the Mun you are flying over, such as the Northwest Crater. These reports are valuable (24 points each IIRC) and you can collect a number of them in a single orbit, just go back inside your ship to store the report and come back out to take more observations when you pass over a new area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Also the barometer won\u0027t do anything on the Mun, though it can take readings in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere (not worth very much though).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkStar","CreatedById":37056,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T02:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA couple things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Go to Minmus and land there. It\u0027s much easier than the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Bring both the goo container and the 1m science part (that is the same shape as the short 1m fuel tank). Also, make sure to use the crew report feature and to use the EVA reports (you aren\u0027t limited to one per mission for EVA reports; they just have to be for different spots). Also, visit Kerbin\u0027s different biomes. Finally, make sure to unlock more science parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. It\u0027s for upper stages that need lots fuel and for landers.

The Goo container, Crew Reports, Barometer and Thermometer will give you some science but most of your science is going to come from the 3 bolded sources. Very late in the tech tree you\u0027ll get the Seismic Accelerometer and Negative Gravioli Detector which return a lot of science as well as the Sensor Array Computing Nose Cone which is situational.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T03:37:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fat tank can be fit with multiple engines underneath. Some structural components (docking ports, for instance) can be fit to the bottom in circular patterns, as opposed to how most parts only fit to the attachment point in the middle. Unfortunately, there aren\u0027t very many structural components that attach in this fashion and you may not have unlocked any yet. The ones I know of off the top of my head: docking ports, radial attachment points, and some of the girders.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T04:53:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Modular Girder Adapter (a Starting Tech part) can fit under the big tank in the manner thereaverofdarkness mentioned; it\u0027s useful if you plop one down in the center and then four radially as far out as you can manage; stick an LV-T40 under the central beam and then LV-T30s on the outboard beams -1060 kN of thrust with good steering authority.

Make your gravity turn headed north or south instead of east. You should have enough fuel to attain orbit and deorbit later. When you\u0027re in orbit, take EVA reports; in a polar orbit, you should be able to cover most of the entire planet of Kerbin while it rotates underneath you. The EVA reports are good early science earners. Of course, if you\u0027ve unlocked Basic Rocketry, you should by all means stick a Stack Decoupler between the pod and the tanks, but you can return safely without it (just expect to lose the engine and about five or six of the fuel tanks when you land).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T09:02:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first large engine you get is designed for vacuum use only, so it not surprising that it (or the medium engines) can\u0027t lift the larger tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can however strap solid rocket boosters to the outside (not the underside) of the large tank using radial decouplers to get it off the ground. Even better than solid fuel boosters are liquid fuel boosters, which are basically just a medium tank with a medium engine like the LV-T30 underneath. Since a LV-T30 has easily enough thrust to lift its own tank, it can help lift the underpowered center tank. And if you have 4-8 of these boosters all around it, that\u0027s a lot of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour problem is basically solved by \u0022moar boosters!!!\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
