I would try creating a shortcut to KSP.exe and adding \u0022-force-opengl\u0022 at the end of the target field in the shortcuts properties and/or compress those clouds or use smaller resolutions. You can run the PNGs through a quick compressor like [Pngyu](http://nukesaq88.github.io/Pngyu/) and see if that along with using OpenGL works out for you."},{"CreatedByName":"SamFS","CreatedById":147658,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T19:54:06Z","Content":"Could you please explain how to edit the shortcut and unrelated question but could you explaing what hitting the memory cap means?"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T20:28:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Could you please explain how to edit the shortcut\n\nAs per [the instructions from this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84203-Less-memory-usage-by-using-OpenGL):\n\n\u003E \n\u003E * * *\n\u003E **If you use Steam**, simply right-click Kerbal Space Program in your Library, click \u0022Set launch options...\u0022 and put in \u0022-force-opengl\u0022. You have to start the game out of steam (or the start menu) for this to work, if you start the KSP.exe manually it will ignore your Steam launch options!\n\u003E **Otherwise, or if you don\u0027t want to start through Steam,** open your Kerbal Space Program folder, right-click KSP.exe, select \u0022Create shortcut\u0022, and put \u0022-force-opengl\u0022 in the \u0022Target\u0022 field *after* the quotation marks, with a blank in between. You can now put that shortcut where you need it, e.g. onto your desktop.\n\u003E \n\u003E Alternatively, if you want to start KSP through the start menu, right-click on Kerbal Space Program in there, and put the \u0022-force-opengl\u0022 at the end of the \u0022target\u0022-field, again with a blank in between. (This does not work if you have the Steam version, as the start menu link then links to Steam)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E and unrelated question but could you explaing what hitting the memory cap means?\n\n - KSP uses the Unity game engine.\n\n - Even if you have 16GB RAM in total, Unity (32-bit) can use only up to 3.5GB of RAM before it crashes\n\n - The EVE Clouds pack plugin uses up a lot of memory, and in conjunction with lots of other mods, will cause the game to reach the 3.5GB memory \u0022cap\u0022 before it can load properly, hence the crash\n\nYou have the following solutions:\n\n - Force KSP to run on OpenGL to reduce memory usage\n\n - Get [Active Texture Management](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-1-0-Release-5-0-April-28-2015-Active-Texture-Management-Save-RAM!) to further reduce memory usage\n\n - Don\u0027t use too many mods"}]}
