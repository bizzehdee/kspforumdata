The engine seems to fail to notice this speed, and only takes into account the speed of the center of mass (though the speed is slightly different further from the center of mass). Then at some point the kerbals always seem to let the ship go. (Already happens at really slow roll manoeuvres). Solution I found is to either watch it and grab the ladder/move around the ladder constantly so it updates the position of the kerbal more often, or just ignore it and use the eva controlls to move back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T15:02:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that Kerbals on ladders have a really annoying bug: they \u0022drift\u0022 (slowly move along the ladder), and if left uncorrected, they\u0027ll eventually drift off the end of the ladder and let go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not just when the craft is tumbling, either-- I get this for craft that are quite stationary, and even when the craft is landed on the surface of a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not consistent from situation to situation. Sometimes they don\u0027t drift. Sometimes they drift up, sometimes down. Sometimes it\u0027s a slow drift, sometimes it\u0027s faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, for a given situation (i.e. \u0022this particular ship, parked here, with this kerbal\u0022), it stays consistent: e.g. \u0022Okay, I\u0027m landed here on the Mun, and every time I go EVA on this ladder my kerbal drifts upwards.\u0022 Re-entering and leaving the pod doesn\u0027t fix the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an infuriatingly annoying bug, it\u0027s been around since forever, and I wish they\u0027d fix it.
