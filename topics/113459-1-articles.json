However this time I pulled out those refreshed deltav maps and summed up the deltav for trip to the mun around 5050. However I am not sure that the correct way of founding deltav from mun to Kerbin is to again sum up all number from mun to kerbin so it will he again 5050 of deltav to and 5050 from mun. Of course I didn\u0027t put that deltav on my rescue ship simply becouse before I did trips from mun and experience told me that when I burn from mun orbit prograde at the side of the mun that faces Kerbin the manuver node to bring Kerbin Pe is couple of houndreds only. So clearly I am missing something here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T23:15:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re missing that you can aerocapture/aerobrake at Kerbin.

Takes 580 to go back to orbit. (Excluding user error and safety issues.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo think about what you are reversing. The first 310 m/s is circularization at the Mun from a Kerbin to Mun transfer orbit. Thus reversing the 310 just puts you back on a LKO-Mun transfer orbit. Imagine doing the capture burn at the Mun, turning around, and immediately burning 310 m/s in the opposite direction. You would be back on the orbit that brought you to the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo burning 310 from LMO does not put you in a LKO, but it can get you back close to Kerbin on a Mun-to-Kerbin transfer orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere to slow you down, you can erase most or all of the 860 to turn a Mun-to-Kerbin transfer orbit into a LKO orbit, and most or all of the launch cost as well.
