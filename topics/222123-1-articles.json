But it would be nice if we had a mod that allowed us to warp to a specific day (for precision transfer window) and also allow us to warp to sunrise in ksp 1. On top of that kerbal alarm clock would be great, which i would assume being able to timewarp to a specific day would help the alarm clock work\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capran","CreatedById":65692,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-27T19:38:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Alarm Clock would also be a welcome mod!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"meckryl","CreatedById":231921,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-31T20:38:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022231921\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9547038579\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/222369-alarm-clock-mod-020/?do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea of having a convenient \u0022warp to sunrise\u0022 is a good one, and the existing framework for my alarm clock mod can definitely handle it.
