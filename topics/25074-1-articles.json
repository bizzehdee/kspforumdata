I have seen it before and basically it\u0027s parts you can add to two ships, and once their docked you can turn them on to make a physical Strut between them. I prefer using the Quantum Struts mod myself. the blue laser lights look better IMHO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T06:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are Strut Guns from the Quantum Struts pack.
