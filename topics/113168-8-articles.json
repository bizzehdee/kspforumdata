Why? It looks like Squad will be getting money for very little extra work: Flying Tiger are doing the hard work of porting the game, and Squad will get dosh for licensing the game to them. (Though we don\u0027t know the exact details, so my exact wording may not be legally appropriate.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is only good for KSP.

My first response is a knee-jerk reaction that I\u0027m very concerned because I really don\u0027t like what console gaming has done to PC gaming. BUT (with another cup of tea and some reflection) what I don\u0027t like about the console impact on PC gaming are things like button-mash boss fights and scripted player movements, which actually don\u0027t apply to KSP at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am still concerned that a move towards console support will result in a simpler control set a and overall dumbing down of the game. But so long as the console version doesn\u0027t require that the PC version is altered to fit the console then I\u0027m ok with it. So long as the PC version\u0027s interface is still designed around mouse\u002Bkeyboard and not changed to be a console interface that is then mapped to M\u0026amp;K controls then it should be ok. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy worry about the game being made simpler is not so much for the flight control (I can see how that would work ok as it is on a controller), I\u0027m more worried about the building interface. I\u0027m struggling to see how the current building interface will be enjoyable on a controller and that worries me that it will get simplified and more constrained. But I\u0027m not a console player (at all) so maybe I\u0027m not seeing how that will work. So long as we can still be as free in craft building as we are now to put things exactly where we want and make utterly insane designs then I\u0027m ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets look at the positives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is has a lot that is still quite broken and lots of work that still needs to be done, bringing in another potential market means more money for Squad (or Deported or whoever holds the leash now) and that means more incentive to continue development. I had been worried that the early access program had possibly already saturated the market and so it wouldn\u0027t be as viable to continue development for as long as we\u0027d like to see, but this changes that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore players, more minds to the community is always a good thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA more demanding platform and audience. Because of the limitations of console hardware (vs a well spec\u0027d gaming rig) there will be a pressure to improve the game\u0027s performance. The console audience will also be less forgiving of bugs because they won\u0027t have the \u0022just-add-mod\u0022 fixes we have available (as far as I understand it). So there will also be pressure to deal with more of the current issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, pros and cons, but so long as the PC version isn\u0027t cut down in anyway to fit the console version, then it\u0027s mostly pros.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main remaining (slightly resentful) issue is that right now due to the stuttering issues (known GC problem) and very poor performance with craft of 300\u002B parts I\u0027m not enjoying KSP anything like as much as I used to so I\u0027m feeling generally miffed and the annoyed part of me feels how dare they spend time on expanding the client base when the current one still has issues (but the more rational part of me realises that it\u0027s a 3rd party doing the console work so.....carry on).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:42:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBetween the touchpad and the gyroscope, the PS4 controller could manage I think, given a competent port team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine placing struts or something with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5nbXTIQWcBE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBetween the touchpad and the gyroscope, the PS4 controller could manage I think, given a competent port team.\u003Cp\u003EImagine placing struts or something with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5nbXTIQWcBE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can imagine the smashed TV screens caused by the frustration of placing parts, i mean i find it difficult sometimes with a mouse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boxman","CreatedById":61559,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022 data-cite=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s just speculation to think that 1.0 was \u0022rushed,\u0022 given their \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eprevious release schedule\u003C/a\u003E of something new every 4 months or so.
