The thing you keep missing is that the line of code to print words to the screen and the line of code to move the steering were *adjacent to* each other in the program, with no conditional branches or anything between them, and nothing that depends on signal delay occurring in between them. Therefore if there\u0027s a delay between the print command and the steering command that comes immediately afterward, that would be a problem. The 65 second delay should only occur when the program starts, or when the action group is pressed, but this delay was in between two *adjacent* commands, AFTER the triggering had already happened. Regardless of how the triggering happened, or how \u0022cheaty\u0022 a technique was used to do that, once it does trigger, the two *adjacent* commands should have happened right away back to back.

I was defending WHY it was so easy for us to miss it (all kOS devs who read your report missed that vital point, not just me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been cases in the past of people being unaware of the CONFIG:RT option entirely, and therefore issuing a false bug report based on them not realizing it\u0027s there. But in your case you knew about enough to talk about it in the bug report, but talked about it with an inverted understanding of what the flag means. Yours is the first case of someone being aware of it but getting its meaning backward, which is why it was easy to miss that you were describing its effects backward and that this was the actual source of the misunderstanding. You\u0027re the first person who has *had* that misunderstanding, which is why it was easy not to notice it. It\u0027s not something we\u0027ve encountered before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry for being a bit snippy. We\u0027re in crunch time, have no idea when KSP 1.1 will drop because they never tell anyone ahead of time, and with everyone having limited free time there\u0027s a bit of a worry about getting things out in time to be ready for all the work that 1.1 will require. Into that environment someone comes along who issues a bug report that consumes hours of work because what it seems to be describing would be quite severely broken - a major major enormous flaw in kOS - if it was truely broken. It is very frustrating to find out after wasting those hours that it was an invalid bug report all along, due to a misunderstanding on the part of that user as to what a flag means - a misunderstanding that was unique to that user and that user alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes I shouldn\u0027t have been as dismissive as I was, but for your part you should be aware that that was borne of the frustration of your \u0022bug\u0022 report causing me to waste a few hours of work I could have been doing something productive with on the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T10:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat being said, wanting to disable RT\u0027s rules (entirely, not just signal delay) for some saved games on the same installation as the saved game where you\u0027re using it for career is entirely legit, and RT refuses to support that either, which is annoying.

But in the meantime, one suggestion I always have is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever been slightly annoyed that stock KSP puts your rocket on the launchpad such that when launching to the east, as you typically do, you have to YAW rather than PITCH to do so? (i.e. press the \u0022D\u0022 key rather than the \u0022S\u0022 or \u0022W\u0022.) Well actually that\u0027s related to this common problem in kOS. kOS, when trying to aim UP is also trying to roll into its default orientation, which isn\u0027t the one that KSP puts you in by default, and that roll right off the launchpad confuses it a bit as it tries to wind its way around to the desired situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo try this first before trying anything else: In the VAB, grab the root part with your mouse (such that you\u0027re now moving the whole vessel, leaving behind no detached pieces). Then rotate the entire vessel by 90 degrees so its bottom is now facing east, and its top is facing west. (I cant remember if this is the \u0022A\u0022 or the \u0022D\u0022 key that you want to use, but basically make the roof of the craft aim toward the back of the VAB and the belly of the craft face toward the big open warehouse doors.) Save it like this and launch it. If you\u0027ve done it right, the navball should show, when still on the launchpad, that the \u0022north\u0022 red line is now to your right, rather than on top as it usually is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you start your launch from this position it might reduce the initial roll quite a bit. I may have gotten the above orientation a bit wrong - try it again rotated a few different ways if it doesn\u0027t work the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The staging doesn\u0027t work either: it seems to trigger right after launch, sometimes decoupling, sometimes not, and doesn\u0027t do anything when liquid fuels run out on the first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has a really annoying bug in the stock game, that kOS inherits and makes it look like it\u0027s kOS\u0027s fault when it\u0027s really the stock game\u0027s fault. This bug is when it comes to calculating resources in the current stage. To see if you are having this bug, click the resources window open in the main KSP toolbar and then click the checkbox for \u0022stage only\u0022, which changes the display to showing only the resources in the current stage. Leave this window open as you launch the rocket and watch what it\u0027s showing for liquidfuel. If it shows lots of liquidfuel left when clearly you have no liquidfuel in the current stage, that\u0027s the bug. What it\u0027s doing is failing to realize that the fuel in some of the other tanks are for different stages - it\u0027s adding them to the current stage when it shouldn\u0027t. kOS is passing this bug on to you when you do STAGE:LIQUIDFUEL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(And the annoying thing is that kOS used to calculate stage values itself in older versions, and it was changed to just believing what KSP tells it because we *thought* that would be better than doing the work ourselves. At any rate, I expect the bug won\u0027t last much longer since KSP is revamping so much in 1.1.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is the problem you\u0027re having there\u0027s a few workarounds:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Redesign the staging list to ensure that the decouplers and the engines are in different stages. Having a stage where it does a decouple at the same time as it activates an engine seems to be what triggers this bug. Having two different stages, one where it decouples, and the next where it activates the next engine, seems to help avoid the bug. (Exception - If you have launch clamps - DO put those in the same stage as the first engine - don\u0027t fire the launch clamps before the engines are lit or it will fall to the launchpad.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Change this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ewhen stage:liquidfuel \u0026lt; 0.0001 then {\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto this instead:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ewhen ship:maxthrust = 0  then {\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it will just never bother using the buggy stage:liquidfuel check at all and instead base the check on the fact that the engine is flamed out and has no thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact if you do #2 , you can even remove the \u0022until\u0022 loop that follows, entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, the tutorial is dated because it was written before this stage:liquidfuel bug manifested.
