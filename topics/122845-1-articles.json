First, you don\u0027t have to accept a contract. Second, you aren\u0027t required to research any one node before another unless it has a prerequisite node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow did not researching Spaceplane technology lose you resources? You don\u0027t have to research them if you don\u0027t want to. Nothing in the contracts forces you to. (Although later on you will be missing fairings if you don\u0027t)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience contracts are procedurally generated. You may or may not see one just like that later, but it doesn\u0027t matter, they are infinite. New ones just keep getting generated. There are a few exceptions. The \u0022Fly By\u0022, \u0022Explore\u0022, \u0022Return a Kerbal From\u0022, \u0022Land On\u0022 and possibly a few others are one time only. If you accomplish the goal before accepting the contract you will never see it. Also, of course, the first 4 contracts are required. For example if you enter Minmus\u0027 sphere of influence you will never see the special \u0022Fly By Minmus\u0022 contract. Sometime you won\u0027t see it anyway really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really think you don\u0027t understand fully how the contract system works, unless your bankrupt completely and cannot accept a contract for some reason, there isn\u0027t a reason to restart.

If you have a Kerbal sitting on Minmus it will never give you a Minmus surface science contract, not until you get him off it (too easy to exploit).

You will stop getting the visual survey on Kerbin ones once you have gone farther afield because the algorithm thinks you have progressed far enough in the game that they aren\u0027t interesting or challenging anymore. There is no cost associated with not doing a class of contract. For example if you ignore the \u0022visual survey of [Kerbin location]\u0022 contracts, it will have no impact on what sort of contracts come up in the future game.

Broadly speaking, there are five types of contracts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Records: those are the \u0022contracts\u0022 you automatically have at game start, without ever manually accepting anything. Speed records, altitude records, that sort of stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mandatory initial progression: your four first contracts. Science from the launchpad, launch a vessel, escape the atmosphere, orbit Kerbin. These four are guaranteed to appear in every game you start, and you\u0027re pretty much required to do them to progress (and you cannot reject them). Only through completing these four will you get access to all other possible contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Optional guided progression milestones: Just like the initial progression contracts, these are steps you can do in a linear order. Fly by \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;, orbit \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;, land on \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;, return Kerbal from \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;. They start with the Mun, then progress to Minmus; I\u0027ve never really checked if they also progress to other planets because I was too impatient. The thing with these is that if you skip ahead - if you do a flyby before getting the contract, or if you go straight into orbit on your first visit, or if you go to Minmus before the Mun etc., you break the chain and these contracts stop showing up altogether. They are meant as guidelines for new players, who have no idea what they are doing and don\u0027t get the idea of visiting other places by themselves. As soon as you start displaying the ability and inclination of going wherever you please, the game stops bothering to try and guide you linearly, and instead just lets you find your own way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Exploration contracts: A simple contract template called \u0022Explore \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0022. Note that these are not part of the milestone progression system described above; they get offered in parallel/independently of it. However, they work largely the same. If you enter the SoI of a body before you get the exploration contract, then you will never see it. And in contrast to the milestones, you\u0027re not guaranteed to get these, either. They appear at random, are fairly rare, and are not repeatable. For this reason, most people will never see the complete set of exploration contracts for all bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Repeatable content: The bulk of the contracts in the game. They are generated procedurally, and if they expire, the slot they freed up will just be filled up with a new contract. No matter how many of these you do, there will always, always be an infinite amount more. These include: tourists, part testing, collect science, plant flag, survey, launch satellite, launch space station, construct surface base, do stuff with asteroids... and possibly others I have forgotten. Repeatable content shows up as soon as you first reach space. The types of contracts available is based on your tech progression (you won\u0027t get asteroid contracts without researching the claw), and the task you have to do is dependant on your progress in the game (tourists start out wanting to go on suborbital flights, but if you have been to Jool, then tourists also want to go to Jool).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important takeaway for you is: there are \u003Cem\u003Eno\u003C/em\u003E mandatory static contracts after the first four ones, and you are \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E forced to rush towards researching/constructing a vessel to meet any deadline that you haven\u0027t specifically accepted. And stuff like \u0022return science from orbit around the Mun\u0022 is not even a special contract; it\u0027s just repeatable content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, on the topic of deadlines: Contracts have two of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is usually a couple days (Kerbin days) long, so 30-40 hours. That is the time you have to \u003Cem\u003Eaccept\u003C/em\u003E this contract, before it disappears from your list of choices and gets replaced by a different one. The second deadline is the completion time, which is usually measured in \u003Cem\u003Eyears\u003C/em\u003E even for the simplest of tasks. The timer does not start until you actually accept the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, special contracts like the first four or the exploration missions are very easily distinguishable from the rest: they don\u0027t have the first deadline. The text below the accept/decline buttons will just say \u0022Expires: Never\u0022. They still have a completion time after you accept them, but you can just leave them sitting unaccepted for however long you wish.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-12T08:10:56Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2015 08:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceweezle","CreatedById":92331,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T08:31:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, thanks for going into such detail.
