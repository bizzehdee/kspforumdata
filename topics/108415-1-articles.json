I order to do that you first have to create an interstage fairing, launch the vehicle, revert to VAB, remove everything on top of the fairing (the fairing stays) then build on top of the things inside the fairing, put another fairing on top and connect it (with the trick of offsetting stuff in between).

One advantage to this method is that it is closer to the real Apollo, which staged off the engine shroud exposing the top portion of the lander.
