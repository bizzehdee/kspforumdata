This test was done at 1800-1400 meters altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did some more extensive and scientific \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/vSGza\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etesting\u003C/a\u003E. Set FRAPS to take a screenie every ten seconds; the result of a solid minute of gliding indicates a vertical airspeed of -1.033 m/s. The average airspeed of this minute of gliding, from 1740 to 1678 meters altitude, was 38 m/s. Any slight variations in the screenshots are undoubtedly due to the turbulence which caused the Delta II to drift slightly off course and the corrective action taken to keep the craft straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a more practical application of these numbers, imagine this hypothetical: I am coming down from reentry, completely out of fuel. I regain control of my plane 5 km above the ocean, dozens of kilometers away from shore. If these numbers held up at 5 kilometers altitude (I\\\u0027m sure they don\\\u0027t, but roll with me for a second) then I could glide 183,930 meters, roughly. That should make it to any beach. Since the numbers will not hold up at that high altitude, however, let\\\u0027s just cut it out of the equation. From two kilometers altitude I could still fly 73 kilometers distance. That\\\u0027s pretty damned impressive!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-02T18:07:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=5126.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=5126.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Pheonix-42 has great gliding capabilties, yet for the best results you should drop all of the bombs first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-02T18:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Vanguard is the best glider! \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-02T18:18:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NovaSilisko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NovaSilisko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Vanguard is the best glider!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, no.
