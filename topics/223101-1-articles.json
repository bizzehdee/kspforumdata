In my opinion something like this should be the default difficulty, with sliders to increase/reduce rewards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ETech tree/parts balance\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0(note, this is just my personal feelings)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nXS decouplers and docking ports are deeper/more expensive than I\u0027d expect\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRover wheels are deeper/more expensive than I\u0027d expect, I\u0027d suggest moving the smallest/most basic ones down at least\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe SWERV feels too cheap, it\u0027s really so incredibly powerful it should be deep in Tier 4 IMO\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe NERV feels just underwhelming overall, with its significant dry mass and the bulk of hydrogen, I\u0027m just skipping it and using deep-space methalox or going straight to the SWERV\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSince all probe cores now have reaction wheels and the same capabilities, there\u0027s barely any differentiation between them, differences are basically cosmetic.

Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E. At least the early game mission rewards drastically overwhelm science rewards such that science almost seems irrelevant. This seems to be better in the late game though. I\u0027ve had science trips return\u00A0 several times what my mission payouts were later on and I expect the same from the next trip I\u0027m planning. I think this is in part because later on you can do many science collection types while early on you are quite limited and these payout poorer. Most other points seem appropriate too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI disagree on the nuke assessment. I think NERV and SWERV are pretty well balanced with how they must be used and their cost within the tree. They both equally require the additional consideration how you\u0027ll handle their bulk. Their higher efficiency comes with the high cost of having to invest in interplanetary construction as any rocket using them will be much more unwieldy to build/launch than an equivalent with methalox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve built interplanetaries with both NERV and SWERV and in each case there was a huge launch or multiple launches to put them in service, sometimes with multiple attempts to deal with atmospheric effects. It would have been much easier to use methalox engines albeit with less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for some risk in a reduced margin for the mission. This seems like a reasonable tradeoff to me. If you just want a one-shot, disposable rocket, the methalox engines are much easier/more reliable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll add that I feel reaction wheels and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E seem a bit underpowered. I find myself requiring multiple reaction wheels to get anything other than the most tedious control authority over anything I build. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E gets consumed far too quickly by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to leave it turned on for general control. I\u0027d be fine to only use it for big ship turns if it was much better than reaction wheels, but here too the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters just aren\u0027t that strong that it\u0027s hard to justify carrying the extra fuel for this that also adds to the cumbersome turning of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel the larger reaction wheels don\u0027t scale up as much as they should. Ton-for-ton, they have the same torque as the smaller wheels, but the rockets you put them on are substantially heavier. Even with the bigger ones, I end up needing to use several for a reasonable turn rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
