For those of you who don\u0027t know me, I became a modder in June of this year and now have a part pack out with well over 20,000 downloads. Click the link in my signature if you\u0027re curious about that. Prior to creating mods, I\u0027ve only had experience in programming in Delphi and PHP, neither of which are of much use in creating mods. My frustration started with having to create and edit .cfg files. It seems Squad has decided to make their own markup language for those (I\u0027m jokingly referring to them as SquadSON... after JSON... files). Up until now, I\u0027ve been using Notepad to edit them. I\u0027m sure you can see the rage building. The frustration really reached a peak when I started trying to learn C# to create plugins. Naturally, being a noob to C#, the Unity API and the KSP API all at once, I\u0027ve been plagued by NullRefs in the logs. Again, attempting to take the path of least resistance, I\u0027ve been using a text file viewer and hitting CTL-F and F3 repeatedly to find those null refs and then re-searching to find where I put my own Debug.Log() entries in the log file. I finally got fed up, took a break from modding (for about 5 days) and went back to Delphi. The result is ModEASY. Your comments, bug reports, suggestions and well worded complaints... are most welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EMain Features:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Log Viewer\u003C/strong\u003E - While there are several log file viewers out there, I did mine a bit differently. While it does include the expected search feature, it also includes the ability to pre-program searches. You create a list of things to search for and when the log file is loaded, a list of locations is created. By clicking on the list of found items, the log is automatically scrolled to that position. This is handy when searching the log for errors or warnings or, if you\u0027re a plugin creator who, like me, prefaces their log entries with the name of their mod, it\u0027ll quickly locate all those entries.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart File Editor\u003C/strong\u003E - After selecting a KSP install directory, ModEASY locates all of the part files in that directory and all subdirectories and loads them into a sorted and group capable list. By clicking on any of the part files in the list, it\u0027s automatically loaded into two editors. One editor is a standard text editor with the expected features of copy, paste, find, replace, etc. The other editor is a key/value editor with expandable nodes. If you need to make quick or frequent changes to a part\u0027s .cfg file, it doesn\u0027t get much easier than this.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFilter Builder \u003C/strong\u003E- If you\u0027re not familiar with VAB \u0026amp; SPH filters, you should be. Filters allow KSP users to group parts into selectable categories. The filter builder is designed primarily for the part modder. By selecting a directory, the filter builder will scan that directory and all sub directories for part files. It will then build a filter (PartCategories.cfg) which categorizes the parts found into standard part categories (Pods, Fuel Tanks, Engines, etc.). This filter file can then be distributed with part collections. It\u0027s recognized by KSP and loaded automatically so that the end user can quickly and easily select the filter and see only the parts in the filter. Below is an example of a filter I built for my Maritime Pack showing only the structural parts in the pack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.kerbaltopia.com/ModEASY/Help/Images/Filterex.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Filterex.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EAdditional Features\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESkins - Choose from over 20 different styles and colors.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EInstaller with Uninstall - Comes pre-packaged inside an installer with an uninstall feature.
