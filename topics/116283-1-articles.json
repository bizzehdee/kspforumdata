Adding to this thread because I have the same problem, and I am searching the forum for a solution. The game crashes when Revert to launch pad, or to KSC. I have made the recommended changes, and all the others in the forum.\n\n Have you found a solution yet? or has the issue disappeared? Please share. I have been grounded for weeks.\n\nThanks\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/6d3sehdwtqmp68a/AAA0JD_-Jj4w71NYFXrFD1v9a?dl=0[**https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6d3sehdwt...FXrFD1v9a?dl=0**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6d3sehdwt...FXrFD1v9a?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T11:29:13Z","Content":"There\u0027s many things that result in the same symptom, limeindy\u0027s appears to be specific to the craft but yours looks to be caused by something outside the game, so there\u0027s no \u0022one size fits all\u0022 fix for this.\n\nlimeindy\u0027s best bet is to scrap the craft and build another as all his other craft are fine, as to why it\u0027s causing this I cannot tell, the output\\_log just ends with no information and my player.log shows a segmentation fault when reverting with that particular craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T14:58:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi Spacejohn, I still don\u0027t know what\u0027s causing this yet, the error log only shows a general out-of-memory error and the output\\_log doesn\u0027t say what caused the crash, usually the output\\_log will say \u0022system out of memory\u0022, but for you it just crashes.\n\u003E So there\u0027s no smoking gun here, which suggests the cause might be outside of the game and KSP can\u0027t do anything (except crash).\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d like you to try starting your PC with a [**clean boot**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/929135).\n\u003E \n\u003E If KSP doesn\u0027t crash while in a clean environment it suggests there\u0027s a conflict with something else installed on your system.\n\nI\u0027m getting the exact same crash after 5-6 scene changes, no matter where to/from. High part count on scene seems to hasten it, as does how fast you go through the scene changes, but not much. It\u0027s a memory issue (access violation, just like above), but I have KSP nowhere near the limit (2.5 gigs or so), and the RAM also shows 0% usage. So not a case of excessive texture loading. I run an old Nvidia GT9800, I might try to force OpenGL to see if the problem is DX-related. My crash folder creation is about 5-6 logs a day... Some context out of a typical error log:\n\n    mono.dll caused an Access Violation (0xc0000005)  in module mono.dll at 0023:10107259.Error occurred at 2015-07-28_020022.C:\\Juegos\\KSP\\KSP_win\\KSP.exe, run by Rune.71% memory in use.0 MB physical memory [2346 MB free].0 MB paging file [1948 MB free].0 MB user address space [61 MB free].Write to location 00000000 caused an access violation.\n\nGlad to see it\u0027s a stock thing, though. I was considering nuking a lot of mods to see if I could make things better.\n\nRune. Let\u0027s cover a couple threads to see if I get some brilliant advice."}]}
