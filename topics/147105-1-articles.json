Its fine when is just 2 or 3 things to swap between, but, when you have a significant number of things? Its a right pain in the booster. My search fu is weak, so, I may be doubling up, if so, mods, merge? If not? Why am I the first to think this up? I would love for the ability to be on say Bob doing what ever it is that has me EVAd as Bob, and instead of hitting [ or ] a few dozen times to get to say Bill who is near by so I can bolt that light onto my ship or what ever. Its cool is hes the next jump to when those keys are hit, but more often than not, its a flag or a lander thats not needed at that time and the list goes on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I envision is this. You are on your primary vessel or EVAd kerbal or what ever it is. And you need to make a jump to a specific thing. You should be able to click on that thing \u0026lt;yes, I know in map view this is possible, but once a good number of things are stacked in the same spot, its impossible to single out the one you want\u0026gt; and the option to \u0022Switch To\u0022 is there waiting for use.

We now desire to place Bill into one of the modules in the base. To do this, as we have it now, MUST press either [ or ] several times. Between each press we must wait as physics change to our new location. Rinse and repeat until you arrive at your target, in this case Bill.

This is an option that would REQUIRE A DELIBERATE PLAYER ACTION to make happen. It would require: selecting the desired object you wish to swap to. You would then left click said object. Upon left clicking, a box appears with a button and the words: Switch To. This dialogue box would be identical in nature to the ones that ask you to \u0022Set as Target\u0022 or \u0022Undock\u0022 or \u0022Decouple\u0022 so, again, it would require an intentional choice on your behalf to select and then click with your mouse to activate.

Look at the picture immediately above your post. I had to INTENTIONALLY click on Wildra there to make that dialogue appear. I would then have to INTENTIONALLY CLICK ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS to make them happen. What you are suggesting is deliberately contrary to the method in which I propose this function occur. This is not a simple, oops I clicked on Bill and now I am in control of him situation as you are implying it would be. NO. This is a, I must make a conscious choice to interact with the kerbal or ship via multiple, conscious and deliberate clicks. This isnt a, oh i got click happy and accidentally did this, NO. This is a, I chose to take that surface sample, or I chose to undock or decouple, or, take direct command of that ship/kerbal/what ever.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn no way is what I am suggesting functioning as you are implying. Far far far far far from it sir. As I have stated multiple times, multiple ways, with pictures no less, this function as suggested and envisioned by me, is NOT SOMETHING YOU COULD ACCIDENTALLY TRIGGER. This is something that you must make conscious choices to click and engage. Just like decoupling a node, or opening a solar panel \u0026lt;non action group activation, but direct click it\u0026gt; is. And you do not demand that THOSE functions be off by default. No. This again sir, for the optimal sake of clarity, is something I envision being something you, me, player xyz must make conscious and deliberate choices to make happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no room in my suggestion for you or anyone to accidentally take control of object XYZ while in control of object TUV with out making the CHOICE to do the following: Click on said object. Click on the DESIRED CHOICE in the dialogue. Just like, in the game now, there is no CHANCE at accidentally decoupling something via those self same dialogues because at each step, you are making the choice to click and proceed. This is, just for you Alshain, an addendum to my suggestion, just to make absolutely double dog sure there is 0 chance at dumb firing this option, absolutely 0 action group assignability. This way, it is ALWAYS the choice of the player to make this switch happen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT/DISCLAIMER: I am sick of my words being misconstrued either by accident, or by deliberate hostile act. I have, in my opinion provided enough, clear and concise logic on how, this is not something someone can do by accident, but, by actual deliberate action to make such a swap of control happen, that it is clear that how it is envisioned that again, it will be a direct actionable choice, the same as planting a flag, taking an eva report, undocking/decoupling, and even suggested for his comfort that this not be allowable in an action group, to keep this, a solid, multiple click event.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-06T01:48:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2016 01:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AlamoVampire\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-06T01:53:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/78020-alamovampire/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002278020\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/78020-alamovampire/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@AlamoVampire\u003C/a\u003E So you want it on the tweakable menu then?\u00A0 You said click, I thought you meant left click (usually click and left click are synonymous, while right click is usually explicitly said) Anyway, just a communication issue.\u00A0 The tweakable menu could be doable, but that menu is per-part.\u00A0 I might be able to make a mod to do that, but if I made a mod it would require Module Manager, I know you don\u0027t like that.\u00A0 Otherwise I\u0027d have to edit every parts config file and I\u0027m not doing that lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-06T01:55:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2016 01:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-06T02:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/110959-alshain/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022110959\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/110959-alshain/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Alshain\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0glad we have the communication thing cleared up. ya, coulda been a touch more clear on the clicks between right/left, but, now we are on same page \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0believe it or not, Red Iron Crown cleared up my issue with module manager, but, sadly OPM or Kopernicus \u0026lt;no clue which\u0026gt; was causing odd lag issues and it finally decided it didnt want to run as it was crashing my game consistently.
