I like the cambered wings and the slightly off-axis thrusters and nose section; flying it is kind of quirky with the offset axis of thrust, but manageable and very stable. It has lots of lift. I decided to make it an SSTO, hence the Rapiers and docking port, and though I could reach space with this it didn\u0027t have enough fuel to circularize the orbit since I had to leave some fuel tanks empty in order to reach the appropriate velocities. So I created a second version that has a third engine, allowing all the fuel tanks to be full, and sure enough it got to a ~80 km orbit with enough fuel left to get higher.
