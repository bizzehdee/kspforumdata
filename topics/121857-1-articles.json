All your RCS thrusters need to be arranged around the CoM in an even pattern.

Badly arranged RCS creates a torque moment, which can be corrected by a strong reaction-wheel input by the SAS. Also, thruster blocks can generate some counter-torque by using other jets to combat the roll, but this will consume mono way faster than necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture a full Jumbo-64 tank with 8 RCS blocks in 4-way symmetry, 4x top and 4x bottom.
