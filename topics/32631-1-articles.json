How much gravity are you looking for? If we have a number, we might be able to work forward from that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been doing some reading and there does seem to be a clear relation between the mass of a planet and its radius. The details can be found in this PDF: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jackson/pdf/SotinJacksonSeager2010_Exoplanets.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jackson/pdf/SotinJacksonSeager2010_Exoplanets.pdf\u003C/a\u003E but I\u0027ll skip to the essential component for our discussion. This equation determines the relationship between the mass and radius of a planet: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER/R(Earth) = a * (M/M(Earth))^b \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe variables \u0022a\u0022 and \u0022b\u0022 are coefficients that change depending on the kind of planet. If you look at the PDF, Table 5 carries the coefficients for Terrestrial planets, ocean planets, and \u0022super-mercury\u0022 planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are other equations in the PDF - some of them quite complex - but this one should serve our purposes for now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing: one of the reasons why planets higher than 10 Earth masses are likely to become gas giants (even miniature ones like Uranus and Neptune) is because their higher gravity will trap lighter molecules like hydrogen. On worlds like Earth, hydrogen rarely sticks around; once it gets into the upper atmosphere, it can be excited to speeds exceeding escape velocity just by being exposed to sunlight, and so it\u0027s lost to the planet forever. Heavier worlds can trap hydrogen (and helium, and other light gasses) and so accumulate thick atmospheres.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteWeasel","CreatedById":59171,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T00:25:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve messed around in US, and earth 4 is probably going to be as big as it\u0027s going to get as believability will allow.
