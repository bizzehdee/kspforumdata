The maiden voyage of Merkury-Appaloosa for example worked well. (He says trying to avoid spoilers \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext - you\u00A0could cut back on some of the launch sequences. After a while they do tend to run into each other and most\u00A0launches which the \u003Ci\u003Eauthor\u003C/i\u003E is describing as \u0027boring\u0027 or \u0027uneventful\u0027 could probably be cut. Having one or two routine launches is fine just to show that your guys can do it but otherwise - do we really need to see the fourth launch of a rocket we\u0027ve seen before. Similar comments apply to routine orbital manoeuvres.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could try showing some of those flights from a different perspective - for example from Mission Control or from a kernel in the crowd watching the launch. You could also be a bit selective about which parts of the flight you describe - they don\u0027t all need to start on the launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick example from my own writing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPioneer 1 is my Apollo 8 equivalent. The launch is described in detail, swapping points of view\u00A0between the kerbonauts and mission control. I skip over most of the rendezvous and docking in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E because we\u0027ve seen that before in a couple of other flights. TMI is new, so that gets plenty of page time. Then the action skips ahead to cover an in-flight emergency, then all the stuff around the M\u00FCn - again because that\u0027s new. On the journey home, the technical stuff is skipped over in favour of a flashback sequence to fill in some backstory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor comparison, Pioneer 4 is my Apollo 11 equivalent. The launch gets plenty of attention again - as seen by the watching crowds and news anchor. There\u0027s some reaction stuff from different places on Kerbin. Then we pick up the flight again in Munar orbit with the lander undocking and heading down to the surface. No need to do the whole journey to the Mun - again because we\u0027ve seen it before in earlier chapters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously not all of this will work for your own story but hopefully the general ideas might help spark some ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last thing - try not to insert author comments into the text - it really kills the immersion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-12T23:31:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m late to this conversation, as usual. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0As for inner voice - I absolutely have this.... some of the time.

Most, if not all of their vehicles are repurposed civilian vehicles and with a couple of exceptions their weaponry is\u00A0more suitable to the odd police action than major conflicts.

Satisfied that the - now badly bent - handle wasn\u2019t going to close again, he heaved the unconscious guard over his shoulder and took off in a crouching run.

The cabin door burst open, armed kerbals spilling out, just as the flares burst open with a loud crack scattering sawdust and burning magnesium shavings over the snow. With a deceptively soft whump, the diesel ignited, sending tongues of orange flame racing across the ground. Before the horrified Firesvarn guards could react, the flames reached the trucks, charring paintwork and igniting tyres in blazing clouds of choking black smoke.

Lemke froze against a tree trunk, eyes darting left and right. A dip in the ground, fringed by more bushes offered better shelter, the hard ground and drifts of dried thorns underfoot sufficient to hide his passage.

He flung his other arm out in preparation, ready to lock it round his enemy\u0027s throat. A mottled olive-and-brown jacket filled his vision, short neck and close-cropped black hair above it. Hair not so very different from his own. Hair that snapped round revealing wide open, terrified eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14.000000953674316px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI can\u2019t do this.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14.000000953674316px;\u0022\u003E\nThe blade swung up and back. Lemke lashed out, slamming the hilt of his knife awkwardly into the side of the other\u2019s head. The Firesvarn dropped bonelessly to the forest floor, eyes rolling back into their sockets. Lemke dropped the knife and fell to one knee, catching him, fingers feeling for a pulse. When he found the beat, weak but steady, he almost collapsed too, limbs suddenly shaking uncontrollably.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14.000000953674316px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECan\u2019t leave.

Removing the Firesvarn\u2019s belt, he tied the soldier\u2019s wrists together behind his back, rolled him into the trench and piled the litter back over him. Breaking off branches from the nearby bushes, he arranged them on top\u00A0 of the limp form until it was mostly hidden under a blanket of thorns. He climbed to his feet and cut a shallow blaze in the nearest tree trunk, not enough to damage it but clear enough for all that knew to see.

Deprived of their scouts, the Firesvarn at the valley entrance were caught by surprise and then overpowered by superior Wakiran numbers. Although the fighting had been fierce, casualties were mercifully low, the Firesvarn commander unwilling to waste the lives of his troops once the true size of the Wakiran forces became apparent. After a brief foray into the forest to retrieve Lemke\u2019s and, he had been relieved to see, a number of other scouts, the prisoners were now on their way to the nearest town.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14.000000953674316px;\u0022\u003E\nThe second skirmish had not been short.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14.000000953674316px;\u0022\u003E\nLemke skidded behind a boulder, leaned out, fired, ducked back.
