I can most definitely get rid of a few of the required mods, I just prefer those parts to alternatives (B9 RCS blocks are awesome).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*EDIT*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fly - first make a small correction, get some medium struts between the 2.5-3.5 converter plate and the main launchpad tank, I forgot them, and it oscillates rather wildly when the 4 2.5M side tanks are jettisoned. If you don\u0027t strut it up a bit more, it\u0027ll survive but shake like hell, I limited throttle to 10% max while on that stage (just before nuke) - usually circularizing/transferring to somewhere at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore takeoff, right click the control tower and \u0022control from here\u0022. For some reason the smelter seems to be in command at the start, even tho my root module was the tower. Then, mechjeb all the way. It turns like a whale in treacle when not under engine power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen on the final stage, it isn\u0027t PERFECTLY balanced, you\u0027ll need RCS from about 400m/s dV remaining, and it may start to veer off if you get as low as about 20m/s dV. I couldn\u0027t figure this out, only minimize it to this point. Turn on RCS when landing and you\u0027ll be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, the nuclear rocket is intended to be used until just after you\u0027ve burned to land somewhere. Jettison it then, and any remaining fuel is used for the final descent stage engines, which have way better TWR for Duna etc. You must jettison the nuke before you land. The final 8 side fuel tanks are best gotten rid of before landing also (mechjeb should do this for you).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-29T18:38:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2013 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pasty2k2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded flying guidelines\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mishkin_007","CreatedById":59818,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T23:37:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWaiting for kethane to update to 0.7 and then im going to try this mod out for real.
