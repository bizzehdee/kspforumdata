The full rocket is now a 1130T monstruosity !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was overfueled and some most of the parts (it was a 13 launches mission assembled around Laythe) used the first stage core to slow down on Jool arrival.

So I tester my first stage to really know what payload it as able to put to orbit. 200T at 200km with a cost of 2280Cr/T and a payload mass of 15.5%.

Up until about 10x Isp you don\u0027t notice this effect very much, but diminishing returns start ramping up noticably above that. Above 15x Isp, more fuel achieves very little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the less dV a stage has, the more stages you need to perform your mission. And every new stage is going to have added cost and added dry mass in the form of decouplers and engines, which negatively impacts your efficiency. So you don\u0027t want to make your stages too small, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to keep in mind is that you should be wary of choking your lower stages. If your rocket needs more dV without adding another stage, then it\u0027s tempting to add it to the topmost stage, because it adds the smallest amount of mass and cost. But depending on what you just added, you might have unbalanced your rocket stages - the topmost stage gained a disproportionate amount of mass, thus reducing the dV of the second-to-topmost stage. And the top two stages combined also gained mass, reducing the dV of the third-to-topmost stage. And so on. It has a cascading effect that ripples through all stages below the stage you changed, and in a design that has many stages and/or strongly different Isp values between stages and/or is strongly unbalanced, you can accidentally end up with a rocket that has \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E dV than it had before you started adding fuel! Of course, there is one stage you can always overload to your heart\u0027s content without choking anything: the first stage, the bottom-most one. Because there is nothing below it to choke. However, it is also the largest stage, and that means you have to add large amounts of mass and funds to it to achieve the same effect as adding a little bit to the topmost stage. So you need to experiment and see which path is best for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy strategies for efficient launchers are thus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do not exceed 10x Isp worth of dV for any given stage to avoid rapidly diminishing returns\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do not remain below 5x Isp worth of dV in any given stage either, because staging equipment and engines cost mass and money\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All stages should have similar fuel/mass ratios to prevent stage choking\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Lower engine mass can sometimes trump higher Isp because it improves the fuel/mass ratio\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Decide before building if cost efficiency or mass efficiency is more important; they do not always go hand in hand (f.ex. solid booster vs. liquid engine)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T09:16:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 09:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T10:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you calculate ISP of a \u0022meta-stage\u0022 when you have mutiple engines fireing different durations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy \u0022huge\u0022 first stage is \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Small SRB destach first\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Then 8 red tanks with Mainsails\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Then 4 red tanks with mainsails\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- then 4 bigger tanks with mainsails\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- then the core with clustered engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept SRB, all engines have ISP of 360 and descent TWR.

Don\u0027t let your first stage thrust-to-weight ratio get too low. You want to accelerate up to terminal velocity as rapidly as possible -- ideally the instant you take off. Don\u0027t forget that every ten seconds you shave off your initial vertical ascent profile saves you nearly 100 delta-V by reducing your gravity losses. (But this is only true when you\u0027re moving significantly slower than terminal velocity. Above terminal velocity, you lose efficiency from the air resistance.) I\u0027ve seen massive spacecraft with huge but nearly choked first stages that can just barely get things moving -- in such cases, there are huge rewards to spamming a bunch of initial cheap boosters to get things up to terminal velocity quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. It\u0027s OK to have a low(er) thrust to weight ratio in your upper stages, and this can often save a lot of engine mass. Depending on your trajectory, a TWR of as low as 0.6 on the final orbital insertion stage can work. Don\u0027t lug a heavy Kerbodyne/Mainsail/Skipper engine up to orbital velocities unless you absolutely need the performance later. Every bit of mass you can shave off your upper stages has cascading benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. This is even more true for interplanetary stages. Be patient and use one tiny engine.
