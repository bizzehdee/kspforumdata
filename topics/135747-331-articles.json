For most launchers on this planet, that\u0027s a fantasy figure that will never be reached, based purely on propellant available on board but ignoring other considerations like structural limitations. For example: a Falcon 9 that SpaceX will sell you today has an advertised expendable payload to LEO of 22,800 kg. But do you know what the maximum mass is that you can physically mount onto a Falcon 9 before you roll it out onto the launchpad? It\u0027s 10,800 kg, as per the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.de/url?sa=t\u0026amp;rct=j\u0026amp;q=\u0026amp;esrc=s\u0026amp;source=web\u0026amp;cd=1\u0026amp;cad=rja\u0026amp;uact=8\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW3pu-pbLSAhULbRQKHS2FC0oQFggaMAA\u0026amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spacex.com%2Fsites%2Fspacex%2Ffiles%2Ffalcon_9_users_guide_rev_2.0.pdf\u0026amp;usg=AFQjCNF6Rkj_NV-9NP0CQasGP5eaHOthpg\u0026amp;sig2=-lRpJJ937TPpdxFpu_Ck0A\u0026amp;bvm=bv.148073327,d.d24\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFalcon 9 User\u0027s Guide\u003C/a\u003E, section payload adapters. And while we don\u0027t have a Falcon Heavy User\u0027s Guide yet, keep in mind that it uses the exact same stage 2 as the Falcon 9, and therefore uses the exact same payload adapters. Thus I would not be surprised at all if the maximum payload you can physically mount onto Falcon Heavy also ends up being exactly the same 10,800 kg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo all that theoretical \u0026gt;54 tons to LEO performance is most likely only going to be available for a mix of two jobs: pushing a lighter payload beyond LEO, and returning booster cores. SpaceX says that Falcon Heavy can push about 13.5 tons to Mars in fully expendable mode. But IMHO it\u0027s possible like that\u0027s the only scenario we\u0027ll actually ever see Falcon Heavy flying expendable, because for destinations closer to home, it might not have any way to mount more payload to make use of its capabilities. Even sending a Dragon around the Moon may be possible while expending only the center core. GTO payload in that configuration is estimated as 14 tons, and Dragon V2 is specced at a maximum possible loaded mass of around 9.5 tons, which is unlikely to be tapped out on 2-3 people leisure cruise. A free return just might be possible with recovered side boosters, especially if the SuperDracos add their \u0026gt;400 m/s to the mix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs such, SLS offers something Falcon Heavy cannot, and that is raw payload mass. As a much bigger rocket, is has structural capabilities far greater than a Falcon 9 upper stage, so more of that theoretical 70-120 tons to LEO can actually be physical payload. And the fact that it will have more than 100s of specific impulse advantage over the F9 upper stage will also help a great deal in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLS may be the last own launcher that NASA ever operates... and it may not be the best it could have been, had NASA had a free hand with it... but the commercial market will not yet be quite where it needs to be to replace it within the coming ten years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222970351\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488255728\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, regex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, some good stuff in this thread, I had no idea NASA wasn\u0027t really that hot about the SLS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dunno, there weren\u0027t any sources on that claim.

The whole organization is made up of geeks and enthusiasts. Any rocket is better than no rocket, and SLS is not a bad rocket. If there wasn\u0027t a mandate to spend unnecessary amounts of money on it to employ an unnecessary amount of people in certain states, I don\u0027t think there would be nearly as many complaints (apart from those people that would no longer have a job, of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tullius","CreatedById":168049,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-28T08:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy shouldn\u0027t SpaceX be able to pull this stunt off?

If the Senate decides to cancel SLS in favour of private projects, then there is nothing preventing them from doing it. And relating this to the current administration is a bit difficult, since nobody really knows how their intentions are: Sure they want to save money, but at the same time they seem to have some interest in a manned Moon mission (even if it is just for the pictures on TV), since they are investigating for a manned EM-1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the second part: NASA is free to create the requirements they want, i.e. to adapt them to ITS. Sure, they shouldn\u0027t make it too obvious, but finding some scientists saying that, if they want to go to Mars, they should \u0022either go big or go home\u0022, should not be that hard. Also, there is nothing preventing them from buying part of an ITS mission to Mars, i.e. only pay for 2-3 of 6 seats. For example, in case of\u00A0Red Dragon, NASA essentially gifted SpaceX the necessary capacity of the Deep Space Network (in return, NASA gets scientific and technical results of the mission).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in the end, I don\u0027t think that it would be really cheaper for NASA to fund commercial missions than doing it by themselfs: The commercial resupply missions will cost NASA a few billion dollars, and the commercial crew program already granted Boeing nearly 5 billion dollars and SpaceX over 3 billion dollars even before the first flight. Comparing those values to those of SLS program\u00A0which will have cost some 40-50\u00A0billion dollars by the time of the prospected EM-2 mission, it is actually not that expensive, considering the relative size of the project. Do you really think that companies like SpaceX would be able to develop\u00A0ITS for NASA at less than 10 times the cost of the Commercial Crew program? And grant to a company like Blue Origin the same support for the competition? So I think that the Senate, if they want to do the sensible thing (which is not guaranteed), will stick to SLS, if they want the US to do more in space than ISS and probes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-28T13:08:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2017 01:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Tullius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-28T13:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EI feel like part of the whole schedule slipping thing is the fact that SpaceX is a relatively small space company.
