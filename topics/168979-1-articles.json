(lead, antimony, and a little tin -- both antimony and tin melt higher than lead) melts around 600 F.\u00A0 Most aluminum used for things other than electrical wire\u00A0 contains some\u00A0 copper, and often a little silicon.\u00A0 Copper melts at the verge of orange glow, pure aluminum (at 1221 F) would be a nice cherry red -- but the alloy might well melt below 900 F, which would be cool enough you might not see the glow in a well lit work area, certainly not against the yellow glow of the forge interior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust looked it up -- 6061 has a solidus (lower end of the partial melt range) of 582 C, still above the Draper Point, but close enough to it that lighting matters very much.\u00A0 Especially if you\u0027re used to heating iron or steel to yellow to give a little more working time, you might not notice the very faint glow at that temp -- and that\u0027s where it transitions to \u0022puddle,\u0022 even though the puddle would be less than fully fluid.\u00A0 And that 6061 melts about 80 C lower than pure aluminum, even though it\u0027s 96% or so aluminum and contains less than 1% of any single alloying element (biggest is magnesium at up to 1.25%, then copper no more than 0.4%, then zinc, not to exceed 0.25%).\u00A0 I found references to other aluminum alloys that have liquidus (fully melted) below 500 C, which is decidedly below the

temperature, and generally more \u0022silvery\u0022 a metal is, the lower its emissivity (this is why gold -- with a very low emissivity in IR -- is used as insulation against radiation cooling for stuff going to space, like the LEM descent stage).\u00A0 A perfect black body has the highest possible emissivity, a perfect reflector (and an aluminum coating is close-ish, hence its use on telescope
