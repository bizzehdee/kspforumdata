There are male cues where asexuality is supposed to prevail. What is interesting is the idea that these male cues are perfectly fine because that is what was seen during the actual Space Race, right?

I like it how it currently is. I mean, we kind of assume they\u0027re male because most people are generally wired by societal influences to see sex-less things as being masculine unless defined otherwise, but in reality there\u0027s nothing definitively masculine or feminine about them, other than some having traditionally male names, but others certainly have names that could be construed as female. Their appearance, to me suggests asexuality and I personally am just fine with there being no real mention or definition of their gender. Even if there have been some who claim the Kerbs are all males, I refuse to accept that analysis and assert that, at least within my own space program, the Kerbals are genderless, or, should a definite border between male and female Kerbals ever be implemented, that Nexus Aerospace Division is an equal opportunities \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eemployer\u003C/span\u003E destroyer.

This is a game designed by human beings for human beings using human frames of reference.

What a coincidence!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point in our culture, and in video game culture specifically, the inclusion or not of female characters to go along with the male characters is a deliberate choice. Either way is a deliberate choice. The ships of \u0027We forgot\u0027 or \u0027It never occurred to us that is might matter\u0027 sailed a decade ago.

In my opinion there would be something particularly Kerbalish about them being mixed up every which way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy in my opinion the far bigger insult would be to the ideals that this game celebrates. The history of space flight has always involved pushing boundaries and celebrating the best and brightest. This has included people like Sally Ride and Christa McAuliffe and Valentina Tereshkova and Roberta Bondar, as well as people orbiting this planet this very moment who also happen to be female.
