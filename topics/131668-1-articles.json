Depending on your persistent debris setting it should actually be beneficial for more than just decluttering your tracking station. What a low persistent debris setting will do is automatically scuttle the oldest piece of debris, and I believe this includes manually assigned debris as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-09T02:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDebris is pretty cheap to leave in existence.\u00A0 It\u0027s running on rails, there\u0027s no physics modeling to be done, it doesn\u0027t even have to be displayed in the map view (assuming you\u0027ve got debris display toggled off).\u00A0 I never bother worrying about debris, and by late career I have \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elots\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of it floating around (as in \u0022well over a hundred\u0022), and I\u0027ve never noticed any impact on my game performance, and my computer\u0027s not some sort of special high-end gaming rig.\u00A0 Certainly, ten measly debris pieces should have an impact on your game that\u0027s undetectably small, even if you\u0027re playing on a potato.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only time I notice the game slowing down as I move to later career and there\u0027s a lot more stuff flying around is when I\u0027m running RemoteTech and have a much more complex comms network, since then there\u0027s a lot more processing to do for the overall system.\u00A0 But except when I\u0027m running RT, it really doesn\u0027t seem to make much difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-09T02:25:17Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2016 02:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Velve666","CreatedById":157954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-09T06:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI too change unused and defunct crafts into debris. with or without\u00A0it toggled in the station I dont see a noticeable decrease in performance.
