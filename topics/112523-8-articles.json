The new radiator deploy module uses the same sort of tracking, so I was able to just drop the new module in and go. \n\nSuncatcher is an object within the model that has no mesh, a plane which tells the animation what direction to point at the sun. It tracks the local Y\u002B axis towards the sun, I believe. To answer your original query, you will not be able to make them track differently without changing the orientation of the transform object that is tagged by the module. Having looked at the model (for the large deployable) it appears that every mesh object has the same local orientation, so it wouldn\u0027t matter which panel you used, it would still face it\u0027s edge to the sun.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T00:05:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 12:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"}]}
