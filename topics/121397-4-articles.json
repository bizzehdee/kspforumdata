Especially the KIS compatibility is what I was always looking for to finally go for some space camping :-) so much kerbal!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I have some really bad RAM issues because I have way too many mods installed (yeah I know...) I already stripped my game to the absolute necessary - which is still to much to play with Pathfinder without crashing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is there a way to install only the Ponderosa module? My Problem here is that it doesn\u0027t inflate if I delete the rest and I have no idea which files are needed exactly to make it work (except for those in /Assets of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso please don\u0027t be offended by my blasphemic request here :-).

The crew delivery vessel only had sufficient life support for about a week\u0027s time, and on the Mun night was coming when the crew arrived. They couldn\u0027t wait out the night and were forced to land just before nightfall. With only a day or so to go they built the rovers and habitat, then realized that they had insufficient battery power. KSC forgot to take into account the length of the Munar night and the crew was in danger of freezing to death. A quick thinking engineer reconfigured one of the rovers for salvaging duty and managed to retrieve the batteries from the supply dropships. Unfortunately, in the process the solar panel of the crew cabin of the Buffalo was damaged and the rover was stranded several kilometers from base. Unable to repair the damage, the engineer was forced to EVA his way back to the nearest dropship and scavenge a deployable solar panel. It was a race against time, but she managed to make the trek back to the rover and return to base in time to beat nightfall. Now, the crew is eagerly awaiting a life support resupply, as they\u0027ve only enough oxygen for about a month\u0027s time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you might want to rebalance Angel is the storage container for TAC-LS. The current container gives 2700 of each LS product (food, water, oxygen). This gives my crew of three 2551 days of food, 3861 days of water, but only 76 days of oxygen. Three of the TAC-LS containers that come with that mod is about the same size (in volume anyway, not sure about dry mass) and those give 3014 food, 2058 water, and 315,000 oxygen. The consumption rates are all different, so balanced like that you\u0027ll run out of each at about the same time. With those numbers my crew of three would probably have ~2700 days of each... which tbh seems a bit overkill to me, but that\u0027s how TAC-LS is balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to consider is making the parts containing solar panels repairable by an engineer. I\u0027m not sure whether they are or not, as my engineer is still only a wee little level 1, but the option didn\u0027t pop up after I broke the panel on the crew cab. It just said \u0022Broken!\u0022 and had no option to repair it in the menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this is intended or not, but when set to storage (inflated or not) - the wagon only has four storage slots. Lot\u0027s of volume, but no inventory room to speak of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe backpack you can store stuff in - it\u0027s volume is only 250, and it takes up about that much space as well. A kerbal has 300 by default, so there\u0027s little point in carrying the pack. Making it something like 500 would be nice, and is probably what I\u0027ll do for my own game. It kinda breaks the game in a way though - by placing them inside other containers you\u0027re getting \u0022free\u0022 storage as I don\u0027t think KIS accounts for how much is stored inside a container when it is placed into a container. Ideally the volume of the container (the pack) would be very low when empty, but goes up as it is filled. That way an empty pack takes little to store, but a full one takes as much as what it is holding plus a bit more. Guess that\u0027s probably a limitation of KIS though. As is, they\u0027re strapped to the outside of my rovers as emergency supplies and roadside repair kits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the spelling error is in the switchback.cfg (part name = switcback). However, the saddle.cfg is also missing the switchback in it\u0027s allowed parts list entirely. I just added the line suggested above and it works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all though, loving this mod. First time I\u0027ve been able to entirely build a base on another planet using EVA. Everything started out in containers (aside from a few larger items strapped outside) and was totally disassembled. Never been able to do that with any other colonization mods, so this one is basically a must have mod for me. Really makes EVA much more useful.. I feel like I\u0027m actually playing as my engineer is spending more time outside the base walking around than inside doing nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne question though - I can\u0027t for the life of me figure out how to get organics. The greenhouse says it needs it, but I can\u0027t configure a storage container to deliver it. I remember one of the colony mods (USI\u0027s MKS/OKS) used organics as part of it\u0027s production chain, and you could fill those modules prior to launching.. but without that I don\u0027t seem to have any way of sending organics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-13T16:44:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2015 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enorats\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T17:09:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the feedback. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Loved the story too.
