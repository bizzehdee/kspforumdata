Obviously, on real variable geometry turbojet intakes that serves to slow the speed of the intake air to subsonic speeds, but in game, it\u0027s just an animation. Furthermore, Taverius\u0027 shock cone has a similar animation at higher speeds, so I\u0027d expect it to have comparable performance at high altitudes/speeds.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging the default area in the cfg file from \u0022area = 0.00025\u0022 to \u0022area = 0.000\u003Cstrong\u003E0\u003C/strong\u003E25\u0022 seems to bring the amount of air to a similar, albeit a bit lower, level of others intakes, but the part still generates a huge drag with FAR, huge as in a small plane will fly like a brick amount.
