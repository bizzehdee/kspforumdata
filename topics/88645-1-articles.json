Please include something like this in the stock game. It would be useful for things like if you make your root part horizontal and it messes up the flight controls, so you can then change the root to a vertical piece. It also helps in subassemblies because you can\u0027t select a part other than the root part on a subassembly, meaning you will sometimes have to rebuild your whole craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemecle","CreatedById":107534,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T10:48:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s planned, As you can see here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/100627215914/devnote-tuesdays-the-kspumpkin-edition\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/100627215914/devnote-tuesdays-the-kspumpkin-edition\u003C/a\u003E in the Felipe part, \u0027Root Mode\u0027 paragraph\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T11:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt will allow to change on the spot the root part, but I wish there was a way to give action group to subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MelonHeadSeb","CreatedById":67347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T14:58:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nemecle\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nemecle\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s planned, As you can see here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/100627215914/devnote-tuesdays-the-kspumpkin-edition\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/100627215914/devnote-tuesdays-the-kspumpkin-edition\u003C/a\u003E in the Felipe part, \u0027Root Mode\u0027 paragraph\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, awesome.
