It is very frustrating to be looking at the opposite side of a planetary orbit that you\u0027re adjusting. When burning at the apoapsis to adjust the periapsis or vise versa, you can\u0027t see what you\u0027re doing while you adjust it causing this game of \u0022adjust in small increments and then rotate the entire camera to see what you did\u0022 over and over again. This would be easily mitigated by letting us see and use the maneuver node through the planet. I understand this could be problematic as seeing the orbit through the planet would become confusing but I don\u0027t think it needs to be visible through the planet and as long as the maneuver manipulator is visible while editing, that\u0027s plenty. We could move the maneuver node using the center still but it would be blindly. This wouldn\u0027t be a problem to me personally as I am only doing very small correctional directional burns rather than moving the whole maneuver at that point. It\u0027s a very small tweak but I think the uses far outweigh any confusion it could cause (which personally I don\u0027t really see any other than not seeing the orbit). And to that end, MAYBE a dotted line orbit through the planet only while editing a maneuver node would be a possible solution to that problem, though I think no visualization of the orbit through the planet and having less noise on screen would be preferred by most experienced players.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-23T21:01:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2023 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Nicrose\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-23T23:30:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Youpiyatta","CreatedById":228045,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-24T16:24:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002B1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donkey32","CreatedById":174169,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-24T17:18:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso would be best if the maneuver node sets on top of the\u00A0 AP and PE markers.
