Love the game, and I\u0027m very happy I picked it up. Obviously there are a ton of things I would love to see implemented down the road (why are spaceplanes so awful?), but one smaller thing comes to mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve built a few craft now with extra fuel tanks designed to be jettisoned once they are empty and lose some mass, so I want to use those tanks first. Sometimes the game actually seems to figure it out on its own, not drawing fuel from later stage tanks, but that behavior is a bit unreliable, so often times I\u0027m going in and manually disabling my main tanks so it just draws from the ejectable extras.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would love to see is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) That the game remembers which tanks I\u0027ve disabled (I have to go in and reset it every time I play)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) That disabling/enabling fuel tanks can be assigned to an action group like most other actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! Keep up the good work!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"golegogo","CreatedById":78553,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T16:52:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf i understand what you are saying its that you what the external fuel tanks to be used up first so the can be dropped to lose weight...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe game already has this..the FTX-2 External Fuel Duct. to use it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. select the part and set in on the external fuel tank \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. the treat it like a strut and connect to the main tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. watch as the fuel is used up first\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif this doesn\u0027t make sense just look up the FTX-2 External Fuel Duct\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZenithRising","CreatedById":77506,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T02:16:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I have since read about this behavior, which is fairly nifty,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I have multiple stages of tanks (two groups of three to maintain symmetry), so the current system doesn\u0027t distinguish between those (unless perhaps if I daisy chained the fuel lines?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, I want this functionality for xenon gas and rcs too, so the fuel lines won\u0027t help there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T02:37:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe defiantly need this, and for RCS tanks too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
