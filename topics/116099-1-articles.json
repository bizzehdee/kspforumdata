I had to remove 1500 oxidizer before launch - that was the remaining amount on my first go. I also used up the payload\u0027s tank - I guess that\u0027s intended as you didn\u0027t close it off. That organ made of radial intakes felt like an overkill. Maybe the wings too, though it wouldn\u0027t feel right to tweak someone else\u0027s construction, so I didn\u0027t.

Current version is 1.0.4. I thought those were 1.0 planes. These days air-hogging doesn\u0027t work anymore, 4 radial intakes should be enough. Also I think you could also do well with like 1/3 wing area too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line is - I think your planes will work on the newest version too, though I\u0027d certainly optimize them for the current setup.

Those are 0.9 planes, yeah. The \u002710 air intakes per engine\u0027 thing is for getting the plane to 30k meters with a 1500m/s speed on air breathing stage, so the craft can get orbital with only ~850 delta-V of closed cycle burn (which is just slightly less than it can achieve without wasting the payload fuel.).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T08:10:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m far from being an SSTO expert - I built \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=2018193\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2018193\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emy first one\u003C/a\u003E in 1.0.2, and still struggling to finish one that can reliably get some payload to orbit.

It didn\u0027t even reach 1100 m/s before rocket mode. In my experience, an optimalized rapier SSTO can reach even 1400 on 25k with one shock-cone or two radials / engine. Since 1.0.4, atmosphere is so light that I don\u0027t even need to level out for acceleration with high TTW spaceplanes.
