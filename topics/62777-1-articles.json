It\u0027s strange that, there is always day time when we are building vehicles in the hangar and in VAB (even if we are launching in the middle of a night). Just adding some kind of button which enables a choice of day/night skin will be sufficient as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) it\u0027s possible to match a default \u003Cstrong\u003Eship orientation in the VAB with the orientation on Launch pad\u003C/strong\u003E?
