First and foremost, I am hoping that I\u0027ve posted this in the right topic. Alright... so I am beginning to learn a few things here and there about some astrophysics related things. At least the very basic stuff, or so I presume. For [near] circular orbits, I have learned how to calculate orbital velocity and from that I am also able to calculate the time it would take for said object to orbit based on the parametres given. However.... I am not sure I understand how to calculate an object\u0027s semi major axis (in a circular orbit) based on orbital time. For instance... if an object is in a circular orbit around the Earth, we know it has an orbital period of ~2 hours... but what is it\u0027s SMA? I don\u0027t know how to do the calculations for that. I do know that Orbital Velocity = Sqrt of GM/R (where R is the semi-major axis of the object) and that Orbital Time = (R2*3.14)/V...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T11:08:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELets start with a perfect circle.
