An existential crisis is where one asks questions about the foundations of their life and whether their life has any meaning, value, and so forth. This means that, at least partly, KSP is a thing your life is built on. KSP shouldn\u0027t be a foundation of your life. Get outside, go out and run around in nature, and if you\u0027re one of the unlucky many who live in the city and can\u0027t access nature in all her glory without a few-hour ride in an auto, at least go to whatever parks you have available to you. If you\u0027re more of an inside guy (Or conditions are unfavourable) write, read, paint, do something with much more value and something that\u0027s actually worth your time. Find something to do that your heart and soul burns for and is attracted to like a magnet to iron. Do something that will bring much more satisfaction to your life and build you up rather than play a stupid little game about sending stupid little green men to imaginary celestial bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd bud, get some sleep and eat right. It looks like you\u0027re feeling depressed like I was for a long time and those two things helped me a lot. Get out in nature and experience her with all your senses, pay attention to all of them and think about what words you\u0027d use to describe the sensations. If you get suicidal thoughts talk to family, friends, school administration, and even medical professionals, they\u0027ll get you taken care of.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T02:02:49Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 02:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T02:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome day the sun will swell into a red giant and incinerate the earth, too, but there\u0027s no need to panic just yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlextheBodacious","CreatedById":139447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T05:27:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efly: that\u0027s... a bit intense.
