You don\u0027t get to see one from Wisconsin until August of 2017. Even then it will only be a partial eclipse in Wisconsin. You\u0027d have to drive south to see totality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely make the effort to see one if you can. I saw a total solar eclipse from Southern Germany in 1999. During totality, the street lights came on, the birds stopped singing... Everything was quiet. You could see the edge of the moon\u0027s shadow coming as the clouds started to light up again in the distance. The speed was immense.
