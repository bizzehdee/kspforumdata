Any comments you have on it are welcome. I find that it has more than enough fuel to insert into Munar orbit, and hypothetically return to Kearth (I didn\\\u0027t return to Kearth this time - Jeb insisted on a Munar landing - the boys came in low and fast and plowed into hard Munar dirt). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find that my orbits tend to be too elliptical, but I think that\\\u0027s more of an indictment of my poor piloting skills than of my rocket design.
