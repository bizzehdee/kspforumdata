Above 19 km, and you\u0027re in that gray area between space, and air flight. Too high up for typical air breather engines, too low to really be \u0027clear\u0027 of the atmosphere.

Very fast, very efficient. Needs a lot of takeoff and landing speed to remain controllable. Do NOT attempt hard Gs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Very gentle-flying turboprop. Can get off the runway with almost a feather-touch to the aft stick at full flaps. Controls gently, flies very reliably, almost hands off if I trim it. Very stable and settles nicely. Good plane for flight practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Supersonic bomber. Pretty good mix between 1 and 2. Goes fast when I want to, handles decent at low speeds without too much trouble. Nimble for its size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Ground Attack aircraft. Turns and controls very well at low speeds, has plenty of power, and is very efficient. Not very fast for a jet, but it behaves well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach of these aircraft are based on the real thing, and perform in completely different \u0027flight regimes\u0027. Some of them were harder to build right than others. (The A-10 analogue took six hours to work out how to get it to look like the A-10 but not attempt front flips every time I gunned the throttle.) Just remember that. (And that\u0027s KNOWING how it\u0027s supposed to look and behave.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, FAR simulates the dynamic shifts for supersonic flows. I wonder if we can ever convince Ferram to come up with a tool that would render airflow regime estimates as a graphic in the hanger. Show stalls, normal flow, shocks, and supersonic flow. Knowing where those are and what shape they are would help a LOT at supersonic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-01T20:09:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2014 08:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AdmiralTigerclaw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T19:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve read the wiki, it\u0027s kinda useless. \u003Cp\u003EThe most useless thing that could be written in a wiki.

If you\u0027re losing pitch control at high altitudes, your CoL might be a little too far back (at supersonic speeds the CoL moves backwards a bit towards the rear of the plane). I\u0027ve also encountered this behavior when my pitch control surfaces were too few or didn\u0027t deflect enough. At very high altitudes the atmosphere doesn\u0027t work the same -- it\u0027s more of a ah... drag cloud, I guess, than something you can aerodynamically fly through. On some of my stock-sized KSP SSTOs I had to enable RCS at very high altitude to keep the thing oriented correctly.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you\u0027re not using a dry CoM marker, your CoM might be moving too far away from the CoL when the plane is low on fuel. That absolutely \u003Cem\u003Edestroyed\u003C/em\u003E the reentry ability of a lot of my SSTO designs -- it would always flip around backwards so the engines aimed prograde because of the CoM shift from fuel drain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo please, if you could, post screenshots showing CoM/CoL!

A plane that is stable at supersonic speeds is going to be \u003Cem\u003Esuper\u003C/em\u003E touchy on the pitch at subsonic speeds. This is true of real aircraft. And the opposite: a plane that is stable at subsonic speeds is going to have pretty much zero pitch control when supersonic and will act like a lawn dart instead. The trick is to find that special middle ground where it\u0027s juuuust stable enough at subsonic speeds that you can fly it up to thinner atmosphere and higher speeds where the plane will be more stable. I still have to trial-and-error this but I\u0027ve gotten much better at my CoM/CoL placements to give me something that has a good chance of working right out of the gate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I get home after work I\u0027ll take screenshots of the aircraft I posted above, but with the CoM/CoL markers activated so you can see the placement of them. That plane is pretty sensitive on the pitch control when climbing up to mach 1, but past that it flies extremely well in straight lines. Turns like a dead fish, though. It\u0027s not the best-ever design. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I keep pushing for dry CoM images is that the dry CoM is not as intuitive as it sounds.

You have to be extremely careful with designs that have any kind of lifting surface up near the front of the plane.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-01T20:08:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2014 08:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by jrandom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T20:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELol, You just made my point.
