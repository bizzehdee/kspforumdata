Anyways, good job getting the forum back up, Kerbal! It was a hell of a job if I understand correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here it is again:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy name is Huib, I study sciences of the arts at Tilburg University in the Netherlands (no I didn\u0027t know Diederik Stapel, different faculty etc.) and I\u0027m currently working on my master\u0027s thesis on video gaming. To collect data I have set up an online survey and I would like you to fill it out, although a lot of you have already done so I believe. The survey is about \u003Cstrong\u003Evideo\u003C/strong\u003E games (so no board games) and will take about 15 minutes to complete. As a thank you I will be giving away some games when it\u0027s all done, just check the website itself for details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe survey is located at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.videogameresearch.nl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVideogameresearch.nl\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome information about data usage and the way your privacy is being handled:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only people with access to the data itself are the professor supervising my thesis and myself.

It does log your IP address, as a quick check for me to see if people have been filling it out more than once. Your IP address will not be exported to my statistics software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you would like to have a chance of winning a game, you will be asked to enter your e-mail address. This will be stored in a second database that doesn\u0027t log IP or date and time of entry. This way your e-mail address can no longer be linked to the answers you gave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would really appreciate it if you would fill it out, every single person helps.

Also I had some trouble determining what a typical gamer is. I found some research on usage of digital equipment and gaming, both Dutch and American. Unfortunately it wasn\u0027t really useful for determining typical gaming behaviour, for various reasons. Sometimes the numbers were a little outdated, and in research done by a large Dutch institution they made a separation between offline and online computer use, for some reason. I think this is very bad: nowadays you can\u0027t ask someone how long he uses the computer in an online way, and how long offline. I myself wouldn\u0027t be able to answer such a question and would probably just make things up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo come to a point: I don\u0027t know exactly what a typical gamer is. I think the thesis itself will give some hints, since people playing all kinds of games have filled it out, but it won\u0027t be enough to draw any final conclusions on this matter. I have already addressed this problem in the theoretical part of my thesis, and in the discussion at the end I will recommend that my study (or something similar) should be repeated as soon as solid data on typical gaming behaviour are available.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warscribe","CreatedById":58388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T11:37:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this just about computer/gaming use or do you draw conclusions to social behaviour too?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other week i read an article that said, statistically the average gamer is about 30 years old.

They had their, although cliche\u0027d, attributes. While it was perfectly normal for kids to be hooked to the gameboy, gaming above the age of, say, 18, was weirdly looked at. back then, games were for lonely and socially incapable people. Nowadays, Gamer is a state of mind that can be furiously discussed about..there is always the gap between casual gamers and core gamers and so on. The gamer did not only become socially acceptable, but a new social structure in itself. gaming has evolved beyond simple pastime, it is now art and sport. It has also become valueable work. the question that should be asked is: What type of gamer are you?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HBY","CreatedById":57816,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T16:09:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I should use \u0022someone who plays a video game\u0022 instead of \u0022gamer\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E . \u0022Gamer\u0022 has all kinds of connotations and different meanings to it, while \u0022someone who plays a video game\u0022 can be someone who plays every single day, or every once in a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs this just about computer/gaming use or do you draw conclusions to social behaviour too?\u003Cp\u003EThe other week i read an article that said, statistically the average gamer is about 30 years old.

However, if it indeed turns out that 30 year olds play significantly more games than other age groups it would be hard to ignore. In that case I would be very curious to see if they all started playing around the same age, which would mean they started gaming in the same time period. That would suggest that the explanation for average gamers (there\u0027s that word again) being around 30 years old would lie in the past, although it\u0027s hard to be sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it has become increasingly difficult to really separate online and offline computer use by asking people about it instead of measuring it, also because of the different meanings these words can have. For example: is playing a single player game on steam offline or online? And having facebook open all day long, like you said? This is quite complicated and people will interpret it in different ways when asked about it. Also, I think people switch between online and offline a lot, sometimes every few minutes. I don\u0027t think people really keep track of that, let alone are able to answer questions about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe question that should be asked is: What type of gamer are you?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKallio et al. have written a very interesting article on that.
