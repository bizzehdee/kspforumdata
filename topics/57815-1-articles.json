I\u0027m so excited right now and since you are my only friends who are also interested in space, I wanted to share it with you right away! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m an chemical engineering student and I\u0027m highly interested in space since my childhood, and one of my projects is to send a mini satellite to LEO which will be totally designed by other students of my university.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let me tell the main part: I got my first binoculars for stargazing! I\u0027m not a rich man and I can\u0027t afford a telescope yet but I saw a discount on a Chinese made binoculars and I bought it right away. It has 10x power and 50mm diameter. I was a little bit concerned if it was going to be a cheap-sheet but after I got it it\u0027s really worth of it\u0027s price. I\u0027ve seen many other binoculars with same or even lower magnifying power and same diameter had prices like 3 or 4 times more than the one I got. Only handicap is its cover is plastic instead of metal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd about my first lens-supported stargaze tonight, I was looking around the sky to get recognized with stars and their relative places I saw a very very bright star and wondered what it is. After having a bad neckache and good focusing, I saw that \u0022bright star\u0022 is actually yellowish brown and it is round like a planet! So I ran to my pc to find a stargazing program to find out that \u0022bright star\u0022 was Jupiter! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really excited and happy for finally looking up closer and I hope I will save enough money to make myself a basic reflector telescope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what about your first experiences?

The outer lens is about 6 cm (2\u002B inches) in diameter. Moon looks great through that, and I can see the phases of Venus and Jupiter. Other than that, the thing is... well... you know.
