I was wondering: how easy is it to put a couple of the screens into a modded cockpit? I am not a mod developer and I don\u0027t know a ton about code. Would it be something that could be done fairly easily or is the processes a lot harder than what I have envisioned in my head. Again, I\u0027m not a mod developer and only have experience with installing mods and messing around with the config files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
