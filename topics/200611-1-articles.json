It is empirical -- not based on any particular physics model. But yes, whatever form of thrust that you use needs to be able to push through that\u00A0sound barrier in a convincing way, or you\u00A0probably won\u0027t make it at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camacju","CreatedById":207172,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-24T18:54:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncreasing thrust is a lot less important than reducing drag. Parts inside fairings or cargo bays don\u0027t produce drag, so try to keep as many parts hidden as possible. Minimize wing area to further reduce drag, use nose cones on any open nodes on the craft, etc. You\u0027ll find that you\u0027ll be able to break the sound barrier much more easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
