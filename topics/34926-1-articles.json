Flexible connections like falofonos suggested work pretty well when you can use them, but sometimes that\u0027s not really an option. It is possible sometimes to dock together the two parts with subassembly loader. You can launch both parts already docked, lower the landing legs, then undock. If the ports are lined up correctly then their position shouldn\u0027t change much, but if they no longer line up then you need to move one of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you don\u0027t necessarily have to drive both components off the launch pad, like you show. I usually just drive one off, and then dock them right on the launch pad. This doesn\u0027t work with really big crafts or more than 2 or 3 parts though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also have to keep in mind that your mass on the launch pad might be different from the final mass. If you have a bunch of full fuel tanks they will push down on the landing legs a little bit affecting the position of the docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T04:02:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/29661-TouhouTorpedo-s-Mod-Releases-Thread-%28PITCH-VECTOR-ENGINE-ROVER-ASAS%29?highlight=modular\u002Bwheels\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETouhouTorpedo Modular Wheels\u003C/a\u003E pack has a \u0027jack\u0027 system built into it so you can lower/raise your vehicles\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mr_grr2","CreatedById":72104,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T04:14:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif they really are the same Height, it may come down to Weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe one on the right is much heavier. so would obviously sit lower by flexing the leg joints pushing the feet to the sides more and lowering it marginally.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T05:00:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NoMrBond\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NoMrBond\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/29661-TouhouTorpedo-s-Mod-Releases-Thread-%28PITCH-VECTOR-ENGINE-ROVER-ASAS%29?highlight=modular\u002Bwheels\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETouhouTorpedo Modular Wheels\u003C/a\u003E pack has a \u0027jack\u0027 system built into it so you can lower/raise your vehicles\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah but then you have to keep the vehicle sitting on the wheels, not on legs.
