Real aerobraking is a very slow, progressive process, only dipping in a tiny bit of the atmosphere at a time. Going in deeper requires more heat shielding and thus more mass. It was done very successfully by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, as one example. Coming in from an escape trajectory and slowing yourself into an orbit using the atmosphere isn\u0027t called aerobraking, also. It\u0027s called \u0022Aerocapture\u0022, which has never been performed due to the mass issues I mentioned before. In the case of the Apollo missions, there were no retroburns before entering the atmosphere. They just entered directly, keeping the G-forces down by offsetting the capsule\u0027s center of mass slightly, which allowed it to enter at a slight angle, thus producing lift - the capsule actually briefly ascended again after entering the atmosphere, in a very slight skip trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u0022Interstellar flights\u0022? Did you mean interplanetary?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. There is no \u0022limit\u0022. It just fades out to nothing very slowly, but even at the altitude of the ISS and beyond you get subtle atmospheric drag. It\u0027s almost impossible to tell a minimum limit. Around 100 km to 120 km (maybe a little low), though, is about the limit where you can make a few orbits, depending on the aerodynamic characteristics of your spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Around 11 km/s and 7.6 km/s respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Yes. In interstellar space you are still affected by the gentle gravity of the stars around you, and the supermassive black hole in the galactic center which all stars orbit around. There\u0027s no such thing as a hard-limit Sphere of Influence like you get in KSP. You\u0027re always affected by all bodies. Technically, everything in the universe is exerting a gravitational pull on you, even if it\u0027s absolutely ludicrously infinitesimally tiny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Around 400 km or so, but it changes a little bit every so often for various reasons (it frequently requires reboosting to compensate for atmospheric drag, as well as occurances such as adjusting it to make it easier for a vehicle to rendezvous. The whole altitude of it was kept lower for the sake of the shuttle, and after the shuttle was retired it was raised) It\u0027s generally an agreement between NASA and Roscosmos to maneuver the station, as the manuevering will be carried out by Russian Progress vehicles. The European ATV used to do reboosts, but that was retired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Possibly. Walter Schirra on Apollo \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E9\u003C/span\u003E 7 (thanks harbingerdawn) had some conflicts with flight controllers over his unwillingness to carry out parts of the flight plan due to the fact he was generally miserable after developing a cold. John Young and Gus Grissom smuggled a corn-beef sandwich to orbit on their Gemini flight, which the controllers were incredibly mad about. Sexual activity? Not as far as anyone knows... it would be pretty difficult to hide. There was one astronaut who kidnapped somebody, I think, but that was on the ground. I forget her name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. It hasn\u0027t ever happened, but IIRC the jurisdiction depends on what country\u0027s module you\u0027re in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Almost impossible to say. Depends on the value of the cargo, which rocket and spacecraft, etc. The shuttle was about 1.5 billion dollars per launch.

Spacecraft orbiting Mars typically enter an initial highly-elliptical orbit using their thrusters then aerobrake down over multiple passes. Landers come straight from an interplanetary trajectory to a landing, and the returning Apollo missions did similarly. What has not been done in real life is going from an interplanetary trajectory to a closed orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022In principle, the exosphere covers distances where particles are still gravitationally bound to Earth, i.e. particles still have ballistic orbits that will take them back towards Earth.

The central black hole is only a small part of that mass, except for a spacecraft in the galactic core. Because the Milky Way is a disc the orbits of stars tend to wobble up and and down as well as circling the disc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ISS\u0027s altitude varies. It can be boosted by engines, and will decay by atmospheric drag. The orientation of the solar panels is important - by putting them \u0022edge on\u0022 to the prograde vector the orbital decay can be reduced at the cost of less solar power.

A body\u0027s Hill sphere is first, not necessarily a sphere, but all the positions when the body exerts the strongest gravitational force on another body; e.g: the Sun\u0027s Hill sphere extends to about half the distance to the next star (Proxima Centauri), so ~2 ly in the direction of that star. Then, PCentauri will exerts a stronger pull on you than the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) The ISS is in a ~350-400 km orbit with an inclination of ~52\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.

Overall you\u0027re looking at several hundred million US$ for any large launch to orbit, though that tends to reduce recently, especially with SpaceX. The Apollo progam costed about $150 billion overall; and a single Saturn V launch costs ~$500M in 1969 dollars, so about $3 billion today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-19T17:10:25Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2015 05:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaarst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T17:08:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AmpsterMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AmpsterMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo explain why 100km is the \u0022you are in space\u0022\u003Cp\u003EAt 100km, the velocity required for a plane to generate enough lift is equal to orbital velocity at that altitude.
