I was building a 3-crew Mun lander to collect a big packet of science (well more of a Mun hopper really), and after doing all my dV calcs etc, realised I\u0027d neglected to plan for any means of getting my three intrepid explorers back to Kerbin. Whilst my Mun hopper should have arrived at it\u0027s destination with a healthy 3500 odd dV to go exploring with, a quick look at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_Sheet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWAC\u0027s excellent dV map\u003C/a\u003E suggested I was going to lose a good portion of this trying get back home. So, I was debating whether to place some sort of station in low Mun orbit that could manage the return trip, or accept that my Mun hopper was going to have a somewhat shortened trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the chart, we can see that (from Kerbin take-off to Mun landing), it requires around 6260 dV, which is about right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow common wisdom would have it that getting home would take about the same, less some of the 4550 dV required for the ascent from Kerbin. That leaves around say 1710 dV, which is quite a bit still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I was considering docking with a station anyhow though, let\u0027s just look at the dV to get home from a low Mun orbit (14km). According to the chart (860 \u002B 210), that\u0027s still 1070 dV, and probably a little more to deorbit from Kerbin. Another chart I looked at gave a similar estimate of around 1100 - 1200 dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that\u0027s around 1/3 of my dV. Admittedly I wouldn\u0027t need to take the whole lander back, but it was definately a bit of a downer and causing me to lean towards putting a transfer station in orbit around the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, 1100 to 1200 \u003Cem\u003Ejust didn\u0027t feel right\u003C/em\u003E, so I did a little experiment and came up with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/577888948858053355/0C23A46AE74FB9045B51BDC3565077E0D9502ACA/\u0022 alt=\u00220C23A46AE74FB9045B51BDC3565077E0D9502ACA\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, that\u0027s right, you can get back to the surface of Kerbin from a 14km Mun orbit using just 276 dV! Incidentally, for a basic 3-person capsule and 410 ISP engine, that\u0027s just 45 units of liquid fuel! Or, from the Mun\u0027s surface, that would be 916 dV. Where did all the free fuely goodness come from? I think there are two main factors that aren\u0027t obvious in the charts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) There\u0027s no need to circularise your orbit around Kerbin. You may be able to a direct descent (although I exploded from either heat or g-forces as I entered at around 3.5Km/s), but at the very least you can come in with a roughly 35km periapsis and do around 3 (automatic) aerobraking orbits before landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Launching from the Mun so that you are in a clockwise orbit around the Mun (remember, the Mun is orbiting counterclockwise around Kerbin, so when you do your Mun exit burn you want to be burning opposite to the direction of the Mun\u0027s orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say, I\u0027m now reconsidering my need to launch a transfer station prior to the main mission (although there would be other benefits too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any similar revelations?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-22T23:28:41Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2014 11:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Benno\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T23:36:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe chart numbers are for non-aerobraking transfers.
