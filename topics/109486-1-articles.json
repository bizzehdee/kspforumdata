The 1.25m LF tank holds a completely wrong amount of fuel for its size.\n\nThese are the current stats.\n\nMk-1 LF fuselage: LF - 160 \n\nFL-T400 Fuel Tank: LF - 180 Ox - 220\n\nNot only does the rocket fuel tank hold more LF than the dedicated tank, it holds the oxidiser as well.\n\nIt should probably hold somewhere between 200 and 300 LF. Accounting for its higher impact tolerance."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T16:49:23Z","Content":"What about the mass?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T16:50:36Z","Content":"Yeah the aircraft tank is very much lighter, it\u0027s not supposed to be only full of fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"bartekkru99","CreatedById":76625,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T17:28:23Z","Content":"What I would suggest is making realistic jet engines split into a compressor, combustion chamber and turbine with a nozzle, or at least making existing ones much longer, so there\u0027s not that much room to store fuel and then making existing tanks more capacious."}]}
