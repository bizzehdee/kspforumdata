(I have no idea if that was the right word to use there) The fairing made of panels around the LV-909 on the lander / capsule provides space for the landing legs, monopropellant and ather stuff you might want to put on. The side boosters show how liquid fuelled boosters that crossfeed into the core can be more effective and more efficient than SRBs, without destroying the laws of physics outright with an asparagus monstrosity. Struts are placed in key places that minimize wobble, and the landing legs are placed sideways to provide a wider and more stable stance on the ground, and be more discreet while flying, while still providing enough ground clearance to land safely.
