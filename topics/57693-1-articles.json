If you incorporate a decent size (think medium - before Rockomax) torque wheel into the rover, it will probably be good up to 20 m/s on Mun... but don\u0027t take my word for it : ) Quicksave often!

I believe rovers are for the future, for when we have all kinds of biomes on Eeloo (set a probe into its orbit just yesterday, first time for me, yay! : )...

The lower the body\u0027s gravity, the more unstable your rover will be, so putting the wheels further out from the center of mass it will have less of an inclination to roll in any particular direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The heavier your rover the more traction you will have and unless you have some kind of RCS/rocket assist you will need the traction to get up those hills and turn without just ice-skating, especially on the likes of Minmus. Likewise, you can add artificial weight to your rover by, say, putting an ion thruster on your center of mass firing upward depending upon your energy budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Switch to docking mode so you don\u0027t induce roll while just trying to steer. Just have your mouse near the button in case you flip so you can reorient yourself wheels-down before you land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Disable braking on the front wheels, so braking isn\u0027t as likely to cause you to flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Disable steering on the rear wheels. 4\u002B-wheel steering seems neat, but it actually leads to more instability in low gravity as your center of mass sways out of line with its rest position in the middle of all your wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat about covers it for stock rovers. Modded rovers can go in quite a diverse array of directions for increased control and traction. I think my favorite system I\u0027ve devised is to use Kerbal Attachment System winches with a grappling hook (front) and anchor (back) set to different action groups. Not enough traction to climb that crater rim? Fire the forward grapple and reel yourself in. It\u0027s a bit slow going, but it\u0027s pretty cheap energy-wise. Likewise if you\u0027re trying to drive down a steep hill and can\u0027t control your descent, drop the anchor (or more than one on bigger rovers) to slow yourself down and keep you pointed down-slope instead of rolling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for trying to use a science lab on a rover, that\u0027s for people far more patient than me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I just built a heavy lander with a bunch of experiments and lab and hopped from biome to biome, came back from the Mun in less than a day with almost 2k science without all the wait and drive and struggle.

As for getting large/stable rovers to the target, it\u0027s generally a case of brute force. One thing to remember though is that with enough struts your rocket doesn\u0027t have to look anything like an actual rocket. I\u0027ve seen (and launched) some truly massive rovers atop some seriously beefy rockets. In fact if you\u0027re looking for inspiration, search up the \u0027post your rover\u0027 thread, a lot of people especially with bigger rovers tend to post pictures on the launchpad/runway. The most common way to launch a big rover seems to be to put it flat across the top of the rocket so it\u0027s symmetrical-ish, rather than having the wheels stick out to one particular side.
