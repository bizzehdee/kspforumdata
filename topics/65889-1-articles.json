The twist is that it isn\u0027t actually an object in the game - it\u0027s just a non-collision object.

It could even be tweakable in the options in exactly the same way as the ground scatter: have an option of toggling it and a slider to determine how often it happens (within reason, of course). As stated earlier, it also wouldn\u0027t be too stressful in terms of performance, as it doesn\u0027t render any physics for it - each meteor would have as much effect as a piece of space debris that is only 1 part, if my logic serves me right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf any of this confuses you, please tell me.
