I\u0027m in the Tracking Center screen time warping to the intercept. Just before she enters Jool SOI I click the fly the ship button. In the midst of it switching to/loading the ship I press \u0027M\u0027 to bring up the orbital map. The ship never loads, and all I see are the sun and stars (and HUD of course). so then, I press ESC and head back to the Space Center. Now, back at Kerbin, the terrain didn\u0027t load and I can see the solar system where I should be seeing land and ocean, I\u0027m pretty sure the buildings loaded (can\u0027t fully recall. its late, and I\u0027m getting tired). Anyways, I quit the game, and load it back up. Only now Valentina is missing. No ship in tracking station, she just...disappeared. It really sucks cause I pride my Space Program on not losing the main Kerbals, and secondly, Jool is a long trip. le sigh. \n\nAnyone else had this happen to them yet? \n\nAny chance I could load some previous quicksave or something to resurrect her? I\u0027m really not keen on restarting my career over this.\n\nI\u0027m pretty bummed and gonna call it a night. Thanks for any input."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T04:24:53Z","Content":"Sounds like you ran into some form of kraken......\n\nYou could try loading from a previous quicksave."},{"CreatedByName":"MadChris48","CreatedById":112853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T11:24:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sounds like you ran into some form of kraken......\n\u003E You could try loading from a previous quicksave.\n\nI tried that , but I think after I exited and restarted the game the quicksave I had was lost."},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T11:28:29Z","Content":"Back up your persistence file. Go there. Ctrl \u002B F. Find \u0022Valentina\u0022. Find the bit where it says missing and change it to active or whatever the other Kerbals (alive) are. Reload game. Enjoy Necromanced Valentina.\n\nThis is a bug that I\u0027ve been encountering at least 3 times in 1.0 so far."}]}
