I was using an ALCOR capsule in IVA, with SCANsat up on one of its RPM MFDs (using RasterPropMonitor-dev19), orbiting Jool and getting the lovely map of static. I was on a transfer orbit to Bop, and the instant I entered its SoI (I had already fully scanned it with the three included antenna on an earlier probe) KSP froze--or so I thought initially. Its frame rate had actually dropped to about 1/15 (that\u0027s 1 frame every 15 seconds). At first I thought this was just related to changing SoIs while in IVA, but it happens even if I only enter IVA after changing SoIs.\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s odd is IVA worked perfectly as long as I removed SCANsat\u0027s map from all of the MFDs, and SCANsat would still work perfectly if I used it in its normal windowed mode. So, I\u0027m assuming this is some problem related to interaction between SCANsat and RPM or ALCOR, or all three. But, where do I start debugging such a problem? Nothing shows up in the log and attempting to do anything in KSP at such an insanely slow framerate is nearly impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s odd.
