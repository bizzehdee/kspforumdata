You can get away with really fast burns to change your orbits, but trying to land with quick burns is a recipe for disaster. Slooooow, loooooong burns at precise angles is the name of the game. I use MechJeb to assist me in this; the actual landing autopilot is way too far off for my purposes, but using a combination of the Translatron\u0027s KEEP VERT function and Smart A.S.S., using SURF for most of the way, and RETR GRAD when I\u0027m really close and want to set-down, I can usually land within \u002B/- 1 degree of latitude and longitude of my intended landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E entirely possible to land without MechJeb\u0027s help, but goodness does it ever make life easier by taking the load off your brain.
