Sure you can do that, but need to hover the mouse over the target ship to know how far you are of it ... what do you mean you want the move the mouse ( for change the image orientation )? Why would you ever do such a thing ? :/ And why the hell would you even think of doing a docking in map mode?

Ok you can see that intel in the VAB, the SPH, the main menu or the Mission control ( or in flight ). But you better engrave in your mind what missions you have avaliable if you want to go to the tracking station ( for ,you know, go to the ship that has the ability to fulfill that mission that you already launched, but had to do something else in between ) because you can\u0027t access it there. And what do you mean you want to know outside of the Mission control what are the rewards of a contract, you lazy sod? Do you actually want to know if the reward you acepted is worthwhile enough to do a mission solely for that contract ? Why would anyone want to do that ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Science archives you can know from what situations you recovered science from.
