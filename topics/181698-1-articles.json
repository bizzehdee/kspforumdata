I play ksp 1.3.1, and after intensive testing, I found that ppds are no scrubbing at all, and ECLSS process exactly 99% of a kerbals breathing. The biggewt problem is that, althought I can set 3 slots of a ECLSS to scrubbing, two ECLSS dont stack, so I will never be able to put more than 2 kerbals in a ship! Anyone has experienced something similar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-26T12:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest asking on the kerbalism thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rauko","CreatedById":188489,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-26T12:55:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are right, done!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-26T15:31:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread moved to Tech Support for Modded Installs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
