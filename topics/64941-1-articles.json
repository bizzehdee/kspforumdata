While trying to build an SSTO I noticed a very odd behaviour in MJ. Wenn I launch directly into or close to the orbit of my target and then fire the rendez-vous autopilot, it increases apo- and periapsis ~200km over the targets orbit and then plots a plan to intersect from this orbit with my target. But when I select an orbit far below my target it rendez vous directly into the targets orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy stations for example is at 640km. When I launch my SSTO into a 600km orbit and select the RV autopilot to reach my station, MJ would put me in an 800KM orbit first. But when I launch into a 400km orbit and then start RV autopilot, it puts me directly in the 640km orbit of my station. Same is true for targets in 270km hight, I need to launch first into a 125km orbit or otherwise I need enough DeltaV to get into a 400km orbit and back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I doing something wrong? I can do manual Hohmann from 600km to get to 640km without any problems. Even with the Rendez Vous planer of MJ (not autopilot) I can select Hohmann transfer to target and I reach my station just fine, it doesnt tell me to burn up until my apo is at 800km - so why is the autopilot doing it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is quite bugging me as my focus lies entirely on building, I don\u0027t want to spend my time Hohmanning manually all the time, at least not yet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E So for now I just launch into 200km below target orbit and then auto RV to my target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope someone can clarify that for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehave fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T13:06:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt does that to decrease the synodic period, which is the period the two vessels have their closest approach to one another. Of course you can always get a rendezvous with a vessel in a 640 km orbit by launching into a 635 km orbit, but if both are on opposite sides of the planet, it\u0027s going to take a really, really, really, REALLY - did I mention \u0022really?\u0022 - long time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"milosh","CreatedById":104352,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T17:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay I see, so MJ does what is most time- but not necessarily fuel efficient. In this example though I didn\u0027t have to wait that long by doing it manually, only 8 hours to warp through while the AP skipped like 2 hours only and with an SSTO, fuel is more important to me than some warp\u0027able hours.
