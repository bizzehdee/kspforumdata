It might be a brown dwarf or our instruments got something wrong but estimates say its around 986592 km in diameter. That is comparable to the Sun. So IRL it is 136 ly away but we can scale that down to 50 ly just to make travel easier. There is also a possible second planet in the system, its diameter is unknown so we kind of just have to improvise, the only thing we know about the possible second planet is that it is more massive than its brother but smaller. A final thing to note is that this system is very young, basically when the first humans appeared on Earth is when HD 100546 b formed which is only about 300,000 years ago. So these planets will be very hot. That\u0027s all I can think of maybe there could be a few additional moons for these planets to make it more entertaining. Have a good day.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022maxresdefault.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UIeoggqzSGM/maxresdefault.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
