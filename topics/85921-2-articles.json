There\u0027s the planets, which are the large, singular objects in roughly circular orbits without any chance of an orbit-altering encounter with another body; and there\u0027s the asteroids, KBOs, and comets, which are all part of families of similar objects orbiting in similar orbits (which are usually highly inclined and eccentric). The current classification says a lot about the history of those bodies, since all the planets formed on nice round orbits, and scattered everything else into inclined eccentric orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crubs\u0022 data-cite=\u0022crubs\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeesh, I didn\u0027t realize pluto was that inclined.
