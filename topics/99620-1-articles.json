One pair of docking ports will have the real, primary connection, and the other pairs have a secondary \u0022self\u0022 docking connection where the parts aren\u0027t parented with each other, but there is a fixed physics joint between them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut I didn\u0027t know you could create these secondary docking connections at any point (so long as you can move docking points around, e.g. with Infernal Robotics).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMods used:\u003Cbr\u003E* DROMOMAN robotic arm parts \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37680-DROMOMAN-modular-arm-parts-for-Damned-Infernal-Robotics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37680-DROMOMAN-modular-arm-parts-for-Damned-Infernal-Robotics\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* Infernal Robotics \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-90-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Infernal-Robotics-0-19-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-90-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Infernal-Robotics-0-19-3\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T06:43:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell now, that\u0027s pretty cool.

That has previously been a recipe for problems and infact InfernalRobotics has a big bold notice on the first page saying that doing this will make your life miserable. What normally happens when you dock a port on a hinged arm is that the hinges, pistons etc that sit between the docking port and the crafts root part will get messed up (reset to weird impossible positions or become fixed so they can\u0027t move anymore).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past I\u0027ve gone to odd lengths to work around that because having a movable docking port like this is so useful for base assembly, cargo arms etc. Unfortunately the best solution I\u0027ve had no longer works because it requires a now deprecated functionality from KAS (being able to set a winch to \u0022undocked mode\u0022). That enabled the docking port on the end of the arm to be treated as if it was a separate craft and then docking didn\u0027t cause problems to the robotics parts. The other solution is to use the KAS magnet instead of a docking port, but that used to be problematic too. Last time I used that approach the magnet had been improved and it worked fine, but it used to often result in parts being ripped off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if because its docking to itself, rather than to another craft, if that is the reason it hasn\u0027t caused problems for you.
