Since 1.0.x came out I went back and revisited all the part mods I was running while waiting for updates. Tantares got update very quickly so I tried it out - now I don\u0027t want to give it up it\u0027s so wonderful. Includes numerous pods including 1.25m 2 kerbal pods as well as station parts for building Russian style stations. The work is beautiful as well so I\u0027d check it out. The two packs offered are Tantares (Soyuz/MIR) and Tantares LV (Proton\u002Bother stuff). The LV version has most of the lift engines/tanks and the standard version has the pods and orbital engines. You can always pick and choose the pieces you want so I\u0027d check both of them out - personally I run both and I\u0027m currently not looking for other part mods to use at the moment. Very good stuff. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
