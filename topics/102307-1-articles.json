Like all great challenges the fun is in the constraints and limitations that have to be overcome. Kerbal and Duna provide some physical limits. Sturmstiger has added some well thought out natural seeming constraints, most obviously a flexible LKO mass budget scheme based on the idea of industrial capacity. You must use a single Kerbin to LKO launcher design, it\u0027s payload mass to orbit determines how often you can launch, 2 days per ton between launches. So 30 tons to orbit means you can launch every 60 days ( or every 45 days if your launcher is more than 50% re-usable ). Various safety, mobility, and robustness constraints can be added to your taste. Mod usage is very open, no magic drives - but very permissive.\n\nI had taken a run at the challenge focusing on maximising Primary Score. It\u0027s not really what the challenge is about but I was having trouble trading off (for example) safety and score. I got \u0027stuck\u0027 in 0.25 with some mods not really working (Deadly Reentry I\u0027m looking at you - though to be fair it was probably me). I decided to get the Primary Score MinMax \u0027out of my system\u0027 on a stock 0.25.\n\nNow I\u0027d like to take a more nuanced approach, to play with some of the mods out there, make some fun engineering solutions, and preferably have it all flyable.\n\nMy goal is a real-ish-tic plan to do in depth science, learn as much as possible about Duna in the 4000 KDays. Last time I looked the game\u0027s science system didn\u0027t seem that true to life, and I\u0027d be doing sandbox anyway, so I\u0027ll use \u0027scientist astronauts\u0027 on Duna as my proxy for science. Similarly I\u0027ll add some extra constraints:\n\n**The Four Man Rule:**\n\nLighthouses always had a three man crew - one to be in trouble, one to try to help, and one to tell the tale after it all went terribly wrong. There were quite a few cases where the lighthouse was found mysteriously unmanned. One more must be safer - right? Also four fits nicely with the various Hitchhikers and crew cabins. So four is my minimum number of Kerbals in a team.\n\n**The Belt and Suspenders Rule:**\n\nextend the original \u0027crew survives the loss of a single engine\u0027 to also survive the loss/failure of a single parachute. As far as is reasonable I\u0027d similarly guard against failures of single components. I\u0027m not too sure how far I can should push that.\n\n**The Really Robust Rule:**\n\na failure of a single spacecraft or surface module / vehicle will not prevent the accomplishment of a mission milestone. For example if the goal is to get a crew up for a particular return flight and an ascent vehicle is lost/malfunctioning there should be another available, or if the milestone is to get a Duna scan-sat network up on the first flight then the loss of any one satellite should not prevent the network getting all the requried scans.\n\nI\u0027ll use any mods that can make the mission architecture as near future real-ish-tic as possible, some kind of retro 1970s near future. For example I\u0027ll use Deadly Reentry and TACLS.\n\nA lot of the fun is in figuring out how to achieve the goals, so I plan to post the development process of the mission plan and the vehicles and engineering required to achieve the plan, and then finally the flights themselves.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T22:49:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 10:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DBowman**"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T00:53:37Z","Content":"To maximize mass to LKO over time the Kerbin Launch Vehicle has to be \u0027re-usable\u0027 ( \u003E 50% of KLV weight can be recovered undamaged). I\u0027m content to do a simple passive \u0027chute and forget\u0027 recovery, though I\u0027ve seen some nice Space-X style \u0022land the launch vehicle at KSC\u0022.\n\nThe key question is how big a KLV to build, we can launch every 1.5 \\* PayloadMass Earth Days.\n\nThe K2D windows happen every 228 Earth Days. If your KLV launch period does not \u0027go into\u0027 228 then some windows will get more mass than others. This is \u0027okay\u0027 but does make mission planning more complex, either you have some kind of modular Kerbin Duna Xfer Vehicle, or you have a \u0027packing problem\u0027 where something you want to send is too massy and has to be split across DKXVs. 150 tons fits perfectly into the windows and has no \u0027packing problem\u0027.\n\nAlso given the off K-D window start and the 1000 Earth Day end of challenge your KLV payload size can affect your total mass to LKO in the 1000 days. For example with the 30 ton KLV I already have the first window gets 60 ton and the rest get 150 ton = 660 ton total. A 50 ton KLV would get 650 ton total. If the program went \u0027forever\u0027 then this cutoff effect would not happen and any KLV size would deliver the same mass to LKO. Since the challenge is \u0022Duna **Permanent** ... \u0022 I\u0027m not going to optimize for the effect of the 1000 day cutoff and off D2K transfer window start. I\u0027ll just pick a mass that makes sense from a mission planning point of view.\n\nI guess a minor point is less launches makes the program more \u0027fly-able\u0027, also nukes make each KD transfer more flyable (as well as real-ish-tic).\n\nI looked into how reasonable it is to build a 150 ton KLV, firstly here are some real world comparable launchers:\n\n- Energia: 100 ton to LEO, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energia) was 2400 ton on the pad, payload doing final insertion, totally reusable - landed the parts, built in the 1980s.\n- Long March: 130 ton to LEO, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long\\_March\\_(rocket\\_family)#Long\\_March\\_9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March_%28rocket_family%29#Long_March_9) currently in development.\n- StaurnV: 120 ton to LEO [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\\_V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V) from the 1960s 3000 ton on the pad.\n- SLS-2: 130 ton to LEO [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\\_Launch\\_System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System) block-2 under development.\n\nSo 150 ton looks \u0027large\u0027 but not ridiculous.\n\nI built a proof of concept, it just gets up:\n\n![HxEEYBZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/HxEEYBZ.png)\n\nNote:\n\n- Three Mainsail cluster on the final stage, 9 total. It looks a little clunky, maybe 2 KR-2L extra large engines would do it (better TWR, worse ISP), but would be even clunkier.\n- Asparagus staging.\n- Orange tanks - they have the best wet to dry weight ratio.\n- Borderline TWR on most stages\n- Fuel drop tanks.\n\n For Mission Robustness and Crew Safety I want to ensure that even if 1 KLV fails I still get a payload with life support to the Dunauts every Hohmann transfer. That eliminates using a 150 ton KLV - 75 tons would deliver on Robustness, Safety, and Fly-ability. This proof of concept looks much more reasonable:\n\n![nFeHLGe.png](http://i.imgur.com/nFeHLGe.png)\n\nNote:\n\n- Two Mainsail cluster, 6 total.\n- Asparagus staging.\n- Nice TWR on all stages.\n- Some excess deltaV to support adding recovery hardware.\n- My first transfer will be limited to 75 tons to establish the program on Duna.\n- 45 Earth Days are \u0027wasted\u0027 before the first KD transfer window. This is 20% of the period between transfers, so it\u0027s significant, but I\u0027m not optimizing for the start / end of the challenge.\n\nI\u0027m sure I can make it re-usable etc so I\u0027m going to leave it as a proof for now and move onto mission planning the KLV payloads; Duna Kerbin Xfer Vehicle, and Duna payloads. I\u0027m targeting: emergency Duna-Kerbin return (requires also Duna ascent), scan-sat survey to prep for Duna descent, sat comms network, Mars Direct style fuel generation on Duna surface, Duna Space Center (Remote Tech \u0027like\u0027), Mobile Duna Manned Science Teams, \u0026 Duna Unmanned Science Thingies.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T01:24:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 01:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DBowman**"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T01:26:58Z","Content":"My Kerbin Launch Vehicle will have 75 ton payload mass, ideally none of that mass would be for a Duna Kerbin Xfer Vehicle or the Kerbin-Duna transfer fuel. A reusable DKXV takes care of part of the problem, using in-situ resources to produce fuel on Duna takes care of the rest.\n\nLike Mars Direct ( [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars\\_Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct) ) we can produce fuel on Duna from Hydrogen brought from Kerbin and CO2 from the Duna atmosphere. On Mars 8 ton of H2 can produce 112 ton of fuel and oxidizer - so not free but a big saving. If a Duna H2O source were available we could arrange free by electrolizing water to H2 and O2. I\u0027ll plan on bringing H2 to produce enough fuel \u0026 oxidizer on Duna to cover the Duna - Kerbin - Duna transfer cycle.\n\n( I didn\u0027t realize Mars Direct called for spinning the Hab and Booster twice a minute on a 150m tether to produce Mars surface \u0027gravity\u0027! scary\n\nDuna 0.3g\nhttp://www.artificial-gravity.com/sw/SpinCalc/\n[http://www.artificial-gravity.com/sw/SpinCalc/](http://www.artificial-gravity.com/sw/SpinCalc/)\nhttp://www.artificial-gravity.com/sw/SpinCalc/\n=\u003E 270m @1/min, 68m @ 2/min - hmm something to think about )\n\nIt costs 4500m/s to get fuel from KSC to LKO and only 1400 \u002B (700 using nukes) to get it there from Duna (so \u0027like\u0027 1750m/s correcting for 800 ISP of nukes). Getting the H2 to Duna eats some of that. I haven\u0027t worked out the break even on the cost of getting the Duna Resource Processing \u0026 Ascent Vehicles to Duna - but I won\u0027t need that many and if the program goes \u0027forever\u0027 it\u0027s bound to break even before then.\n\nThe first (single) fully Duna fueled KDXV would arrive at Kerbin on Earth Day 331, the subsequent 495 Kerbin-Duna would have half the flight fueled for free, the first pair of Duna fueled DKXV would arrive at Kerbin on day 559, day 723 would be the first Kerbin Duna trip with no fuel required from Kerbin. At that point the program is fully established.\n\nSo I need a nuke powered DKXV that get itself full of fuel from Duna to Kerbin, aero-capture, then push 75 tons back to Duna, aero-capture, and do a bit of maneuvering. Any leg could be manned so I have to add the 25% deltaV Crew Safety allowance, on an unmanned trip I could either under-fuel it or store any excess/leftover fuel in an LKO fuel dump. For Crew Safety it should have at least 2 nukes, and be able to fly / abort safely with a single engine.\n\nHere is my method to figure out the vehicle: first sketch something to push 75 ton to Duna (1200 \u002B 300 Crew Safety \u002B 100 maneuver = 1600 m/s), rip the payload off \u0026 note the new unrealistic deltaV, add 700 \u002B 175 Crew Safety \u002B100 maneuver m/s, tweak the transfer part to meet that new deltaV. That should be able to push the fuel to Kerbin, 100 m/s for maneuvering, connect to a payload, push it back to Duna, 100 m/s for maneuvering.\n\n![c7iG1r8.png](http://i.imgur.com/c7iG1r8.png)\n\n4 \\* 360s \u002B 340 fuel will get 1599 m/s @0.22 TWR\n\n![VfMmPut.png](http://imgur.com/VfMmPut.png)\n\nrip off the payload =\u003E 7569 m/s =\u003E I need need 8544 m/s\n\n![Gy9zAcV.png](http://imgur.com/Gy9zAcV.png)\n\nby just filling all the tanks I got 8544 - ... a co-incidence!\n\nOf course I also forgot to put placeholders for avionics etc. need to add SAS etc =\u003E add a 90. So a little over 3/4 of an Orange tank \u002B 4 nukes. The TWR should be okay for KD transfer, even on three engines. \n\nThis is pretty finely tuned so when we start pushing kerbals back to Kerbin, or doing \u0027sample returns\u0027 those \u0027payload\u0027 \u0027units\u0027 may have have to carry their own fuel tanks to make up for their extra mass - or I may decide to add more fuel tanks to the KDXV.\n\nNow I need to confirm that aerocapture at Duna and Kerbin don\u0027t need heat shields - it makes the vehicles much simpler. I\u0027ve just started using Deadly Reentry, it\u0027s neat how it shows you the temperature of the parts. I\u0027ve burned a few vehicles reentering Kerbin atmosphere so I guess it\u0027s installed and working okay.\n\nDuna AC test entered SOI: 45134 km 976 m/s desire 250 km =\u003E 11940 m Pe ( thanks to [http://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/](http://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/) )\n\n![ihkxa27.png](http://imgur.com/ihkxa27.png)![CSNxoGj.png](http://imgur.com/CSNxoGj.png)\n\nHit atmos @1600 m/s - peak temp 485 @12000m 3rd can back is cold. The pics are from about 12000 m, close to max heating. Nukes are rated to 4000, tanks to 1400.\n\nSo all looks safe for Duna.\n\nReturn to Kerbin: entered SOI; 83540 km 864 m/s desire 80 =\u003E 32575 m\n\n![aRZYieN.png](http://imgur.com/aRZYieN.png)![VzYUhjF.png](http://imgur.com/VzYUhjF.png)![LrUStkA.png](http://imgur.com/LrUStkA.png)\n\nWell this is a little different! The engines maxed at 1200 deg @ 32 km, first tanks like 850, the rest \u0027cold\u0027. Solar cells arrays unfolded etc okay after.\n\nFor the real flights I\u0027ll be less aggressive \u0026 take care to tuck things away behind fuel tanks.\n\nNote to self - don\u0027t forget all three kinds of antenna; omni, long range, \u0026 interplanetary.\n\nNext I want to sketch out the first flight, targeting:\n\n- Crew Safety via unassisted immediate return from LDO and Duna surface.\n- Crew Safety via life support to cover a missed Kerbin Duna Hohmann transfer.\n- and as much non Crew Safety as will fit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T07:36:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 07:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DBowman**"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T02:06:27Z","Content":"Since I have 75 ton Launchers I can rely on getting life support to Duna surface elements every transfer - so they need 228 ED (912 KD) on the surface, and and extra 64 ED (256 KD) for the initial transfer.\n\nMy original plan was 4 man teams in \u0022Mobile Homes\u0022, but TACLS recycling is very heavy and works for 8.

I like the idea of doing the Telecommuter also, give DSC something to do - but I\u0027ll look at that after knowing hat the mass budget looks like after manned landings. \n\nI played around with a few stacked designs, and designs with the life support stuff at the center, I decided to go with the classic snake/train. Wheel heights were a bit of a pain, Kerbin testing doesn\u0027t help when Duna has 0.3 G and the suspensions are different ( I guess ) between Landing Gear (neater to fit things together \u0026 lower power ( 0 ) requirements ) and Ruggadized Wheels.

Remote Tech tutorial on omi network ([http://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech/tutorials/c16network/](http://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech/tutorials/c16network/)) has 4 satellites @ 770 km. Scan Sat SAR scanner has 750 km optimal altitude. If I had 3 satellites they would be at 120 degrees separation. Duna radius is 320 km, so 2\\*( (750 \u002B 320) \\* sin 60) = 1854 km between satellites. This is well in range for omi directional antenna. So I can use 3 communications satellites with 1 backup.\n\nAlso at 750 km altitude I can piggy back SAR scanner on two of the communication satellites.\n\nDown to 10 satellites.\n\nRadar and Multispectral are content to work at the same altitude, so I can pair them up, 2 satellites rather than four.\n\nDown to 8: 2 comms \u002B 2 (comms \u002B SAR) \u002B 2 (Radar \u002B Multispectral) \u002B 2 interplanetary = 4.44 ton.\n\nThe minimal Ion has way more DeltaV than required. A single \u0027tug\u0027 could take them to their orbit and leave it there. They would drift over time, but Flight 2 could bring more tugs to correct them. I expect the first tug would be able to keep essential satellites on station until then.\n\nFor robustness we\u0027d have 2 tugs. An ion less sat masses 0.185 t, best case total mass is 8\\*0.185 \u002B 2\\* 555 = 2.59 ton saving over 60% of the naive mass.\n\nHere are all the satellites except the interplanetary ones, massing 2.4 ton so probably all up will be 3.0 ton. If I have spare mass (ha!) I\u0027ll fake the graviometry pair.\n\n![o0c9jUeh.png](http://i.imgur.com/o0c9jUeh.png)\n\nYou cannot see some of the coms sats also have medium range directional antenna for talking to the IP sats. There is an ion engine at each end, only one will operate, the other is a backup. \n\nThe flight pan for placing the satellites is:\n\n- get the \u0027stack\u0027 into an inclined (more polar the better for scans, \u0027ok\u0027 for comms) 250km orbit\n- drop a Radar\u002BMultisensor\n- -dV, wait, \u002BdV will tune the separation - just so they don\u0027t scan the same track\n- drop the second one\n- Ap to 750 \u0026 circularize\n- drop a com sat\n- -dV, wait, \u002BdV to tune separation to 120 degrees, take care to match period very well\n- repeat for 2 more comm sats\n- Ap high\n- drop an interplanetary comm sat\n- -dV, wait, \u002BdV to tune IP sat separation.\n\nOK time to mass budget the first flight to:\n\n- get there\n- scan for sites\n- land \u0026 drive around\n- supplies until the next transfer arrives from Kerbin\n- \u0027bug out\u0027 if necessary at the first Kerbin return window and get home (Ancient Duna vampire mummies or funding cuts)\n\n47.5 ton budget\n\n- 2 \\* BigSab \u002B H2 = 12.67 ton\n\n= 34.83 ton\n\n- sats = 3 ton\n\n= 31.83 ton left\n\n- 19.2 mobile home DSC edition\n\n= 12.63 ton left\n\n- 2\\*DAV (dry\u002BH2) = 6.56 ton\n\n= 6.07 ton left\n\n- 3\\*cabincrew as return transfer hab \u002B 1 DAV gives space for 8\n\n= about zero\n\nLife Support for the return trip: Large Hex food \u002B 2 regular O2 \u002B Hex Water \u002B Small Water = 80d water \u002B 355d F\u0026O = 1.5 ton\n\nso 1.5 ton over - grrrrrr or 2 ton if use I use the big 16 crew Cabin.\n\nokay a 76 ton launcher fits Hohmann window better, but still 0.5 - 1.0 ton over - I guess it will have to self circularize, it has space for the fuel.\n\nhmm real life water purify plant ? TACLS = 3 ton - too heavy?\n\n[http://www.marsjournal.org/contents/2006/0005/files/rapp_mars_2006_0005.pdf](http://www.marsjournal.org/contents/2006/0005/files/rapp_mars_2006_0005.pdf) says 6 man 500 day non advanced water (water buffer \u002B purify?) \u0022Integrated Water Recovery System\u0022 = 4.5 =\u003E 6 for 8 crew and \u0022Vapor Phase Catalytic Ammonia Removal System\u0022 as half that = 3 ton. GRRR TACLS seems \u0027realistic\u0027. Though Kerbals are smaller than us, Zubrin suggested taking smaller astronauts so the life support mass would be lower (or the crew could be more numerous).\n\nWell very very close, just 2% over \u0027nominal payload\u0027, and all the capability I wanted. No doubt something will go wrong putting the \u0027final version\u0027 together.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T14:01:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 02:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DBowman**"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T12:33:44Z","Content":"\u0022Whether \u0027tis Nobler in the mind to suffer the Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune.

So good if you want to insulate yourself - but bad if you want to spread the heat out. Likewise docking ports.\n\nSo I tried plugging something that could be a heat sink(xenon tank) with some radiators (canards) on the engines and then via oct strut to the fuel:\n\n![ULKoKfF.png](http://i.imgur.com/ULKoKfF.png)\n\nscience fictiony right? especially when the canards try to do attitude control in orbit. But useless....\n\nHow about radial attachment points, they are designed to be used like this so maybe squad put heat transfer in:\n\n![aLjIiGD.png](http://i.imgur.com/aLjIiGD.png)\n\nnope - the engines are just about to explode / throttle back and the fuel is still very cool.\n\nOk - how about using the fuel as a heat dump directly like it wants by connecting the engine to the fuel tank connection node and then cluster tank and engine units:\n\n![0ik7Ngr.png](http://i.imgur.com/0ik7Ngr.png)\n\nHere you can see it just finishing 700 m/s burn. The engines are almost overheating and the fuel is at 1700 degrees - lucky it\u0027s not combustible!\n\nI can work with 700 m/s burns - to get to Duna just do two burns on consecutive orbits; 450 \u0026 600 say. The potential idiocy of using fuel as a heat sink up to 1700 degrees bothers me a little, but it balances out the suspicion that the engines are not meant to get so hot so quick anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:48:39Z","Content":"I decided to stick with 0.90 for now. 1.x had been thrashing features a bit - like removing heat from nukes...\n\nI put together all the parts for the first flight. As you\u0027d expect it is some 6 tons over weight ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) I have to stick to 76 ton since that lines up so perfectly with the transfer windows. The challenge rules allow the payload to circularize so I\u0027ll try that before cutting anything from the payload.\n\nOdd things that came up while \u0027just putting some chutes things to make them recoverable\u0027:\n\n- The first stage wants to lands right back on the pad, but sometimes on the edge or the ramp... so you have to tweak the ascent a little.\n- MechJeb won\u0027t stage if there is any fuel in the stage, even if it\u0027s disabled. Staging manually turns of auto pilot.\n- I needed some legs for the first stage but none are long enough - I-beam to the rescue.\n- The second stage would land fine in the water, then slowly capsize and explode - I had to split the fuel to make a short fat tank.\n- I couldn\u0027t \u0027split fuel out\u0027 to evenly fill the side tanks on the second stage - so they are built like mini asparagus stages - any one know if there is a neater way to do that?\n- After leaving the payload in a 80x80 the third stage re-enters fine sitting on it\u0027s engine bell, DRE shows it hot but not too hot. Couple of chutes and some landing fuel and this would be 100% re-usable.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

So it looks like I am going to have to simplify the construction of a few things; e.g. swap out mass-less cubic oct struts for landing legs, use TACLS containers as structure. \n\nHere is the First flight payload \u0027just stacked on end\u0027, with the lifter under it it practically pokes out of the top of the VAB.\n\n![QhjbThu.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/QhjbThu.png?1)"},{"CreatedByName":"Curiosity7907","CreatedById":154220,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T14:21:39Z","Content":"I am having something strange with duna can anyone please tell.\n\nNormaly many versions ago from 0.17 to 0.23.5 or 0.24.2 duna\u0027s atmosphere at the top was red then yellow then white that time.But today at the latest version of the game I can\u0027t see any color stripes just like previously all I can see is fully black atmosphere with a little white line."}]}
