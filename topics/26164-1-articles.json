I\u0027m aware this question has been asked before (I\u0027ve done some extensive googling), but I\u0027m still having trouble even after lots of reading. I\u0027d like to get a command module directly above KSC to act as a RemoteTech relay. The best I\u0027ve been able to do on my own was an orbit with an AP~2900km/PE~2600km/INC 0*. This was workable but not optimal since it would occasionally go out of contact with KSC. I\u0027ve tried using MechJeb\u0027s Ascent Guidance set to 2868km but this ends up putting the module (If I recall correctly) 90* away from KSC. How can I use MechJeb to get it directly above KSC? I\u0027m using MechJeb v2.0.7, RemoteTech v0.5.0.0, and ISA MapSat v3.3.4. In the meantime I\u0027m going to continue trying manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"corvus2606","CreatedById":57190,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T20:23:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eput your module into a 100km orbit around kerbin, then set up a manoeuvre to be executed when you\u0027re on the opposite side of the planet from KSC. when you burn at that point out to 2868km approx, you will end up within tolerance of being above the KSC, then circularise and you\u0027re done\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T20:56:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECoincidentally, I just performed the exact same mission a day ago. As corvus said, you\u0027re gonna want to first get into a parking orbit and then initiate your transfer burn on the other side of the planet. While it might theoretically be possible to launch in some way that you raise your initial apoapse to kerbostationary altitude in a single burn, it would likely involve some strange \u002B/- radial aiming to get the longitude correct. I\u0027m unsure if MechJeb 2 has any functionality for this, and I know the previous version doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasiest to just set it up with maneuver nodes from a parking orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T21:04:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs long as you know the required altitude, then you\u0027ll have no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere am I (almost perfectly) doing it back in 0.12(?), where \u003Cem\u003Ethere are no such things as mechjeb and maneuver nodes\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9GZyxn6HiA8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fyrem","CreatedById":57131,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T21:22:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhile this is a horribly wastefull (fuel) method, it will work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*set desired alt to 2868k\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*edit flight path to Start turn: 2868, end turn 2868, shape: doesn\u0027t matter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elaunch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein other words, fligh STRAIGHT UP till 2868, then circ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(ok, you won\u0027t be EXACTLY above KSP, but will be darn close).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce MJ is done, open up the Orbital Info page.. look for Orbital speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse RCS or a low power engine and adjust your Orbital period (burn prograde/retrograde) as needed to get an Orbital period of 21,600.000s, or 6h 0m 0s, or one Kerbin day\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe Orbital period is what you really want to get right, do not worry if your AP/PE are off a bit, as it is the \u0022time it takes your sat to orbit\u0022 that must match KSP\u0027s \u0022day\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-09T21:27:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2013 09:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Fyrem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
