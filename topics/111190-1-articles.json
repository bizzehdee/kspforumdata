You mean Phil Plait, the Bad Astronomer? Of course he is, what rock have you been living under. (He\u0027s also a big fan of space, a guest rogue on SGU, he\u0027s the, you know, *Bad Astronomer.*) He\u0027s actually an astronomer, not some video guy on spouting off on Youtube like Veritas and V Sauce. He\u0027s written lots of books, is a major science communicator. Next you\u0027ll tell us than some random guy who happens to run the Hayden Planetarium might\u0027ve heard of KSP. Yeah, and people may have heard of him, too. (Cosmos, etc)"}]}
