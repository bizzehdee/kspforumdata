My advice is to throw caution to the wind (heh). Try editing the parachute parameters such that it activates as soon as you stage it, regardless of safety. I recommend using a probe core instead of a kerbal, though, as it sounds like the requirements of this contract are going to leave them in a death spiral, unless you add secondary parachutes to land safely after the test.
