If the answer is yes, I recommend you to use the \u0022Crew Manifest\u0022 plugin, it adds the, for me, basic function to move kerbals from one module to another inside a ship or station, as they are supposed to be able to do if it where a real ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zxczxczbfg","CreatedById":74636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T01:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there\u0027s a mod out there that allows you to detach and relocate stock radial parts from EVA, You could install it, fly another \u0027naut over to the station, and simply move the RCS block by hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"superdude14862","CreatedById":64727,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T01:48:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t mind the debug menu, you could probably use whack-a-kerbal to shoot off the RCS block. If you\u0027re going to do that, make sure to quick save before. If you want to stay without the debug menu, a splashdown would most likely destroy the RCS port, but i question the structural integrity of docking a parachute module.
