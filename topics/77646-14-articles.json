Surprisingly, NEE-01 survives the event and electronics remain 100% operative, due the heavy ant radiation shielding known as NEMEA and invented by EXA, but the HERMES-A ground station is unable to decode the transmission due a huge polarity error, After 5 days of monitoring and evaluation EXA finds out that the satellite is recoverable, on May 28 the Mission Directorate starts the PERSEUS recovery operation, with a nominal duration of 3 months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn July 2013, EXA\u0027s Space Operations team realizes that it will not be possible to recover the signal of the NEE-01 from ground, but it should be possible to do that from an space based platform, then begins the PERSEUS project: The design, construction, installation and testing of a micro repeater unit onboard de NEE-02, which was being readied to be launched in November.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn August 28, EXA concludes the signal recovery operation for the NEE-01 PEGASUS, which transmitted successfully until May 23 before sustaining a close approach with debris from an old soviet rocket, the satellite is put into hibernation mode, but not completely shutdown, its reentry into the atmosphere is predicted for the year 2023.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovember 21, 2013 at 02h10m11s local time, the NEE-02 KRYSAOR, second Ecuadorian satellite lifts off towards the orbit onboard a Russian Dnepr RS20B, this launch becomes world record for injecting 33 satellites into orbit at once, at 02h25m13s the NEE-02 KRYSAOR is delivered into its planned orbit.
