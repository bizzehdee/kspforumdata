Now, I know I could just not use them, but frankly most of the fun in the game is just building the ships for me, and I\u0027m really awful at the flying so normally I let MechJeb handle that for me. Right now I can\u0027t do that. They oscillate like crazy while flying, they tip over as they\u0027re leaving the atmosphere, and it seems to have forgotten how to do a circularization burn properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo these mods just not play well together, even with the patch? Is there a setting I should change? Should I just not use FAR if I want to rely on MechJeb for ascent?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny answers or information at all would be really helpful, thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-12T12:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechJeb with FAR definitely needs other settings than without FAR.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor me it works when I limit the AoA in MechJebs Ascent Guidance to 3\u00B0 or even less in extreme cases.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, enable corrective steering and limit speed to termial velocity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLet MechJeb not turn the rocket below 4 km. (edit ascent path).\u003Cbr\u003E\nMake sure your rocket is inherently stable by looking at the center of mass and center of lift. CoL should be as far away as possible from the CoM and CoM should be in front of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEspecially when the first stages tanks are empty, there should still be some margin between the CoL and CoM to reduce the tendency to flip. But I guess you already know that.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso use struts to make your rocket stiffer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMechJeb has a hard time getting your rocket to space if it bends like a sausage during ascent.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLimit your engines power if necessary to get a TWR of 1.5 to 2.5 for the ascent stage(s).\u003Cbr\u003E\nPersonally, I try to achieve a starting TWR of 2.2 or so for the lower ascent stages (SRB boosters and primary LFO ascent stage).\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd I usually do the initial angle correction of just 5 degree or so myself at 3-4 km and activate MechJeb not until I reach 10 km.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis will cause a not 100% optimal gravity turn, but for me it helps to prevent MechJeb to turn the rocket too early\u003Cbr\u003E\nand thus causing stability issues because of the still low speed at 3-4 km.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(As the ascent path set in the ascent path editor never seemed to be respected by MechJeb for some reason. At least that\u0027s what I expierience.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have to tweak those settings I gave here for your own ascent technique.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut for me it works OK like so.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut nonetheless, MechJeb makes my rocket oscillate much more than a manual ascent with active SAS does.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMechJebs stability controller is better than the stock SAS but also more aggressive with default settings. (and I would not recommend to mess with them...)\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor me, limiting the AoA helps with keeping this under control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-12T12:10:43Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2015 12:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cairol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
