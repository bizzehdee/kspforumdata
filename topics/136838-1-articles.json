Yet, my country does not fair in aerospace engineering so I crie...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to topic, I have reached till Eeloo, ignored dres because I really hate it, and explored almost all moons of jool, and also explored other planets. It was really accomplishing and a happy moment for me to reach them, but it felt... dead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee what I mean, I wish we could have a better environment, shaders, lighting\u00A0and more types of biomes with unique features, minerals, atmosphere, fog, lava, storms etc. And have some hills too, like we have in kerbin. The planets are really boring, repitative and with no unique things to explore, yes I did see all the easter eggs, but it does not make them lively. Also, the planets are very boring, I wish we had more planets like uranus (hehe) neptune, saturn or other unique ones. Kerbin also needs some population and cities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy request is that can anyone recommend me some cool mods for all this? If this cannot come in one, I would like individual mods with different features because I really cannot find perfect ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-13T09:41:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck out Environmental Visual Enhancements.

Why is this advantageous you might ask? Previous planet adder mods, such as Planet Factory, modified the live planetary system and had to keep multiple hacks actively running to provide these worlds.
