This has the advantage that anything with a DTS-M1 has pretty good connectivity early on. These also have a Comm-16 on them for side-links.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 - Put up (6) LKO sats with Comm-16s at 267km orbit in a hexagon. This provides almost perfect coverage. Ideally 2-3 of those should have DTS-M1 links to the KEO sats (or a Comm-32).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3 - Put up (4) MKO sats with Comm-16s at 776km orbit in a box around the equator. Two of them should have DTS-M1 links to the KEOs (or a Comm-32).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt tends to be a toss-up as to whether I do #1 first or #2 first or #3 first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I get the Comm-32s and KR-14, I toss up another pair of KEOs about 30-40 degrees ahead/behind the existing KEOs (within 2Mm). They can use the Comm-32 to cross-link and also down-link to KSC. Eventually, my KEOs get pushed outward to 180 degrees apart at 2869km altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also do a lot of robotic lifters. The circularization stage has a probe core, battery, solar panels and a Comm-16. After lifting the payload into LKO, they detach and get used to fill in the 267km flock. Or if they are used to push payloads to Mun/Minmus, they get used there as fill-ins for a 250km orbit flock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy science probes to Mun/Minmus (such as Mag-RPWS sats) have DTS-M1 links back to Kerbin plus a Comm-16. So they serve dual-purpose as comm links back to home, omni-directional linkages around the moon, and for gathering science (or ScanSAT). I don\u0027t bother any more with dedicated comm-sats for the moons / other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor funding all this, I decline all contracts initially except those that ask for a simple satellite to be put around Kerbin with \u0026lt; 20 degrees of inclination and Ap \u0026lt; 5Mm.
