Hi! First time on the forum. Played for a couple years, took a huge break, and recently started going nuts again. I play career mode on hard. I feel that\u0027s the only way to play. (Reverting flight? Pfffftt)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I\u0027ve looked on this forum, as well as googled, and read many tutorials and videos on this subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main problem is, even when I\u0027m watching my Center of lift and my Center of mass during each stage, I keep having issues keeping the rocket going up while trying to escape the atmosphere. I read a guide where the COL should be below the COM, but even with that I\u0027ve had issues. I\u0027ve tried putting it inside the COM. Still issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandomly, I\u0027ll have ships that are perfectly stable. Others aren\u0027t for unknown reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering if someone can better describe why these things happen? I keep wasting untolds amount of money in career mode having to restart and do it again, only to get stuck as soon as I get to the contracts involving orbit/mun pass by\u0027s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can splice some videos together if need be showing the COL and COM, and then the post flight. I haven\u0027t been able to find a pattern based on those numbers as to why my stability feels so random.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh! Before you ask. I\u0027ve seen this elsewhere. SAS or no, this still happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T22:50:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnless you\u0027re using a spaceplane with wings (lifting surfaces) then you can safely ignore the CoL. For rockets, you want the CoM as high as possible. If you are having trouble with your rocket flipping then that usually means you are straying too far from your prograde marker while you turn. Your rocket needs to be streamlined, so use nose cones or fairings and make sure any turns you do in the atmosphere (like the main gravity turn) are very slow and gradual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do more searches you should be able to find a ton of threads talking about this exact problem and how to fix it in 1.0.2.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T22:51:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpinning out of control essentially comes down to a contest between drag and control. When the drag overcomes your control authority, you go for a spin. You can decrease drag by staying closer to prograde and building a more aerodynamic rocket. You can increase control using engine gimbals, stabalizer wheels, and control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that drag increases significantly right around mach 1 (340 m/s). So you should stay pointed as prograde as possible at speeds around 280-400 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"V3xatious","CreatedById":144306,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T23:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh.

I\u0027m not trying to perform my turn yet. Before the new physics this was no issue. Orbit was the easiest thing.

As soon as I activate my normal engine, it spins out. It\u0027s a single pipe with a few fins, so I\u0027m not sure why it wouldn\u0027t be aerodynamic. I\u0027ll have to mess around with it more and see if I can find some patterns. I haven\u0027t been able to research stabilizers or any of those yet, so it comes down to the Pilot and myself to keep it flying correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T00:03:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPost a pic of the stage that spins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a rocket control fins should be as low and outside as possible.

Main thing is to keep drag in mind. In particular, make sure your payload up front is as streamlined as possible, ideally a smooth cylinder with a pointy front end.

Fairings also help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re having trouble debugging why a particular rocket has problems, the aero overlay helps while in flight.
