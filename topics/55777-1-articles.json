Now, if you researched the right technologies, than you could pick the upgrade \u0022expander cycle\u0022 which will add say about 30 seconds of Isp and lower the weight. But, there would be a downside, it would add cost and lower thrust by 15 Kn, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in the R\u0026amp;D Buildign there could be an Upgrades tab which tells you which ones are available and which ones you could research. It would cost money to research an upgrade and it would cost a little bit of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on the Mk1 Command Pod, there could be upgrades for Heatshields and SAS torque and maybe even life support. But this would add weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there would also be limits on the upgrades you can make to that part on that rocket. Say, only two for an LV-909, 2 for a MK1 CP, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also thinking of an experience system where certain Kerbals could fly rockets with certain command pods on their own. Say Jeb had flown the Mk1 Command Pod for so long he knew every nook and cranny, and picked up a bunch of experience (depending on biome, only from gotten from recovery, though), he would be able to fly the craft through all the nodes with only a few meters/s discrepancy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a mission planning idea, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you basically go to mission control, click on \u0022add flight plan\u0022 and a map shows up. Now, you type in the planned apoapsis and periapsis and it makes an oribt for you, then you use the Maneuver Node System to make plans. Now, you would set up a launch schedule and a sort of alarm clock would tell you if it\u0027s almost time for the launch. Well, those are some of my ideas!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESigned KASA CEO:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
