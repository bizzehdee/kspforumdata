Most noteable was the antique Buzz Aldrin\u0027s Race Into Space and its visually improved but still greatly\u00A0lacking successor Buzz Aldrin\u0027s Space Program Manager.\u00A0\u00A0BARIS had a historical function where it kept track of the missions you had flown in a linear timeline fashion. You could go back and review the missions you had flown. It included the mission name, type of mission, type of spacecraft, date flown, crew (if any), mission patch (cool), and prestige points earned. I have searched for a similar mod for KSP but haven\u0027t found one. Could one be created? I have zero experience in creating mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-26T18:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthere was an addon that did this. it is currently in my queue of mods to adopt/resuscitate.\u00A0 I do not believe it is in working function.

It was interesting to play, but it had a major flaw. You were guaranteed to kill several astronauts, no matter how careful you were in your research and development or mission planning. How the game calculated the probability was skewed toward disaster. It got to be very frustrating, but I digress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-28T03:32:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022in order to make an omelet, one must crack a couple of eggs.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022no risk, no reward.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you want to live forever?\u0022 \u2014 Valeria in Conan the Barbarian\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Chuck Yeager\u0027s quotes, famous and not much - Sualci Quotes\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.quotationof.com%2Fimages%2Fchuck-yeagers-quotes-6.jpg\u0026amp;f=1\u0026amp;nofb=1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
