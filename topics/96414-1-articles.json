It\u0027s about the easiest place to land on, though DRE will add some extra challenge then once your speed is down simply deploy chutes. Just be sure to build sturdy, the gravity\u0027s stronger than even Kerbin so no big ships on flimsy legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to run a return mission Ike is a good choice. Most if not all Mun landers can do Ike as well, the delta-V requirements are about the same. Aerocapture at Duna would be usual but with FAR you will need to either use trial and error or install the Trajectories mod. You can just do a powered capture, it takes around 350 m/s of extra delta-V which isn\u0027t an awful lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to capture with an Ike gravity assist into an orbit as similar to Ike\u0027s as you can get, then you do a few orbits before encountering Ike again and getting into Ike orbit. To arrange such a gravity assist, set up a mid-course correction on your way from Kerbin to Duna and use a combination of then green pro/retrograde and the blue radial/anti-radial components, which lets you change your arrival time at Duna and thus where Ike is when you arrive. The same technique works to avoid Ike when you don\u0027t want an encounter! I strongly recommend the PreciseNode mod for any sort of gravity assist work, it makes it easy to adjust manoeuvres to 1 m/s or better precision.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vindaloo","CreatedById":134734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T15:28:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, thanks for all the advice.
