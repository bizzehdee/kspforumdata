Doesn\u0027t matter if its cheaty or uncomparable to other parts of the game. That\u0027s where I see this idea going, use KSP as a platform for some new/fun/crazy idea. let it have its very own gameplay, E.G. you start with a small ball of goo on Eeloo and have to find rare resources to replicate, grow, transform, and this way travel across the kerbol system to fullfil some goal, could be as simple as visiting/collecting resources from all planet and moons in the game. That wouldn\u0027t take very long due to the probably \u0027cheaty\u0027 nature compared to stock stuff. It\u0027d be a fun little chellange.
