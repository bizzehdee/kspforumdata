Let\u0027s start with friction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFriction is a form of energy transfer. \u00A0It involves at a minimum 1 solid surface. \u00A0Friction comes from the shear force (kind of like pressure, but parallel instead of normal to a surface) that comes up whenever two things slide across each other. \u00A0There are shear forces in flowing fluids, but this leads to the concept of viscosity. When you have 2 solid surfaces your coefficient of friction can be quite high. \u00A0We can turn the friction force into an energy by multiplying that force by a distance\u00A0(E=F*d). \u00A0You\u0027ll find the mechanical energy that went into overcoming friction comes out of the process as heat. \u00A0We typically call friction between 1 surface and a fluid drag. \u00A0You\u0027ll find that drag causes very little heat in air, because there\u0027s just not that much energy required to get air out of your way. \u00A0Especially in the upper atmosphere. \u00A0You can prove this one to yourself too. \u00A0Run a re-entry with a known vessel mass (e.g. the starting capsule at 0.84 tonnes). \u00A0Watch for the fire to start. \u00A0Next note the acceleration on your vessel by timing how long it takes you to drop 1 m/s velocity. \u00A0Divide the mass of the vessel by the time to drop 1 m/s to get your force. \u00A0(a=v/t, we set v to 1 m/s and we measured t)\u00A0then F=m*a\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdiabatic temperature change requires no energy transfer. \u00A0That\u0027s the definition of adiabatic; no energy or mass transfer. \u00A0Under moderate conditions this is governed by the ideal gas law, P*V=n*R*T. \u00A0One thing that is not immediately obvious is that this equation has units of energy. \u00A0P is pressure, is force / length\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. \u00A0V is volume, which has units of length\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. \u00A0When you multiply these together you get force * distance, which is energy. \u00A0When we said we do things adiabatically our change in energy is 0 and our change in mass/matter (n) is 0 as well. \u00A0In order to satisfy these conditions P*V/(n*R*T) must remain constant. \u00A0Thus if we keep our volume the same, and drive up the pressure we will have a large increase in temperature as well, possibly to the point of generating a plasma. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow why is the air in front of a re-entering capsule getting heated adiabatically? \u00A0Isn\u0027t it flowing around the capsule? \u00A0This one is more of a timing kind of issue. \u00A0We have to remember that orbital velocity is ridiculously fast. \u00A0So fast, that air molecules can\u0027t get out of the way and get compressed. \u00A0They\u0027re compressed so fast so there\u0027s no time for heat transfer to dissipate the energy created by the capsule ramming into the air. \u00A0So we have the kinetic energy of the vessel being transferred to the air in front of it. \u00A0The energy went up, so P*V went up, and n*R*T went up. \u00A0Air is compressible, so we know P went up and V went down, but P*V went up. \u00A0On the n*R*T side we know that R is a measured constant. \u00A0It\u0027s not changing. \u00A0Remember we\u0027re moving really fast, so there isn\u0027t really time for heat and mass transfer in the ram area. \u00A0Also we have a detached shock cone, which will have a stagnation volume right in front of the vessel. \u00A0So if n isn\u0027t going up and R isn\u0027t changing, that means T is going up if n*R*T is going up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReal gasses do depart from the ideal gas law above, but these departures are well studied as an equation of state, or other thermodynamic models. \u00A0You can think of the equation being modified to P*V=Z*n*R*T, where Z is a correction function. \u00A0The correction function has been studied for over a century, and many models are available depending on the conditions you are studying\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rcp27","CreatedById":129752,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T20:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222573461\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139419\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462906138\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022139318\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbol Macrosystems\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Kerbol Macrosystems said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);background-color:rgb(251,251,251);\u0022\u003EWe\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003Etypically call friction between 1 surface and a fluid drag. \u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nViscous surface drag is only one element of the drag on something like an aircraft.
