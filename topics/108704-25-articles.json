Since I can\u0027t get any replicatable group of mods or situation to cause the crashes I can\u0027t mark it as incompatible with certain mods.\n\nSo my only suggestion is that if Science Relay is causing crashes then don\u0027t use it.\n\nAnd no, to my knowledge none of the science management mods are related (ForScience and Automated Science something, might have been related at one point, but I think they have diverged quite a bit).

No NullReferenceException spam or whatever when transmitting some science along control path of 2 or 3 vessels to KCS.\n\nSince KSP maintains the singular instance of CommNet at all time, any CommNet-based mod will inevitably supply its own CommNet derivative to KSP. When two or more CommNet-based mods are installed, one mod may take over one CommNet component but another mod take another depending CommNet component. Such unstable dependency may arise to endless cycles on non-existent or wrong objects at either mod.\n\nAt least from my experience on CommNet development."},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-15T14:27:30Z","Content":"[@TaxiService](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/74999-taxiservice/) That\u0027s what I\u0027ve seen, too.

As I\u00B4ve read on this topic, a few issues may\u00B4ve happened regarding Science Relay, and here\u00B4s my report about it, running with other mods on 1.5.x. , Windows10 64Bit.  \n\nHope that come to any use. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022)   \n\n::::::::::::  \n\nI\u00B4ve been playing using these mods on the \u0022Modlets\u0022 page, and they\u00B4re pretty cool! They really make things a lot easier.  \n\nBut, I don\u00B4t know if any other player has had a problem with \u0027Science Relay\u0027 yet, but it seems to be locking the game, and I have to close and reload. So, if you haven\u00B4t received any complains about it so far, my description lies bellow.\n\nThank you!  \n\n..  \n\n.......\n\nSpoiler\n\n...  \n\n.  \n\nThe game has locked several (at least seven or eight rebooting/reloading times in a row) when I attempted to perform some science, AFTER I\u00B4ve installed those Modlets\u00B4page ones, and then I managed to isolate which one of them was causing the problem.  \n\n-WHAT happened: the game locks. Simple as that;  \n\n,  \n\n-DID it work at least once?  \n\n--Yes. I\u00B4ve used it a LOT, and it everything worked properly, except a few times the problems bellow happened;  \n\n,  \n\n-WHEN it happened:  \n\n--when I clicked one of the action buttons to perform several experiments at the same time;  \n\n,  \n\n-WHICH experiments:  \n\n--I decided to remove any other DMagic stuff to see if they were the problem, but it happened also when using only the stock ones:  \n\n---In this case: Gravmax, Two-hot thermometer, Barometer, Atmosphere and Seismographer.  \n\n,  \n\n-WHICH scenario:  \n\n--First, I\u00B4ve thought it was only after the vessel entered the atmosphere, and also it seemed to me it was due to the camera cicling/changing, but the it happened also when in low space ambients;  \n\n--I also tried in diferent celestial bodies, including those I had already did the same procedures before the mod, and it happened on those as well;  \n\n--Recently, I\u00B4m playing almost exclusively thru \u0022The World Beyond\u0022 planets pack, and I was about to report to them initially, but when I attempted to make as said the line above, I realized it wasn\u00B4t a \u0027TWB\u0027\u00B4s bug;  \n\n,  \n\n-SOLVED problem?  \n\n--Yes and No: it has no longer happened after I deleted the Science Relay from GameData folder;  \n\n,  \n\n-CONSOLE and/or debugging?  \n\n--Yes and no. Though I\u00B4ve attivated all the debugging options on the AltF12, nor the console shows anything special (I think), nor any crash/log file is created. I will paste bellow the last lines recorded in some situations, but I don\u00B4t think they are of much use.  \n\n--I was wondering if maybe it could happen just after the time your mod recognizes how many vessels are able to receive the transmited science?  \n\n--As the @$#%\u00A8\\*\u0026\u00A8\u00A8$%\u00A8Windows10 seems to not be able to switch tasks while the main on is locked, I couldn\u00B4t see if any other temporary error file is was created before the KSP locks/closes.\n\n.............\n\nSome screens showing the the messages prior to the lock/crash. A few coincidences, but I believe none of them have a part on the problem.  \n[![Sci-Relay-Bugs-1.png](https://i.ibb.co/JjNQGgn/Sci-Relay-Bugs-1.png)](https://ibb.co/JjNQGgn) [![Sci-Relay-Bugs-2.png](https://i.ibb.co/qd2qzXK/Sci-Relay-Bugs-2.png)](https://ibb.co/qd2qzXK) [![Sci-Relay-Bugs-3.png](https://i.ibb.co/sgQgRnM/Sci-Relay-Bugs-3.png)](https://ibb.co/sgQgRnM) [!\\[Sci-Relay-Bugs-4.png\\](https://i.ibb.co/M1Y0zTy/Sci-Relay-Bugs-4.png)](https://ibb.co/M1Y0zTy)[![Game-Data-SCN.png](https://i.ibb.co/vYjJ2tv/Game-Data-SCN.png)](https://ibb.co/vYjJ2tv)\n\n..  \n\n..::\n\nAgain, the mod is GREAT and did work quite all right.
