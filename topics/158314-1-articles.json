Everything is the Mk3 and Big-S parts, so very good heat tolerances. I managed to land a smaller plane with the same lift/drag ratio, but upscaling it causes all sorts of weird effects - especially wings breaking off halfway through the atmosphere, sometimes without cause, sometimes due to structural failure, sometimes to G-forces exceeded (the plane is not rotating or anything). It feels like the game, when more parts are in play, tends to let things break esier if it struggles with the framerate and more complex parts (as in more partcounts).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aerodynamic forces are beyond what the game is designed to cope with. The forces acted upon my lander\u00A0by the rear inflatable heatshield warped my craft - I had to reset the autostrutting to get the cockpit/top part\u00A0aligned with the bottom again. There are no lander leg of the required sturdyness to land an eve lander - the engines are far better! The inflatable heatshield seems to be perfectly designed to keep a craft going sideways - you should not be required to build redicilous heat-shield parachute on top of the craft just to keep the correct end pointing towards space. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-27T23:58:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2017 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by martinborgen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-28T03:19:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I\u0027ve experienced some very weird physics on Eve as well. \u00A0Like if you save while your chutes are open, and then try to reload, it will insta-kraken your ship into oblivion. \u00A0Though part of what you\u0027re seeing may have a grain of reality. \u00A0If you upscale a ship by 2, the mass goes up by a factor of 8, while the surface area only goes up by a factor of 4 - so reentry is inherently harder with bigger craft. \u00A0There may also be issues of leverage on longer wings. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as lander legs, the best I\u0027ve done is to put like 8 on my ship, expect a few to break, and hope there are still enough left to keep my ship intact. \u00A0I\u0027ve had plenty of heat shield problems too. \u00A0I can usually get it working with oodles of airbrakes and mass balancing, but it takes a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, I\u0027ve definitely been super-frustrated with Eve in the moment, but (physics glitches aside), I\u0027m glad it\u0027s hard. \u00A0Once you\u0027ve got the basics down, there\u0027s not much variation in difficulty in the other planets.
