Am I the only one? I\u0027d think it was against the rules to write a paragraph in the OP.\n\nYou just wrote a couple. Technically, paragraphs can consist on only one sentence. And since the first one serves as an example rather than a description, it gets the point through despite not adhering to official grammar conventions.\n\nAnyway, the modus operandi for the forum discussions seemed to be presenting an idea/observation, then either asking a question or asking (or waiting) for some response. How the idea is presented doesn\u0027t matter much (one user once wrote a long, essay-like paragraph, others include lists, graphs, photos, or anything else that shows the points), other than that the idea has to be something understandable, and (if a question) ask in a clearly-worded manner.\n\nThen again, some threads do fit the stereotype you depicted. Other than a very few that asks something not allowed to be asked (forum rules), most simply exists without too much trouble."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T15:47:52Z","Content":"Moderation message.
