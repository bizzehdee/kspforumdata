Brought to you by [Hunter-Ariel Industries](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111612-Hunter-Ariel-Plane-Industries). \n\nTo compete in the challenge you must build a stock plane, having a maximum liquid fuel capacity of 10 units. You must fly your plane till it runs out of fuel (and land it... If you want.)\n\nSubmit a screenshot of your F3 screen making sure you have the resources tab open. If you want to, submit a .craft file for download aswell.\n\nThere are three categories to compete in. NCS (No Control Surface), Open and Modded.\n\n  **Leaderboard**  \n\nNCS:\n\n1: GoSlash27: 4,335,756 m (10 Days Time!!!)\n\n2: Bob\\_Saget54: 2,359,288 m (4:23.07 Time)\n\n3: Batz\\_10K: 1,128,406 m (0:33.54 Time)\n\n4: Tarantulae: 376,847 m (0:36.40 Time)\n\nOpen:\n\n1: Bowfonz: 761,745 m (1:03.08 Time)\n\n1: Me: 508,117 m (1:11.11 Time)\n\n2: Foxter: 157,917 m (0:6.24 Time)\n\nModded:\n\n(All times are **Hour:Minute.Second**)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E ![2Su8M86.png](http://i.imgur.com/2Su8M86.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E My distance was: 142,237 m.\n\u003E \n\u003E [Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t8rrgjzgb5uuwg7/Hunter-Ariel%2010%20Fuel.craft?dl=0)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nHave fun guys!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T00:29:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 12:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by dec159**\n  \nUpdating the Scoreboards, Hopefully I haven\u0027t forgotten anyone!"},{"CreatedByName":"ihtoit","CreatedById":78942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T09:21:12Z","Content":"no fun in stock, this is an infiniglide challenge."},{"CreatedByName":"Vivian_Science","CreatedById":138704,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T10:32:25Z","Content":"By 10 fuel do you mean all together?

If your CoG/CoL is dynamically stable then it should hold it. If you were in a dive or something when power died, then you\u0027d hold in the dive. If your CoG/CoL is unstable, it\u0027ll slowly oscillate until it dives and rip itself apart."}]}
