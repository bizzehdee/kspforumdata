One with the original parts, then another with the lifting body parts came out. Now I am building an SSTO with the v1.0 parts. In my previous SSTOs I could get to 20-22km before I ran out of intake air, and had to switch to rockets. Now I am having a hard time getting past 17km. So, I am curious what the limit is in v1.0 for air-breathing engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the Maximum Altitude you have attained in an SSTO* before you had to switch from Air-Breathing engines to rockets? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*\u003C/strong\u003E This question only applies to successful SSTOs (circularized an orbit and returned to Kerbin).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T22:12:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dogface\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:53:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E69km, where there simply is no more oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally with spaceplanes, other SSTOs flew about the same launch profile but I generally couldn\u0027t be bothered to nursemaid them through the upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:14:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1.0, the limit for jet engines is no longer intake air, but thrust.
