After Eeeloo I did not bother waiting for an minimum cost burn, but did an 2600 m/s burn who intercepted Kerbin, the lowest point was close to Moho orbit. This gave me an orbital speed inside Kerbin SOI of over 10.000 m/s, I used two hours from edge of SOI to LKO and the final approach was pretty surreal as it felt I was running on time compression, also took some tame braking even with the g-meter maxed out for over an minute. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other experiences with this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RawChicken","CreatedById":57199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T14:23:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehahaha, did you take any snapshot?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T14:40:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMacey just did a 7000m/s aero brake at Laythe in his last video, and will be doing another one in his next video with his dreadnought with No Fuel remaining, only monoprop!
