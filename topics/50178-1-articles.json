In such situation You either can get an \u0022action group\u0022 for collecting data with Your devices and another one to simply transmit data, but I think there is a much more simple way to do that. What we currently have in our left side of the scree is a vertical staging menu that has icons for all the modules on on the ship. What I thought of is just making almost the same looking bar, so that You can toggle staging controlls and toe original \u0022green bar\u0022 would be replaced with a scientific bar with modules maybe in blue, so that You can controll all Your scientific modules from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternative would be expanding the resources menu from it\u0027s current form to TWO tabs that would be Physical resources and Data. Again You would have just \u0022bars\u0022 of collected data with maybe a single button to \u0022transmit data\u0022. IMO this is something that HAS to be done just to make it simple and user friendly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO the first solution is better as You could have multiple groups of scientific equipment that would collect data in \u0022stages\u0022, so that when You press space You get data from one set of sensors, press again and You get another set of resources etc. This way You could group up \u0022science set for lower atmosphere\u0022 another \u0022science set for orbit\u0022 and a \u0022science set for interplanetary space\u0022, or maybe also for different atmosphere layers just to quickly switch between staging and science controlls to collect data as You launch Your aircraft, as You reach the orbit etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last thing is that for such situations when You need to constantly keep track of different staging controlls, rotation, thrust etc., You should have some sort of antena type that would be capable of continous transmission of current data as You go, maybe at a cost of high level of data loss in the process as well. The same function should be also used for spacecrafts that could be designed to crash into a planet for specific data (like an early game, low-tech alternative for lander), maybe adding a use for our old spacecrafts could go together with this, as such \u0022real time data transmission\u0022 antenas would require an additional satellite to be on the orbit when not arround kerbal? This way our old orbiters that did their research and are just orbiting a planet, but are still operational and can transmit and receive data, could be any use for us?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo just go witht he previous ideas. \u0022Forwarding\u0022 data would be usefull, but at the same time adding some sort of \u0022computing module\u0022 or \u0022data bank\u0022 that could store series of data comming from sensors, would add multiple levels of depth to the game. At a cost of constant energy consumption and decent weight players could construct their spacecrafts in a new way. Instead of adding multiple \u0022duplicates\u0022 of the exactly same research equipment to store different values for different experiment conditions, there could be a \u0022data bank module\u0022 that could store up to X experiments (that is a matter of balancing or maybe different kinds of such module type?). Maybe that would allow to save up to 80% of the original data (that would be further degradated if transmitted of course), so that You don\u0027t get a \u0022full profit\u0022 in case of retreiving an aircraft that returned home? Maybe more or less?. IMO that would be also a nice way to recover data in a way, that You launch a tiny spacecraft just made of a battery/panel pack, controll module and that data bank, back home instead of bringing back the entire lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a serious issue for me that I can place a craft on an orbit, but after it has served its purpose I am unable to reassign it to a different task later. The scientifis equipment is not going to provide any new data, so my experiments would not provide to much science, or any science at all, but in the end ... these have their antenas that can just be used as a communication devices all the time. Real-time research streaming would add use to these old spacecrafts that are operationa and useless at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one last final suggestion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould we have an option to \u0022LOCK\u0022 antenas open? I wen I manualy extend an antena, transmiting data with it should not trigger closing it back, as (IMO) instead of \u0022reverting it to closed state\u0022 it should be set to \u0022revert to the stat at the beggining of transmit operation\u0022 so if I want to transmit, but my antenas are already open, they should stay that way, and the other way arround when closed at the point of \u0022tramsmission request\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETo sum up, what I think that the team should do:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Add science UI - some sci midules panel to easy use, just like You manage stages OR resources\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Add any way to easy trigger sets of experiments\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Allow \u0022live\u0022 transmission (it\u0027s players problem to manage his crafts power levels for such transmission, right? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Data storage parts for science\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Add use for old spacecrafts with operational communication items\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Fix antena bahavior\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a small post scriptum:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am aware that everything should come at some cost when I suggest new modules here and new functionalities, but when it comes to UI ... it\u0027s just a matter of being more user friendly, so I hope that is the main thing You could consider out of my entire post here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi everyone! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-23T10:19:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2013 10:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Zamaszysty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
