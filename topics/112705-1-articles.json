For formerly-named SLS we have have done QM1, static testing the five-segment boosters. With SLS, those 5-seg SRBs will be in active production. And for the upper stage, get this - 5m diameter cryogenic tanks in active production for Delta IV (and eventually Vulcan) powered by two BE3 rocket engines! Hydrogen fueled, built to air-start and restart, two 490 kN engines is enough to match J2X, but these engines are in production have actually *flown* on the New Shepard test vehicle!"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T22:07:44Z","Content":"Technically, yes. You might have to add another set of boosters, or replace them with the SLS Block II\u0027s \u0022Dark Knight\u0022 advanced boosters- the Ares I was underpowered. I\u0027m not sure why you\u0027d want to build a rocket like that though. It\u0027d probably be more economical to man-rate the Delta IV Heavy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T22:09:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 10:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fredinno**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T22:08:36Z","Content":"How wide are the SRBs?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T22:09:23Z","Content":"The engine for Vulcan is the LOX/LCH4 BE-4, which isn\u0027t in full-scale testing yet, but that\u0027s not really relevant. The main problem is the SRB casings haven\u0027t actually been \u0027in production\u0027 since the end of the shuttle program, and by this point restart of the production is basically impossible. There are somewhere on the order of 50-80 segments left, and SLS would be competing for those.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E How wide are the SRBs?\n\n3.7m. Given ATK found mating that with the 5.6m Ariane 5 care was aerodynamically feasible for liberty, it shouldn\u0027t be an issue.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T22:11:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 10:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kryten**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T22:12:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The engine for Vulcan is the LOX/LCH4 BE-4, which isn\u0027t in full-scale testing yet, but that\u0027s not really relevant.\n\nThat really isn\u0027t relevant, I was talking about BE3!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E by this point restart of the production is basically impossible.\n\nThat\u0027s pretty sad.

Some of the equipment (like the molten salt bath used for quenching) couldn\u0027t even be turned off without rendering it unusable."}]}
