Is this just due to the low gravity? If so, surely my heavy vehicles would be able to grip, but they don\u0027t. Is this the way it\u0027s supposed to be or am I doing something wrong?

Rovers at rest really will slide sideways. This is because vehicles run/park on rails (like GT5) and so the calculations are based on driving on a level surface, with inclined surfaces affecting acceleration like they would a rocket or plane, which is completely understandable considering the difficulty that would be involved in making the rovers behave more realistically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for my comments about the lack of friction, I came to my conclusions through a series of experiments that I have been performing with the wheels over the last few weeks, and have made a few interesting discoveries, such as: unlimited wheel torque and a bizarre torque curve that I think is supposed to simulate the torque curve in an electric motor, but I can\u0027t tell (discovered in an experiment to calculate what 1 unit of energy actually is in watts. Inconclusive since the unlimited torque makes determining watts impossible); a stiction coefficient of about .05 - the equivalent of driving on sheer perfectly smooth ice (in an experiment to confirm whether or not the torque really was unlimited by driving up various inclined surfaces... I couldn\u0027t complete it because the wheels have virtually no traction. Only momentum will propel a rover up a hill. Try this yourself.); and that lateral acceleration doesn\u0027t appear to affect the vehicle - other than to flip it like it was on landing gear - so no calculating skidpad Gs (I suspect that experiment is also useless since there is a bizarre steering curve which I cannot make sense of). These issues are all exacerbated on low G planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did these experiments because I do amateur off-road racing and used to build racers (and off-road hotshot trucks), and was curious what my B.O.E would be with the rover bits... as it turns out I learned way too much about rover parts for my own good, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I do confess that I play this on a mac, so maybe these are are mac issues, but I did try BobCat\u0027s DEMV (ANT to be specific) to see if it was a mac unity thing, and the DEMV performed exactly as I expected it to, including being able to both climb as well as park on an incline past 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, which you cannot do with the stock wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I do fully understand that this is a space game and not a driving sim, so do please not take my post as a criticism of Squad or their efforts. I am merely pointing out to a fellow player that there are shortcomings and limitations to what Rover wheels can do and why those shortcomings and limitations exist. I\u0027m sure if Squad felt it was a real issue that affected gameplay that they would rectify it. I suspect these issues will likely be addressed by a modder since I\u0027m sure most players would rather have the devs focus their efforts on other, more important things, like, say, flag planting and resources/mining/strut guns. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-27T06:27:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2013 06:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Scoundrel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling and my first part didn\u0026#039;t show up\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alephzorg","CreatedById":2383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T18:04:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I\u0027ve only tried the stock rover wheels on Kerbin, Mun and Minmus.

In ksp terms, this is the amount of \u0022thrust\u0022 your wheels have at certain rpms. I don\u0027t know how the coded numbers work, but I suspect the number is linked to velocity or a velocity equivalent. The torque curve numbers make no sense (to me) for electric motors since, generally speaking, most electric motors have about 8x the rated torque at 0 rpm (meaning as it spins up it has 8x the torque, but it drops off - usually linearly, though there are exceptions - to 1x the rated torque at the rated rpm). If you want to make your rover accelerate like a bat out of hell, double or triple both the first and the second number in the key line. If you multiply your overspeeddamage number by 3 or 4 as well, your rover wheels should give you a top speed close to what you are looking for as well as the ability to actually reach that speed. I personally haven\u0027t tested it, but if you give it a go, let me know if I was close or if I was just talking out my posterior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteering curve: looks to be the maximum degrees angle that the wheels will lock as you turn, though it could also be turn rate. The first is a velocity number, the second is the degrees. I have no idea why they did that. Definitely lowering it as you go faster will probably keep your rover stable at high speeds if you\u0027ve set your CoG too high so it becomes tippy. I use ballast on my rovers to get my CoG low and they almost never tip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImpact tolerance you can probably leave alone, though if you keep blowing tires from hitting rocks at 200kmph you might want to up it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Trekky0623\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Trekky0623\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there any way to alter the stock wheels to give them some friction, like the Bobcat DEMVs?
