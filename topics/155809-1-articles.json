My logic indicates that if I try to land directly from my interplanetary trajectory, since I\u2019m going so fast, it will be more expensive than if I use gravity assists to first capture around Jool and lower my Jool orbit as much as possible. Is my logic sound?

If you were to come into Tylo and gravity assist yourself in such a way that you can get a gravity assist from Vall that puts you into a Jool orbit that looks like a transfer from Vall to Tylo, you can for a scant couple m/s turn your direct Tylo intercept burn into a Vall-Tylo-transfer intercept burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027s still gonna be expensive.
