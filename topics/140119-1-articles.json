However when I try to return to Kerbin and enter the atmosphere it burns up. I know there are ablator shields but only for stack seperation, no radial ones. (I\u0027ve even tried attaching them to struts underneath the craft but that didn\u0027t work either). I\u0027ve tried attaching radiators to the bottom but they didn\u0027t do anything either.

With a Pe of no less than 35km, try bleeding off speed by holding the nose of your plane up ~45 degrees. If you went straight in at this height it might burn your nose off, but in this way, you are sharing the heat load a little bit. Make sure you don\u0027t have anything with a low head tolerance in your re-entry profile!
