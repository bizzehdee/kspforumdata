That means, on Eve 12,000 m/s will only be enough if you fly a proper gravity turn at terminal velocity - if you keep your ascent as short as possible without suffering too much atmospheric drag. Heck, I could take a certified working Eve lander and fail to reach a 75km Kerbin orbit with it.

Figure out how much dV your craft has by solving the rocket equation. That will get you to your target with less trouble... in fact, if you\u0027re good at math, you can input the desired dV of each stage into the equation and then reverse it, solving for the mass faction you need for that stage.

If you manage to get most of the way there (apoapsis outside the atmosphere, and at least 1000 m/s vessel speed when reaching that apoapsis), then your craft has about 12,000 dV (on account of needing 4500 dV to launch into low Kerbin orbit every time). Of course, I\u0027m not sure if you\u0027ll have the TWR on the later stages... but then again Eve has brutal gravity, so all your stages but the final one are probably going to be somewhat beefy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T13:47:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative approach would be to scale the lander to match Eve\u0027s gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, start with your standard lander, make a note of the mass of each stage.

A mainsail in the lower atmosphere of Eve will have an ISP of 320; a Mainsail on the launchpad on Kerbin will have 320.6 -- big deal. The difference is that on Kerbin, the ISP improves immediately with every meter of altitude, while on Eve it will be stuck at 320 until you reach about 10.5-11km -- that\u0027s where Eve\u0027s atmosphere is just as dense as Kerbin\u0027s at sea level. The situation will improve not quite as quickly, however.

(All are Asparagus-staged, often many small stages where TWR doesn\u0027t change all that much over the trip; also, many people have left all kinds of MechJeb and KER info panels open. There\u0027s a lot of data in those galleries.) Compare to your own TWR to determine how long it will take you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, \u003Cstrong\u003Eput your vessel on the test stand and let the engines run at sea level for as long as it would take you to reach 15km on Eve\u003C/strong\u003E, plus a safety margin of at least ten and no more than twenty seconds. Cut the engines. Check remaining delta-v: if you have about 5000m/s left, you\u0027ll be good. Just remember that your TWR has to be pretty high for almost all the way: out of those 5000m/s, you should have an Eve-TWR of about two-ish for the first 2500m/s, around one for the next 1500m/s, and only for the last 1000m/s may it be lower than one. If your TWR is less, you\u0027ll need more delta-v, but not all that much more: 6000m/s should do if you reach the 15km mark with an Eve-TWR of 1.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPro tip: also test your lending gear.

A perfect suicide burn would consume about 150m/s of delta-v, but is very treacherous and unforgiving. BUT: a very small number of parachutes will suffice bring that down to 20m/s. The parachutes will also ensure that you\u0027re pointed straight up and don\u0027t drift, so you don\u0027t have to care about steering and may concentrate on the throttle. For the latter purpose, a single drogue chute will be enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA parachute-buffered powered landing can be done even if you have clumsy fingers.
