Strangely enough, right clicking on the other parts of the Agena brought up the menus as if everything were still connected. I then turned on RCS, and tried maneuvering around, and that\u0027s when the fabric of space and time collapsed in on itself. Things broke apart, as you can see in the picture. But the menus still came up. I then said, \u0022Screw it,\u0022 and throttled the engine up, which worked. The engine, and only the engine, moved forward until it hit the Gemini nose, as if physics were turned back on. But the engine went through the fuel tanks to get there.

The first time was after I renamed the Agena core to it\u0027s proper name, and my already in orbit Agena\u0027s core turned into the ICBM core, as expected. I undocked the Gemini, and physics collapsed. I however wrote this off since there was a part there that shouldn\u0027t be, and things were already broken looking anyway. Now that this has happened again, I think it might be something else. However, seeing as no one else has said anything about the Agena being broken, I\u0027m not sure what to do.
