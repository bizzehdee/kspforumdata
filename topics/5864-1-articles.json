Its large wings give good glide time, and it has reasonable maneuvrability with low risk of fatal control failure. Its two gimbaled engines provide the thrust for space travel, orbital insertion, and descent control. Its unusual landing gear, partly comprised of a typical water skid/pontoon setup, partly land skid/hardpoint/pontoon setup. The latter has proven itself capable of providing both shock absorbance and strength against damage. These make up the majority, being 3 of the five gears. Horizontal takeoff speed is ~=100m/s, if pulling up. Recommended landing speed without power is anything below 60m/s. Anything below 100m/s is possible with engines running. Water landings are not recommended, but are survivable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft is a Long Take Off and Landing type, and is intended to be landed without assistance from RCS. Although it will be fitted with RCS for maneuvring in space and possibly Munar landings, these don\\\u0027t have to play any role whatsoever during landing, either to slow it or to prevent it impacting too hard. Both can be managed by normal ASAS. Do not attempt landing with SAS on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ytWfF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ytWfF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-22T10:42:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks very nice, It\\\u0027ll be nice to see some pictures of it in action.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
