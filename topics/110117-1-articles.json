I\u0027m pretty sure all the tools are there) but I\u0027d like some interloper asteroids to capture. Again, ContractConfigurator could do it but this sounds more like something that could happen in stock. Huge F-class asteroids that are on hyperbolic trajectories with respect to the Sun, and a contract to wrangle it into orbit around Kerbin. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zazwaz117","CreatedById":69169,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T23:34:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply! Indeed an actual Rama type artifact, i.e. the size of a small moon, would be impractical. I\u0027m not sure if BDOs are at all possible in KSP, would be pretty sweet if they were. I was thinking more along the lines of like a derilict alien spaceship or a floating monolith, something along those lines, more Kerbal sized. Basically just an anomalous object that if you investigate it yields a lot of science etc. Maybe one of them could be a derelict alien ship with an OP engine that you could salvage, fix up and then fly around in? Like something that would appear once or maybe twice in your entire career play-through as an endgame thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zorbaq","CreatedById":134243,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T06:15:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zazwaz117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zazwaz117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was recently pondering the question about alien life in the Kerbal universe.
