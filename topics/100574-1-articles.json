It was my first creature to successfully exit creature stage and go on to tribal, and then all the way to space stage. Before I had used cheats to go further. I remember how awesome it was to get the thing printed! I suppose when I print a Kerbal ship it might be one of a significant achievement. I have no idea what my first orbital ship looked like, nor my Mun Lander. It might be a Joolean expedition or even my \u0022Edwin Abbot\u0022 Space Shuttle. (I will probably wait until 1.0 for that so i can re-balance it for aerodynamics.)\n\nShow off what ships you will print!\n\n![zkRd8MM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zkRd8MM.jpg)\n\nEngine fairings DO work, it seems. And I like how they handle radial decouplers. And it looks like the stack decoupler is getting a new texture in 1.0.
