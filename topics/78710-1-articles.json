When you unlock the potential, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll get contracts to test new parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContracts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts would be broken down into three different types:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E R\u0026amp;D. These would be the parts you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve unlocked the potential for in your tech tree. These would cost a lot of funds to field the first time and would have zero or very little financial payback. The reward would be full access to develop the new part (but more funds would be needed after the R\u0026amp;D stage to bring the part into production.) More complex parts should require multiple tests, say test an engine on the ground, in the air, and in space before it can go to the next step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Prestige. These contracts also would offer very little financial reward but would build up your reputation. Which over time would bring better commercial contracts (see below,) and would bring you a higher annual budget (again, see below.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Commercial. These would be your money makers. Companies would ask you to put up weather satellites, GPS satellites, communication satellites, etc. These missions would have a very accurate altitude and orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFunds\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunds would come from two sources:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Annual Budget. The higher your prestige, the higher your budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Commercial Contracts. (see above.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso everything should cost funds. The VAB, the launch pad(s), the kerbinauts. I also think time should be a factor here. The VAB should only be able to stack, say one rocket per week. A launch pad should only be able to lanch x amount of ships per week etc. So there would be financial incentives to build more of your infrastructure. Also like commercial and prestige contracts could be seeking the same launch day, forcing the player to choose one over the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrestige\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would influence the type of commercial contracts you receive and the size of your annual budget. The more success, the better. Failures, such as losing a Kerbal could eventually having you fired as head of the KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, hope you guys like these ideas. Love this game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS, if resources were ever added, it would fit with this really well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust adding on my thoughts from yesterday:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGaining Science would unlock technologies (not parts) that would then unlock contracts (see below) for new parts. In this new system, Science would not be instant and would take time to unlock. Certain technologies would require lab work done in orbit or on alien planet over time. This would encourage the player to build space stations and permanent bases on other planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience would also be tiered, with certain technologies only unlocking by visiting certain planetary bodies. This would encourage this use of probes, especially earlier in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts would be broken into three parts: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER\u0026amp;D: These contracts would appear when certain technologies are unlocked on the tech tree by gaining Science (see above.) These contracts would have little or zero financial payback, but the reward would be unlocking new parts. These new parts would in fact be very expensive to field for the first time, with their cost going down if the player puts them into production. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrestige: These contracts would be offered by the government or planet wide organizations looking to push the bounds of spaceflight. These too would have very little, if any, financial reward, but would build the players Prestige over time (see below.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommercial: These contracts are the money makers. Private companies would ask to have communication, GPS, and weather satellites be put into orbit. These missions would have very exact positioning in orbit. As the players Prestige grows, more complex commercial missions would be offered, like putting an orbiting hotel into orbit or on the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunds \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunds would be gained in two ways: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommercial Contracts: (see above.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnnual Budget: This would be directly tied to the players Prestige (see below.) The government would expect a certain amount of successful launches per year, this would prevent the player from just fast forwarding time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, everything should cost Funds, the VAB, the launch pads, training, etc. Facilities like the VAB and launch pad should only be able to be used x number of times per month, encouraging the player to build out more infrastructure. Time and timing should be a major factor. As an example, rescue mission shouldn\u0027t be just thrown together. Rockets would take time to stack, roll out and fuel. Also contracts should ask for the same launch day, forcing the player to choose. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrestige \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrestige would influence the player\u0027s annual budget and type of contract. Success would lead to higher budgets and better contacts, and failures would lead to lower budgets and no contracts. If the player continued to fail or lose many kerbals, the player could be fired as head of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-21T14:31:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2014 02:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by vexx32\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMerged double post.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thrombo","CreatedById":63034,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T08:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a bit surprised nobody has replied to your thread.

We need most of the missions to let us interact with in game assets... either putting up a supplied satellite (spawned in to the sub-assemblies) or adding specific parts to a game-spawned space station. To limit the number of stations- the game could be limited to how many stations it can spawn around a given planet... and each one will be in a very different orbit (orbits and declinations that make sense and that are rounded to nice friendly numbers with lots of 0\u0027s like 120,000m @ 35 degrees instead of 134,577m @29 degrees).

I don\u0027t want game-generated craft cluttering up space but I\u0027m not necessarily opposed to putting them into orbit as a routine \u0022challenge\u0022 to gain cash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am very much against budgets per timeframe because you would eventually end up having to timewarp until you get some money in order to play the game. This, to me, is horrible game design. At least with how it is now you have the option of doing something else while your Duna craft travels, for instance, but if you blew all your funding on that Duna craft you can do nothing else new until the next year rolls around. While you can shellac over this as \u0022planning\u0022, I play games to actually play, not wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do, however, like the idea of multiple launch sites at different latitudes that serve different purposes. For instance, an off-equator launch site would be better for commercial launches/rescues to inclined orbits. Having a turn-over time for these launch sites introduces an element of planning into the game that is lacking. There should be enough launch sites/runways that you are never prevented from launching (again, the \u0022waiting game\u0022 with timewarp), but you would then have the option of launching at a sub-optimal site or planning your launches in a manner that allows optimal usage. Following the infrastructure building idea, you could place say, three launch sites at the start of that game and work from there, adding or improving them as time goes by. Maybe you could even have a maximum launch mass per site that could be upgraded. I also think launch sites and stack building times should be determined by the mass of the craft in question rather than by a blanket time because that adds yet another element of planning to the mix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also very much against stack building time \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E a mission, mainly because, in the real world, craft and payloads are built far in advance and take much longer than a week. There are also instances of very quick turn-around at a site, like with at least one Gemini mission. A better system, IMO, is time debt for building a stack, where the facilities are unavailable after the stack is built. That lets you launch when you want but also retains the planning element that comes with the site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHrm... I suppose off-loading the time until after the launch may still result in some sort of \u0022waiting game\u0022, but to me it just seems ... friendlier to the player, resulting in less interruption overall.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemoricus","CreatedById":4141,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T04:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegex: Yearly budgets are far too long, I\u0027ll agree with that.

Basically giving the player multiple launch sites to choose from at different latitudes with turn-over times after launches that would require you to plan your site usage. The general idea being that the player almost always has the option to launch (because that\u0027s what the game is about) but the choice of launch site would be a limiting factor in contract selection. I also believe that contract stacking is kind of silly right now and that, if possible, each launch should represent one contract which, along with shortened deadlines, would encourage planning when selecting contracts. You would need to adjust contracts to require inclined orbits, including planetary axial tilt (a big planning factor here on Earth), and also incline the planets a bit more to get some benefit out of this, which will probably turn at least a few people off of the idea, but it\u0027s a more realistic approach to launch planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also pretty easily abuse the timewarp with that system if you want but, to me anyway, that should be the player\u0027s choice regarding what pace they want to play at.
