The only quick finger games I play nowadays are via an emulator on my phone that lets me play older games from the console wars era (NES, SNES, N64, Sega Genesis etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have noticed that unless I play regularly, my fingers are not fast enough to react on the touch screen to avoid dying, especially in games that require precise movement of any sort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that virtually rules out fighting games, and even some space sims, since I cannot avoid getting shot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am partial nowadays to quitting it altogether. There are actual hobbies I can and would pursue if not for gaming, like drawing or writing fiction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGaming was and is easier... but ironically at some point in life it seems I am getting literally too old for the twitch movements required for victory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo win the cost is becoming higher than I am willing to pay and for what?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA credits screen lol?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOlder console games are notorious for poor or nonexistent endings anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may end up just setting a limit on how long I play and leave it at that. Since it is entertaining but utterly frustrating AND utterly unimportant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess I am venting. I can do that here right lol?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now though, my emulator is uninstalled and I feel no urge to reinstall it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
