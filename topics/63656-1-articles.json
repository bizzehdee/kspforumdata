Kids in Vancouver are tucking into hot coco for supper, while the people of Tokyo try to break through the morning rush hour. Humanity of the spaceship Earth continues it\u0027s march into the future. Then, observatories around the world notice something: a huge, metal object entering the solar system at a small percentage of the speed of light. As it nears Earth, it slows down, rather than speed up, as Kepler would wish it to. It\u0027s a spacecraft the size of a small city. As it enters orbit around the Earth, a radio message blares out from the ship, in every human tounge. In a word, the message is: \u003Cem\u003EHelp.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the facts: In a star system not too far away from ours, many centuries ago, a species of life not at all different from us (carbon-based, four limbs, a face, social and sentient) is ready to colonize another star. After looking at every system in the local neighborhood, one is considered most likely to house a world comparable to theirs. They construct a generation ship, 250,000-strong, and start the centuries-long voyage. Unfortunately, during the voyage, two developments sprout up. (1) The homeworld descends into nuclear war, and contact is lost. (2) Radio signals are detected from the destination world, first simple beeps, then dialogue and television. There is another form of intelligent life living on the world they\u0027re trying to get to. As they get closer to their destination, they watch the race that inhabits that world advance. They watch footage of a dictator on a stage, above a huge crowd of soldiers marching in lockstep, the nuclear fireball of an atomic bomb rising over a desert, two men in bulky white suits skipping around their spider-like vehicle, sitting on a desolate, blank plain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, they reach their destination, now having to secure a home for their species.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that brings us to the present day. 250,000 aliens on a colony ship and 7,000,000,000 humans on planet Earth. They know that they can\u0027t get into a war with us and win, it would be like 250,000 21st century civilians with cellphones against 7 billion 16th century soldiers with muskets. They simply don\u0027t have the resources or the weapons. They can\u0027t drop asteroids on us, as that would destroy the habitable planet they need to survive. They could try living on Mars, but that is far from the ideal. And they can\u0027t go back home or call for help, because \u0022home\u0022 no longer exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you can see where this is going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving decrypted the languages of these humans during the last leg of their journey, they now transmit their story to the people of Earth, and ask if they could find shelter on our home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do WE do? We have the survival of another sentient race in our hands, we could blow them out of the sky if we wanted to. Could we even live with ourselves if we did that? If we decide to let them stay, to what degree to we welcome them, do we let them into our homes, build a house for them next door, or keep them in concentration camps? What about the long-term effects of this, at every level, from technological to social? Would we eventually try to destroy each other, or would the two races merge together in such a way (from a social viewpoint, not a biological one. Sorry, Kirk-fans) that the two are treated one and the same by society? What are your personal opinions on what SHOULD happen, and what WOULD happen?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[CLARIFICATION ON THE ALIENS] Imagine we turned back time by 50 million years, to when mammels were starting to fill out the niches left empty by the dinosaurs. If we let natural selection do it\u0027s thing, we would eventually produce a species very much \u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E Homo sapiens, but \u003Cem\u003Enot quite\u003C/em\u003E. All the really important stuff, what we say to distinguih ourselves from the other lifeforms, will still be there, but it could be slightly taller, or less hairy, or a slightly different leg structure. THAT is our aliens. This is so that the scenario works (they would very much like a world like Earth, and we could communicate with them once we\u0027re past the language barrier).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-19T02:43:21Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2014 02:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Drunkrobot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T02:17:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat should happen is they should get certain land set aside for them, where as long as they don\u0027t destroy anything, we let them live there.

What land, may I ask you? What do we have available to give? We can choose to give them utterly inhospitable areas like Antarctica or the Sahara desert, which to them would be no different than remaining on their ship, because it would require them to live in closed biodomes. So that\u0027s not an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we could offer them hospitable but currently uninhabited land, such as large swathes of Canada or Russia or Brazil... except that those areas are one of the last remaining biospheres that make our planet Earth so earth-like. Do you wish to give up more of the critically important Amazon rainforest that\u0027s already being consumed at an alarming rate? 250,000 individuals require a LOT of space if they must be quarantined for safety reasons, live completely self-sufficient because they eat different things than we do and have no industry to trade with us. It would be the equivalent of a small nation; maybe around a thousand square miles (2600 km\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2), the size of Luxembourg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the big one - giving them land that\u0027s already inhabited.

(Sorry China, but you know it already happens every day on a smaller scale.) The less a country cares about its human population, the more likely it will be able to make room.
