The interesting thing I noticed when I looked at output_log is that, when I switched from the Sun-orbiting vessel to the space center, PlanetariumCamera focused on the Mun, whereas when I switched from a Kerbin-orbiting vessel to the space center (or from the space center to the tracking center), PlanetariumCamera focused on Kerbin. I wonder if that\u0027s part of the cause -- if the Camera is looking at KSC but thinks it\u0027s on the Mun, maybe there\u0027s some kind of massive disparity in some of the floating-point numbers (the shadows are only a few meters or tens of meters in size, while it thinks its distance to the objects being imaged is something like 12 Mm) causing some funky rounding or machine-epsilon errors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
