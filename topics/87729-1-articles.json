Being able to choose, with a disclaimer explaining than you can\u0027t launch straight into a lower inclination orbit that your launch site\u0027s latitude and suggesting a site along the equator, plus incentivizing non-equatorial sites with lower costs, could lead to some interesting trade offs. Plus we\u0027d get a change of scenery and see more of Kerbin. Messing around with KerbinSide, flying around a bunch of new terrain that, with the addition of EVE can look pretty nice, and then going back to the same old KSC can be tough. Plus we could have multiple launch sites, possibly supporting construction/launch prep. time restraints. Just my feelings on the matter. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: It took a minute for me to realize of the most obvious and useful reasons for multiple Space-centers, which is: multiple high-return recovery points to aim for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-18T05:14:03Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2014 05:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Mandelbrot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T05:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDifferent Launchsites should be an Option in stock but the equatorial Launchsite is great for People new to the game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW... there is still KSC-2 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T05:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeck if it would be an option, I would make my KSP on EVE (of all places). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond option would be on Laythe for the Joolian settings (like alternis kerbol).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen for the fun of it, Minmus or Pol... but free launches aren\u0027t really my style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf only on Kerbin, then I\u0027d go Antarctica.
