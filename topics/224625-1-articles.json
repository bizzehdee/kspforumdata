I imagine, in the settings, a slider that would be set by default on 3, but could be adjusted from 0 (completely disables autosaves) from something like 15 or 20 for example. (We could even go further and let people remove the limit if they wish to \u2013 they would have to perform the cleanup manually though)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother opportunity coming with this one is to also implement another slider next to the previous one to configure the frequency of each autosave (1, 2, 3... 15 minutes?)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
