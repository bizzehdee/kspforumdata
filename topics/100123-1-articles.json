Whenever I open up my rocket, which is normal except it weighs a crap ton, I can edit for a few minutes but then:\n\nParts dragged in (PP tanks) cannot be edited or attached,\n\nSave button doesnt work,\n\nLaunch doesnt work,\n\nLoad does not work.\n\nTo reproduce: \n\nBuild a ship with an SRB from PP at the lower stage (may need to be huge),\n\nAdd PP adapter, PP decoupler and fairing base from PF\n\nAdd thrust plate with 20\u002B engine mounts\n\nAdd engines\n\nAdd RF PP tank\n\nAdd mechjeb and fairings\n\nScroll down, a chunk of the ship is missing (sometimes only the decoupler is left), load or launch cease to work\n\nI checked the craft file of the ship in question, it has roughly the same .craft size as the others (230KB). However, there is an autosaved ship with 1KB and contains nothing, though I have no idea what that is. Help would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nMODS: (many parts in part packs deleted)\n\nRSS and RO\n\nEditor Extensions\n\nFASA\n\nFAR\n\nHangar Extender\n\nKJR\n\nKWRocketry\n\nMechjeb2\n\nNear Future Solar\n\nNovapunch2\n\nNRAP (procedural payload)\n\nProcedural Fairings\n\nProcedural Parts\n\nRealFuels\n\nSmokescreen\n\nTweakscale\n\nEDIT: Deleting autosave file did not help. It let me load but the ship was unusable, had half parts missing etc and could not be launched.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-20T14:55:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2015 02:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GiantTank**"},{"CreatedByName":"GiantTank","CreatedById":113180,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T14:56:40Z","Content":"Please help, this is the most infuriating bug I have ever had to deal with, having half the ship disappear just plain sucks.

Now i gotta reinstall this game. Squad, this is by far the worst bug!!! It spreads to the stock game too. ... is this! And nobody even helps. Jesus. OF COURSE WHEN YOU HAVE 80 MODS UR GONNA CRASH! THATS CLUTTER! STOP ASKING WHY! YOU DONT NEED SUPPORT!\n\nI found one thing. It appears to be caused by PF thrust plates with more than 40 nodes. Screw this. I hate this game now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T16:20:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GiantTank**"},{"CreatedByName":"bernh","CreatedById":140617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T04:22:04Z","Content":"You are probably running out of RAM, based on the mods installed, but your error log in your dropbox is truncated, and the area that states a RAM problem is missing.\n\n I have around 50 mods, some very large ones, and was crashing bad.

After a lot of trial and error I came up with this solution. - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115069-0-90-Possible-Windows-Memory-Wall-Crash-Workaround](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115069-0-90-Possible-Windows-Memory-Wall-Crash-Workaround)\n\nThis is an alternative to ATM.
