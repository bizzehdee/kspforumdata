If you make the same length burn with the same ship you will get the same DeltaV (obviously the amount of fuel you have remaining makes a difference as once your ship has less mass you will get more acceleration for the same amount of fuel). The oberth effect occurs dependant on WHERE you make your burn. Burning low down in a gravity well (say to escape the planets SOI) not only accelerates you ship away from the planet, it also reduces the time for which gravity has to slow you down as you escape. It also works the opposite way round. If you come shooting into an SOI towards a planet, you travel quickly towards it not giving the planets gravity a long time to accelerate you (Therefore you dont need to use fuel removing this velocity when you want to slow down relative to the planet). Also once you burn, the closer to the planet you are the more time gravity has to slow you down and therefore the less velocity you need to remove to prevent yourself flying back out into interplanetary space. Your rocket isnt influenced by where it is (Constant ISP, Constant fuel consumption for a given throttle setting, DeltaV produced only depends on the properties of your rocket), but the resulting change in orbit for a given amount of DeltaV is VERY dependant on the previous orbit and WHERE the burn is made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(An illustration of the oberth effect is the act of hovering.
