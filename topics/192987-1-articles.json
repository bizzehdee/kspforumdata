But there is no reasonable prospect for trade in any significant mass of physical material from a Mars settlement back to Earth in the near future due to the high transport costs. In his recent article in the\u00A0National Review,\u00A0\u201CElon Musk\u2019s Plan to Settle Mars,\u201D\u00A0Robert Zubrin makes exactly the same point: a business case based on physical trade is not necessary and makes little sense. Later trade and commerce via non-physical goods such as software is probable once a settlement is fully operational. More significant and interesting economic situations will occur on Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA good model for the expenditures needed to found colonies is the Greek and Phoenician expansion all across the Mediterranean and Black Sea areas in the period early in Greek history (before about 600 BC), leading to the founding of one of the greatest trading cities in history, Carthage.

In order to provide a resting place for their merchant fleets, to maintain a Phoenician monopoly on an area\u0027s natural resource, or to conduct trade on its own, the Phoenicians established numerous colonial cities along the coasts of the Mediterranean, stretching from Iberia to the Black Sea. They were stimulated to found their cities by a need for revitalizing trade in order to pay the tribute extracted from\u00A0Tyre,\u00A0Sidon, and\u00A0Byblos\u00A0by the succession of empires that ruled them and later by fear of complete Greek colonization of that part of the Mediterranean suitable for commerce.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPopulation growth created a scarcity of farm land and a restriction of the ability of smallholders to farm it, which was similar in every [Greek] city-state. In places with surplus population, this led to a demand for additional living space. The location of each colonial establishment was dictated by the supply of unexploited resources which would provision the metropolis, as well as the finished goods it would produce.

First, Antarctica is actually worse (i.e. less habitable) than Mars by some measures. There\u0027s less available sunlight, especially during the winter months, meaning less consistently available solar power, and Earth\u0027s atmosphere is much thicker than Mars\u0027s, which corresponds to faster heat loss. Beyond that, though, there are several international treaties preventing any and all exploitation of Antarctic resources for economic gain, by public or private entities. The population of Antarctica is low because, beyond anything else, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eillegal\u003C/em\u003E to do anything there other than research. Were that not the case, I\u0027m sure we would see mining and oil towns in Antarctica, and at least one settlement that could be described as a city (to function as a port of entry, among other things). The population wouldn\u0027t be high, by any means - but it would be a lot higher than what it is today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
