The negativity and hatefulness that this forum has felt largely free of has seemed far more widespread. I was too busy to post much in the system requirements thread but, holy cow, there is some vehement anger, and tin foil hat level stuff in there: people saying they hope the game fails and the studio closes because the system requirements were too high (for v0.1 of EA), or that this clearly means that they have been systematically lying to us and manipulating us all along, stuff like that. Heck, the continual recurrence of the thing about clouds, and stuff like atmosphere scattering and graphics in general, is reaching comedy levels.

Even the repeated pushing back of the release date over the last couple years has always felt like a dev team that cared a lot being allowed to do \u0022feature creep\u0022 in a good way, and being the time to do so properly. Despite the occasional naysayers and trolls, I have never worried that it wouldn\u0027t come out (and that sentiment never managed to take hold here, thankfully); obviously I can be wrong, but I\u0027ve seen what development hell looks like, and it never looked and felt like that. Sure, the studio change was a cause for worry in that initial period where we didn\u0027t have much info and we were waiting to see how it all shook out, but it turned out fine, as far as can be seen, and may well have been for the better (we\u0027ll probably never have enough inside information to definitely say about that one, but it\u0027s most certainly a reasonable assertion). I am definitely hoping that it will return to that once EA gets solidly underway, and that this is just the years of build up in the pressure cooker of hype blowing out bursts of overheated emotional steam, because this is just yucky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a big fan of the whole \u0022go touch grass\u0022 comment (I agree with the sentiment behind it, but I find most uses of it to be too condescending, and it feels like it\u0027s that way on purpose. I prefer that sentiment to be delivered\u00A0 in a less sarcastically laconic, and more useful and productive way), but there have been an increasing amount of threads and posts where, while I didn\u0027t say it, cuz there is no way it would actually improve the conversations, it certainly felt like an appropriate response.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not even saying emotional reactions are invalid. Be excited. Be disappointed when things are not as you hoped they would be. Raise your concerns, in a thoughtful manner, as they arise. Be critical, in a constructive way, when it is needed (and it will be needed plenty, I\u0027m sure. Honestly, if they didn\u0027t think it did, it would probably not go through EA). Raise your voices, if valid concerns are being ignored, and if it is \u003Cem\u003Etruly \u003C/em\u003Ecalled for (but that should a higher bar then many seem to think, and is not the same as just angrily yelling).\u00A0 But also reserve some judgment for when it, y\u0027know, actually comes out, and some more for the real v1.0 release. And remember that this is a game, you don\u0027t have to buy it (you can even say why you aren\u0027t, if it is done constructively) and those are all real human beings (who really seem to want to make this the best it can be, and really care about it) who are making it, and that this forum is a better place when we stay rational and, above all, civil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-21T16:41:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224236492\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212157\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221676996577\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vl3d\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, Vl3d said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105624\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Pthigrivi\u003C/a\u003Ewhat do you think about the trip planner?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027s a start.

As a consumer, I accept that sometimes I\u0027ll give a company my money for a vision I\u0027m hoping they reach, but they fall short. In my opinion, they way for KSP2 to become what I want is for me to buy it, play it, stay positive, and give constructive feedback. For some games that I\u0027ve played, that hasn\u0027t worked and I\u0027ll hold a grudge for a long time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll just summarize by saying that, as a software developer, I really don\u0027t understand the people who take a game they want to love, and just shower it with negativity all over the internet for not reaching their expectations. I\u0027m not saying there\u0027s never a time to go there; after a lot of burned bridges on Elite Dangerous, I\u0027m at that point myself. But we\u0027re nowhere near that point on KSP2, and the best thing we can do for the game at this point is support the devs and give them a chance to actualize the vision they\u0027ve presented to us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LoSBoL","CreatedById":174038,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-23T19:08:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224239062\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212157\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677178331\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002271395\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jarin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, Jarin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven the publisher, I would \u003Cem\u003Enot \u003C/em\u003Eexpect a NMS situation here.

KSP is a wonderful game but there are tons of under the hood quirks, problems, and bugs, an inconsistent art style, and tons of underdeveloped gameplay elements and many clear potential gameplay systems that are absent entirely. Taking the core of it, improving and tuning it for performance and qol, and improving, adding, and building out gameplay systems and loops (not to mention interstellar travel, which is huge), which is, by all appearances, what they are doing, is pretty much exactly what KSP2 needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd complaining about the engines and parts being the same (which, we will see once it\u0027s out.\u00A0 YMMV, I suppose) would be a much more compelling argument if they weren\u0027t adding a ton of engines and parts, and if we didn\u0027t have EA for them to take feedback and tune things. Plus, they fill valid needs, so even if they got rid of them, they would still need new ones that filled the same approximate roles, just with a different look, and then then the issue just rolls back around to tuning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
