Adult females 3 feet tall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMales often keep their body hair to a minimum, however richer kerbals have been observed growing large amounts of hair, styling it to increase their social standing. Females are less common. An extremely large proportion of female kerbals grow long hair, regardless of social standing. Kerbal heads are large, for one purpose. Crash Protection. Their skulls are mostly a rubbery material called Kergelium. It explains why kerbals bounce when they hit the ground. Kerbal eyes are large, able to see in dark environments. It is unknown if kerbals are plants or not. They are hardy, able to survive decades in deep space with nothing at all apart from a spacesuit. They are able to swim, walk and jump great distances. A Kerbal brain is fairly small, but with a large amount of processing power. They can withstand high gravity and extreme temperatures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHierarchy\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll kerbals are signed up into the space program from the moment they can walk.
