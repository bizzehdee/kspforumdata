I finally decided to give the game a try and I\u0027m having a blast. Literally, heh. I started in Career Mode, added a couple of PC Gamer recommended mods like MechJeb and Chatterer, and have been learning what works and what doesn\u0027t. Thus far my \u0022Death Wish\u0022 series of rockets- I\u0027m up to MK 5- have enabled me to orbit the Mun and Minimus, though Minimus was a real bear to figure out how to fly to. Apparently MechJeb doesn\u0027t fully unlock until later so I\u0027ve been flying things on manual and banging my head on the wall figuring out how to plot orbital maneuvers with the add maneuver thingy. Quite fun. I\u0027ve yet to make a precision landing a KSC but hey at least I can land. I\u0027ve only killed Jeb a couple of times thus far. Er, he\u0027s gone MIA, like a Spartan. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Hm, how I have a vision of a kerbal in Spartan armor...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually had an idea for a similar rocket building game back in the 90s, but never figured out the math or game technology, so I\u0027m happy to see Squad\u0027s accomplishment working so well- and it\u0027s not even done yet. Unity really makes game development easier, much easier to pick up than XNA or DirectX (I abandoned those efforts years ago). I have my own game idea in mind, and have been teaching myself Unity, and I spent my free time last year switching from trueSpace to 3DS MAX. I\u0027m also learning to write stories for games- all in my free time of course, so it\u0027s slow going. Programming is the easy part, I\u0027ve been doing that for years; it\u0027s what I do to earn a living. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see that KSP has plans to deduct a cost for the rocket components, but what about making money? Is there some sort of commerce mod available already? Sort of like the old Earth Orbit Stations or Space M\u002BA\u002BX games? I can envision different experiments like the old Project Space Station had as well. Speaking of which, what space station modules are there in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Mike\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spellflight.com/ContactLostArt/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMy 3D Art Gallery\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boosterspice","CreatedById":58629,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T17:49:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!

This game is the sort of thing I\u0027ve wanted to play since I was very young; various other games had some of the other mechanics in place (craft construction and customization, realistic physics, etc.), but none of them quite combined it into the \u0022full package\u0022 I was looking for until I discovered KSP myself almost a year ago. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Wow, has it really been that long?)\u003C/span\u003E Of course, in the \u002790s I was still in elementary school, so I couldn\u0027t be quite as proactive about it as you apparently were \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as economy-adding mods go, let me point you in the direction of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43645-KSP-23-Mission-Controller-Extended-%28Looking-For-Parts!!%29-Version-55-%283-1-14%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMission Controller Extended\u003C/a\u003E.

Just in case I want to add stuff as well... Actually, I did want to clean up all the space debris orbiting Kerbin. I know I can select the debris and hit Terminate in the tracking screen, but you know, that is no fun, not to mention contributions to the Kessler Syndrome. What I want to do is build a ship that can grab the debris and de-orbit it. I don\u0027t know of any grabbers that would let me do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, I have successfully landed probes on the Mun and Minimus, collected data, and brought them back.

So, it\u0027s overpowered. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E From there, the core booster becomes the Kerbin Departure Stage, which pushes the stack to either the Mun or to Minimas. The former Kerbin Departure Stage becomes a handy crasher stage, so the probe has plenty of fuel to land with. After touchdown, the probe takes readings and blasts off again. The three outer engines can get the probe back to Kerbin and de-orbit it. Originally I designed the probe\u0027s core engine to do that work, but now it just helps slow the probe down during its plunge into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, and slows the stack enough so that it isn\u0027t jolted by the chutes opening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course with the new tech tree unlocks, the Death Wish MK 7 is now obsolete...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crasher925","CreatedById":44578,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T10:17:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehehe heh welcome to the forums and welcome to ksp \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T13:49:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!
