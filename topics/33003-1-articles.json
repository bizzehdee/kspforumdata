A Larangian point automatically means there is a new SOI that interacts with the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be two possibilities then:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we talk about the parent to the planet you are flying by, then it\u0027s possible only if the Larange point is \u003Cem\u003Ewithin\u003C/em\u003E the planet\u0027s SOI.

That would need to be checked I\u0027m not 100% sure, but it makes sense I guess. And if so, to significantly change the escape velocity, those objects would have to be really massive, and probably that the gravitational waves they induce with the planet would have a much bigger effect than the escape velocity change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, again this requires a third extra influence. Natural captures are possible, it\u0027s just hard to get the required conditions. And for example, a natural capture around Venus or Mercury would be near impossible because they don\u0027t have any current moon. The most likely way it would happen would be that a binary ateroid/comet would enter the SOI and leave on in orbit while the other one is expelled at high speeds. Or by a lucky influence with the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
