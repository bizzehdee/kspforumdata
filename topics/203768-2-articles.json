Anyhow, in the early days of KSP (think version 0.18), there was a lot of buzz by newcomers into the game who were upset about the lack of goals KSP had. I, for one, never had to have prompts on how to play the game; I could easily make up my own missions and my own goals. But for some, they needed something other than \u0022here\u0027s a bunch of rocket parts, go build!\u0022 Remember, the early versions of the game were a free-build sandbox games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoodies and Easter eggs were added in .18 (maybe earlier, but I wasn\u0027t playing before then). We had a desert temple, crashed UFOs, a dead Kraken, M\u00FCn arches, and monoliths, etc. to go find. And again, for many, these were enough incentives to fling Kerbals out in all kinds of directions and in all kinds of contraptions of death. But for many, that still was not enough incentive to spark the imagination, so career and science modes would be added with a wonky tech-tree (that made no sense to me) to help folks manage their way through the game. Sure, it has always seemed like an afterthought, because it was! And sure, it probably could have been implemented a lot better, but considering that by that point the game had already begun to evolve beyond the original programmer\u0027s vision, so this development was beyond the vision, too.

RAM usage, bugs that break ships but stay on board with the game because they\u0027ve been introduced in-universe as the Kraken, a charming artstyle that got replaced with much more generic 60s textures, basic features like alarms and craft searching that took until KSP\u0027s final breath to be introduced, inaccurate physics warp with countless accuracy related bugs with no way to disable inaccuracy without BetterTimeWarp, a low time warp cap that results in Jool transfers being a massive bore, all these things just pushed me off and so far I\u0027ve been waiting a phenomenal amount of time for KSP 2 to drop so I can get back in without having to put up with all these issues. I expect KSP 2 to bring new players to the table thanks to the fact that it isn\u0027t just extreme fanatics that can put up with all this.
