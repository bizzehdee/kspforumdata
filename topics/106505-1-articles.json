I find it much more forgiving than FAR in regards to aicraft stability. However, when I make spaceplanes and get them to reenter (even from a 75km suborbital trajectory that goes 180 degrees around kerbin) They almost always partly burn up, especially the wings and control surfaces. Is there a way to put ablators on them? Maybe an MM config?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeckuvaTester","CreatedById":138862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T12:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure I could do it.
