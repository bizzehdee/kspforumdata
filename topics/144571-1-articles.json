For one it would be far smaller, however it would operate whilst airborne the same by using propellers to provide lift and movement. However it would be computer controlled, with a passenger selecting a destination from a list of authorized landing sites and once landed, the vehicle can then drive closer to the location as needed using driving autopilot software already in development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vehicle would also be small with only 2-3 seats for passengers which would likely sit in a tight circle as to minimize space. The motor would also be made from pre-existing engines, such as the ones from lightweight airplanes for flight so that there wouldn\u0027t need additional costs for creating new engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is borderline a \u0022flying car\u0022, but unlike the close attempt we have, this would be small and function just about anywhere. The greatest benefit being that you could take photos of an area you would like to have used for the flight landing software and send it to a division who would look it over, approve it and therefore let you turn any acceptable location into a landing site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlying drone technology is existing technology as it\u0027s been used for the military for years and now has become considered for companies with lightweight drones. Now a helictoper-esque vehicle is not quite the same as a 10 pound drone, but with time and development safety can be included into the design and make it viable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole point of the vehicle being that people can go anywhere they want, and possibly avoid traffic. If this were to become successful, maybe we could finally become the BTTF 2015 and finally make traffic jams a thing of the past?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was just an idea of mine. Let me know what\u0027s right or wrong or just your thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WestAir","CreatedById":59115,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T04:03:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe very first roadblock you\u0027ll encounter will be a legal one, then a logistical / contingency battle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.)
