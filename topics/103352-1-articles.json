It\u0027s just functionality I expect. 2. Rovers, I\u0027m sick of putting these stupid rigs with command pods that make it harder to edit them(have to remove the whole thing to check CoM etc, for example), destroy the smallest ones, and waste time. I know TouTorpedo made a mod like that, but as far as I know it is years old and doesn\u0027t serve a function anymore. Can someone make a new mod to fix this? It would make my life so much easier(hard to make ATV\u0027s for awesome sci-fi warfare if they need a pod 4 times their size stuck to them).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T05:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77066-Seat-Fixer-Assign-Crew-to-Command-Seats-in-VAB-SPH!-Launch-Kerbals-on-an-SRB!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77066-Seat-Fixer-Assign-Crew-to-Command-Seats-in-VAB-SPH!-Launch-Kerbals-on-an-SRB!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like the DL is dead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Solarspaceprobe","CreatedById":125110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T08:10:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI mention that, but it\u0027s broken and Tou\u0027s mods don\u0027t work very well for me anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T20:19:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Solarspaceprobe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Solarspaceprobe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI mention that, but it\u0027s broken and Tou\u0027s mods don\u0027t work very well for me anyways.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I can\u0027t mod, but decoupling that grey structural pylon leaves no ugly stuff on your rover.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T20:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERoverDudes exploration pack has a couple of tiny one kerbal pods, they\u0027re more like wearable command pods than pods.
