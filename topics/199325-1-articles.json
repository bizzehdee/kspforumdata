Like literally a fresh save. Each \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E is attached via a tt-38k decoupler. But when I cycle through the staging, it doesnt decouple. It makes the noise, and the tt-38k piece falls off, but the SRBs are still attached. Ive tried doing it with slow velocity, fast velocity. Stage with another rocket kicking on, stage without a rocket kicking on. Ive tred 3 decouplers PER \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E.
