The Jet Airliner has been properly redesigned, the SR-71 is exactly correct to the best of my ability. The Thunderbird is deliberately unstable, since it\u0027s a maneuverable jet fighter.\u003Cp\u003EOh, sure. I\u0027d love to add proper aeroelasticity and flutter, but haven\u0027t gotten to that yet. The best part is that adding that will lead to aileron reversal effects (go too fast with wings that are too thin and the ailerons cause the wing to bend so much that the plane actually rolls the other way). Lots of rage will occur once that is implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The blackbird should be able to reach for 20 kilometers, but that\u0027s more of the atomsphere limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re just not handling the SR-71 right.

I love it even more than before, but I\u0027m noticing that it\u0027s really, really easy to SSTO now compared to back in .19 as far as I can tell. Stuff just seems to get really fast reallu quickly, to the extent that I managed to get the Grumman X-29A that comes with the mod up to quite a few km/s in the upper atmosphere, putting it on a nice suborbital trajectory peaking about halfway out to the Mun. If I\u0027d stuck a few sepratrons on the fuselage before I launched, I probably would have been able to bring my periapse above the atmosphere and call it an orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just wondering, is this how it\u0027s supposed to be? I know Kerbin\u0027s small size compared to Earth makes it easier to SSTO, but this still seems a little much, and I\u0027m wondering if things didn\u0027t get moved over properly when I installed the mod or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for the great mod, by the way!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-19T04:27:21Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2014 04:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GreeningGalaxy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Einaccurate values\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
