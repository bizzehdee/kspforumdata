In principle this is fairly simple. Just watch for new contracts and adjust their values as needed. I haven\u0027t implemented any of that, and I would need to take into account strategies, but this should work fairly simply. Any changes to the rewards etc... for any contract would take place after other types of configs (ie FinePrint\u0027s config file, which adjusts values while the contract is being generated, not after), but there is no reason why any mod Contract type and/or Parameter type shouldn\u0027t be adjustable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a mockup of the config window, the new button on the main window is used to open it. All of the contract/parameter rewards/penalties are adjusted with some kind of mutant log-scale slider. From 0-100% is linear, from 101-1000% is log scale, to push the less useful, really high amounts together toward the right side. This allows for easy adjustment of all these values. Along the bottom are sliders to set the max amount of contracts offered for a given type (contracts offered after reaching this amount would just be deleted before you ever see them, hopefully), and to adjust the max amount of active contracts of that type and its duration once accepted (obviously some special cases will be needed for the contracts that don\u0027t expire).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kd8sjgL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kd8sjgL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach contract and parameter type can be selected through two scrollable drop-down menus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u6VOx1V.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022u6VOx1V.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously many improvements need to be made to the UI and to make the options clearer.

Any addon contracts/parameters should be recognized and allow for adjustments (it is possible that the contract/parameter type names might be ambiguous for some of these, this depends on the mod author). There are a handful of stock contract and parameter types that are unused, but still show up here, as someone else may be using them (there is also one broken stock parameter type that has been specifically excluded from the list). A global config file is planned for a later version, but for now every save file will start out with the default values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe aware that allowing for 0% values, or toggling the option to adjust active contracts on and off may cause problems.
