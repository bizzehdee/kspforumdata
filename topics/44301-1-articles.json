With these, they can accomplish a mission, such as a sub-orbital flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay they fail once, and are stuck bankrupt with no rocket parts to use, or just a couple SRB\u0027s. To combat this, they could take out a loan that they can repay later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce they earn some money from the missions they complete, or by loans, they can buy better rocket parts, slowly working up to interplanetary and return missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a way that would be similar to the Mission Controller mod:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WmG6g9r.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WmG6g9r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for advanced players, a space race using one of the said systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe, when starting a Career Mode save, they can choose what system they play in!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1L0zFYN.png\u0022 alt=\u00221L0zFYN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease tell me what you think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, what happened to the forums?

For one, obviously KSP is not linear, nor is it designed with some end game. Loans make sense here, in the sense of players learning to respect the fact that they have parts, and costs for them. But, with the use of loans, obviously it has to have limits, and if those are spent, then what? wait for some time induced bail out to continue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I like loans, but there should be an alternative in my opinion. Without reducing players to repeating missions for pay (unless they\u0027re dynamic, like rescuing stranded kerbanauts for other space programs/nations.) there needs to be \u0022Chores\u0022 to act as a more solid structure of funding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I already suggested, dynamic missions like rescues, part scavenging, resource expeditions, and other such tedious activities would go hand in hand with a loan system, for one, there could be set \u0022loan\u0022 stock vehicles for these missions you can use to opt out of building your own, and the pay of the mission will be based on fuel consumption, time, vehicular condition, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, as for making loans reasonable other than X amount of money. It could be based on varying factors. Reputation, success ratings for missions (what kind of mission as well could be considered), average time it took to pay the loan off, and even could be loaned based on a single vehicle\u0027s reputation. Like a commonly used launch sub stage could end up sponsored since said loaner may feel more at ease with investing in the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for space races, I really like this concept, except it needs to be balanced for ships assembled in orbit, up to the point of an exit burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Naten","CreatedById":70923,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T20:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I agree about the loans. If SQUAD were to add these \u0022loans\u0022 in someday, I think it should start of as... say... 1,000 Kerbal Monetary Units, for which I think we should refer to as KM for simplicity\u0027s sake, from now on. And for each uncompleted mission that is completed, would that add 500 KM or so to the maximum loan, or maybe should it be based off of reputation with Kerbals getting killed or not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it should be like this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting max. loan: KM 1,000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, there should be a time scale.

Basically, you\u0027d be doing whatever you want to do, like flying a bunch of missions to Mun and the game would give you missions that encourage that behavior. Then I think he said there might also be a couple missions that help you advance your technology and understanding of the game mechanics thus encouraging you to widen your experience by traveling to other planets. Not necessarily telling you to go there but certainly giving you incentive to spread your wings a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s been a lot of suggestions as to how kerbonauts would make their money aside from missions. Lots of good suggestions like selling tickets for kerbals to view some of your launches(perhaps certain specific/historic missions would feature this ability), mining for rare materials(basically a resource that only exists to be sold, I guess) and shipping it back to KSC or near enough to it to salvage the materials at low cost and high profit, using a progression themed or fully customizable museum to generate positive feedback and public opinion for your space program, thus increasing funding and so on. Just a lot of really good ideas percolating around in the minds of forumgoers everywhere.
