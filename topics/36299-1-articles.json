At this point the only person with the right to do anything with those models and textures is the maker, William bunch\u0027o\u0027numbers or something. I haven\u0027t looked for him in a while but last i did he hadn\u0027t been active since before the forum crash. As a fellow fan of the OI capsules and faced with the mandatory discontinuation of them (until he shows up again or 2130 or so) I went and made my own, being sure the license was shipped with every download. I cant provide a link because Im on a phone right now and thumbing this up is hard enough, but you\u0027ll find it on SpacePort if you search for HexCans\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
