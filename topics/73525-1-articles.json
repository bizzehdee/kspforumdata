I personally don\u0027t want revert to launch completely removed because I like to test my designs. But once I\u0027m done testing, and I\u0027ve decided to do a real launch, I would like there to be a no-turning-back mode so that if all hell breaks loose, I can\u0027t just hit the revert button during the initial shock and disappointment of the disaster. Like when I killed Jeb, Bill, and Bob in one go when my science plane crashed on take-off during it\u0027s maiden flight. The temptation to revert in my deepening sense of regret and loss was almost insurmountable - if any other additional disappointment had occurred simultaneously (like if my Eggo-waffles had started to burn in the toaster), I surely could not have faced the reality of life without those three heroes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T19:30:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot globaly. I can see in the future difficulty for career being added. MAYBE then there can be an option when starting a new career to remove the revert flight along with other changes. Since it is already an option in the config files i see this as already planned. But until difficulty settings could be added, demanding all career plays to play one way is not how career should be made. Reverting flights is a big portion of testing missions, especially for a rather new player. Not killing hundreds of kerbals just trying to get to orbit is kinda ridiculous. (also probably impossible as you will lose the game by then)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tutrakan4e","CreatedById":100818,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T19:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs long as the Kraken is roaming around the Kerbol system the \u0022Revert to Launch\u0022 is welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T00:00:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be awfully hard to test things with \u0022revert flight\u0022 removed.
