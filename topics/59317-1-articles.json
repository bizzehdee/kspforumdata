I\u0027m not referring to the \u0027stage\u0027 action group that triggers for every stage, but a numbered one that triggers when that numbered stage is. Uses for this would be things like, automatically deploying solar panels after fairings have been discarded, or after release from the launch vehicle. Activating/deactivating reaction wheels at various stages of launch. Pretty much anything that can be done using current action groups now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think overall this would give us loads more flexibility for vehicles without having to remember specific action groups to trigger, and freeing up action groups for other uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else think this would be handy?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
