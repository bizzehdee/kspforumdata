I got the lander/drive/refinery portion up into orbit no problem. It is currently on space trials between the Mun and Minimus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some shots of the lander under power and then the last three shots are the craft I am having a problem with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/JacHI\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I built the lander/drive section first launched it and tested it. Then I went back and built the command section second removing most of the lander to save weight. It was the only way I could get everything to line up right so all three senor clampotrons can dock. The problem is when I get the whole craft into orbit and go to separate the lander section which is basically just a construction jig my command section explodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell sometimes it just separates into a bunch of bits with no explosion. I have tried using, docking ports on both sides, docking ports on one side, seperators, decouplers and every combination in between. Everytime the command section breaks apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to fix this or is it just a function of the way the ships were built? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have included the craft file. The staging for the lifter is a bit out of order. I have to watch the tanks draining to make sure I adjust it in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1b53G-UMsskazFJcnU5aWxPazA/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1b53G-UMsskazFJcnU5aWxPazA/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-16T02:49:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2013 02:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by British_Rover\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efixed craft link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T04:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first recommendation: Have you tried taking a look at the design in the VAB and ensured that none of the parts on the vessel are clipping through one another?

It was the first thing I tried after the decouplers caused the command section to come apart. On my initial design something might have been clipped because their was an explosion but I went back double checked everything and built a whole new command section. Using an action group to decouple the command section still broke apart into three or more pieces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am going to try and rebuild everything from the command section down to a new Mark2 kethinterplantery lander and see if maybe the craft file was corrupted. After using my Mark1 design between the Mun and Minimus there are few things I would like to change. I think I can knock a couple of tons off the lander and give it Tylo capability after refueling with Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-16T23:10:46Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2013 11:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by British_Rover\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
