Others too, but those are the main gameplay ones.\n\nOn my 0.90 career, which took a while! This happened.\n\nEverything was great and a little slow. I had an orbiter at each of Kerbin\u0027s moons equipped with a lander and enough fuel to land at almost every biome. I was also doing contracts to raise cash. I maxed out the level-2 science building very quickly, then it became a grind to attain the cash to build it up to level-3. I used policies to convert as much science as possible to cash, but when I finally could afford to upgrade the building, I had attained enough science to easily unlock all remaining nodes, with thousands of science left over.\n\nI don\u0027t think a single Kerbal has reached level 3 - none of them have done more than 2 - 3 missions. My two Duna probes are still 200 days out from Duna. Yet, in a way, the game is \u0022complete\u0022 - my motivation is unlocking stuff.\n\nIf anybody can suggest a way to extend the game without breaking my save, I\u0027d like that. The only thing I can think of is KSP Interstellar, but I\u0027m not really into the future-tech. I also noticed a couple of tempting tech trees that require adding multiple mods for parts etc. I am already near the RAM limit.\n\nIn my opinion the stock tech tree should be more like the real story of rocket development from the V-1 to the near future. Gradually improving parts over time. The way it is, I\u0027m unlocking the most powerful engines in the game before construction is complete on my first Poodle-powered ship...\n\nI also considered tweaking the science income down and the funds income up, but that would make the early game painfully slow.\n\nI\u0027d just wait for 1.0, but I think that\u0027s a long way off...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T15:25:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 03:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Matt77**"},{"CreatedByName":"sam.johnson841","CreatedById":104846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T11:12:55Z","Content":"Build a colony on Gillie or something crazy, anything crazy will do, you could look in the challenge sub forum for ideas?\n\nSam"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T13:15:56Z","Content":"Interstellar might be the way to go.

From the amount of work Scott Manley had to do to reach warp capability, I don\u0027t suppose I\u0027ll manage it before 1.0 arrives and EVERYTHING changes :-)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T14:14:58Z","Content":"The stock career is horribly unbalanced, especially in terms of science rewards.\n\nSo if you want a balanced gameplay, consider using balance mods, especially regarding contracts and strategies.\n\nSince mixing tech trees during a game is generally a bad idea and you already accumulated lots of science from the unbalanced contracts, a new career is your best option for a balanced gameplay.\n\nThe SETI-BalanceMod in my signature would provide that (with better progression, it starts with probes) when using the CommunityTechTree. If you do not want that, there are recommendations for other balancing mods under INSTALL and at the end of the second post."},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T15:08:01Z","Content":"Unfortunately career mode is still not a fully-fledged and balanced game in this respect.\n\nI tend to play much like you, if you want any other planets in the Kerbol system to be relevant then you must ban yourself from Kerbins moons. Its a spectacularly easy task to max out the entire tech tree within 2-3 game days with only vague ability to actually design and fly.\n\nFor instance i dont need minmus, its a 4day flight, why would i do that when i can strike 8 mun biomes in 24 hrs inc transfer and return?\n\nAnswer of course is just dont visit them, or make 1 token landing on each for the progression contracts but refrain from biome hopping or putting stations in orbit. Either pretty much completes your game directly, since you start reaping 2-4k sci per mission\n\nIf you want to do contracts, scale the sci rewards way back, i use 20% and they still contribute a big chunk.\n\nAlso ban yourself from \u0027Test-part\u0027 contracts or remove them entirely from the game, they areway too easy and offer broken amounts of sci. Its often possible to \u0027launch\u0027 something with no engines and/or fuel, recover it 15 seconds later and scoop 100 sci for launchpad part tests. Broken balance-wise.\n\nMods, as you mention can help, either they add more parts, or redistribute what is available. If you are already sitting close to the RAM cap then you will absolutely require the ATM mod to add anythign else (compresses textures, i use it even on otherwise vanilla installs since Squad\u0027s stock textures are bloaty)\n\nFinally, I did once play a carer back in 0.24 where I tripled the cost of every node in the tech tree. Game is still easy but takes a little longer at least and its less viable to max out inside Kerbin\u0027s SoI.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T15:13:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 03:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by celem**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T16:15:29Z","Content":"Interstellar is a really good idea. Most of it (except for antimatter and FTL-Drives) aren\u0027t even that far away, many are just in very early stages of development. Either that or development was stopped due to cost to efficieny factor. Things like fusion aren\u0027t that far off, and things like microwave beamed power are possible, but since we don\u0027t have fusion we don\u0027t have enough energy to make it useful etc. I really like the mod because it doesen\u0027t feel OP since it is a helluva lot of work to set up say a reliable beamed power network.\n\nAlso, I can strongly reccomend the [thread=79588]MKS/OKS[/thread] by Roverdude (also check out his other mods, they\u0027re awesome), especially combined with kethane or karbonite they add a whole new level of complexity to the game. \n\nMy self set goal is to havea fully self sufficient spaceprogram with in situ refuelling and mining operations, self-sustaining life support systems for all stations and bases, bases and orbital stations around every body, a fleet of FTL-capable shuttles and rescue ships and a gigantic self-sustaining FTL-Cruiser with landers, skycranes and rescue ships for all bodies in the kerbin system.\n\nAlso concerning your RAM problems I can strongly reccomend [thread=59005]Active Texture Managment[/thread]. That enabled me to more than double the amount of mods I can use, and my install was already heavily modded. I am currently using MKS/OKS, KW-Rocketry, KSP-Interstellar, Freight Transport Technologies and B9-Aerospace, all of which are rather part heavy.

I like the idea, but it makes too many changes for my liking. You made a good point about balance though - it isn\u0027t the tech tree that\u0027s the problem, it\u0027s the overall game balance.\n\nCelem - I\u0027m actually going to forget contracts exist between now and 1.0! Although they were absolutely required to get my science centre up to level three - I think the tiers increase in cost much too rapidly.
