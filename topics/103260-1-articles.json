I had an orbiter at each of Kerbin\u0027s moons equipped with a lander and enough fuel to land at almost every biome. I was also doing contracts to raise cash. I maxed out the level-2 science building very quickly, then it became a grind to attain the cash to build it up to level-3. I used policies to convert as much science as possible to cash, but when I finally could afford to upgrade the building, I had attained enough science to easily unlock all remaining nodes, with thousands of science left over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think a single Kerbal has reached level 3 - none of them have done more than 2 - 3 missions.

Broken balance-wise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods, as you mention can help, either they add more parts, or redistribute what is available.

Most of it (except for antimatter and FTL-Drives) aren\u0027t even that far away, many are just in very early stages of development. Either that or development was stopped due to cost to efficieny factor. Things like fusion aren\u0027t that far off, and things like microwave beamed power are possible, but since we don\u0027t have fusion we don\u0027t have enough energy to make it useful etc. I really like the mod because it doesen\u0027t feel OP since it is a helluva lot of work to set up say a reliable beamed power network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I can strongly reccomend the [thread=79588]MKS/OKS[/thread] by Roverdude (also check out his other mods, they\u0027re awesome), especially combined with kethane or karbonite they add a whole new level of complexity to the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy self set goal is to havea fully self sufficient spaceprogram with in situ refuelling and mining operations, self-sustaining life support systems for all stations and bases, bases and orbital stations around every body, a fleet of FTL-capable shuttles and rescue ships and a gigantic self-sustaining FTL-Cruiser with landers, skycranes and rescue ships for all bodies in the kerbin system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso concerning your RAM problems I can strongly reccomend [thread=59005]Active Texture Managment[/thread].
