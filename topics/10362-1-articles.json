I have the latest version of both the game and Mechjeb. I tried putting the MumechLib.dll into my plugins and the parts into my parts folder. After that failed I just put the entire Mechjeb folder into the plugins folder. That didnt work either. I have the parts ingame and I can use them, but when I go to the launchpad there is no Mechjeb window. Suggestions?\n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-09T09:33:33Z","Content":"Are you using the full, paid version (0.14.x) or the free demo (0.13.x)?
