I had an idea of doing a collab on solar system exploration, in which every person would work together in a new stock\u00A0sandbox (or maybe career) save to send missions to every planet and moon in the kerbol system. I\u0027m sure if that would be a good idea for a collab though, so that\u0027s why I am asking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnster_Space_Program","CreatedById":187334,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-08T12:47:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf someone has a better idea for a collab, I would like to know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikey117","CreatedById":169509,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-08T15:39:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell seeing as you guys on pc\u00A0have\u00A0 robotic parts now, how about a transformer.
