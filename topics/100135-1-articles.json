Ive never once looked at the Dv my planes have when I build them. I design my aircraft for whatever purposes I need then I fuel it in way that\u0027s favorable for its flight performance. Then its whatever Dv I have in the end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as fuel efficiency goes the best thing you can do is cruise at the highest altitude with minimal throttle. As far as telling wether or not your craft will make it too and from your destination is just a guess really. It\u0027s so easy however to build a plane with enough fuel that can circumnavigate Kerbin that I just don\u0027t worry about it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one time I built a plane that needed extra range I used drop tanks.

It depends on a number of factors, especially altitude. It may take some trial and error. As for what altitude, that is entirely up to you. Kerbin is a big planet though, and I prefer not to be flying in a straight line for quite literally hours (can\u0027t imagine using RSS to do that) so I fly a high as I can. If you are using FAR, you can climb high and glide for quite a distance too, I\u0027m not sure how well gliding works in stock, it takes a little longer but not as long as a low altitude flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T21:58:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s not that easy to predict dV for planes.

Mainly because Ferram incorporated AJE into FAR which got rid of the over powered turbo jet. Stock Kerbin could easily be circumnavigated in a few hours without timewarp. With warp it can be done in around a half hour I wager. You can cruise at a 1kms in the upper atmosphere with that OP engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR takes much more power to achieve the same speeds now due to the nerfed engine, but I still think it can be done in a decent time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Alshain said OP it\u0027s trial and error.

I use stock aerodynamics. I can tell you this - you want to be using Turbojets (you can travel faster the higher up in the atmosphere you go, and the Turbojet is definitely a high-altitude engine), and you won\u0027t need much more than a single Mk2 Liquid Fuel tank for the round trip. Maybe the extra few units you\u0027d get from a pair of Nacelles, and that\u0027s only if you don\u0027t feel like draining out the things.

Sub-orbital hops can cover enourmous distances for very little fuel. The higher your surface velocity, the better (orbital velocity is obviously the extreme here at 0 fuel per km covered).
