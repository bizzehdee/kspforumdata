It was my favorite STO. I designed it to be able to haul up to 36 tons of cargo, and haul it back down, and be able to fly without any cargo, and come back down, after jettisoning 2 delta canards up front. It could also take off and get into orbit with no cargo, and still have the 2 delta canards on, which was necessary to be able to pick up to 36t from orbit and bring it back down without bringing anything back up. It just wont work anymore. Ive finally got it to do everything i want it to again, except I just cant seem to land with no cargo inside, even after jettisoning the 2 forward delta wings.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EOriginal craft (that worked!
