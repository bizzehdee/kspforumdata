FAR just shows you if you\u0027ve got a large angle of attack (the angle between the direction your rocket is facing and the prograde direction - that is, the direction your engines are pushing you... note that they are different directions!)... and FAR also changes the game\u0027s normal aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you want to do is keep your angle of attack low (the FAR toolbar shows AoA), i.e. less than 10 degrees, while in any atmosphere. Otherwise, the force of the air being pushed into the top of the rocket (as it rises through the atmosphere) pushes the top of the rocket sideways and rips the top of it (in your case, the fairings section) clear off the rocket boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo further explain AoA... suppose you launch straight up. Your prograde direction is then straight up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you tilt over to 45deg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment you tilt over, your AoA is the difference between prograde (at 90deg, straight up) and the direction the rocket is facing (45deg), i.e. 90-45 = 45deg. This is an extreme AoA. You want to keep it generally under 10deg, although differently-shaped rockets with different parts can handle different AoAs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, after doing the tilt to 45deg, the prograde direction slowly moves down toward the 45deg angle the rocket is pointing to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with FAR installed, it\u0027s best to make small tilts early in launch, then gradually tilt over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I typically do is (you can fine-tune these values for each rocket):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0-800m ASL: straight up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E800m-3km: 88deg pitch. (Using MechJeb\u0027s SmartASS module can help for precise steering).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3-6km: 86deg pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6-10km: 83deg pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(note that with the above turns, maximum AoA will only ever be 3deg - between 6-10km ASL when I change from 86 to 83 deg pitch).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, you\u0027ve cleared the thickest part of the atmosphere, so AoA isn\u0027t as delicate and you can start doing steeper tilts. It is, though, still important, so be careful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10-15km: 80deg pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15-25km: 70deg pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E25-30km: 60 deg pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E30-35km: 50 deg pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(now through most of the atmosphere, pitch change can be made even steeper)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E35-40km: 40 deg pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E40-45km: 10 deg pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E45-50km: 0 deg pitch (assuming, of course, you have enough thrust to get your apoapse up to the correct altitude. If not, then pitch upwards instead).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50km-80km: before this phase, I usually burn so my apoapse is 10-15km higher than my desired orbital height. During the 50-80km phase, I would typically burn while pitched varying between -25deg and \u002B2deg.
