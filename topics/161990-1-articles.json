If you aren\u0027t including \u00A0an actual plugin (.dll file) then you don\u0027t really need a source as your cfg is the source. Now, if you include a .dll from another mod or you make one yourself, you have to include a source. This to to ensure you aren\u0027t including a plugin that could harm someone\u0027s computer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mrcarrot","CreatedById":176291,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-12T16:54:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
