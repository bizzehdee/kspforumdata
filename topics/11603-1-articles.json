But, when the engine gets hot (higher throttle), the water splashes around as if it\\\u0027s steaming.\n\nBrakes won\\\u0027t work (obviously). It\\\u0027s VERY hard to move with an engine than if it was on land. Only tested with jet engines.\n\nEDIT: when at almost full throttle, it does sound like the engine is choking on water, I guess it is since we\\\u0027re moving so slowly... Also, the engine doesn\\\u0027t overheat as bad.\n\nVery cool!\n\nScreenshots are in attachments.\n\nScreenshot7 is the one where the water splashes when the engine is warm."},{"CreatedByName":"Foamy","CreatedById":608,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T01:17:20Z","Content":"That\\\u0027s a common issue for ships but they have been overcome, i think surface wise aircraft carriers have been made, as for subs i know some underwater exploration have been undertaken but it is extremely difficult without cheat parts."},{"CreatedByName":"Maikie_G","CreatedById":13120,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T11:45:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\\\u0027s a common issue for ships but they have been overcome, i think surface wise aircraft carriers have been made, as for subs i know some underwater exploration have been undertaken but it is extremely difficult without cheat parts.\n\nThere was a nuclear submarine mod that would let you move around at decent speed on and under water, but it was so overpowered that I managed to land that submarine on the Mun once."},{"CreatedByName":"GeekyMe97","CreatedById":24678,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T14:20:21Z","Content":"I did this before there were spaceplanes ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Steve5451","CreatedById":18812,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T20:25:23Z","Content":"Is the water denser than it used to be?\n\nA long time ago before the terrain change I was able to make a very simple boat and it went across the water fairly fast.
