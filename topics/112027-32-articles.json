Looking into it, it appears that I\u0027d have to have my patch run AFTER the SystemHeat patch that makes all these nice radiators play nice with the FFT engines, and I\u0027m aware of how to do that.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E However, what I\u0027m not aware of how to do is how to edit the values of the fixed microchannel radiator variants that are available thru B9 part switching. It seems to me that I\u0027d have to delete and re-write the entire B9 part switch section of the config file, which seems like a chore when I\u0027m only interested in changing the numbers on maybe 5 lines of the patch.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I thought I had a good handle on how to make \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E patches, but apparently my knowledge (or the features of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E itself) fall short on this kind of thing where the value you actually want to edit is deeply buried inside a sub-node of an actual PartModule.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Any thoughts? I want to basically be able to say \u0022Okay, in the B9PartSwitch part module, for all these \u0022subtype\u0022 nodes, I want to take the temperatureCurve inside that subtype and edit the 2nd value of the 2nd key to be 4x as much as it is right now\u0022 but I don\u0027t want to have to re-write the whole dang thing to do that, if that\u0027s possible.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m going off of the ModuleManager guidelines and nothing in them says anything about editing things that are several sub-nodes deep inside the part module itself.\n\u003E \n\nThis is generally correct below - if you need more go to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E thread.
