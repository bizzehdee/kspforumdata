It would be much better if either the one connection could take the whole load, or if we could have several connections, either through claws or by stringing a few lines between ship and asteroid. The latter would be a lot more credible than a single super-rigid claw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while I\u0027m at it: that pivot is priceless, but setting it \u0022just right\u0022 is practically impossible.

Given the amount of thrust I can transmit through the claw, I\u0027m looking forward to several hours of babysitting the burn.
