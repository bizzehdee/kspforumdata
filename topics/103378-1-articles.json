With mods like KAS, TACLS etc. I figured that I will need some \u0022shuttles\u0022 of supplies (Food and Water) from time to time but that is fine. Yesterday I started thinking of actually making one of my support crafts (I have 1x 5m and 2x mk3 cargo bays) to be one that will go and mine an asteroid and replenish my fuel reserves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may as well use my \u0022Shuttle system\u0022 to haul fuel as well as food when my reserves are getting low, but I would like to mine asteroids. I have a huge base (5m bay) that I can drop to surface and back on most bodies with no atmosphere). I have small exploration craft and I have a space plane for the atmosphere exploration and 1 empty bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I did see Scott Manley recovering 1 of his miners, then ran out of fuel, but managed to process some fuel and save it from falling. What mode was that ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not want something that will add large amount of different resources to work with.

And yes, it does what it sounds like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a miner\u002Brefuel barge around this mod. 7 orange tanks (1 center, and 6-way symetry), ....loads of landing grear, and a monoprop tank on top of the outside orange tanks. Under the center tank i had the converter and drill and all that, and the others had LV-Ns underneath. On the sides I had solar panels and 6 of those stock radially attached engines to help takeoff from minimus. It was damn impressive to see this monster take off and head for refuel-missions. This project was what prompted me to install TAC Fuel Balancer, to allow me to ensure even weight distribution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I believe I remember hearing from the devs that the 1.0 resource system would \u0022Not be unlike Karbonite\u0022, so you might want to go for that for the purpose of familiarization.
