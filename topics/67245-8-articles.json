It might be easier in the short term, but all these features still need to be added at some point. If, say, GP2 was added before biomes, then that doesn\u0027t actually remove the need to add biomes - Squad would still have had to do it when biomes were added to all planets anyway. Whether that\u0027s better or not is debatable, but personally, I\u0027d much rather Squad made the current planets more interesting (like the Mun!) rather than just adding more for the sake of it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe total work done is the same, true. However, if GP2 was added in, say, 0.21, then it would already be there, and biomes and all that would have been added to it in 0.90. Sadly, it wasn\u0027t added, and that means that it will take longer to get the planet finished because there\u0027s a higher quality that all the others have. So, GP2 needs to be the same quality. And it takes longer because the quality of the other planets should always be rising. Thus, the longer they wait, the harder it\u0027ll be. It\u0027ll be more work in a shorter amount of time, compared to the same amount of work in a much larger amount of time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T03:37:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022spinomonkey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022spinomonkey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUNRELATED: Why does the ocean cover all of Kerbin?
