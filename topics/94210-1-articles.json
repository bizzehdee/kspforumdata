Well... blowing up. However I noticed no matter how hard the mk3 cockpit hit, it would not be destroyed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to do a little test. Attached a MK3 cockpit to a 3.75M engine, (the cluster of 4 forget the name) turned on infinite fuel and shot it up to an orbit that matched the moon. Once at AP pointed back at Kerbin and entered the atmosphere at 75km/s. Also mind you, it landed in the water. Anyone else think the MK3 cockpit needs nerfed?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
