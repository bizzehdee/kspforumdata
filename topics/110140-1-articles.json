From what I see now is that you want them to deploy up. You just have to invert the controls on them I believe and they pitch up when deployed. I haven\u0027t looked into this much, so I can\u0027t be sure right now. I\u0027m at school and I\u0027ll check when I get home. Never mind, I just saw you got what you wanted.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T18:18:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by legoclone09**\n  \nRealizing you got your answer already"}]}
