Drills are supposed to stop once the ore bunker is full, however, as long as the converter is running, the bunker will never be quite full... and any excess ore your drill retrieves will be wasted.\n\nIt happens like this:\n\na) converter takes 0.5 units ore\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) drill sees free space\n\nc) drill produces 8.5 units of ore\n\nd) only 0.5u will fit in the tank -- the other 8 units just disappear\n\ne) thus, ~84% of the asteroids\u0027 ore will be wasted\n\nThe above figures are correct if you have a three-star engineer on your vessel and create LF\u002BO.\n\nThings you can do:\n\n- don\u0027t bring any engineers (then one drill produces about as much as one converter can take)\n- micromanage your drill, stop it when the ore bunker becomes full\n- bring enough refineries to process the ore as quickly as it comes in\n\nOf course, this only affects asteroids. When mining on planets and moons, the deposit can\u0027t be depleted so it doesn\u0027t matter if you waste any ore.\n\nEdit: typos\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T21:25:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 09:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T21:04:48Z","Content":"I did not know this.
