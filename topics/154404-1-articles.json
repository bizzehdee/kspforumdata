Sweet!\u0022.\u00A0 I figured I\u0027d make consumption and waste production 3x the default value and go from there.\u00A0 Well, first it was impossible on most of the sliders to set exactly 3x the value.\u00A0 Also, when I decided to roll back to the defaults, I couldn\u0027t even get the default values back! (Yay floating point maths?)\u00A0 The sliders won\u0027t let me alter things with exact precision, so eventually I just hacked my save file to roll back to defaults.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not just mods - I find myself yearning for input boxes with stock tweakables too - like the thrust limiter.\u00A0 I\u0027ll want a specific value, and have to move my mouse ever so slowly to get exactly the right spot.\u00A0 Back in the days when tweakables were first introduced, I remember fuel amounts being really annoying this way as well.\u00A0 This was fixed by locking fuel amounts to specific step values, but even now I wish I could just type in the value I want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre text/input boxes hard to implement in Unity\u0027s UI?\u00A0 I know MechJeb has some, but I also know its UI is a bit different than most mods.\u00A0 I rarely see them in any other mod.\u00A0 Is it a matter of screen real estate?\u00A0 Is it just convention?\u00A0 My first thought was console-ization, and while this might explain the stock game a bit, consoles can\u0027t run mods afaik.\u00A0 Is there something I\u0027m missing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-03T08:28:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUIs are the worst part of programming, at least in my opinion. The less time I spend on a UI, the better. A slider is (relatively) easy and safe. You don\u0027t have to check to make sure the input is valid, lock the input so it doesn\u0027t bleed through into the game (Oh you hit space? That\u0027s a staging) handle boundary conditions, or anything like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-03T11:23:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222908792\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154404\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483432125\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, 5thHorseman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t have to (...) lock the input so it doesn\u0027t bleed through into the game\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E can be a pain when you\u0027re EVAing, with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on, and dragging a part from your inventory to where you want to place it makes your Kerbal rotate around.
