By that I mean Kerbals are assumed to require about 0.42kg of O2 per 86400 second. The extension of this assumption is that the same mass of plant matter respires in the same way. TACLS makes the same assumption. I have not looked at asmis\u0027 work at all, but if he is basing respiration on real-world data, it might Just Work\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDensity of the materials shouldn\u0027t impact their consumption rates if I understand how various generators work. What it will influence is the mass of parts. For testing, I have decided that user-friendliness in the in-game UI is important, so when the UI says there are 21 Biomass, that means there are 21kg of Biomass.

My fear is that, no matter what Roboto and I do, BioMass will always be incompatible with with other biology related mods. This is especially true since I am trying to stay true to the biology, so input masses should equal output masses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is where it gets complicated and a bit tl;dr. The KSP community has worked out that Squad\u0027s parts use liters as what the \u0022unit\u0022 is. Density is in tonnes/liter. This can be confirmed by looking at the solid rocket booster. The part is defined as having a mass of 0.5 (tonne). It hold 433 (liters) of solid fuel, and the density of solidFuel is 0.0075. 433Liters*0.0075tonnes/Liter=3.2475tonnes for solid fuel\u002B0.5 tonnes for the part=\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/RT-10_Solid_Fuel_Booster\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E3.7475 tonnes\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerators usually consume and produce resources in units (so in Squad parts, liters). So if you are designing something that is mass balanced, you need to set up the generator in such a way that you adjust the numbers in the generator so it uses the correct amount of mass...which is totally determined by how the resource\u0027s density is defined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if different mods define oxygen\u0027s density differently, any mod that does mass-related reactions will end up having different (probably unbalanced) outputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo illustrate, if one looks at oxygen as defined in ioncross, TACLS and amsi\u0027s lifesupport mod, is is defined as having a density of \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E0.0004\u003C/span\u003E 0.00002083(ioncross), 0.0004290144(TACLS), 0.00000143(amsi). If a converter says to consume 6 units of oxygen, that would translate as \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E2.4\u003C/span\u003E 0.12498, 2.574 and 0.00858 kg of oxygen being consumed, respectively. And this doesn\u0027t even address that I think that _none_ of those densities are Squad-appropriate densities. Me thinks amsi\u0027s is closest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no good way to solve this since some mod makers insist on realism and use real-world density values, some try and make densities match what Squad has defined for resources, others opt for easier in-game displays, and other use a number that seems good enough.

There was an interesting thread that seemed to, initially, want this. I don\u0027t agree with all of what the thread OP ended up proposing, but the thread made me better realize that modders fall into two basic categories: \u0022realists\u0022 that want to use only real world densities and \u0022kerbalists\u0022 that take Squad\u0027s resource list as canon and try to make everything fit. Kethane, for example would be an example of a \u0022kerbalists\u0022 mod.

I\u0027d absolutely love to see some nice guidelines among \u0022kerbalist\u0022 modders, especially the biology-related mods.

Plus the parts default 0.5tonnes=3.7475tonnes(the weight of the entire part).
