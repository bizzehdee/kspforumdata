That\u0027s fine with me. Yet interstellar travel needs to be added in order to visit, land on, and return back home with the crew when such distant objects are implemented. Meaning that Squad should implement the Interstellar mod, Interplanetary Launchpads mod, B9 aerospace mod, and the KW rocketry mod in order to visit and return from distant objects. Warp drive will be needed! I have also realized that the lighting in KSP is quite poor because no matter how close or how far you are away from the sun the amount of lighting stays the same. If the lighting were to be better then the closer you get to the sun the brighter and the farther the dimmer meaning the surface of Moho will be light in color looking due to all of the light and the surface of Eeloo will look as if it is night time even when Eeloo is facing the sun. Eventually you will receive almost no light from the sun and the sun will no longer be visible at such distances and the lighting of the interstellar stars will start showing up. And for some visual enhancements Squad could add the Environmental Visual Enhancements mod to add clouds, Better atmospheres for more realistic atmospheres, and Distant Objects mod so very distant object will appear twinkling in the sky kind of like distant objects do in real life. All of this would be great if it were added to Kerbal Space Program and it will really improve game play, relation to real life and will increase in popularity due to better graphics, greater customization of ships with the mods permanently implemented into KSP, and more wonders to explore.
