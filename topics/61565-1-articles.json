There are a few tricks you need to know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) lock suspension on landing legs, ALWAYS. The landing leg suspension causes massive problems with modules of different weights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) don\u0027t be afraid to lower the legs on the module being carried. If you are using a small crawler, you can lower the legs on the module you are carrying with G and get it to stand up on it\u0027s own feet. Now, this only works if suspension is locked. In the case of things of different heights, lower a few legs on the base to get the target port to sag some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast solution I can give is you may want to try moving the large fuel tanks empty, if possible. With tweakables and CoM reacting to that, a little shift in the design of the fuel tanker rover can enable it to be launched empty, rather than full.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T01:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t you know it!
