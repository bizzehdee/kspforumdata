Therefore, to be a good contender, the LJ-80s should display stellar performance in all other aspects to be worth overlooking its low speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nTCA has added an additional step in its testing process, consisting of a very quick pre-rollout statistical analysis. Initial statistical analysis showed a center of lift far behind the center of mass, so we expected poor pitch authority in its flight characteristics. This was already not a good sign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nIn addition, aircraft designations were fairly confusing, with the initial briefing naming the aircraft under a long-form name, then a short-form name. Then once we received the prototypes, they were then referred to under a third different short-form designation, and we had to refer between documentation of parts to figure out which was which, which fortunately was fairly quick. We will be referring to the aircraft by the short-form designation (LJ-81) from here on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nLJ-81, the base version of the aircraft, was very basic, but still included flaps on the wings. These, however, were not wired to any specific control in the cockpit, and were only actuated by the brakes. As well, the tail controls were mixed to receive all inputs. We suspect that this was intentional, as the ailerons on the main wings were not set to respond to pitch or yaw. Further inspection discovered that the engine thrust reversers were also not wired to any control. All of these flight control issues were rectified before flight by TCA engineers. However, we missed the fact that the main gear was allowed to steer, in addition to their inward cant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThe LJ-81-ER was similar, but included more flaps, as well as spoilers for increased deceleration ability. Additional range was supposedly achieved through the addition of a belly tank holding 1000kal of fuel. Also, an additional exit door was added at the rear of the aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nIn both aircraft, the rear fuel tank was left unused and empty of fuel. As for passenger comfort, given the similarities to TCA airliner designs, comfort has been rated as good, with cabins shielded from decent portions of noise and vibrations due to the engine mounting design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nPart counts of 40 and 49 put them around average for maintenance, with most of the cost going to flight control surfaces. Two engines are about average maintenance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELJ-81 Flight Testing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nFlight testing began with the base-model LJ-81. Wheels up was achieved at ~64m/s, with tailstrikes impossible by nature of the aicraft\u0027s flight characterstics. Takeoff length was decent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nFlight up to cruise altitude was uneventful. The aircraft flew stable with or without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Roll control was noted to be good. More importantly, pitch authority was poor, as was initially hypothesized. Cruise altitude was attained fairly quickly, around 3 minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThe poor aerodynamic setup manifested greatly in the cruise testing, requiring 30-40% of pitch-up trim setting, similar to the M38 tested by TCA previously. And much like the M38, we\u0027re not sure where the extra 1000km\u002B advertised range came from, with only a 2000km range as tested under the KEA range calculation equation, unless, of course, the advertised range was based off of a completely fueled aircraft using the tail tank. The highly efficient Lotus engines were only able to push the aircraft to a maintainable cruise speed of 219.8m/s; not even 220m/s unless in a shallow dive. The aircraft was otherwise stable and fairly easy to trim.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nEngine failure testing came next. The LJ-81 performed well with a single engine failure, remaining very stable and easy to control, even without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E turned on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nFull loss of power, however, did not fare well. The plane was unable to maintain level pitch for glide speed due to a severe natural pitch-down tendency. Pitch was maxed out and bled speed extremely quickly in doing so. A level attitude was unable to be maintained under 80m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nUnder maneuverability tests, it was formally declared that the pitch authority was adequate at best for normal operations \u003Cem\u003Eat speed\u003C/em\u003E, and sluggish for all other cases. The LJ-81 was extremely sluggish at mid-speeds, with its pitch-down tendencies showing more. At low speed, it loses a lot of altitude on turns and was very hard to maneuver due to exacerbated poor pitch control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nLanding was difficult due to this fact, and its wing-mounted landing gear meant that a safe landing could only be performed at higher speeds, where vertical velocity could be kept at a minimum. This was discovered after attempting to land under 80m/s, which caused too much stress on the wings trying to absorb the vertical velocity upon contact with the runway, and the prototype proceeded to break up further after this damage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nWater landing tests showed that the cockpit separates from the fuselage. The body remains intact, but the engines are lost. This is the best case scenario after maintaining maximum pitch-up input and attempting to impact the water at the lowest feasible horizontal velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELJ-81-ER Flight Testing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nMore weight, very slightly more lift, no extra power with already no extra power to spare from the LJ-81.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nIt tended to steer randomly during the takeoff run. Attributed to inward cant of main gear combined with unlocked steering. Wheels-up was achieved at ~80m/s, on the edge of allowed takeoff speed. Takeoff length was acceptably moderate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nCruise altitude was reached under 3 minutes, partially due to its relatively low cruising altitude of 5,000m. No significant differences from base LJ-81.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nAgain, pitch control was lacking. Trim for maintaining cruise conditions required 55-65% of available pitch authority. Cruising speed was measured at an abysmally low speed of 202m/s, and the engine efficiency suffered immensely. Range, based on \u003Cem\u003Eoptimistic\u003C/em\u003E (read: not TCA conservative) standards of maximum as-loaded fuel load was, from the LJ-81 base, improved by a mere 20km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nEngine failure characteristics were the same as the base LJ-81, except that full power loss is even worse due to potentially increased forward mass depending on fuel load, which intensifies the poor pitch ability of the LJ-81-ER. Level pitch can only be achieved with great difficulty at moderate velocity. Unpowered glide capability should be considered as \u0027minimal\u0027 to \u0027none\u0027. Essentially, the aircraft must always be under power; otherwise, the aircraft is rendered unable to maintain positive or zero pitch at speeds under 130m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nLanding performance was also worse, both for standard ground landing and emergency water landing. Due to poor low-speed directional control, lining up to a runway had to be done a fair distance away. More flaps might have helped, but they weren\u0027t wired to a separate control. Spoilers and engine thrust reversers, as of this aircraft\u0027s state, were unneeded, as it \u003Cem\u003Eneeded\u003C/em\u003E velocity, not bleed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nA fire emergency in Twin Crown Aerospace\u0027s prototype storage hangars prohibited us from testing the cargo variant, which was lost with all remaining LJ-81 aircraft prototypes, in addition to various TCA property. Source discovered to be poor welding practices around an A-50X prototype, which started a fire that spread to the nearby Military Applications Division hangars storing various explosive munitions. Recovery efforts around the facility and reconditioning will slow progress in processing further outsourced aircraft testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Verdict:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nLorings Aerospace\u0027s LJ-81 family is designed almost how Twin Crown Aerospace would have designed a medium regional jet with conventional cabins, with a design that appears very conventional and unassuming. However, the devil is in the details, and the LJ-81s proved to be poor performers in vital flight characteristic categories, mostly stemming from poor pitch characteristics. The rear tanks were left unused, and the aircraft may have performed better were they filled and set to lowest drain priority to bring \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E back closer. Or simply adjusted angle of horizontal stablizer to push \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E up. Likely both would have been required, short of a full airframe reconsideration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nBeyond these flaws found in testing, the aircraft as designed have low airspeeds, and they both come in with fairly steep entry prices. It would be difficult for an aircraft to outshine not meeting minimum design requirements in the first place even with a decent design, and this aircraft firmly does not have what it takes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nNo orders by KEA firmly recommended.

Also there is the issue of having a supersonic plane with 168 passenger capacity\u00A0cruising at 14km, is classified as a jumbo, and expected to have 4000km range, while the same plane cruising at 16km, breaks the rules for supersonic, and thus it is classified as a supersonic, and only expected to have 1500km range.... I do think it is a little late doing drastic changes to the rules of this challenge now, being many months in to it. If we can make up a better, more consistent, balanced\u00A0and objective set of rules for the challenge though, It might be time to close this one down, and do a reboot, with fresh sheets and new rules.

I think these parameters should just be a Go/Nogo kind of score, if it is within acceptable parameters it is good, if not the aircraft is deemed not fit for service.\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther hard metrics that I collect for my reviews are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTakeoff and landing speed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTakeoff and landing distance (the biggest one would be the limiting factor as to how big an airport it needs)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParts per seat might also be interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Behavior with engine failure, scoring could be something like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnot possible to land without engines: not fit for service\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\npossible to make emergency landing (no fatalities): fit for service\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\npossible to continue flight to nearest airport: fit for transoceanic flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso up for consideration would be engine failure during takeoff/landing, is it fatal or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: For silver score, I am thinking above average is a nice limit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking in ratings 1through 5 for each item, so if yaw control is too little, the plane tends to sideslip and if it\u0027s too much it\u0027s posible to get into a flat spin easily, that would be a 1 or a 2.

And then you have planes like the slinky 152, which is all greens, but otherwise entirely terrible for most practical purposes. There will have to be some clever math involved or some subjective judgement, or maybe some simple rules. Like no reds, or otherwise unfit for service, and otherwise, at least half of scores above some arbitrary average limit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the 1-5 type scoring idea. There needs to be some guidelines for the limits still, like how many G\u0027s does it take to squish a kerbal? I am suggesting 10Gs as the upper limit, and 5G at cruise speed to be the minimum for a 3-4 ish score. Now the upper limit only needs to be easy to not exceed, if the plane can exceed it if you do so intentionally I don\u0027t think that is to bad, unless you want a 5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realized we have not touched on passenger comfort yet.

Also there is the issue of having a supersonic plane with 168 passenger capacity\u00A0cruising at 14km, is classified as a jumbo, and expected to have 4000km range, while the same plane cruising at 16km, breaks the rules for supersonic, and thus it is classified as a supersonic, and only expected to have 1500km range.... I do think it is a little late doing drastic changes to the rules of this challenge now, being many months in to it. If we can make up a better, more consistent, balanced\u00A0and objective set of rules for the challenge though, It might be time to close this one down, and do a reboot, with fresh sheets and new rules.

The Mk2 is wider, so more \u0027bussiness-class\u0027. For the Size 2 and Mk3 cabins, I guess it gets the same treatment, but I think the Size 2 should get a slightly higher than base value due to its fairly high price. Maybe even give it the same value as a Mk2 cabin, depending how the price scales.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen we can come up with modifiers for engine placement-related comfort, which will still have a factor of subjectiveness, but I think all the judges have a generally similar idea of how we rate this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor maintenance, engine count obviously. We may need a modifier based on TweakScale re-sized parts (resized\u00A0engines only?).
