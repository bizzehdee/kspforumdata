Another failed and immensely frustrating effort.\u003Cp\u003EHow do you keep the target marker lined up with the prograde (or retrograde) marker. I can\u0027t keep everything coordinated. Every time I thrust, forward or back, the target and prograde/retrograde markers drift, and by the time I\u0027ve recovered with the RCS, the relative velocity has changed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you using ASAS? During docking, once you have zeroed out your relative velocity, you really shouldn\u0027t be changing your position. Align one ship in one direction (normal/antinormal or north-south is usually suggested) and align the second ship in the opposite position. Then activate ASAS on both ships, and don\u0027t touch your WASD keys any more (except if you need to correct your attitude: disable ASAS, rotate, and re-enable ASAS). From there, just place your camera behind your ship and ONLY use IJKLHN keys to translate, not rotate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also mystifying to me - I\u0027m watching the relative velocity and I get it moving, and I\u0027m pointing at the target, and it goes down from, say, 2 m/s down to 1 m/s, and the distance to the target is decreasing correspondingly. And then suddenly the distance starts increasing again. I feel like I need either Super Idiot mode, or at least a slowdown mode for when I get extremely close and I can\u0027t react quickly enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will drift around a bit, but you just have to bring it back to from time to time. Aim for zero, not 1 or 2 m/s, then thrust gently towards the ship (the pink marker), and watch your distance. When your prograde marker starts moving too far away from your pink marker, stop to 0 m/s again. Once you are within less than 1km, forget about the navball and just translate like I explained above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Colonel_Panic","CreatedById":61997,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T22:06:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efew more tips: RCS will always cause velocity change when using it for rotation. turn it off before making major rotation adjustments or using SAS, unless you have a very heavy ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Euse precision controls for docking.
