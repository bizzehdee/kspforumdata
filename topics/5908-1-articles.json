Its landing gear is capable of bringing the vessel to land only when the descent speed is less that 5 m/s, though with careful use of RCS, manual controls and engine thrust, this shouldn\\\u0027t be too difficult. Its military uses as a medium range cruiser or bomber make it a useful asset for militaries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OL6H7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OL6H7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
