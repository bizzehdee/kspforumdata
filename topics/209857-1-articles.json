I myself joined only a couple of days ago and while I have been playing kerbal space program for quite some time, there are a lot of things. I also don\u0027t know. For example, when I\u0027m going into orbit and lining up encounters with stations and other ships, I pretty much just do it by guess I don\u0027t really use that whole XYZ coordinates tool that allows you to adjust how your maneuvers will look before you perform them but I\u0027ve done that so often that I\u0027m usually pretty good at pulling it off the first time without having to restart from a last save point, enjoy the forms and fly safe! =) also, thank you for being my final fifth post. Once this is approved I will be able to edit my account.
