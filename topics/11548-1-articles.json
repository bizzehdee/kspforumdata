Rotates very slowly, once per 34 hours. Diameter 1100 km. Gravity is 80% of that of Kerbin, Atmosphere 45%. It is a desert planet. Temperatures roughly range between 0\u00C2\u00B0C during nights and 110\u00C2\u00B0C during daylight. Huge dust-storms occur due to large temperature gradient. \n\n*Drock* - Moon of Sehera, orbits the planet with distances between 5000 and 25000 km. Diameter 70 km and tidally locked to Sehera. Gravity 5% of that of Kerbin, no atmosphere.\n\n**2: Kerbin** - Orbits Kerbol at around 13,5 million km. Fast rotation, once every 6 hours. Diameter 1200 km. Oceans cover large parts of the planet. Temperatures range between -10\u00C2\u00B0C at the snow- and ice capped poles during nights and 20\u00C2\u00B0C around the equator during daylight. In general, temperature variation is limited due to fast rotation.\n\n*Mun* - Moon of Kerbin, orbits Kerbin at around 11400 km. The Mun is a large moon with a diameter of 400 km, it is tidally locked to Kerbin. Gravity is roughly 25% of that of Kerbin, no atmosphere.\n\n*Minmus* - Moon of Kerbin, in orbit at around 46400 km. Diameter around 120 km. Some areas are 100% flat, however, mountains dominate Minmus. Gravity is 8% of that of Kerbin, no atmosphere.\n\n**3: Gorda** - Orbits Kerbol with distances between 15,5 and 19 million km. Rotates once every 17 hours, diameter 600 km. Gravity is 50% of that of Kerbin, atmosphere 15%. The northpole seems to be snowcapped. Temperature range roughly between -40\u00C2\u00B0C and 0\u00C2\u00B0C."},{"CreatedByName":"Munstation","CreatedById":23192,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T15:08:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **1: Sehera** - Orbits Kerbol (Sun) at 9,5 - 10 million km distance.
