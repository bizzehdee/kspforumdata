I\u0027m not going to deny that those two packs are both wonderful and quite detailed, but really the only thing I can build from either that I regularly used that I can\u0027t from SSTU is an Atlas-style rocket (1.5 stage to orbit) and honestly, I\u0027m not really sure I can\u0027t. I\u0027ve been really experimenting in sandbox and have managed to build a passable N1, a quite reasonable Soyuz, and a pretty much dead-on Apollo. Really, the only glaring thing Bluedog has on you is the Gemini stuff (2-manned capsules and accessories) and small landers.\n\nThis pack is uncanny in what you can do with it. There\u0027s even a fair chance it\u0027ll supplant Station Parts Expansion. What would be the icing on the cake would be if you could use the station parts alongside Roverdude\u0027s OKS mod. I haven\u0027t played much with that so far, but as far as I can tell these parts have stock functionality only ATM.\n\nEDIT: They DO increase the base habitability, so there\u0027s that. They need to be combined with OKS parts and, unfortunately, OKS parts generally work better. Still, since OKS/MKS are really intended for permanent stations, the SSTU parts do have a niche.\n\nI love the station parts and REALLY love the DOS-style station cores and parts. Being able to build seven space stations that actually look different is uncanny. I love the different solar panel designs. This pack is awesome and I really wish I had discovered it long ago.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-21T02:03:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2019 02:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by captainradish**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gremillion","CreatedById":190021,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-21T09:15:34Z","Content":"I\u0027m running 0.11.49.161 with 1.6.1 and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E \u002B RealFuels to fix the negative tank mass issue, but it doesn\u0027t seem to have worked.

Notably:\n\n- Performance dependent upon part count -- part count should not be a limiting factor for any sort of reasonable design (10k parts or so; at which point you likely hit poly/rendering limits)\n- Floppy Unity RigidBody Joints -- should not be something players are subject to.\n- Wheel Colliders being terrible -- absolutely will not get involved in that terrible mess.  No working wheel-collider = no purchase.  (By working, I mean does not have arbitrary limits on rigidbody orientation, # of wheels, and doesn\u0027t do any silly \u0027dynamic\u0027 adjustment garbage; e.g. functions just as the Unity-4 wheel colliders did, but with improved friction model).\n- Garbage Collection Stutter -- Why people have put up with this for so long is beyond me.  Had I known it was a thing with KSP1 I never would have bought that game either.  Drives me absolutely crazy every time it lags.\n\nIf they haven\u0027t fixed those issues, I likely won\u0027t even be buying the game.\n\nAnd if they -have- fixed those issues, there really won\u0027t be much of a need for SSTU\u0027s primary goal (lowered part-count for performance).  I may still do some modding for \u0027modular\u0027 parts, perhaps some KerbalFoundries type stuff if not in the stock parts, and likely a full implementation of part-recoloring, but probably nothing complex to the extent that I\u0027m currently maintaining.\n\nEither way, we have a long ways to go before we\u0027ll know more.  They say \u0027releasing in 2020\u0027, but that is likely *winter* of 2020 knowing how marketing drones term things."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-22T17:24:44Z","Content":"Given what we see in in game footage floppy Unity rigidBody will be a thing again.

Stretchable tanks looks better and are easier to play with. Engine stack too. All of it make it easier.
