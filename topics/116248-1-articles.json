Just one more little thing to be more like RL space ships.\n\nThe stage numbers keep changing as technology improves and ships get modified (almost every flight). But if the main things were named, they would be identified more consistently across upgrades. Especially when sharing a save with other people collaborating on a project. In fact, we *did* name the stages, but there was no way to put those names in the game."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T17:17:32Z","Content":"This would be good, and even better if decoupled stages kept the name, also I\u0027ve popped this over to Suggestions."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T17:39:08Z","Content":"If we could make vessels out of a bunch of *instanced* sub-assemblies (as opposed to merging the subassembly in like we do now), that would allow this behavior, and a whole lot of other possibilities as well.\n\nKinda like a CATIA .CATProduct or a ProE .asm."},{"CreatedByName":"Layereddiagram","CreatedById":148146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T20:39:05Z","Content":"This would be great for distinguishing the launcher from the mission.
