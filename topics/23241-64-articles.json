The fix works well, and KSP now loads with both your and remotetech\u0027s mods running.. I suspect other linux users who might have similar problems with \u0027larger\u0027 mod packs such as B9 and remotetech will also hit this bug randomly, and will therefore benefit from this fix. Hope it helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
