This has been around for at least a year. I thought you lot had somebody who looked into website issues etc on the team? How is this something only I seem to notice? Anyway to recreate it: select the community button on the toolbar and see how you cant select anything below the forum button? The video pane is obscuring the rest of the menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FEichinger","CreatedById":58255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T12:01:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re [thread=50682]definitely[/thread] not the only one to notice.
