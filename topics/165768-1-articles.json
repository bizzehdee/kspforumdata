I started in War Thunder, and was a tester for Ground Forces and World of Warships, but World of Tanks has easily become my favorite. I like cover based shooters in general, and World of Tanks is like a slower, more tactical version of that concept. World of Warships requires a bit more forethought than I usually bring to the table, and I\u0027m simply not that good at War Thunder. I don\u0027t play either game enough to tolerate the grind very well, which discourages me from playing more often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Tanks I recently picked up an IS-4 as my third tier 10 (I have a 215b and Centurion X as well).

Fortunately, I found this forum, and since then, I visited this forum a lot more frequent than Wargaming\u0027s forum.

But i haven\u0027t really played it in years. I have come back to it a couple of times and played it for a few days (nostalgia, and to get away from WT bull****), but i can never enjoy it the way i did back then. Im quessing part of that is because of the fact that when i used to play it then, i knew what was going on i had a pretty good understanding of what all the tanks in the game where like (weaknesses, strengths), so i was rather good, but now, there\u0027s so many changes that i just get confused every time i come back to it. Plus, back then my skills where evolving at pretty much the same rate as for others, but now there are a lot more players with a lot more experience and skill around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe highest i got to was tier IV (panzer III/IV, back then it would have led me to the Panzer IV witch i wanted, but not anymore). I have a bunch of other vehicles from other countries around as-well, probably my favorite being the BT-2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow for WT. My god what a load of unfair unbalanced bull**** it is,\u00A0 but i still keep playing it (over a 1000 hours on record).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dunno, i kinda want to go back to WoT all the time to escape all the above mentioned, and especially all those a**holes who bring the Sherman Jumbo into rank II battles. But, the game just plays so much better than WoT that i want to keep going, and when you get battles like the one where i killed 20 tanks all by myself, you want to try and replicate the results, but the amount of RNG and pure luck makes that impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yea, tank battles in WT are pretty frustrating and rage inducing, but i feel that after all these hours of experience, it\u0027s beginning to get more fun again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm currently enjoying rank 1.5 battles and basically researching the entirety of the rank III (US, British, German and Russian) tree before i go battle there. I feel it will allow me to skip all the \u0022that one didn\u0027t go trough\u0022 and getting one shot killed by everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as for air-battles, get me in the Spitfire MK I and i\u0027ll shoot my way to the top-spot in no time. im pretty much keeping myself locked in rank 1.5 battles, but just like with the tanks, i have reached rank III already, i just don\u0027t wanna go there yet. Air-battles in general are fun and i usually get myself near the top in most matches, even with pure bombers (my goal is to master the art of manually aiming defensive turrets. I think my record is headshotting a pilot of a P-36 from 1.4-1.5 km with my Avengers turret). Recently i had a battle where i downed 4 aircraft with a single Sunderland, before i was so damaged that basically threw myself at the enemy hoping that i could ram one of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy main countries for air-battles are, US, Britain and Germany, i also have a few Japanise planes, but i don\u0027t like them too much, as the bullets from their guns don\u0027t seem to exist in this universe half the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as for WoWs, one of my all time favorite games. Nothing to complain about, just pure fun, and pure success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently im moving on from tier VII to tier VIII (bought the KII...witch may have been a mistake. I also have the Richelieu witch is pure fun, and the NC, witch seem a bit fragile). With the KII, i also have a bunch of other premiums laying around (prob my favorites being the Atlanta and the Scharnhorst).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started playing WoWs shortly after it was released, and have been staying pretty active, so i have always been able to keep up with whats been going on witch helps a lot, as then you don\u0027t get any nasty surprises (spotting range when firing becoming the same as your firing range, and them adding a maximum speed at witch you can move inside smoke before you get spotted...stuff like that).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know why, but the thing i probably enjoy the most in the game, is good secondaries (really sucks that you can get them actually effective only at tier VII and above....well, given you have enough point\u0027s on your captain).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, i guess i have to admit that im a bit disappointed with the fact that just how difficult it can be to get anything useful done in a CV, especially as i am a HUGE RTS buff, but, with the new carrier rework coming, that may change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a funny feel that with all the navy stuff ive put up on the forums, it won\u0027t come as much of a surprise to anyone that i like WoWs so much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here\u0027s list of some of my favorites from each game/category.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorld of tanks: BT-2, LOLtractor, after that, i really dunno.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWarthunder:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTank: M-16 MGMC, Wirbelwind/Gepard (the WWII one), Pz IV F1/F2, Stuart, T-28, T-34 STZ/57.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAircraft: Bristol Blenheim, Short Sunderland, Spitfire mk I, JU-88 A6, B-34 (the attacker version).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorld of Warships: Clemson, Lyon, Scharnhorst, Atlanta, Richelieu/Dunkerque.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-22T03:00:13Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2018 03:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by kapteenipirk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbinchaser","CreatedById":160817,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-16T19:22:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust picked up the 88 cm flak in War Thunder.
