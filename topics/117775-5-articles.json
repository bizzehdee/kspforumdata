It runs on an unknown high thrust, high specific impulse engine system that allows single-stage-to-Mars flights, dual retro-thrusters in the leading edge roots behind snap-action clamshell doors, and has a trio of engines in the belly (one fore, two aft in the wings) to allow for horizontal VTOL flight on airless or nearly-airless bodies across the Solar System. Some of the variation of the stock DG include:\n\nThe DG-IV-3, made by Dansteph, which seems to use an air-augmented cycle for lower-atmosphere work, has a small cargo bay (half the size of this one), and several eye-candy features like a tracking antenna and switchable paint jobs.\n\nThe XR1, which this is based off of, from Altea Aerospace. Twin Scramjets, no cargo bay, an APU to provide hydraulic power, and fully integrated thermal management and life support. It has two sister ships, the XR2 Ravenstar and the XR5 Vanguard, with a third still in development, the XR3."},{"CreatedByName":"Redneck","CreatedById":2030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T00:51:27Z","Content":"I am working on the deltaglider now so you guys know lol ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T03:38:48Z","Content":"are sstos in ksp not dead? like, who uses them any more? if anything, dont most people instead of attaching rockets to a plane, attach jets to a rocket? like, its simpler lift off profile, simpler landing, simpler... everything. and it worked."},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T05:12:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Outside of Orbiter, there are no comparable vehicles.
