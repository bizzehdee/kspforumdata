In the outer kerbol system, minmus is fully solidified. Somehow, Jool flunged minmus into the inner kerbol system. Sending Minmus\u0027s Perihelion (Periapsis) below Kerbin\u0027s Orbit, and into a eccentric orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce it approaches Moho\u0027s Orbit, its \u0022ice\u0022 melts forming lakes that are seen around the equator. As Minmus begins to be flunged out back into the outer kerbol system again, it had coincidentally been captured by Kerbin. Kerbin, then slowed Minmus\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the help of the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, Minmus gained stable eccentricity but due to other gravitational influences, Minmus orbit was inclined.

The atmo was quickly brought down to Kerbin, but the outer atmo was travelling at orbital speeds from Kerbin\u0027s spin. Of course, a Keostationary orbit is below the Mun, but the atmo wasn\u0027t spinning as fast as Kerbin, a cause of wind on Earth. So Minmus formed, as a frozen sphere of water, or perhaps with it being Methane/kethane, the atmo used to be Methane/kethane-rich but then something happened. But anyway, there was a collision with two icy asteroids, and the cloud of snow left behind hit the outer parts of the Kerbin system, covering Minmus in these mountains, and someone else can think of why the lakes are exposed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
