Time and time again, people have attempted to replicate reported successes of Cold Fusion, but (supposedly) nobody has succeeded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne theoretical reactor design is a standard vacuum chamber with a Palladium cathode in the center and several coiled Platinum anodes surrounding it. The chamber is filled with Deuterium Oxide and Lithium salt. When the cathode and the anodes are activated and voltage is applied to the Deuterium Oxide, it splits into D\u002B and OD- ions. The OD- ions are attracted to the Platinum anodes, and eventually break down into more D\u002B ions and Oxygen. The Oxygen bubbles to the top of the chamber. As for the D\u002B ions, they are attracted to the center Palladium cathode, where they actually work there way into the interatomic lattice structure of the Palladium. Upon saturation of the lattice, there are still D\u002B ions that need inside, so some of the ions that are already inside the lattice have to make room, and they fuse (this is the \u0022fusion\u0022 part) into Helium. The Helium rises to the top, like the Oxygen. The process creates enormous amounts of energy and heat, and the only byproducts are Helium, Oxygen and Deuterium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheoretically, the reason why most Cold Fusion experiments have had such differing results is because of microscopic flaws in the Palladium lattice structure, hampering Deuterium saturation. If this is true, we may be one step closer to cheap and abundant energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Titan Space Agency","CreatedById":75600,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T00:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been obsesed with this idea too, and i have come up with the idea that you could fuse two tritium atoms in the reactor.
