If you angle 5 degrees to one side and keep yourself just above the ground, you\u0027ll still use all your fuel, but you\u0027ll build up a lot of horizontal speed as well, so you got more practical effect from your thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of orbit, if you shoot straight up to 100km and then start burning sideways, you still have to keep burning away from the ground a bit in order to keep from falling back to the ground before you get to orbital speed. If you think about how much force it takes to pop up to 100km vs how much force it takes to go from zero to 2km/s, you\u0027ll see that you need to generate a lot more horizontal speed than vertical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus the most efficient launch would be to shoot almost straight sideways, since that\u0027s going to start pushing you toward orbital insertion right away. You still have to fight gravity on the way up, though, so you angle slightly so that you\u0027re climbing a bit. The optimal trajectory would be one that puts you at your desired orbital height just as you reach the necessary orbital speed. The problem on planets with atmosphere is that you also have to fight against air friction, and shooting straight sideways would keep you in atmo a lot longer, which would waste a lot more fuel. To counter this, you want to pop up above the low atmosphere, then start leaning gradually but aggressively toward your insertion angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity losses are all that fuel you spend on fighting against gravity when you\u0027re entering or exiting an orbit.
