The following are a few things I believe need a bit of tweaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) placing parts in cargo bays. I\u0027ve been having trouble attaching parts to the cargo bay hard points (the green spheres). The parts just keep attaching to the bottom or next to the hard point at a weird angle. The only surefire way i can get a part to attach to the hard point is to come in from the side so it snaps to it. This does not work in cargo bays. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) SAS and space planes. It\u0027s been difficult to attach the SAS modules to my space plane designs in a streamlined fashion. They just disrupt the aerodynamics (looks only) and kind of stick out. At this point I just put them in cargo bays, but I keep running into problem one. If anyone has any tips on how to make SAS stick out less, I would greatly appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Nighttime Landings. Normally I use the shadow of the craft as it descends or on board lights. Unfortunately, there is no shadow at night (duh) and the lights only work close to the ground. This can make it very difficult to judge altitude during a night landing. I\u0027ve tried the interior view (for the better altimeter), but that has its own drawbacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s. I really love this game and intend to play it for a long time:D. These are the only faults I could find in 15\u002Bhours of gameplay and they aren\u0027t very big ones. If any of this is on the banned list I apologize, I did my best to make sure it was not. Happy Holidays.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
