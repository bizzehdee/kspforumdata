I want a phone that I can use without internet. I spend as much as 2 weeks at a time out in the mountains in BC. Don\u0027t say \u0022oh well everyone has coverage anyway you just go to mountains!\u0022 I get less than a mile out of the closest town with coverage and i don\u0027t have a connection anymore. The closest town overall has 300 people and they have no cell towers there at all. The S5 is only slower because of the bloatware Samsung tacks on. If you look at lower end phones such as the One Plus one you can see the difference it makes. Why would anyone care where the phone is made? That\u0027s bordering on an untrue stereotype. I don\u0027t know how to tell you this but EVERY phone is made in China. iPhones are produced by Foxconn. They have all their factories in China. Samsung phones are made by Foxconn. I\u0027m not sure about One Plus phones or Oppo phones but I\u0027m betting theyre made in China too. Just because your phone says \u0022designed in California\u0022 doesn\u0027t mean it was made there. Face the facts, iPhones aren\u0027t special little snowflakes, they are made like every other phone. If seeing designed in California makes you feel good, good for you.
