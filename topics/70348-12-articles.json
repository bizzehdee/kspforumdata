Your car isn\u0027t made in one place, as an example. It pulls in components from all around the world. As for scientific research institutions, beyond a certain size you loose any benefit to having it all in one place. And switching to having multiple institutions competing with each other for funding allows you to generate competition and spur more rapid advancement. Now, for something like SLS that doesn\u0027t make sense because having multiple institutions competing to make the best most efficient LV would be like Ford asking different plants to make different Mustangs and see which is best, and the private sector is happily rising to the challenge anyway. But having Ames and JPL both working on astrobiology projects does make sense, because there can be competing theories about how something works and both will be driven to prove themselves right and get more funding. And they will serve as a check on the other\u0027s work to ensure it\u0027s good science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan science be made more efficient? Yes. But that has much more to do with the fact that scientists are never trained to be managers, and yet are often tasked with being managers. Just putting the entirety of the NIH in one place, or moving all the national labs to one location, won\u0027t automatically make everything better. We decided science is important, and are paying money to make science happen.
