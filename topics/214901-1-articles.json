My modlist is available at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://controlc.com/8587d8e6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://controlc.com/8587d8e6\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have noticed that, if I build a rocket with external boosters, the booster flame plume is multiple feet (in game terms) beneath the engine bell. Please see screencaps of a launch, with the boosters running, then jettisoned and just the main engine running, which is at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/h0HFaaC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/h0HFaaC\u003C/a\u003E. Please note that this is the same launch...I took a screenshot, then staged the boosters and took another screenshot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay...It appears that (at least on this rocket), it is specific to the Reliant engine. The inline engine on the spacecraft is a Swivel, but the 4 boosters are each Reliants. I switched two of them, as a test, to the Swivel, and the visual anomaly is not in fact there. However, the Swivel\u0027s lower thrust isn\u0027t quite enough to get me to orbit, unless I want to stick another pair on it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have any idea where in the configs to tweak?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--vr\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-11T23:09:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2023 11:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by VulcanRidr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdated information about the problem.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
