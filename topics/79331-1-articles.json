But for future reference, you might want to look around in here before asking questions because this one has been asked and answered many times in the past few days (several times on this page of the forum alone), and is the 1st thing in the 0.24 FAQ sticky thread here, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, what you do is fly your rocket (that has an empty seat) to within about 2000m of the Kerbal (closer is better). Once you\u0027re close enough, use [ or ] to switch your control to the Kerbal, then hit R to turn on his jetpack, then use the EVA jetpack controls to fly the Kerbal to the rocket. Then he has to get inside the rocket. Once he\u0027s in, your control is back to being the rocket, and you just bring it in to land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
