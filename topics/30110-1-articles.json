The only thing I am stuck on is when I want to build a stock heavyish lifter. My problem is that during launch in the lower atmosphere my fuel tanks that are connected to each other (Yes i made sure that they actually are) randomly decide to \u0022collide\u0022 into each other (thats what the aftermath report says). I have tried using different tanks, more struts, specialised strut placements, less thrust, more thrust and a variety of other tips and tricks but nonetheless the problem persists, at random! I have build lifter rockets that fly fine the first try, but on the second one with no alterations made whatsoever one of my tanks likes to magically collide and go BOOM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince i am building a lifter capable of heaving 50T into LKO I need to use lots of fuel\u002Bengines.

The answer is to strut to different parts of your vehicle so the load is more spread out. Also try designing stuff that doesn\u0027t hinge off one connection. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I mean by that is that if you attach a tank radially to another, and then put another tank below the one you just attached, BOTH of them are anchoring their weight onto that one radial attachment, so instead try to spread the weight of your vehicle across as many of the components as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem can be if you cram a really powerful engine below a heavy vehicle.
