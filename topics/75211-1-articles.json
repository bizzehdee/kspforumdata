This is a short suggestion on road tracks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoad tracks are trails of sunken mud/ soil left by a rover, plane or a car. It only appears on sand, dirt, soil and mud. They disappear after it reaches 2.5km away from the player, thus ensuring no lag. It is just a visual improvement, not an actual physical track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T13:57:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYES!
