While not a complete replica I\u0027ve tried to stay of close to the real thing as possible while still keeping the part count down. (Ok its not a low part count but better than it could have been) However once the first stage goes its down to manageable levels for most computers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket has a relatively low payload fraction at only 10% (50 tons) but is able to move even the max payload as far as the Mun or Minmus due to the low TWR of the 3rd stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGP2-5 Lifter: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/9bu11kemaiby244/GP2-V%20HLV.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/9bu11kemaiby244/GP2-V%20HLV.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the basic rocket with no payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGP2-5 Mun Mission: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/9srgv9cp1x3cdxm/GP2-V%20Mun%20Trip.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/9srgv9cp1x3cdxm/GP2-V%20Mun%20Trip.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComes with an orbiter and two stage lander for Mun or Minmus missions.
