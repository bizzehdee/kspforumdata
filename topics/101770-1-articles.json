A key requirement- over how much of a time window are you trying to measure at one time? What is the smallest acceptable time window? Your requirements are a little vague, but an old oscilloscope could fit the bill, and wouldn\u0027t cost much if used. You could measure the voltage and current (using a current-sense resistor and a voltage probe- a lot cheaper than an actual current sensor) and export the waveforms its collects to a computer. But the time window it collects over would be short. Just make sure the o-scope can handle 120 VAC, which is actually a peak voltage of (2^0.5)*120 = ~170 V\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a complex load (one with a significant imaginary/reactive component) you have to know the relative phase between the voltage and the current to compute the power, so simply measuring the current alone won\u0027t do the trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the other key requirement is cost, how much are you willing to spend?

It would record to an SD card. You\u0027d have to set up some hardware and probably do a little programming, like, for example, make a signal conditioning board for it so that you could feed the Aurdino\u0027s ADC a signal that was proportional to average power and that didn\u0027t turn it into smoke. You\u0027d have to isolate your analog signal conditioning circuitry from AC, obviously, but that\u0027s not too difficult. Basically, how your signal conditioning would work would be to multiply the voltage across the AC load by the differential voltage across a current-sense resistor (in series with the load) using something like this analog voltage multiplier IC-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD633.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD633.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELow-pass filter the output of this IC (you could use nothing more than a single-pole LPF using a resistor and a capacitor) so that you get the average power over like the last second or two, and have your data logger log that. I haven\u0027t done a project where I need to sense AC voltages, so I\u0027m not familiar with how to best isolate your signal conditioning circuit from AC, but I could look it up if this approach interests you, and you don\u0027t already know how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advantage to this approach: it\u0027s cheap. You can get Advanced Circuits to make you a two-layer PCB for only $33, and get the parts off Digi-key and Mouser. The disadvantage- obviously, it\u0027s gonna be more labor-intensive, and you need decently advanced electrical engineering skills, but if you say you have a bunch of O-scopes and probes, maybe you do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T01:40:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 01:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T01:28:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like rather demanding needs.
