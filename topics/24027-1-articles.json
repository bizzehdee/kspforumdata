This way I cannot copy the ship and send out like 2 or 4 Living Quarters at once. I\u0027m using Subassembly mod but it\u0027s really hard with that also. The easiest way would be to change the root part to something else so I could copy the whole structure..

I\u0027ve been messing around with the XML files quite a bit, mostly deleting debris, but copying ships there.. Too much trouble :/ I can\u0027t use the subassembly for this project because my ship has a docking port which I want to connect to the rockets which take me to space and subassembly mod only lets you connect the template from its root part (command pod).. I tried mixing this with Part Filter which allows to start building ships with different parts but that was way too buggy.
