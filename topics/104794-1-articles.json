This same thing happens with engines, but the engine fire comes out of the bottom of the rocket and to the left of the engine of you are looking out the door. What is wrong? Help please. I also don\u0027t see the staging on the right side of the VAB either.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI seriously need help.

Some of the other forum posts on this topic mention Tweakscale as a possible culprit, and that was true for me. But rather than uninstalling and living without, I tracked the problem down to a config file.\n\nGameData\\TweakScale\\plugins\\PluginData\\Scale\\config.xml\n\nFor me, that file was a 0 kb empty file. Not sure how that happened since I\u0027ve used the mod fine for months, but it was the cause. Renaming it allowed the plugin to rebuild it correctly and now no more engines/RCS running in the VAB. Hope this helps someone else."}]}
