I\u0027ve looked at a few mods, but I\u0027m thinking it might just be more simple to just adjust somethings myself by editing the parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy only concern is that this might break the contract system in career mode and I\u0027ll be stuck, credit-less!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have any experience with this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T21:20:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve started this process myself, a little.

So I want to make extra versions of them that have no lift, and maybe a little less drag.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I understand so far is that using the KMM module manager is the smart way to do it -- even if you have to learn how to write the scripts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I think you need a reply here from someone with lots of experience with the Mod Manager. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Danger2007","CreatedById":71663,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T03:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was just going to back up all the parts before I start and if something goes wrong then I\u0027ll replace them.
