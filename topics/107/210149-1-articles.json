However, when I launch the vehicle, the servos seem to no longer be attached to the shrouds, and rotate independently of them:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TKPrKBZAlik?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022KSP Servo Bug\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve built and rebuilt this vehicle three or four separate times, and this issue occurs consistently.

I\u0027ve found that a workaround is to attach something else to the servo, say a battery bank, and attach the shroud to the battery, then this gives the expected behaviour:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/168825481548791808/1032684699186901043/unknown.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002285.25\u0022 height=\u0022907\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/168825481548791808/1032684699186901043/unknown.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
