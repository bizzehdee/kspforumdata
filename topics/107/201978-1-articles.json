This happens with any/all items that once put in a cargo slot has that green\u00A0bar on the right with a 1 beside it, but I can never get it to 2. I removed many of the mods I was using that dealt with parts when 1.11 hit, but kept the Feline Rovers because I hate making rovers. The rest of the mods I use are for UI like Atmospheric Autopilot and Mechjeb. There is likely a part of a mod that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E didn\u0027t remove which is causing it. It likely asked me if I wanted to delete the folder and I didn\u0027t or vice versa. Before I post a full list of mods tho, I was just wondering if anyone else has heard/seen this happen. I hope someone has and there is a simple fix that I am overlooking.

It\u0027s the Cargo category. Usually for when you need to do the (broken) repair this part on that craft missions that you would need to use them. EVA Repair Kits, EVA Science Kit, Small lights, some small solar panels, the drogue parachute that does not need an attachment point (the small one). These are all things that can stack in the Cargo Containers.. or they should, but I can\u0027t for some reason. I grab a second one and click on the spot where the first one is and it just clicks. No extra part added, but the Container shows that it would have room for it (in Liters). I was able to do it for a while after it was introduced, but something changed and I\u0027m not sure what. I thought it was just a glitch that would be fixed, but still there after a few months of waiting, so posting here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KADC","CreatedById":224153,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-08T22:10:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can see this thread never got a solution, but as this is literally the only relevant Google result (other than a six-year-old one for KOS which I don\u0027t have installed) I\u0027m going to cross my fingers and hope this new post will stimulate a better result as I have either the same or related issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can stack all stackable items (stock, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E) with the expected quantity limit (yellow number) and volume calculation (green bar) in some non-storage parts which have had inventory capability added to them (ex. any crewable command module).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can stack only certain stackable items (wrench, screwdriver, explosives, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E manual to be specific -- nothing else as far as I can tell) in actual inventory-specific cargo containers (ex.
