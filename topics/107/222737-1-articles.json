I have it set to 1 second with the parachute activating at the very end and the decoupler activating at the start with the sepratron. When I\u0027m in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, it plays fine, but when I click launch and try to click \u0022play\u0022 it says playing, but the timer thing doesn\u0027t move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried changing the priority a bunch and it didn\u0027t do anything.
