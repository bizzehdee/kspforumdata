When you hit space to deploy the module, it starts floating toward the surface but fails before it gets there. It does get to the surface but only after the deployment has failed and there is no way of re-deploying without picking it up, and then you have the falling problem again..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nError just after deployment...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/7a6GMSc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/7a6GMSc\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModule status after failed deployment\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/tlEWlJ0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/tlEWlJ0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-25T02:34:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2021 02:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Dave373\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadd image links.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave373","CreatedById":209486,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-25T04:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuccess!..\u00A0 If you can find an incline steep enough, and face uphill, and turn the units to the right angle (depends on the type of unit) the science units will touch the ground before failing to open.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSee pic..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/ULSIdeP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/ULSIdeP\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would just like to add that traversing Gilly with science is painful as you can\u0027t pack a Jetpack..
