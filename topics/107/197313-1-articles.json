I want to open this topic to ask about the KAL-100 Controller.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is basically that the controller forgets the whole track when loading/saving or even when switching/focusing to another ship. I found just a few bugs related to it in 1.7 and 1.8, claimed fixed. But this issue is still present in 1.10 version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, every time I load the game or switch to another ship, whatever track is on the controller of X ship will be deleted, not sure why. Even weirder, if I dock another ship with a controller to this X ship, one of the controllers will be deleted and the other will be overwritten (even though they have different names and such) only when docking!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to ask if anyone know of a fix to these issue or a fast way to add a track, or just simply, copying and pasting a whole controller into another ship (of the same type, same structure, pieces, etc) because i have a huge space station that I have managed to make a circular ring using robotics arm and a controller to make the nice effect. However yeah, is a pain in the ass to add the track every single time since is a huge structure and has lots of robotics parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help please? And thanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor further information, please have a look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/189125-bug-moduleroboticcontroller-kal-1000-literally-forgets-entire-sequence-tracks/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis post\u003C/a\u003E per example!
