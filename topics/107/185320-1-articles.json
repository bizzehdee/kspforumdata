I would like to do something similar with ground stations, maybe naming them by where they are deployed. I can\u0027t seem to figure out how to do this. I currently have several items in my tracking station called \u0022DeployedGroundStation\u0022 or something similar and I can\u0027t seem to figure out how to rename them. Is there something I\u0027m missing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
