I\u0027ve tried deleting/re-saving the craft, saving under a different name, opening the file in a stock game... no avail. The weird part is that if I open the .craft file in Notepad\u002B\u002B and go looking for those entries, their rowIndex is consecutive (even if their physical location within the file is a little jumbled up) and as I\u0027d expect them to be: L M Ankle = 10, L M Pad = 11 and L B Hip 1 = 12... Granted, this isn\u0027t a huge issue, but it\u0027s annoying, and it\u0027s bugging me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
