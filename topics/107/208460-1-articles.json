Am I missing something? Do I need relays in Duna orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the experiments keep disabling themselves (the completed ones), despite there being way more power than required. I even sent a manned mission to switch them\u00A0 back on, and to deploy more power just in case, but they switched off again straight away. They seem to get disabled in time warp.......?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225SDr5z9.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/5SDr5z9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-05T21:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve only ever tried deploying those things on Mun, which, due to being tidally locked, never would lose contact with Kerbin.
