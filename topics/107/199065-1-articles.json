I.e. if I want to drop stuff out of scientist\u0027s pockets to clear space for science module, game just doesn\u0027t allow me to drop it on the ground (while engineer can do this easily; guess it will eventually lead to some mass protests by pilots end scientists).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
