On side note,I\u0027ve try with anything else than wheel,and find out that only lightweight structure seems work with robotic part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeam,steel plate.steel cube,wheels,battery,I have tried everything else between hinge and wheel(and even no wheel tho) and robotic part completely fail to work(hinge mostly of time start moving like piston on a below\u0026lt;10 or -10 digit angle) Moving autostrust of object between robotic part and wheel(as something just hinge and static part,for sake of testing Im trying different configuration type) and it does the same, maybe moving couple digital number higher or lower than what it does but still doesnt work as it suppose(hinge change into non fonctionnal piston) well...\u00A0anything I do simple doesn\u0027t work, outside lightweight structure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm only using last interstellar mod,idk if it had anything to do with that bug\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: fallowing another thread, Turn out that kerbal joint inforcement that is include with interstellar mod make robotic part struggle\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-07T23:40:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2019 11:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by etoque\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
