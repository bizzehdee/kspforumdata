I deorbited a primitive station near it, and got the message that it couldn\u0027t record the data because it had no power:\u00A0it was on the dark side of the Mun at the time of impact. At the time of impact, I was focused on a lander just departing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. Ah well, I have a transfer stage inbound to try again, making sure it had sunlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my lander established Mun orbit, then did a de-orbit burn to land the transfer stage near the seismograph, while the lander landed nearby. I heard the kaboom of the transfer stage crashing (it wasn\u0027t an Earth-shattering kaboom), but no message. I checked over the science station, and everything looked good. Then I quickloaded to just after the de-orbit burn, and had a scientist at the science station pick up and re-deploy the control station and seismograph. After another perfect landing, I still had no message, no science results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now I ask, before trying again and riding the stage down, has anyone else had this happen?
