I\u0027ve been trying to wrap my head around\u00A0helicopter physics and built a pretty stable test design using a contra-rotating rotor to stop spin (thank you Brikoleur!). I can fly around pretty\u00A0easy, but one thing keep going wrong: Landing. Basically can\u0027t do it. Here\u0027s what happens:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fly around a bit to test aerodynamics, then decide to land. I lower my blade RPM and descend slowly, but as I approach 0 m/s (descent) the rate of slowing increases very suddenly and\u00A0I begin a free-fall like drop. I quickly jam the rotors back to max RPM, but there\u0027s a\u00A0lag\u00A0before the change starts reducing my descent and I\u0027m typically around 20-40 m/s before it starts (slowly) reducing. Often this either ends in\u00A0hitting so hard I explode, or just hard enough that I bounce hard upward and rocket back to high altitude (even if I drop RPM right before I\u00A0hit). If\u00A0I get it semi-stable\u00A0I can ping-pong up and down, but can\u0027t maintain a slow descent. It feels as if the sweet zone for descending slowly is so VERY narrow that I can\u0027t stay in it, like balancing two spheres on one another. I can capture a video of this if it is unclear... Just hoping it\u0027s a known cause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be clear, when the sudden drop happens, I am NOT touching the controls. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is on, but my hands are off the RPM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know what I\u0027m doing wrong?
