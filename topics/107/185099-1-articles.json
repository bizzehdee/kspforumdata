They weren\u2019t fast, but they were a bit faster than 2 m/s. The paddle wheel was actually faster, but it still wasn\u2019t anywhere near jet boats and it\u00A0produced a good bit of lag with the water. At the same time, though, both of these were made to be kinda fancy and were thus very unoptimized. I\u2019m certain a more optimized boat could do better, both in terms of hull design and rotor pitch optimization.
