And in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E they both work fine, but once I launch, the left one just won\u0027t move. I trieda lot, manual rotation, removing from symmetry, placing separately. Nothing works? Anyone else experience this bug, and does someone have a fix?
