Was working pretty great for a while. I checked in on it after a while, however, and found that it had apparently gotten disconnected from the control station, but only after collecting 100% science. The problem is that only 10% of this science ended up getting transmitted for some reason. What\u0027s up with that?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of the modules seem to have moved around at all, and it is definitely still in range of the control station, which is still receiving power from the solar panel.

The deployed science works in the way, that while they are working every now and then (every 10% of science gained?) they try to connect to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and transmit their science. If they cannot transmit at that moment - either because there is no commnet connection (at that moment!) or no power (e.g. because the solar panels are in darkness) - then they keep the data and continue on. If they have a connection at a later try then they transmit all data that has been accumulated up to then. But once they reach 100% researched science they do another try to transmit data and then shut themselves down, even if they couldn\u0027t transmit their data. So if you have a setup with spotty commnet connectivity or are just unlucky then it can happen that whenever the experiments try to transmit their data this fails for some reason or another. And when they reach 100% researched science they give it a final try, fail again, and then stop trying altogether.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way to \u0022fix\u0022 this that I know of is to go there with a Kerbal - preferably a scientist - pick up the experiment, and place it again. This resets the experiment and it can try from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, this sucks.
