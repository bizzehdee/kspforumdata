Had an idea to try robotics parts and control them with KAL-1000. Tried it in the past and didn\u0027t have any problems. However today I\u0027ve noticed that I cannot control robotics in KAL\u0027s track editor. Instead green lines, which controlled thoese parts, now I have blue, striped line, that I cannot move up or down (attached screenshoot).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have no idea what is going on, tried to google my problem, no results unfortunately... Can anybody help me with that, please?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222019-12-07.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/TqBL7nX/2019-12-07.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-08T10:40:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe green lines in the KAL track editor are for continuous values like a servo\u0027s traget position, a rotor\u0027s max RPM, a piston,s target extension, or so. These values can (and should?) change smoothly over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe blue lines - and more importantly the dots on these lines - are for triggering \u0022instantaneous\u0022 events, like toggling motor power, (un-)locking a servo lock, toggling the \u0022open / closed\u0022 state of bay doors, etc. Those events get triggered, whenever the play position of the KAL reaches a marker dot on the corresponding blue line. You can add a marker dot with the \u0022\u002B\u0022 symbol in the middle of the row with the buttons in the track editor, and then move it around with the mouse or enter the exact time in the field at the bottom right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words: you get a green line for options that you can control with an axis action group and a blue line for options that you can control with a \u0022classic\u0022 action group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JanJanJan","CreatedById":201728,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-08T12:47:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOMG...\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow I\u0027m embarrassed... I\u0027ve just realised, that I had been picking wrong options all this time... Instead of \u0022toggle bay doors\u0022 I should have picked \u0022deploy limit\u0022 to set things, what I wanted...
