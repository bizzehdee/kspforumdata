Some features can only be scanned with an arm, some can only be picked up by a Kerbal on EVA, and some are just graphical only, if you have terrain scatters turned on in the settings. On Eve, the volcanic rock can only be picked up by a Kerbal, while the basalt formation and pancake dome features can only be scanned by an arm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
