I\u0027ve gotten the Making History expansion pack and was able to install and play it without issues. However, I just bought the Breaking Ground DLC and am getting error codes when I start up the game. The game loads up perfectly fine but when i get to the menu screen a little pop up window displays the words \u0022The following expansions failed to load: Breaking Ground: Expansion isn\u0027t a recognized expansion that can be loaded!\u0022 I have verified the games files and tried validating my install folders to no avail. Just wondering if anybody has had any similar problems and can possibly steer me in the right direction toward getting this issue resolved.\u00A0Thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-01T00:22:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/197789-rogersb17/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022197789\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/197789-rogersb17/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@rogersb17\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have moved your thread to the breaking ground support subforum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
