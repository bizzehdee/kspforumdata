The distribution of ore turned out to be exceptionally suitable for this plan; it\u0027s very unlikely that I\u0027ll ever have another save with such a good distribution of ore on Minmus or an ore-rich Mun crater in the right position for direct-ascent launches to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. This save has both. However, being one of my early games, I started it before I installed Breaking Ground. I miss the surface features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, can I force BG to add surface features to this existing save? There are as yet few bases, no colonies, and most mining ships are in flight. I intend to make a backup before adding the features, and if any bases or ships are damaged by features appearing where they are, I can load the backup, move them, then re-add the features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, can I generate a new save with the same random seed? I could then move my ships bases and everything to the new game. As above, if something is damaged, I can go back to the old game, move it, and re-transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying some things, but if anyone really knows, I\u0027d love to hear about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I think I\u0027ve found it. Copying Seed and ROCSeed from the save in question to a new save made the new save\u0027s ore distribution the same as the old and \u003Cem\u003Eremoved \u003C/em\u003Esurface features. I think this is because ROCSeed is -1 in the old save but a positive number in new saves. In the morning, I\u0027ll try setting the old save\u0027s ROCSeed to some positive value and see what happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-10T16:16:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2024 04:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 10\u0022\u003EJune 10\u003C/time\u003E by eekee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Esolved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eekee","CreatedById":211180,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-10T15:34:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is ROCSeed. I copied its value from a newer save, and found BG surface features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTesting was the hard part; they don\u0027t spawn in instantly, so I twice thought it hadn\u0027t worked. For my first test, I cheated a rover to Vall as its features are some of the easiest to see. I drove around a bit and saw nothing to the point that I was starting to think it hadn\u0027t worked. Then, I turned around and saw 5 or 6 cryovolcanoes erupting simultaneously. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (I think they do that when they\u0027re newly spawned.) I still had a question: were they forming because I\u0027d changed ROCSeed or because I hadn\u0027t been to Vall before, in this save? So, I had to explore Kerbin too. I drove a rover for quite a while without seeing anything, but I didn\u0027t think to turn around. Seeing no baobabs on the grasslands, I cheated the rover to the middle of a mountain range to look for crystals and immediately found a baobab. This left me wondering if they were only spawning in regions I hadn\u0027t seen before, so I looked at an area I\u0027ve seen more of than any other, the grasslands between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and the mountains, and found a baobab there. I think it\u0027s safe to say all the bodies have BG surface features now, and the cause can only be changing ROCSeed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncidentally, I thought I saw 2 ROCSeed lines in one of my saves. Both had the same value. When changing it, perhaps search the file in case there is a second instance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-10T16:19:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2024 04:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 10\u0022\u003EJune 10\u003C/time\u003E by eekee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMention multiple ROCSeed lines\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
