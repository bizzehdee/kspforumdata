The first process produces metals and hydride that evaporate off at different temperatures and are collected by cold traps at different temperatures, the second process separates elements via their voltage of formation. That is two dimensions of separation.

Some of what you said though is in error though, for one Venus does not suffer for temperature swings, it atmosphere super rotates and keeps the whole surface at about the same temperature day and night. Second Venus is very nitrogen rich, 3 times as much nitrogen as earth, at least in gas form. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways mining hydrogen and water form the Kepler belt is ideal, a minimum of ~1x10^21 kg of water is needed. The Kepler belt provides high concentrations of water with a delta-v of 4-6 km/s. Even cracking water into hydrogen from the Kepler belt makes sense because trying to extract it from gas giants would consume even more energy in delta-v (making 1 kg of hydrogen is equal to pushing 1 kg of matter to 6.3 km/s) plus the waste oxygen could be used as propellent mass. Venus already has 4.6x10^21 kg of CO2, add 4.1x10^19 kg of hydrogen, have the heat convert it and the CO2 to water and methane and have engineering cloud flora covert the methane back to hydrogen and carbon soot and you got 3.7x10^20 kg of water, that a quarter of the needed amount of water for 1/11 the input mass.

On earth we need to burn fuels, complex power plants, we cant just aim a mirror at the sun and get continues heat and power 24/7. On earth 100 Kw per kg only makes sense for the most rare of elements, in space that would not be a concern because power is plentiful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re chasing a mining utopia.

I never said 2 km/s! Lets consider the round trip cost two and from Venus, even with aerobraking that is going to be a delta-v of over 16 km/s, with an asteroid colony we could do it in 8 km/s for hundreds of asteroids. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat evidence you have that they have all those compuds? Please.. I really want a source that tells me if I can get all the elements from 1 asteroid.

The argument that for what the asteroid colony can\u0027t make right way they can trade for in what they can mine, which can\u0027t be done on Venus without having to get things off of Venus.
