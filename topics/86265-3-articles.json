The descent module was the only really disappointing part of the thing cause it is too small and not really suited for what it needs to do. Next time I think I will design a bigger one that will include the legs and the chutes too. This time, to overcome the problem I made a large part of the deorbit burn with the mothership engines (that was still plenty of fuel and that eventually I left in LKO with some fuel left), then I dropped the lander on the correct way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding was easy to be honest. Just a few legs went OOO and their job was done anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ascent was easier than I thought. I had a very good TWR all the way and I had some fuel left to RV with the mothership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small EVA to get back to the return ship. At this point the mothership was supposed to be spent and left here. The module I brought has got around 4700 D/v so it should be enough to get back home by itself, but the mothership still had fuel, so I decided to bring it back home with me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was not really intended to do it so I simply left it in LKO after the aerobrake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter undocking the reentry module I simply made my deorbit burn and I missed KSC by a few miles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship concept is a little bit on the \u0022recycled\u0022 side: the lander was formerly a low tech Mun rocket and the mothership was made for a Jool 5 mission (that\u0027s why it is so full of useless crap). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u0027s go with the pics.
