It\u0027s not offering me the thing I\u0027m looking for, which is a small and convenient life support container. Sure, I can load up a quadcore with a wedge each for water, oxygen and food, but then I have a 1.25m part with life support resources for 147 days... and a giant amount of wasted weight and space, because there\u0027s water for 168 days and oxygen for 384 days. It\u0027s completely impractical, especially if I just want to go to the Mun for 5 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I want is a lightweight, tiny part that adds a couple of days worth of life support by itself, so one or two Kerbals can go on a mission that only lasts a week or so. TAC LS is the one mod I have found so far that comes anywhere close to this, with its inline 0.625m 30-day container and the radial 20-day hexcan. Still overkill for one single Kerbal going to the Mun, but ideal for two, and great for going to Minmus. I think I\u0027m going to stick with that instead.

Then you upgrade that too, and you can extend your reach to Mun and Minmus... where building a manned return mission bumps right into the mass limit of the launchpad again. Upgrade that, and you\u0027re set to go interplanetary.

Around 3300 m/s to get into orbit, and 4850 m/s to escape Kerbin. It\u0027s fascinating... I wonder what this new Kerbin would have to be made of. I know the stock one needs to be as dense as lead or something crazy, but with all of this extra volume KerbinX2 must not be as implausible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a pretty linear progression.

Around 5 times the density of lead. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile your new Kerbin (assuming the new radius is 1200 km) would need a density of ~29.05 tons per cubic meter.
