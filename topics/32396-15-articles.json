It\u0027s only for the original Kethane drill and shouldn\u0027t be used on any other part. The KethaneExtractorAnimatorLanded module lets you use any old part as an extractor, and it simply uses the vessel status (whether it\u0027s landed) to determine whether the extractor can harvest resources. The KethaneDrillAnimator module powers the heavy drill and supports animations, particle effects, ray casting for ground, the works. It\u0027s definitely the best of the three, but it\u0027s complicated to use. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Majiir/Kethane/wiki/API-and-Modules-Documentation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDetails are in the documentation.\u003C/a\u003E The EPv2 auger uses the ExtractorAnimatorLanded, but I\u0027ve been discussing the DrillAnimator with skykooler and making enhancements so it\u0027s suitable for his use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Krisism\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Krisism\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhere can I buy you both a coffee?

This is a thread for the Extraplanetary Launchpads Mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of this great mod - now that I have all the parts working I\u0027m looking into making it a bit more realistic in the numbers. To share some of the quick info I\u0027ve learned and how you can implement it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Common ore deposits on Earth range in iron concentration - with a low end typically being 25-35% and the high ends (known as Direct Ship Ores) are closer to 65-70% iron. The higher grade irons are rarer, and though there is a lot of savings in refining something with less waste - the waste in higher grade deposits tends to be more expensive to dispose of. Until we have a way of defining different deposit concentrations, I think it\u0027s more realistic and better for the mod to use a lower value. Personally, my conversion efficiency from Ore to Metal is 33%, and I mine Ore at 0.01 (though this seems to fast). To change your efficiency, open up your part.cfg file for the Smelter/converter part and look for this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODULE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = KethaneConverter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E SourceResource = Ore\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E TargetResource = Metal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ConversionEfficiency = 0.33\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E SourceConsumption = 0.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E PowerConsumption = 10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s quite self-explanatory. Change your conversion efficiency to whatever you want and I recommend setting a low value for source-consumption too. Ore refining is not a quick process!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Metal to rocket parts - how do you measure this in reality? There are so many possible alloys or other things used in rocket parts that this has to be somewhat of a stretch. In general though, I think the actual conversion efficiency from metal into rocket parts would be very high, leaving little waste metal. The time it takes to make them is another story though - and this is where I think some realism can be applied. By setting a high conversion efficiency (say 90%) and a very low source consumption, we can produce rocketparts efficiently from metal, it just takes a long time. I\u0027m going to now test with the SourceConsumption value for metal set to 0.03 (roughly three times as long as ore-metal conversion).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, just thought I\u0027d share the values.
