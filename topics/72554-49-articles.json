Make it an option to auto scale. I want to turn it off, I find it so annoying even when it is right...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the bug where the mass and other numbers are getting inflated or deflated to incorrect numbers for the appropriate scale can be re-created with nothing but Tweak Scale and MechJeb installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart with a MK1 Command Pod. The one with a 1.25m bottom and a 0.625m top. Place a Small Inline Reaction Wheel on top of the command pod. Resize it up from 1.25m to 2.5m and the mass will go up. Resize it back to 1.25m and the mass will stay at what it was when it was at 2.5m. This can be repeated with pretty much all of the parts when connecting a part that is classified as a \u0022stack\u0022 to another \u0022stack\u0022 part. This bug can also be reversed by resizing from 1.25m to 0.625m then back again and the part will have an unusually small mass. I was only able to cause the bug to happen when attaching a \u0022stack\u0022 part to another \u0022stack\u0022 part. Seems to work correctly when attaching a \u0022stack\u0022 part to a \u0022surface\u0022 part such as an Octo2 probe core which probably should be classified as stack anyways...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the Small Inline Reaction Wheel was changed from a 1.25m part to a 0.625m part in version 0.25 so the config should maybe be changed to reflect that? Some of the smaller probe cores are classified as surface and maybe should instead be stack or maybe not be configurable at all since there are probe cores for most sizes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some screen shots showing the bug with a different command pod and fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore any changes are made the total mass is 3.28t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AUYEpIm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AUYEpIm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESizing up make the mass go up to 19.03t which appears to be correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DK1cCMu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DK1cCMu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging the fuel tank back down to the normal size of 1.25m causes the extra dry mass to be retained from the previous 2.5m size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KqhzaDr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KqhzaDr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain this time going from 1.25m to 0.625m sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OfLsxcA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OfLsxcA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hRimXKi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hRimXKi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-21T05:46:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2014 05:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by hazens1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biotronic","CreatedById":72381,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T05:41:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESilence in the back!
