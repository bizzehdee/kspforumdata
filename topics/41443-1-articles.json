How do you build a rocket when the parts list is on the (distorted) side? Also, the resolution is halved horizontally and the GUI is made for a horizontal screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- in the same spirit, flying a rocket in external view. Sure, it\u0027d be 3D and less info, but head movements would be weird, given the focus point on the ship. Let\u0027s not even talk about clicking on a mod window \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- however, with all those issues: IVA would be improved tenfold with a Rift, for sure. That\u0027s the one camera set in a point, and rotating on it instead of around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat could be done: for external views/VAB/SPH, change from \u0022point of reference\u0022 to \u0022turn your head with the center view being the ship\u0022. Like a virtual screen displayed in a black room, at 1m from you. Not pretty or amazing, but it\u0027ll avoid putting the Rift off and on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: of course, that\u0027s a lot of extra work for a few people (since the Rift is not *really* out yet). I\u0027m all for it, and it\u0027ll be needed down the line (HarvesteR is a TrackIR fan, so I\u0027m not worried about future implementation), but right now, it\u0027s a small nice-to-have compared to other features.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-08T13:59:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2013 01:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Neomatt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T15:29:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce the IVA views are fully fleshed out, than I would totally try a mission with the Occulus Rift.
