First time on the forums so I want to say hey to everyone, and sorry if this thread is misplaced. I\u0027m also trying my hand at modeling and texturing (using blender) and would appreciate some help and constructive criticism!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m working on is a set of parts aimed at making modules for base/spacestation building. Mainly windowed walkways and living quarters. To start I\u0027ve got a walkway module that I\u0027m almost done with, but am in need of help with ironing out the kinks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the finished part:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1276.photobucket.com/albums/y474/blargeddy1/KSP%20Help%20Thread/walkwayshow_zps45d2d862.jpg?t=1366572366\u0022 alt=\u0022walkwayshow_zps45d2d862.jpg?t=1366572366\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow in all honesty I know it\u0027s not that good but I\u0027m proud of it. In any case I now arrive at the point where help is needed. I have a basic understanding of how the .cfg file works, but am having trouble with some parts of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, I would like my parts to be listed under the Structural tab in KSP, so in the CFG I have the category set as Structural as it should be(subcategory = 0 as well) but it shows up under the propulsion tab. I\u0027m not sure why that is but would like some suggestions as to why that may be. Secondly I would like to set up the node_attach in the CFG so I can attach it to other parts correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I have for the node_attach settings so far: node_attach = 0.0, 0.0, 5.3, 0.0, 0.0, 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 5.3 setting is correct(references to the underside of the part) but when trying to place it this happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1276.photobucket.com/albums/y474/blargeddy1/KSP%20Help%20Thread/walkwayshow2_zps43ec5d5c.jpg?t=1366572368\u0022 alt=\u0022walkwayshow2_zps43ec5d5c.jpg?t=1366572368\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically I\u0027m asking which value in node_attach that I would use to have it rotated 180 degrees to attach it properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\u0027m specifically asking for help, if anyone could offer suggestions or constructive criticism I will gladly listen to your input. I originally intend these parts for personal use but if they are received well I could post them to the spaceport for everyone\u0027s use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther parts I intend to make:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 4-directional connector hub with crew space and perhaps a crew hatch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVarious adapters for 1 meter and 2 meter stock parts in KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA short, mostly windowed module to be used as an \u0027end cap\u0027 for the walkway or connector hub, possibly with a crew hatch\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"germalto","CreatedById":25510,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T20:16:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, the parts look nice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei would recommend looking at the wiki, its a tad outdated but it has stuff in there about attachment nodes and other documentation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENode_definations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation#Node_Definitions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation#Node_Definitions\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttachment Rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation#Attachment_rules:\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation#Attachment_rules:\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is from my config file, perhaps this can help\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E// --- editor parameters ---\u003Cbr\u003Ecost = 150\u003Cbr\u003Ecategory = Structural\u003Cbr\u003Esubcategory = 0\u003Cbr\u003Etitle = M.M.M Corridor5\u003Cbr\u003Emanufacturer = Germalto\u003Cbr\u003Edescription = Originally cardboard boxes, these sections have been bent, taped and painted and re-purposed as off world living containers\u003Cbr\u003E// attachment rules: stack, srfAttach, allowStack, allowSrfAttach, allowCollision\u003Cbr\u003EattachRules = 1,1,1,1,1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to some of the stuff I\u0027ve done, sounds like your doing something similar, perhaps it will give you a few ideas :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://modularmagneticmodules.imgur.com/all/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://modularmagneticmodules.imgur.com/all/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany questions or queries, PM me if you want, I\u0027m not an expert but i have a rough understanding of making parts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blargeddy","CreatedById":57093,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T21:18:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the post. I had used the CFG pages you linked in creating my part file and I actually have your MMM mod from the spaceport. You did a nice job with it and those pictures of your assembled base are great too. If I may venture to say, I\u0027m creating these parts because after trying your mod I found that I wanted something smaller and easier to use. It\u0027s a good mod but doesn\u0027t quite deliver what I personally need, as it is with mods in general it comes down to personal preference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I found a typo that was responsible for my part showing in the propulsion tab and fixed it. But I\u0027m still having trouble with the angle values for the node_attach. I\u0027ve tried values for the x angle and it seems any positive value will rotate it 90 degrees, and the opposite with any negative value. I need 180 degrees.
