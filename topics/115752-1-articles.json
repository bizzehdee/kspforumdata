It has many forms. The Post-apocalyptic return-to-steam, the Victorian England or Aristocratic American story, even the Wild Western. It can be fantasy, a love story, or even hard science fiction. The latter is what we\u0027re going to talk about (or write about if you want to be technical.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe here at the Kerbal Space Program forum certainly love our space travel and our hard science fiction.

The object of the exercise was to demonstrate that, within the capabilities of propellants that could be specified (at least theoretically) at the time, such a mission was not merely possible but would be economically viable\u00A0in so far as the vehicle lift-off mass from the Earth would be no more than one thousand tonnes.

Railways would necessarily be narrow gauge, so that the engines can be light enough for individual transportation. Steam engines would probably be transported to a colony in pieces, and then assembled on site, with a majority of structural parts coming from bamboo. That way only the most difficult parts to produce in-situ would be sent across the vacuum of space from planet to planet. No need to waste precious payload mass on running plates,\u00A0cabins, and fuel bunkers. Rails would be, as discussed earlier, bamboo tracks. Switch tracks would probably be somewhat difficult to produce, however, but no doubt possible. Locomotives could be used for mechanical power and towing, using a system of pulleys to lift things. They could be used to carry supplies and materials around a base. If the planet has multiple colonies relatively nearby, trains could pull passengers and supplies between the colonies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003E...And\u00A0Horses\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your destination planet has a breathable atmosphere(or maybe if you have proper space suit technology), horses could be a valuable tool.

You channel the steam through a generator for electricity, then either a radiator to cool it down and reuse or just add additional water to keep the process going as long as desired. This is not as efficient as solar electric cells, but it\u0027s quite within the bounds of 19th century technology. But could Victorians build a pressure-sealed craft that could operate in space?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe late 19th century was a hotbed of submarine development. Numerous inventors in many countries developed undersea craft: Holland, Lake, and Nordenfelt to name just a few. The same design principles that keep high pressure water out also keep air in. Any shipyard that could build a submarine back then could make a vessel sealed against vacuum. But the main objection seems to be the idea of maintaining life support in space. After all, those Victorian submarines didn\u0027t remain submerged for months at a time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/books/apollo/S6CH5.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENASA\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0determined for the Apollo missions that 1.8 pounds of oxygen were required per man-day of operation in space, plus an additional 4.8 pounds to replace losses due to leaks and such.\u00A0The actual oxygen usage for the Apollo 15 mission was only 2.94 pounds per man-day, only 63% of their estimate which had been refined down after six previous Apollo missions to the moon. (NASA estimates were notoriously conservative.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we assume our hypothetical steampunk aether ship is the size of a contemporaneous armored cruiser (say the British Orlando class) it would displace 5600 tons and require a crew of 484, probably much less, assuming it\u0027s an unarmed exploratory vessel. This is roughly equivalent to the proposed size of the aforementioned Project Orion ship. Even supposing a crew of 484, and the actual oxygen usage of the Apollo missions (about 3 pounds per man-day) the oxygen requirement for a 100-day journey to Mars is only 72.6 tons. For a round-trip (assuming we can\u0027t resupply on the Red Planet) we\u0027d need at least double that, plus a reserve for time spent exploring, so let\u0027s triple that amount: 218 tons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater requirements are close to that of oxygen. NASA provided 25.4 kg for the Apollo 15 mission, a usage rate of 2 kg per man-day. At that rate a 100-day mission to Mars with 484 men would require 106.48 tons, tripled gives 320 tons. This is assuming no recycling.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Orlando-class cruisers were designed to carry 900 tons of coal, which we need only enough to lift us out of the atmosphere, leaving plenty of room for the extra oxygen and water supplies needed for the trip. And remember, this is assuming a ridiculous size crew. A civilian vessel of the same size would have a crew about one-tenth that of a warship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut a major problem with long-term operations for both spacecraft and submarines operating on life support is the build-up of carbon-dioxide. Without constant removal the respiration of the crew will increase the concentration until it becomes toxic. Somehow we\u0027ll have to renew our air supply, and just pumping in more oxygen isn\u0027t enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome have suggested greenhouses, and while that\u0027s certainly within the limits of Victorian technology, a greenhouse big enough to do the job would have to be larger than our ship.\u00A0So, maybe we do add a greenhouse to the design, but more for aesthetics than practicality - always a big steampunk consideration.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA used filters impregnated with lithium hydroxide to remove CO2 from the air of the Apollo capsules. When exposed to CO2, lithium hydroxide sucks it out of the air forming lithium carbonate and water. One gram of lithium hydroxide can remove 450 cubic centimeters pf CO2. The process actually made so much water the Apollo crews actually had to dump the excess overboard. A lithium hydroxide filter with simple electric fans to circulate the air would make an effective life support system for our aether ship\u00A0and\u00A0reduce the amount of water our expedition would have to carry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLithium hydroxide is not a high-tech material. It was first obtained by electrolysis in 1821 by William Thomas Brande. The process was improved in 1855 by Robert Bunsen, the inventor of the Bunsen burner. So the life support system of our modern moon missions employed essentially Victorian technology...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPessimistic view of Steampunks In Space.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Beowolf\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Beowolf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nBeowolf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nI worked with a semi-pro author on a similar concept. He wanted to stick with as much hard science as possible, and the big problem was with material strength and tolerances. The available steel wasn\u0027t strong or consistent enough to handle the demands of heavy rocketry. Even in steam engines, the stuff was always developing hot spots and cracks. Different parts of pistons, cylinders and linkages expanded at differing rates from heat, resulting in rapid wear.\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking into the history of steam power, I learned that all the early engines used \u0022suction\u0022 rather than steam pressure. They\u0027d dump hot steam into the cylinder with the piston fully extended, and as the steam condensed, atmospheric pressure slowly pushed the piston down. And that was because their steel cylinders would fail under higher pressures. Plenty failed even using this negative pressure technique. Well, if it has trouble at 15psi, it sure isn\u0027t going to last as a rocket nozzle!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurbopumps would be even worse, as 19th century manufacturing tolerances didn\u0027t come anywhere close to what\u0027s required. AFAIK, before WWII no device more complex than a bullet could spin at turbopump speeds (30,000 rpm!) without tearing itself apart. The first gas turbine that produced more power than it took to overcome the friction losses of spinning it wasn\u0027t developed until 1903. The modern micrometer appeared around 1844, and the new, improved standard for super-precise machining became 1/1000th inch. There was a cool pic of a jet turbine weld on Reddit the other day. An aeronautics engineer said tolerance on those welds is 3/100,000ths. Nearly two full orders of magnitude tighter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, for the icing on the cake, look at how reactive LOX is, and consider how they could possibly control the stuff with Victorian tech. Victorian gaskets are natural rubber and leather and that stuff explodes with LOX. Silicone and fiberglass weren\u0027t even words yet. LOX fed by nitrogen-pressurized tanks I could believe, but that doesn\u0027t seem like enough thrust for liftoffs. On the bright side, they did have access to the hydrofluoric acid used to clean LOX tanks and pipes of all organic material before filling. Though I bet they\u0027d kill lots of techs while they figured out how to handle the nasty stuff in such large quantities. Teflon safety-suits and SCUBA weren\u0027t things yet, either. They\u0027d have to use brass deep-diving suits, plus a hose to carry the used air back outside. Those suits are almost no protection at all against HF spills, and will only protect them from fumes for a short time. So while they learn nearly every accident will be a fatal one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not saying you can\u0027t have an alternate history where such things are dealt with. I imagine a 20-year Manhattan Project-style all-out effort by a major power could have solved a bunch of these problems.

One of the things I do in the steampunk community is present at conventions on Victorian spacecraft. And, in my research for that topic, I found the the 19th Century\u0027s ideas of how they were going to get into space, both in scientific romances and in science, was NOT rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 1779, Erasmus Darwin, the famous grandfather of the more famous Charles, made a sketch of tanks of compressed inflamable air (hydrogen) and dephlogisticated air (oxygen) mixing in a chamber and being ignited to make a liquid fuel rocket. He understood the principals involved (that had been generally known for millennia) and understood that compressing (liquifing) the gas would make a better rocket but it would take until the end of the next century with the works of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky to put it all together into what we would recognize as a space craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn between, rockets sucked. People used them for fireworks. The military used them for signalling. They tried using them as artillery but that\u0027s where they really stunk. So much so that no one even made the leap that, if improved, they could take people into space. Even Verne, who imagined the technological steps necessary to take the submarines of his day to create Nemo\u0027s Nautilus, didn\u0027t consider rockets when taking his protagonists to the moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy far, the most common way that Victorians got into space, at least in the fiction of the day, was some variation of anti-gravity. Or, perhaps more accurately, non-gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on new discoveries in the fundamentals of light and electricity, it was not uncommon for scientific speculation to imagine that gravity was something similar. A wave or a ray travelling through space to act on other objects. So, if you were able to make an object opaque to gravity, that shadow would protect things behind that object from the effects of gravity, thus rendering it weightless. While the Cavorite sphere in H.G.Wells \u0022First Men in the Moon\u0022 is probably the most famous of these anti-gravity machines, I want to talk about a much earlier, and perhaps the first such presentation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 1847, John Leonard Riddell published a story titled \u0022Orrin Lindsay\u0027s Plan for Aerial Navigation.\u0022 He called his spacecraft the Electric Balloon and through an amalgam of steel and mercury plus an application of electromagnetism, his spherical ship became opaque to gravity and thus floated above the Earth. To direct the craft in one direction or another he would open a window, thus allowing a ray of gravity to enter the craft, act upon the inside, and thus pull the craft in that direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis story was ten pages long with five additional pages of footnotes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of the Victorian Era, Wells recognized that, were a sphere like Riddell\u0027s to be made suddenly opaque to gravity, it would already have the centripital force of the Earth\u0027s rotation and would be suddenly hurled into the sky. (Actually, it would be travelling tangentially to the Earth\u0027s rotation, 600mph in England, but would appear to leap into the sky at 150mph.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDo Not Give Up on Liquid Fueled Rockets\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222768062\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022115752\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221474487406\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022109836\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Peter Balholm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo not give up on liquid-fuel rockets!
