Like the sensation of the color blue or the sensation of a high pitched noise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that viewing the brain as a chemical-electrical computer (there is overwhelming scientific evidence after all that the brain is \u0022nothing but\u0022 this) can inform us of the nature of qualia. A quale (quale- singular form of qualia) you experience is thus the firing of certain synapses that exist only in your brain. Thus, by definition, qualia other sentient beings experience are different than yours, since it\u0027s a different brain. The sensation of \u0022blueness\u0022 doesn\u0027t have any physical meaning outside of this process that creates it. So a qualia is a process unique to each being that experiences it. This is enough to make the comparison of qualia invalid IMO, but if you want to go even further, you could point out that the brains of all sentient beings are all wired very differently from each other, so not only is a different instance of a sensory process going on when each sentient being views a certain color, but a different configuration of neurons is involved as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, we even know for a fact that sensory perception can involve vastly different processes for different people. There are people who \u0022suffer\u0022 from synthesia, which is a sensory phenomenon where an individual experiences cross-overs between the sensory systems, like being able to \u0022taste\u0022 colors or \u0022feel\u0022 sounds. (Studies of mice have even suggested that they have evolved synthesia and make deliberate use of it, experiencing a sensation dubbed \u0022smound\u0022 that is a mix of olfaction and auditory perception.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I think that, just in the inherent way that qualia are produced and defined, as being a specific process in a specific sentient being, it is invalid to compare them.

So for hunter-gatherer humans, it would make sense that the red in red berries is quite distinct from background green as opposed to blue or yellow for instance. Our human ancestors (or any animal reliant on red fruits) that didn\u0027t have the gene that wired the brain to distinguish red from green as effectively would be outcompeted by their high green-red contrast peers, resulting in reduced frequencies and eventually extinction of the low contrast green-red allele in the gene-pool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, since current human society is no longer exposed to these selective pressures, new low green-red contrast alleles may have been introduced in the human gene-pool through mutation and we\u0027d never know. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, color perception in the brain may be preserved between individuals due to optimisation through natural selection over the course of millions of years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T00:49:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 12:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yakuzi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T00:29:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook at the opponent process - you\u0027ll know then that each \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopsin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ephotopsin\u003C/a\u003E is assigned the same in everyone to each \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ES, M and L cones\u003C/a\u003E (respectively blue, green, and yellow-green), and our \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvocellular_cell\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eparvocellular cells\u003C/a\u003E (wait, parvo cell cell ?) knows which one is signal from S, M or L cone cells.
