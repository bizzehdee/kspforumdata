However, I might argue that since which colors are which is learned during development (and all the associations with each color as well), it might be entirely meaningless whether your 450nm registers the same in your brain as my 560nm. In fact, I might hazard to guess that no one sees colors exactly the same way - as far as the interaction between the eyeballs and the brain goes, the red you see might be a totally alien color to everyone else, and someone else\u0027s red might not make any sense to you. \n\nUltimately, I think this problem just tries to draw some kind of line between how your brain receives a piece of information and how it processes it, which might not be separable processes at all. Human brains share a good deal of structure in common, but it\u0027s foolish to assume they\u0027re all exactly the same in the way they handle sensory stimuli - that much, at least, we can see."},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T14:05:22Z","Content":"I know that some people do see different colors than other people (i.e. my orange could be your blue), but i do not see why this matters because even though we see colors differently, we can agree that grass is green and the sky is blue, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T14:05:27Z","Content":"More philosophical than biological at this point.

Like the sensation of the color blue or the sensation of a high pitched noise.\n\nI believe that viewing the brain as a chemical-electrical computer (there is overwhelming scientific evidence after all that the brain is \u0022nothing but\u0022 this) can inform us of the nature of qualia. A quale (quale- singular form of qualia) you experience is thus the firing of certain synapses that exist only in your brain. Thus, by definition, qualia other sentient beings experience are different than yours, since it\u0027s a different brain. The sensation of \u0022blueness\u0022 doesn\u0027t have any physical meaning outside of this process that creates it. So a qualia is a process unique to each being that experiences it. This is enough to make the comparison of qualia invalid IMO, but if you want to go even further, you could point out that the brains of all sentient beings are all wired very differently from each other, so not only is a different instance of a sensory process going on when each sentient being views a certain color, but a different configuration of neurons is involved as well.\n\nHeck, we even know for a fact that sensory perception can involve vastly different processes for different people. There are people who \u0022suffer\u0022 from synthesia, which is a sensory phenomenon where an individual experiences cross-overs between the sensory systems, like being able to \u0022taste\u0022 colors or \u0022feel\u0022 sounds. (Studies of mice have even suggested that they have evolved synthesia and make deliberate use of it, experiencing a sensation dubbed \u0022smound\u0022 that is a mix of olfaction and auditory perception.)\n\nAnyway, I think that, just in the inherent way that qualia are produced and defined, as being a specific process in a specific sentient being, it is invalid to compare them. Apples and oranges. And then add on that sentient beings all have differently-wired brains, it just makes trying to compare them even more invalid.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T14:56:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 02:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T18:50:41Z","Content":"Wavelengths.

Say, a light with maximum on 490 nm, it\u0027s going to be said by some as blue - green while the rest as blue - yellow (or even, green - yellow, but that\u0027s not quite the area...)\n\nRegarding dress... That\u0027s related to how our eye do color mixing - there\u0027s trichromacy / additive mixing ([http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichromacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichromacy) ) and subtractive, or oppenent mixing ([http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent_process](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent_process)). Both are somewhat correct - there they say the reality is more complicated and a citation follows. Dresses again, it\u0027s basically eye trick - the fact that human perception on colors is also determined by the dominant background (luminance) one sees. I saw it blue black. I tried to close the bright background, and I think I\u0027ve seen it slightly more yellow and very light blue... The actual color are somewhat olive green and halfway light blue, hence why it\u0027s among those borderline colors.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T23:50:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 11:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YNM**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T23:49:30Z","Content":"Some people would see a certain wavelength as blue, others red.

If someone else sees what everyone calls green as what I call blue, but has learned to call it green, how would you ever find out?

Neither of those things is something we can imagine, yet it is very possible the same or similar tools in the brain are used to signify X or Y. Maybe what we experience as red in our brain is the same a bat experiences when he blips his sound off of a surface that is slightly gritty and damp. Maybe the same neurological impulses that signify a positive response to your favourite meal signify a tasty (but to you disgusting) bug for a gecko.

So for hunter-gatherer humans, it would make sense that the red in red berries is quite distinct from background green as opposed to blue or yellow for instance. Our human ancestors (or any animal reliant on red fruits) that didn\u0027t have the gene that wired the brain to distinguish red from green as effectively would be outcompeted by their high green-red contrast peers, resulting in reduced frequencies and eventually extinction of the low contrast green-red allele in the gene-pool.\n\nHowever, since current human society is no longer exposed to these selective pressures, new low green-red contrast alleles may have been introduced in the human gene-pool through mutation and we\u0027d never know. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nStill, color perception in the brain may be preserved between individuals due to optimisation through natural selection over the course of millions of years.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T00:49:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 12:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yakuzi**"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T00:29:50Z","Content":"Look at the opponent process - you\u0027ll know then that each [photopsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopsin) is assigned the same in everyone to each [S, M and L cones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell) (respectively blue, green, and yellow-green), and our [parvocellular cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvocellular_cell) (wait, parvo cell cell ?) knows which one is signal from S, M or L cone cells.
