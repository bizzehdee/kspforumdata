Thats plenty of science already. By visiting the other bodies with the 4 standard instruments, there should be plenty of science floating around. Also I have a surface laser zapping spectrometer analyser thingy from who knows what mod, gas chromatograph and liquid chromatograph mass spectrometers from the interstellar mod. A geiger counter that looks like it comes from AIES or FASA. Plenty of opportunity for science there. To have something that HAS to come back that are not kerbals and to make the return mission in any case somewhat difficult, I proposed to use the heavy science parts that give far less science on transmission anyway. Also it makes sense to return them because all the other instruments just measure something that can be transmitted just as well. You dont need to return a thermometer or a spectrum, transmitting it is reasonable. Science jr and goo on the other hand, do not have any analysing equipment. They have just a target substance that is exposed to its environment.
