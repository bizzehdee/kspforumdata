My cable modem keeps losing contact with my provider. Its been unstable since New Years. Ive no idea how old it is. I first thought this to be internet outages on provider side. Now im not sure. My neighbor uses the same provider i do and his internet he says is currently up. Mine as i sit here is still indicating offline. Power light is solid, DS/US light is blinking at 1 pulse per second, Online light is off. 2.4G and 5G lights are solid. Tel1 and Tel2, MoCA and Battery lights are off.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanyone have any idea what might be going on? Also when it DOES connect it tends to be stable and when i check data rates via my phone they are 95% of the time what im expecting to see. Sometimes they are slower but that is not frequent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nagain my cable modems lights are in the state described at the time of posting. I fully expect at some point be it 10 minutes or an hour or 96 hours to see my modem reestablish contact. But is this thing going bad?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n190701162024\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbtw it started this episode at 1841\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nupdate: 2 hours 6 minutes no improvement.

The last 2-3 days we have been under a hard freeze warning. In my area we dont normally drop into the 20s let alone the teens and at 0600 when my neighbor went to work he was showing 17\u00B0f and me i was showing 19\u00B0f. Im going to keep an eye on this as the week goes on but i have my cable account data ready should i need it. Im hoping its like your situation. The moment im forced to change modems i lose one part of my life my deceased friend and brother from another had setup way back when and frankly as stupid as it sounds i dont want to lose what he set up for me.
