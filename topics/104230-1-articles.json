The rocket is coming down fairly fast and actually throttles up shortly before touchdown. That\u0027s likely on purpose, too - they do an early landing burn at minimum throttle which is intentionally a little bit too weak to slow the vehicle down in time, and then start the real \u0022suicide burn\u0022 only a few meters above the ground by throttling up when the margin of error is minimized. Gives them extra time too if the engine fails to start to try and ignite some of the other engines in an emergency landing abort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVertical velocity was not an issue in this landing, horizontal velocity was - potentially due to oversteering with laggy controls.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T12:20:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 12:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T12:20:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhere\u0027s this middle-of-nowhere-on-solid-ground that you speak of?\u003Cp\u003EVisualize in your head the flight trajectory of the rocket and the geographic location of the launch site, and then think about your question again... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, fine.
