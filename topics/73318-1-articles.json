And I\u0027ve gotten a design that should work (after tweaking it a bit after the last test flight it should be able to establish orbit) but I want to refine its tail end, because the way I have my plane constructed I end up with my engines getting destroyed during landing. (and during take off I have to either be very careful pitching up or waiting until the end of the runway gives me clearance) Even coming in as slow as I can without losing control of the plane ends up with the engines colliding into the ground. The rest of the plane is fine, but the entire engine assembly just goes kablooey. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did manage to land it once, fully intact, but that required me pointing my plane at the largest, flattest area I could fine and then giving myself a side view so I could refine my AOA as I got closer and closer to the ground. And while I could just maintain that angle (which I tried on the next two flights), there its literally zero wiggle room. And while I trust in my skills as a pilot to nail that angle every time, I don\u0027t like that a plane is locked to a single angle for landing, with any other angle resulting in some kind of rapid dis-assembly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here\u0027s my plane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/579023082906277323/B8AAE28BDA58C69A5626538C2B86B892A3E50E1D/\u0022 alt=\u0022B8AAE28BDA58C69A5626538C2B86B892A3E50E1D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor those that know of B9 and how its wings work, don\u0027t worry about the larger set of stabilizer wings i put my control surfaces on. I turned off that ones control surfaces so I could use it as a painless base wing. I didn\u0027t like trying to piece together the other bits into something that looked good provided my ample space for the control surfaces I needed). \u003Cp\u003E Also, the reason for the second of wings closer to the front is due to the nature of what I want my SSTO to do (carry both a sizable crew and cargo to orbit rather than one or the other). Without something in the front I can\u0027t get enough lift to get my plane off the ground without letting run off the runway, and when landing I almost always can\u0027t get my nose up without them). The large amount of RCS i\u0027m carrying is intended to be used as a de-orbiting measure, both in emergency and in general. As I refine the plane more and figure out its max payload, I\u0027ll probably end up removing a lot of it, or at least minimizing it to just the B9 tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat could I do to prevent this? I\u0027ve thought about lowering my rear landing gear, but I\u0027m unsure on whether the distance between the gears will keep my plane from wobbling as it speeds off down the runway. (That and rule of cool states that the gears look better at the height they\u0027re at now).

It takes some fiddling, but you can balance the different heights with how far you move the tails aft, so your trail strike problem is mitigated. You can also try giving the wheels some additional clearance using cubic struts (lowest drag and mass, highest part count), regular girders (ludicrously heavy and draggy, lowest part count) or hardpoints (reasonably low drag, low mass, medium part count).

And alas, it flies pretty well too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter examining what all I wanted to do with this playthrough, I realized that I\u0027d be better off designating simple rockets for substantial payload delivery, and instead leave my SSTO (which I\u0027ve dubbed the Velocity) for resupply and crew rotation. (I may eventually utilize it on a Jool mission, but considering I haven\u0027t even gone interplanetary in my entire time playing this game, thats a long way off). So with that in mind, I was able to shorten the cargo bay, which I can now interchange with one or two crew tanks (or perhaps command seats if I feel silly) with minimal effect on performance.

I ended up throwing out the entire engine block entirely and restarting from scratch, which eventually necessitated some science gathering after realizing I wasn\u0027t satisfied with the engines I had. Did the same with the wings, which became easier with the shortened payload expectations. And no tail strikes below 10* pitch, which gives me a comfortable margin, so that issue is gone now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually flying the thing is pretty good for what it is. I\u0027m still running it through high altitude tests to see how well it does (which is more just an in-case option, as at these altitudes I\u0027m either on my rocket stage or descending from orbit), but otherwise as long as I avoid my tendency to just want to land it straight down (i\u0027m impatient \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) I can land quite smoothly, especially now that I can maintain my pitch at low speeds. Found out after a rather disastrous test run (Talking large scale stall from 30km up straight down to surface impact) that my CM does drift rear of my CL just as I run out of fuel. My solution thus far is to just move everything I have left forward prior to reentry, which the VAB tells me should work out fine just fine. Is there a way to have this done automatically, besides TAC Fuel Balancer? That\u0027d be nice, as my idea regarding fuel lines didn\u0027t do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as always, I still want to optimize. So here\u0027s a bunch of pictures for you guys to criticize. I am having an issue with my rocket engines (From Space Shuttle Engines), where the gimbaling and trim tends to wig my plane out of wack, particularly in space. I can compensate for it (as I set the trim speed for both down to 0. Even on a regular rocket they gimbal way too fast, so I did this first thing), but I\u0027m still trying to find settings for them that lets me turn my ship about without having the gimbals get stuck somewhere, thus making the ship go all wacko. I have considered just turning gimbal off (I know have to keep Trim on to maintain the angle I have them set for) but then again, gimbals are always nice for that little extra maneuverability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also trying to weave around the intricacies of reentry. Basic reentry isn\u0027t an issue, and actually I\u0027ve been having problems NOT descending in such a way that doesn\u0027t produce reentry heating (lowest I\u0027ve gone is 8k). While I\u0027m sure that\u0027s actually an awesome thing, it is kind of disappointing. It looks neat. But even so, I can\u0027t decide if I want to just accept that or find an angle to go for that gives me that classic harrowing reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also curious about the B9 control surfaces, and specifically the settings I should go for on them. Right now I have them set to default, but I\u0027m wondering if different settings might provide some benefit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, pictures!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/R0igp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Right now with your current settings you have to many control surfaces doing to much. This will lead to some stability issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest setting your outter most control surfaces as ailerons and thus only control roll. Then set your inner most ones as elevators, and thus set it for pitch. The ones between the two, I would set for both roll and pitch. Your vertical stabilizer I would set for yaw and only yaw. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will give your control surfaces a realistic response and your aircraft will work a bit better because of it. Other than that I think your RCS thrusters are set sideways, they go length wise not vertically, but they should work either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaytheAerospace","CreatedById":108355,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T22:15:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe ones between the two, I would set for both roll and pitch.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m generally not a fan of sharing pitch and roll control surfaces.

They could just be used for pitch authority but then you may have to much pitch, they are to small to really be worth anything as flaps or spoilers. And if they are set as ailerons for roll and just roll they will give the craft a stupid fast roll rate which really isnt needed for a SSTO that isn\u0027t a combat vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T22:41:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay wow that makes this thing SOOO much more stable.
