It\u0027s essentially a 10x OPM system: Moho, Eve, Kerbin, Duna, Dres, Jool, Sarnus, Urlum, Neidon, and Plock. But I\u0027ve changed some of their relative sizes, rearranged and swapped some moons, added moons from JNSQ to the gas giants, and replaced Eve, Mun, Dres, and Ike with their JNSQ counterparts for aesthetic reasons. I may replace more of them, but I\u0027ll be keeping Kerbin as is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I just realized I have no idea if career mode contracts will still make sense under an arbitrary system.
