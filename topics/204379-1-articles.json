Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same for everyone but for me I need to fly by gilly, duna, mun, and eve in one rocket. I first flew by mun, then I was going to fly by eve,\u00A0then gilly\u00A0and finally duna. When flying by mun\u00A0I started to orbit the sun and my only thought was to get to eve\u00A0from there. Okay so fly by mun is done, check.\u00A0Put my maneuver\u00A0up,\u00A0then messed around with it to get an encounter with eve. I got one and all I had to do was wait. Time warping to make things faster, suddenly fly by mun showed up as uncompleted but how come? I flew by the mun already. This isn\u2019t really a big deal though since I could fly by\u00A0mun last. But then the same thing happened when fly by gilly and fly by eve was finished,\u00A0both showed up as uncompleted as soon as I started to orbit the sun and\u00A0then time warping\u00A0a bit!
