If nothing\u0027s changed, the biggest framerate guzzler is usually scatterer\u0027s water shader. I\u0027ve always thought it\u0027d be nice if KS3P, Scatterer, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E would get combined into a joint mod. KS3P adds in the stock Unity post-process shaders that SQUAD pulled out, and Scatterer is the KSP version of a Unity port of Proland.\n\n[@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/) This reminds me: have you checked out Scrawk\u0027s new/old/revised ocean shader to see if it performs better?
