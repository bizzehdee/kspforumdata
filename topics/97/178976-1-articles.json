How do I make that work?\u00A0 So far, mine haven\u0027t\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027d also like to do the opposite, if I have a single node that causes 2 or 3 things to ALL happen, can I branch to all three?\u00A0 (maybe setting appropriate Node Priority in the Options at that branch?)\u00A0 So far, the only way I can make it work is to string them all sequentially, but was thinking I shouldn\u0027t have to do this.\u00A0 I\u0027d like to see a diagram of how one node can trigger 3 things, then reform to continue along down a single node path.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSimilar to the above, I\u0027d like to see the same thing, only instead of trigger all 3 things, it maybe only triggers one or two of the three based on a test, then reforms to continue\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhile on the topic of nodes...\u00A0 using \u0022Catch All\u0022 vs. \u0022Sequential\u0022 examples would be helpful.\u00A0 IN PARTICULAR!!!\u00A0 Suppose I have a long-ish overall mission thread that\u0027s\u00A0taking me from beginning to end.\u00A0 I\u0027d like to have a \u0022Catch All\u0022 node sitting out there that could fire at any point along the main mission string.\u00A0 So far, when I\u0027ve tried to create something like this, the \u0022Catch All\u0022 node fires, but then doesn\u0027t take me back to the main mission string?\u00A0 What is the proper structure for creating this?\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWith the possible exception of the very first node that spawns multiple vehicles...\u00A0 I don\u0027t fully understand the difference between two or three separate nodes as opposed to having those nodes all docked together?\u00A0 I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a difference, I\u0027m just not grasping it.\u00A0 Is it like a logical \u0022AND\u0022 so all of the conditions must be met for the overall node to return True?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor me, the \u0022Dialog Node\u0022 will always popup a window for the user.\u00A0 The \u0022Message Node\u0022 and the nodes with the option to display a message,\u00A0do not display anything on screen for me.\u00A0 It just adds a message item to the log of messages and would force a user to have to go over and click to open.\u00A0 I\u0027d like to have messages appear on screen, but I don\u0027t always want a picture of Gene accompanying it.\u00A0Do I have a setting in my base game options to repress the messages from appearing that I forgot about?\u00A0 If so, I need some messages to appear regardless of what the user may have\u00A0in their options for this.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow do I add a \u0022Catch All\u0022 node (perhaps repeatable?) to detect a craft has landed, but first!\u00A0 \u00A0AT LEAST checks to make sure the target craft\u00A0has left the ground at the start of the mission?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIs there any way to select a picture from the Banner directory to appear with a message, dialog, or point change node?\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure when to use a built-in node message vs. a standalone message or dialog message node?\u00A0 Seems like 3 ways to do the same thing, although at least the dialog is a forced message popup.\u00A0 I\u0027d like to have a forced popup message without a picture of \u0022Gene\u0022... I\u0027d also like to have popup messages that can display an image I put in the banners folder. \u00A0I\u0027d also like to be able to provide my own pictures for my own instructors (with instructor names that I create) to appear.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn the Options section for node, I think I understand how the \u0022Node Order\u0022 thing works, but not exactly sure...\u00A0 I would presume things at the top of the list process first?\u00A0 So maybe if I have a mission ending event (like demise of a craft or kerbal) I put that up there at the top so something like a message related to being out of fuel doesn\u0027t fire first?\u00A0 In which case, a Global setting for node priority might be helpful?\u00A0 Is there one?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf I have specific flags that I created for a mission, how do I store those with the Mission so others can use them?\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLikewise, there\u0027s a directory for the craft(s) the players will need for the mission, but I don\u0027t see anything for any flags that may be associated with the craft?\u00A0 Where does the Mission Builder read it\u0027s flags from?\u00A0 ...the regular game data folder?\u00A0 I guess craft flags are a \u0022Required Mod\u0022 that needs to be installed then?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI notice 2 options for including craft in a mission...\u00A0 Player Builds Craft in the mission or the Designer of the Mission provides it.\u00A0 I can see what seems to be a 3rd unwritten option which is...\u00A0 the player may copy any designs they want into the appropriate Mission/Craft folders to be able to load into the mission when the time comes for a player to build a craft in the mission.\u00A0 Assuming the craft meets all the mission requirements, it should be useable in the missions? ...anyone see any problem with this?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI was\u00A0disappointed that I could not limit or set a given part\u0027s parameter.\u00A0 There only seem to be \u0022Available Parts\u0022 and \u0022Required Parts\u0022 as options.\u00A0 I can\u0027t for instance, limit the thrust of a booster to 20% UNLESS...\u00A0 As the designer of the mission, I build that particular craft and force the player to use it.\u00A0 Unless I\u0027m missing something?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlternatively, there seems to be no way to give the player a group of parts or a\u00A0slightly dysfunctional craft to start with...\u00A0\u00A0and then ask them to repair or\u00A0add to it?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt seems that I can say which parts are \u0022Available\u0022 or \u0022Required Parts\u0022 but I can\u0027t say how many?\u00A0 Like you can only use 1 booster, or you are required to build a 4-engine craft...\u00A0 and here are the engines you have to choose from.\u00A0 There may be 5 or 6\u00A0types of engines to choose from... but you can only use 4 of any combination of them in the final craft design.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe following\u00A0bullets\u00A0are the start of\u00A0my \u0022Would be Nice to Have\u0022 list:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAs my mission structures began to grow in complexity, I was looking for a \u0022Designer Comment\u0022 textbox to drop on the working area and I wanted to draw visual boxes around certain things (or maybe apply a color or shade\u00A0to the\u00A0underlying\u00A0boxes of the\u00A0mission design grid?)\u00A0so I could label sections of the mission design work area.\u00A0 Like:\u00A0 \u0022this\u00A0area is where all my altitude tests are\u0022\u00A0 or maybe a \u0022Node Group\u0022 type thing?\u00A0 ...maybe associated with a clickable \u0022Table of Contents\u0022 sort of thing in the Mission Builder work area so I can jump to that off screen\u00A0area?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nManaging the text dialog was a real chore!\u00A0 The interface is\u00A0NOT a very friendly storyboard environment.\u00A0 Editing long-ish text in those tiny node parameter input boxes is a real pain.\u00A0 Alternatively, a textbox object that could be sized on the mission design area to hold text and then link to a node for a description reference would be extremely helpful!\u00A0 If such a thing could hold pictures to reference that could popup along with the text, that would just\u00A0be wonderful!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-15T18:17:05Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2018 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by XLjedi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
