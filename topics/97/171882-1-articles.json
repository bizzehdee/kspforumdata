For people that are going to say \u201Cget a pc\u201D \u201Cor why don\u2019t you buy a pc?\u201D. I had a pc but it not functional anymore and I do not want to spend over $1000 to get a computer that works as good as my Xbox one x. So all I\u2019m asking is will this be out for consoles.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devinous","CreatedById":185048,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-23T17:38:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also like to know if this is going to happen or at least when they plan on updating to more current versions,\u00A0 however they have our money now and they will spend it on making more PC stuff,\u00A0 and most likely ignoring all that is console.\u00A0 \u00A0I have spent the last several months asking these questions on various forums and only the trolls will speak up.\u00A0 \u00A0Not a peep out of the Squad,\u00A0 and that is why I made the above statement and fell that they only pushed it to the console for the extra revenue to enhance the PC version.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore proof is the lack of a response to your question,\u00A0 I see you posted this in March and here it is May and nada.\u00A0 At the very least they could at least make an announcement,\u00A0 even if it was to say that we have no plans on doing anything more with console so please stop asking...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess the lesson to learn here is to avoid spending any future cash on anything with \u0022Squad\u0022 on the box and to pass this along to anyone that has a console!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mako","CreatedById":69375,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-24T03:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trouble with asking for an answer is that they might not even have an answer. Maybe they want to update\u00A0the console versions to be in parity (as much as possible, at least)\u00A0with the PC versions, but don\u0027t know if they\u0027ll be able to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould they tell you yes, and then fail to deliver? Should they tell you no, and upset you that way instead? Or\u00A0should they remain silent, do what they can, and see what happens?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no good answer if they can\u0027t guarantee an outcome, and my bet is that the only thing they can guarantee is that they won\u0027t do more work. That would be very easy for them to deliver on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot having an answer or even any idea or hint about future plans is pretty frustrating. As a PC player, I\u0027m frustrated I don\u0027t have any idea about the future of KSP; I can only imagine how console players feel. The only thing I can say is: if you want development to continue, no news is good news.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only product Squad works on is KSP, and they don\u0027t even own it now. They no longer have a product to sell directly.\u00A0So if Squad wants to keep making money, it\u0027s in their best interest their keep working on KSP. That\u0027s about the most hope I can offer. And just going by track record for PC or console, I suspect it\u0027s much more than Squad will offer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-25T20:23:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Making History Discussion\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
