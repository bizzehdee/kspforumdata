When I take any\u00A0mission that has a \u0022maintain stability for ten seconds\u0022 parameter, I get credit for the maintaining stability every time the vessel does it throughout the flight. That means if I have, for example, 3 active missions with that parameter, I get contract complete messages every time my vessel is stable throughout the flight. This could literally occur 10 plus times during a single mission. Multiply that by 3 active mission and you have 30 contract complete messages in you message log even though you haven\u0027t actually maintained stabilty for the active mission. You have only maintained stability generally ie (waiting for an orbit burn, coming out of a Holiman transfer, etc).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last mission I did was a satellite insertion mission and I had 20 plus \u0022Contract Complete maintain stability for ten seconds\u0022 messages in my message log.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-12T03:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/18267\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/18267\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-28T01:59:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFixed in KSP 1.4.3 and Making History 1.2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
