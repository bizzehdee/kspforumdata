Theoretically any mission you make, even one including a picture you took of your own cat as a mission banner, would be copyrighted by Take Two. \u00A0 So any form of distributing anything from the mission builder is in violation of the EULA or some other type of license?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-28T18:17:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2018 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by klesh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded last paragraph.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-29T15:06:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso...
