I have the latest Mechjeb version installed and it works fine in Sandbox. If I build a mission where I allow the player to build a rocket and the player adds the Mechjeb module, I get fully Mechjeb functionality. However, if I instead build a mission where I pre-build a vessel for the mission and add a Mechjeb module as part of that pre-build, the Mechjeb has only the basic functionality as if I was playing the Career mode and hadn\u0027t unlocked any of the upgraded Mechjebs and instead was at the first science box on the flowchart when Mechjeb is first available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there some way to address this in the mission builder to get the full Mechjeb functionality? Or is there a hacked Mechjeb that has full functionality right at the start?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-14T09:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might want to wait until MechJeb is actually 1.4.1 compatible...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut until then, reporting such issues in the mod thread will help the author become aware of such issues, so they can be fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
