Here\u0027s why I think this...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole challenge system was based on an incorrect assumption: That many players wanted to spend time a lot of time making challenges\u00A0and that other players wanted to play these challenges.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s true that there was a small and regular\u00A0group of players taking\u00A0part in the written challenges that players set on this forum, but this is a small percentage of the playerbase. Most other players seemingly engaged in their career game, or building SSTOs, or designing\u00A0aircraft, or planning a sandbox mission to Eve and back. I see little sign of this changing with the arrival of MH;\u00A0people are happily continuing doing the same as before rather than using the MH challenge system, just being somewhat fed-up with the bugs introduced and the mods\u00A0outdated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat would have been better is integration with the main game. The\u00A0challenge system would have made an excellent contract design tool, especially with the addition of\u00A0allowing contracts to be completed in sandbox and science modes. This would have made the functionality of interest to a much wider audience. The ability to deploy a launchsite on other bodies in sandbox and late career games would have been appreciated by many too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo pick challenges as the thing to give\u00A0KSP players just\u00A0seems odd. There has been many enhancement suggestions over the years but never this. For a much simpler DLC, another bunch of planets and the parts to reach them would have been easy to do and appreciated by many. A bigger challenge, but something that would have been very well received, would have been the\u00A0much-asked-for multiplayer mode of some kind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there are the new parts: Another miss. There is nothing new or particulalrly useful in the parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engines are meh and don\u0027t fill any new niche, like an expansion\u00A0to the groups of solid, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002BO, nuke and ion.

The LEM-alike capsule is very un-Kerbal and should have been implemented as a set of parts. The KV capsules look half-finished and have little practical use.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new tanks are just more tanks but lacking\u00A0the adapters that the other sizes have. It is now very difficult to tell the tank diameter and volume in\u00A0the parts list because all the pictures are similar. Without reading the description (and even then the diameter is not stated)\u00A0it\u0027s not possible to tell from the parts list whether a tall tank is 360, 810, 2880 or 23040 units of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, considering all the effort that went into launching KSP into the DLC world, MH/1.4 delivered very little that has been well received.
