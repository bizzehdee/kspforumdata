It\u0027s been\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealright\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0though I\u0027d be lying if I didn\u0027t say there were some issues.\u00A0 Here are my thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAsteroid Redirection: You can spawn asteroids with the Spawn Asteroid node. \u003Cem\u003EHowever, once you\u0027ve spawned them you can\u0027t really\u00A0do\u00A0anything with them.\u003C/em\u003E There\u0027s no way to require a ship to dock with them (they don\u0027t technically count as vessels), there\u0027s no \u0022grab object\u0022 node, there\u0027s no \u0022move asteroid to x orbit\u0022 node. This is really disappointing since a very specific Asteroid Redirect Mission was the first thing I attempted in the mission builder after getting my bearings.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u0022Dialog\u0022 Boxes: First of all, a nitpick: \u0022PR Kerman\u0022 should be \u0022Walt Kerman.\u0022 Second, it would be nice to have the dialog box show an astronaut of any of the four space suits (Veteran/Normal, Vintage/Normal) of any gender. Or a tourist. Or female scientists and engineers. Third, and most important: it\u0027s not really a \u0022dialogue\u0022 if there\u0027s just a rant from a single Kerbal and then a single \u0022OK\u0022 button to close the box. There should be multiple dialogue choices that the mission player can choose that might affect the rest of the mission.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSolar Orbit: Without using maneuver nodes (and even then it\u0027s finicky), it is impossible to set high orbits above the Sun\u00A0for spacecrafts, space stations, and asteroids. The maximum distance allowed by the semimajoraxis slider and number box is below the orbit of Moho, something like 0.002 AU.\u00A0This makes conventional ARM or some deep space rescue mission very difficult to set up. You can not zoom out enough to set this up either, and children bodies (planets around stars or moons around planets) are not plotted in the graphic action plane.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGlimmeroids are supposed to be called \u0022Magic Boulders,\u0022 as their implementation in 1.1 or so was a callback to an old easter egg of the same name. Also, there should be more types of asteroid than just the one gray texture, there is at least one more reddish-brown texture.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere are a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of problems with the default historical missions. At this point though I\u0027m not sure how much of it is just based upon lack of polish and gameplay testing for the missions and how much of it is fundamental limitations of the editor. Misspelled or awkward text, reverse completion order, *precious loads of goo*, and so on.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhy not let the player choose to launch as many vessels as they want for the mission as an option? If you wanted to use the Mission Builder for, say, the Jool Five Challenge, it would be unreasonable not to allow orbital assembly. On a similar note, the player should be able to optionally choose the name of the ship.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWernher (shouldn\u0027t it be Gene, the Mission Control guy?) von Kerman in the Mission Builder tutorial alludes to a third tutorial which seems to be missing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNow that we have this sort of programmable mission building u.i., maybe we can have scratch-style programmable flight computers for space probes?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhy partition it off from sandbox and career mode? It would be amazing to have missions come in through the mission control center that you would get funds and reputation for. Or even as a way of planning out missions in sandbox and career.\u00A0You could add a setting to the mission builder that disables universe-scale changes like funds, universal time, etc and marks it as a \u0022Career Mode Mission.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe vessel part explosions and failures could be an interesting hard mode setting for sandbox--\u003Cem\u003Eas long as it\u0027s optional!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBuying new launch sites on Kerbin would also be an interesting mechanic for career mode. You could spend funds to update them through each of the launchpad levels.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEDIT: THE NEXT DAY: There is no way to display dialogue boxes of information in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, which may be where you need exposition delivered through witty one-liners the most!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission builder has so much potential to be great. But it isn\u0027t\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0there yet. It\u0027s mostly functional, it\u0027s decent, but it\u0027s not\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Egreat\u003C/em\u003E. Some of the features I\u0027ve suggested are pretty major things that would classify as \u0022updates\u0022 to the whole Making History DLC (or even future KSP DLC or Updates), but some of them are more like what you could put in a Making History fix patch, like the asteroid redirect mission and higher solar orbits. The main failing of the Mission Builder is that its limitations seem to come from a lack of imagination of what this system could do and what mission authors may want players to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, a few thoughts on the new parts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe center of mass for many of the new pods is far too low. For the spherical pods and the MEM it looks like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E is near the bottom attachment point. If your reasoning for the spherical pods is \u0022well it\u0027s to keep it pointed the right way during reentry\u0022 then that\u0027s the wrong answer--that\u0027s the point of conical pods.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe MEM would need to be completely filled with fuel to hold the amount of fuel that it does.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMany pod IVAs have the ability to double click on windows to get a closer view of the window. This feature is absent in the new pods. It\u0027s not the end of the world,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eexcept for the MEM\u003C/em\u003E. The way the real Lunar Module was designed, the astronaut had to lean right up against the little window. In order for the MEM IVA to be usable for internal-view flight, you need to set up the double-click window setting so that you can look closely. This should also be enabled for the windows on the Gemini-like pod and the Mk1-3.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNo soyuz spacecraft parts?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere is a part model switching feature now. Why not use it to keep the old parts in the game (neither removing them entirely nor keeping them hidden away), since some people (myself included) prefer them to the new ones?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-14T13:43:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2018 01:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-14T01:35:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve only been fighting the mission editor for a few minutes and I\u0027ve already found a bug.

It might look primitive but it\u0027s amazingly effective. When Victor Belenko defected and landed his MiG 25 Foxbat in Japan, the jet was of course torn apart by Americans who were appalled over how primitive it was. From what I understood, after the collapse of the cold war, they found out that many of the \u0022primitive\u0022 features were well thought out. Lots of stainless steel instead of exotic metals, it was apparently very heat resistant and easy to handle in the field. Radar electronics working with vacuum tubes had more to do with being EMP resistant than the state of Russian electronics, and so on. The Vostok design seems to fit right in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaa253","CreatedById":68628,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-15T10:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223320315\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172214\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221520988930\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002236077\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 14/03/2018 at 11:55 AM, GregroxMun said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy partition it off from sandbox and career mode?
