Rockets which formerly required fins were making orbit without fins. Rockets were MORE stable than they should be. The reason was increased part drag on the engines due to a programming bug, which makes rockets unduly stable but also makes drag losses skyrocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-19T18:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup, like wot he said.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Delbrutis","CreatedById":144613,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-20T02:22:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223325730\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221521325167\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113764\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Foxster\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/17/2018 at 3:19 PM, Foxster said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI seemed to be getting rockets to orbit without the usual fins.
