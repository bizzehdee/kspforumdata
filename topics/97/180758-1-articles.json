The Skiff having a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 19.1 as it is now used to be less heavy so I could use plenty to get the required thrust, now when I do use them I cut the Delta-V budget on the way up so much that I could use many alternative engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe skipper is a very good example you gave there, adding to that the Skipper has a Atmospheric \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of 280 vs 265 on the Skiff. So by all means, skipper engines can be throttled sooner on the ascent curve compared to Skiffs while having more thrust per mass. So what is the Skiff good for I wonder if it\u0027s intended application is tackled by a pre v0.90 stock engine?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause of what I said the buffed skiff engine is kind of out line because the Skiff is a upper stage engine. In theory, any rocket using upper stage skipper engines will do better. I wouldn\u0027t compare to a Rhino directly since it\u0027s primarily a vacuum or interplanetary stage engine only while the Skiff or Skipper can be upper stage engines. As for the aerospike, it\u0027s still a atmospheric/vacuum optimized engine that has the best \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E range throughout a flight profile. To my humble opinion, the aerospike is a case in and of itself. On eve it is a winner and proper assist engine, especially useful if you light aerospikes within eve\u0027s atmosphere all the way to orbit without staging them. This allows to make proper use of the engine stats as a aerospike is put to best use if operated throughout the ascent entirely. When not on Eve aerospikes nearly never win the race, albeit on space planes having them. Because of a aerospike lower thrust to cross section and having no gimbal you need quite a few \u002B extra control surfaces or reaction mass/wheels that would add dry mass to take with you. On space planes using wings you need less thrust and thus less aerospike engines. In that case the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O is put to best use when using a aerospike. However, who would want to build a aerospike space plane when you got a better alternative, jet engines. In case of another aerospike application, it should make the furthest reaching rocket space plane capable on a atmospheric world, which is handy if you want to hop science equipment on eve using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-08T10:13:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223595477\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022180758\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221557307216\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022186653\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aeroboi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, Aeroboi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of what I said the buffed skiff engine is kind of out line because the Skiff is a upper stage engine.

While I wasn\u0027t clear my comment basis is referenced based on a multistage rocket design where each dedicated stage is used and where a dedicated engine is used in the upper atmosphere potentially leaving a rhino in orbit if you so desire to go elsewhere. Some multistage rocket have their 3rd stage that I put Skiff\u0027s on prior, but I could already fire them by dropping 1st stage boosters to free up their thrust vector. Also, the difference between 5km and 10km does make a big difference even although 5km has the thickest air.

So a better engine means more thrust per mass over the entire timespan to orbit, so it\u0027s a tiny more thrust to battle gravity losses next to having a little more Delta-V. In the end a more specific engine combination always proves to be better. But since the game is gamey a dedicated Kerbin launch rocket doesn\u0027t require sophisticated stages to get most things into orbit to begin with, so on Kerbin I\u0027m usually not that nitpicking, as long as the engine performs efficiently at the places I want to go.

For that matter I got a few TSTO\u0027s using a Rhino.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
