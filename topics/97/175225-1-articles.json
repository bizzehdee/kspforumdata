Anyway... back to your alternative school lesson...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the pre-release hype, I saw squares and triangles in a few sizes and those boarded up windows to my creativity\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eexploded\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0with new, tidier, and more resilient structures. The offered structural panels would allow for new architectural, artistic and even more robust vehicle\u00A0designs. The day MH went live, I was nearly nuclear. I was so hot about having ten attachment nodes (who the hell thought this was a good idea?!) to each part I could\u0027ve fused the bits together with the heat coming from my head. A lot faster, and probably more neatly. By and large, this is the biggest disappointment\u00A0of the expansion for me, but I\u0027m not finished yet...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSick with my latest wasted effort in building a simple shanty out of structural parts, I go back to the Saturn V replica I\u0027d been so disappointed in... and ripped it apart. This time I focused on using the correct engines (from MH. i.e. Wolfhound, Skiff, Mastodon, etc.) and let the words \u0022scale\u0022 and \u0022replica\u0022 go a bit by the wayside. Little did I know, some of those engine vectors were a bit on the wayside too! My lifter worked alright, but once I got to space, I realized there was no stable flight without spinning uncontrollably due to poorly aligned engine thrust vectors. And before you ask: no, I did not make any adjustments to those engines whatsoever. They came to me offset.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOH! but did I mention I couldn\u0027t even look out the window, because there was no IVA? Yeah. Good save, patching that, sure... but did you even test it first? You remember that part in school, where the teach asks you to double-check your work? This particular part would have taken a minute at the most, just to put a kermanned command pod on the pad...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could keep going, but I feel like I should half-ass this little review too... so I\u0027m going to.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Yes, both.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, the main attraction failed miserably. The ideal building blocks for me is too frustrating to be anything short of fail. How about my beloved aircraft? Everything looking good there. More options is great! I\u0027m excited and building again. The fuel tank variety makes good on versatility and variety, as well as some aesthetic appeal... and then I hear the old engines making new....\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enoise.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Sorry Squad, but when is the last time you appreciated the vehicle you hear often\u00A0suddenly making a new noise?!

A patch has fixed most of this since. I\u0027m aware and playing 1.4.3\u002BMH currently. I have only Kerbal Engineer Redux installed, to be sure mods aren\u0027t conflicting anywhere, but I still have many strange bugs cropping up that I can\u0027t replicate. The wheels still misbehave at times, much like the aero bug surrounding the fairings and other shielded structural parts. I still have to revert to launch inconsistently because the entire screen is grayed over when I launch. Stranger things have happened, but bugs get crushed with time. How long exactly do you plan to pay your exterminators to fail?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realize that not all of these complaints are directly about the expansion, but consider the release date of it compared to 1.4.1...

I feel like the engine plates and a few of the Soyuz parts are well done, the engine plates especially as they fill a role that wasn\u0027t really accomplished with mods (I think there were one or two that made some kind of interstage fairing) and make engine clusters and mismatched engine sizes in the middle of a stack work much better than before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut overall the parts are mediocre at best. Squad seem to have continued their strategy of passing off parts to interns or people working on them on the side (is it too much to ask for a consistent color palette within parts of the same family, or something like stripes that match up...). I\u0027ll take others\u0027 word for it that the engines are unbalanced (the Saturn V replica engines seem like a particularly disappointing oversight), but there are many other issues that shouldn\u0027t have made it to release or seem like poor design decisions: drag issues with the variants (it\u0027s a shame they went for the most bare-bones version of variants), geometry errors on a fuel tank, fairing problems, service bays that are too small for any real use, the absurd \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on the Mun lander, so many attachment nodes that the little structural panels are almost impossible to use (maybe use variants to cycle through different attachment nodes), and so on. And did anyone compare the preview versions of the parts with their final counterparts? I remember some UV unwrapping issues that were pointed out for the Mun lander that I immediately noticed in the final version. So I wonder how much of a \u0022work-in-progress\u0022 those version really were.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission builder is the real problem though. It makes no sense to me. Why would people go to the trouble or learning how to use the rather finicky and complex builder, only to shut out all console users and anyone who doesn\u0027t have the DLC from being able to play them. When you can just come up with a mission/challenge, write your own rules and restrictions, and post that on the forums it seems a little redundant. I understand that an in-game, formalized challenge system \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E be interesting, but this implementation, and as part of a DLC that instantly divides the player-base makes little sense to me. And given the dearth of community missions, and the complete lack of interest in the Squad missions (each one gets one or two replies compared to the old challenges that would get several pages), it seems like others think so, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s mostly just disappointing. This is the only time that I\u0027m aware of where Squad has dedicated a very long time and a lot of development resources to a single, gameplay-based aspect of KSP (compared to something like upgrading Unity,\u00A0replacing the UI, or just improving the code and performance of the game as in 1.2). The other gamey parts - science/tech tree, contracts, strategies, Kerbal professions - all seem like they work whipped up in a month or two with little concern for how well they actually fit in or work. For contracts they spent several versions progressively making them a little better (test launch clamps on the Mun \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E), but they are still fundamentally the same. And the Kerbal professions and science system have been haphazardly added to and changed over several versions, but I wouldn\u0027t call any of it much of an improvement, they are just a little different than they were at first.

D.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s not a worse \u0022F\u0022 just because I wanna be positive about the future of KSP in the whole, but, from the stand point of an old customer that entered the Kerbal world when it was at 0.13/0.14 stage, both 1.4.-something and its DLC about Making History are the first time I does not really feel the need of an upgrade, playing and keeping 1.3.1 as my \u0022main version\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nA lot is already said about \u0022not so much refined additional parts\u0022, but THE BIG DISAPPOINTMENT for me was the \u0022Mission Builder\u0022 itself:\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was hoping for an IN GAME (and I mean in a career, science or sandbox mode game) iteration, where I could \u0022program\u0022 my series of missions (instead to use the randomly-generated one of a career mode), to try to fulfill a whole \u0022space program\u0022, but basically we had just a \u0022scenario builder\u0022 disconnected to any \u0022long lasting\u0022 (but old and already present) game mode.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s not a worse \u0022F\u0022, just because I give \u0022F\u0022 to the \u00221.4.-something\u0022 update of KSP, and it\u0027s not a fault of \u0022making History\u0022: unrefined, full of bugs, already arrived to it\u0027s FIFTH patch (1.4.0... 1.4.1... 1.4.2... 1.4.3... 1.4.4...) but still not finalized, giving an headache to any modded player and to any modder that tries to keep an expanded gameplay based on mods that are still not able to find a final, stable version in which update their mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s not a worse \u0022F\u0022, just because i give a \u0022Z\u0022 to whoever is now running the development of KSP, not the game itself: rushed releases, parts and features designers clearly \u0022new\u0022 to the Kerbal Space Program game, at such point that a tons of modders working for PURE FREE could teach to them a thing of two about \u0022design, balancing and implementations\u0022 of ideas and parts into the core game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFREE CONTENTS shared by the comunity (modders) have better realization than those that should be OFFICIAL PARTS released by Take Two (... yes... there is no more \u0022Squad\u0022, even if it figures still on the label).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sad to expose those bad voting, but I feel orphan, in KSP 1.4.-something:\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe game\u0027s dad sold his idea, the big company that bought it has not a really clue about it, and the actual developers (as said before by others than me)\u00A0 seem just interns of a big company working at KSP as a side project in the free time from bigger projects that had to learn about it from scratches and that have less knowledge about KSP than modders.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe \u0022latest release\u0022 still working as KSP, up to now, is till 1.3.1 for me.\u003Cbr\u003E\nProbably for the moment the last one that has still a legacy of development to the \u0022original designers\u0022 of KSP.\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.4.-something (it\u0027s on the horizon already a probable 1.4.5 or a 1.5.0 version that makes 1.4.4 someway already obsolete) has the feel of a beta-release to test something that take Two does not still really know what should be, and thankfully not having bought it from Steam (to avoid an auto-update, or the need to extract it in a safe space) totally a version that I\u0027ll skip waiting \u0022future, fixed, releases\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan
