Particularly when the base game for that expansion has been leaning on player-created content almost since the first alpha build. It would have been different if the Mission editor had been a bonus feature on top of a more in-depth expansion but... well as far as I could see (I never bought MH) it wasn\u0027t. I saw quite a few reviews which basically said that the expansion as a whole was a bit meh but gave it the benefit of the doubt on the assumption that the KSP community would make a ton of new content with it. I don\u0027t think I saw any reviews to the effect of \u0027buy this - it\u0027s great as it is and the Mission editor is the icing on the cake.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut enough of my personal views on that topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking History suffered from a number of other problems in my opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. \u00A0 It shipped with bugs in the editor and broken content in the Missions, which then needed time to be patched out. Not the best way to make a good first impression and get people excited about an expansion. By the time the bugs had been ironed out and the Missions fixed, the moment had passed and people had moved on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 Beyond bug fixing, it\u0027s received almost no official support or interest since launch. We had a brief season of \u0027Mission of the Week\u0027 and that\u0027s about it. To paraphrase an old software development meme - you need to eat your own dogfood if you expect your customers to eat it too. If Squad couldn\u0027t be bothered / weren\u0027t able to make any exciting new stuff with their Mission editor, it shouldn\u0027t come as much of a surprise that the community decided it couldn\u0027t be bothered either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. \u00A0 Stock KSP has an almost complete lack of interesting game mechanics to build Missions around. Take an Apollo 13 style mission for example. Something breaks on your spacecraft - what happens next? Better hope it\u0027s fixable with an engineer (and that you brought an engineer along in the first place), or that you built in a redundant system. Otherwise it\u0027s most likely back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to try again.

Easier said than done (and writing KSP fiction is something I \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E have experience of) and that\u0027s assuming the Mission editor is set up for easy storytelling in the first place. This puts another barrier in front of wannabe Mission creators. Not only do they have to figure out how to make the editor do what they want, but they need to be writers, or storyboard artists too.

They\u0027re kind of fun, but I think the issue is they make KSP into a very different kind of game.
