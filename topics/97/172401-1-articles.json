(historical engines, etc.) ... it\u0027s not the same thing as saying that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EKSP\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E should necessarily do one thing or another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause KSP isn\u0027t just a historical simulation, it\u0027s also a game.\u00A0 And game balance matters, e.g. the balance among the various parts.\u00A0 You raise a lot of cogent points above, talking about real-world historical rocket engines and real-world fuels and various real-world engineering solutions... but I don\u0027t see any mention at all made of game balance, e.g. \u0022this engine should be more powerful than that one because \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;gameplay reason\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScientific/historical arguments, such as yours, are perfectly valid.\u00A0 But so are gameplay/balance arguments.\u00A0 Which one is \u0022more important\u0022 will vary from one person to another, since different people have different priorities.\u00A0 Some people are very passionate about realism and the history of the space program, and to someone like that, I could imagine that realism would be a lot more important than game balance.\u00A0 On the other hand... some people are completely the other way around, and they couldn\u0027t care less about what real-world engine some KSP engine happens to look like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, of course, an engine design in KSP would satisfy both requirements-- fit perfectly into the game balance against all the other parts in the game, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E be historically accurate and so forth.\u00A0 Unfortunately, the game is subject to a variety of constraints that make that difficult at best, impossible at worst.\u00A0 Some examples:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAs you point out, real-world engines use a variety of fuel types.\u00A0 KSP engines use just \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eone\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 And it\u0027s the same stuff that\u0027s used for jet planes.\u00A0 And for the LV-N.\u00A0 So it\u0027s physically impossible to make complete historical sense in all cases, because the physical design of real-world engines reflect the different fuels they use.\u00A0 There\u0027s no way to have them keep the same physical appearance, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E use the same fuel, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E have \u0022realistic\u0022 relative stats to each other, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E make visual sense in the game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe old stock parts.\u00A0 No matter what engines \u003Cem\u003EMaking History\u003C/em\u003E adds... well, the Poodle and the Skipper and the Mainsail and so forth are still a part of the game.\u00A0 So, from a gameplay balance perspective... the new parts have to fit in, at least somewhat reasonably.\u00A0 And those stock parts \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E look particularly like any historical engine, and weren\u0027t balanced with that in mind, and have been around so long that their stats are pretty much set in stone by now.\u00A0 So the KSP designers are going to have to work around that.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich basically boils down to \u0022you can\u0027t have everything\u0022, and there are going to be places where a design decision has to be made between historical realism and gameplay, and doing better at one will mean doing worse at the other.\u00A0 Which means \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esomebody\u0027s\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E going to be unhappy no matter what you do, since different people are going to want different things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the question of \u0022what should KSP do\u0022 really becomes \u0022what do most players want\u0022.\u00A0 I would hazard a guess that passionate history buffs like yourself who are well-read enough to actually know what all the old engines were, and what fuels they used, and what their stats were, and so forth... are probably the minority of players.\u00A0 I would guess that most players are probably more gameplay-oriented than historical-accuracy oriented.\u00A0 So, that means design decisions are going to have to take that into account, and there are going to have to be places where historical accuracy\u0027s going to have to give a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, put another way:\u00A0 if you\u0027re going to try to convince folks that \u0022the engine stats need to change\u0022... it\u0027s going to be hard to persuade unless you make sure that there\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ealso\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E a solid gameplay story there, regardless of historical accuracy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, with that in mind... I\u0027m not saying \u0022you\u0027re wrong\u0022, but rather \u0022I don\u0027t have enough data to have much of an opinion\u0022 because I\u0027d need to see the numbers.\u00A0 Specifically:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat stats do you propose for the Wolfhound?\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Mass, vacuum thrust, Isp, position in tech tree.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat stats do you propose for the Skiff?\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Mass, vacuum thrust, Isp, position in tech tree.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I\u0027m overwhelmingly a \u0022gameplay\u0022 person myself (as you might have guessed by now) \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ... whatever numbers you propose, I\u0027m going to be looking at them through a \u0022gameplay balance\u0022 lens.\u00A0 Other than an insistence on balance, I\u0027m fairly neutral, i.e. there are many potential sets of stats I could agree to, I think.\u00A0\u00A0 But give me a set of numbers that make sense to me from a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egameplay\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E perspective, and I can totally get on board.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223323100\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172401\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221521153949\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022184446\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dvader\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, dvader said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsn\u0027t the Skiff better than the Reliant in every single way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo.\u00A0 It\u0027s better in some ways, worse in others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223323100\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172401\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221521153949\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022184446\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dvader\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, dvader said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLighter, stronger and better Isp?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is true.\u00A0 But it\u0027s also a much \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elarger\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E engine (can\u0027t fit in any stack smaller than 1.875m)-- even in its narrowest configuration, it has over double the cross-sectional area of the Reliant.\u00A0 Bigger size is a relative disadvantage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me, the real killer argument there, though, is that the Skiff is a full \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethree tiers\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E higher on the tech tree than the Reliant, which in my book means it\u0027s allowed to be objectively better, just as the HECS is better than the OKTO in every way.\u00A0 The Reliant\u0027s a crude entry-level engine; the Skiff is a high-tech performer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not the same thing as asserting that it is or isn\u0027t \u0022overpowered\u0022 --- simply that it\u0027s not a slam dunk, and comes down to a judgment call based on how important one thinks the bigger size and tech tree placement are, relative to the other stats.\u00A0 (For example, a player who always plays sandbox would be more likely to consider it overpowered, I suppose, since for them the \u0022tech tree\u0022 isn\u0027t even a thing.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sh1pman","CreatedById":147869,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-16T02:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125662\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Snark\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0even without the historical argument, the Wolfhound is \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

This is done by using low efficiency engines of fairly high mass. With an engine using \u0022realistic\u0022 hydrogen\u002Boxygen specific impulse of over 400 seconds, such an engine performs incredibly better than real engines. This is not a realism problem. It is a gameplay problem. Engines should generally be worse than their real counterparts, or rockets either get short and stubby or far too powerful for their size. The engine not only performs better when attached to a rocket than it would in real life, it performs better than any other engine in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real life, Hydrogen/Oxygen rockets have a tradeoff from Kerosene/Oxygen or Hydrazine/N2O4. The hydrogen is big and bulky and thus you can not fit nearly as much of its mass into the same space as you could Kerosene or Hydrazine. But of course LH2 and LOx are a tremendously efficient fuel to make up for it. And the lightness of the fuel does have an upside--the thrust to weight ratio for the same amount of delta-v is higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223323306\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172401\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221521165359\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, with that in mind...

IMO there are three factors that are important: First, gameplay and balance.

In real life, the Skiff is a high power upper stage engine, driving the Saturn 5 2nd and 3rd stage, after all! It is highly efficient thanks to LH2, but early tech, being both somewhat bulky and inefficient, notably optimized to still work the upper atmosphere! The model is also huge in KSP, indicating a powerful engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this change would make the engine fit a role that is not yet filled, a high power upper stage/orbital engine in 2.5m diameter (the poodle is not bad, but very weak for it\u0027s size), basically a more upper stage alternative to the Skipper. The high weight inefficiency can make up for the efficiency; we don\u0027t neccessarily need heavy tanks if we can just add a bit of weight to the engine itself. I also put a potential, more conservative \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E beside it, which might fit better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWolfhound\u003C/strong\u003E: Mass: 2 ton.

The engine bell both indicates high power at relatively good efficiency, to me. I mean, that\u0027s basically what the SPS is, just scaled up to KSP-compatible thrust levels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thrust is 160kn per ton, which put it directly inbetween the extremly efficient but weak Poodle (142), and the slightly less efficient but surprisingly powerful Aerospike (180). This basically makes it a very versatile late upper stage/orbital engine, which is always good when a Poodle is just a bit too weak and you\u0027d rather sacrifice a bit of\u00A0efficiency for thrust (which I always feel with the Poodle). Also a bit heavier to make a better single stack upper/orbital stage engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion, this would both keep the engines as interesting alternatives to current engines, be reasonably enough balanced and also reflect the real life engines roles.

sustainer engine like the Skiff.\u00A0 If you did the reverse, people would use the Wolfhound as a lower-stage engine and the Skiff as an upper-stage engine, which just seems backward.\u00A0 So in this case, you have to pick between being historically accurate as to how these engines worked, or historically accurate as to how they make sense to use.\u00A0 They picked the latter, and I\u0027m
