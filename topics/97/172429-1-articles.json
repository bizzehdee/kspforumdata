I have bought the DLC but I have yet to use the mission builder because I have not felt compelled to. To be honest, I would have been much happier if there was instead a simpler mission builder, but integrated into the career mode. I can give an example of how it might work. You could have an extra tab in the Mission Control Building where you could create new missions that are relevant to your current save, e.g. saving one of your stranded pilots, or help to map a moon. There could be boundaries on what you could create and what rewards to give out. The mission can then be uploaded to a server from where other players can search through for missions they want to take. There would be another tab in the Missions Control Building for viewing available missions. Something simple like this would give a kind of \u0022pseudo-multiplayer\u0022 feel to the game if you see what I mean.
