While the problems are correctable and may not be bugs necessarily, some changes to the mission builder could prevent them from happening in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen a \u0022Time Since Node\u0022 node is referenced to the start node, it is actually referencing UT=0, regardless of the start time of the mission. This causes problems when the start node begins the mission at any time other than UT=0. For example, in the mission \u0022To the Mun via Minmus\u0022, it makes the x2 multiplier for reaching Minmus in under 10 days impossible to achieve. The appropriate functionality can be accomplished with the \u0022Mission Elapsed Time\u0022 or \u0022Time of Mission\u0022 nodes, but as this mission demonstrates, players will expect a \u0022Time Since Node\u0022 referenced to the start node to reference the UT set for mission start, rather than UT=0. A simple fix would be to prevent players from referencing the start node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, for \u0022To the Mun via Minmus\u0022, the silver and gold awards are\u00A0unattainable due to what I suspect was a misunderstanding of the way score modifiers are implemented, a misunderstanding \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/172266-making-history-expansion-to-the-mun-via-minmus-squad-missions-not-completable-without-cheating/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3323972\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EI have seen perpetuated elsewhere\u003C/a\u003E. The pop-up description of the \u0022Modify Score\u0022\u00A0node\u00A0 says \u0022Modify the player\u0027s total score\u0022. This description implies that the modifier will be applied at the end of the mission to the players\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etotal\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0score, as opposed to the actual behavior: modifying the score the player has accumulated at the time the modifier node is activated. Whether the description should be improved or the modifier\u0027s order of operation should be changed depends on the original intent of the devs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also something goofy about the way the mun orbit is tested and rewarded. The 500 points for \u0026gt;80% accuracy is not activating for me, despite accomplishing an extremely accurate orbit upon a single circularization burn (\u0026lt;100m off from AP/PE, \u0026lt;0.01deg inc). I haven\u0027t figured this one out yet. If anyone else has, I\u0027d love for you to share your understanding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to these problems/misunderstandings, \u0022To the Mun via Minmus\u0022 max possible score appears to be\u00A07000, while the silver award threshold is 8000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTLDR: \u0022To the Mun via Minmus\u0022 max score is 7000; silver and gold awards are not possible. Do not reference the start node when using \u0022Time Since Node\u0022. Score modifiers apply only to the score that has accumulated at the time when the modifier node was activated, and not to the total score at the end of the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-18T22:02:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2018 10:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by StrikeEagleCC\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MulleDK19","CreatedById":34027,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-19T16:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a side effect of how the mission start time is set.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach node has an activation\u00A0time stamp.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe mission time is part of the start node, so it\u0027s the start node that changes it.
