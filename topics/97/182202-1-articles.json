But the thing is that I like to play on console and I don\u0027t have a gaming pc (don\u0027t want to get one eighter) so I bought it for the ps4 believing at least I would have access to the same parts as the pc version if I bought the expansions. Never had any hope for the mods.\u00A0 But got really liquided when I found out that the options to expand are none. SQUAD should really inform about this in the psn site. At least inform that the the way SQUAD intended the game to be played and the options for buying expansions may differ a lot from platform to platform. Are they even manning the console support?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-16T02:24:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223541484\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182202\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221550270785\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022195306\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lein Armweek\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Lein Armweek said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre they even manning the console support?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a halfhearted kind of way, updates are finally coming, apparently:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8664124258\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/182178-ksp-loadingksp-enhanced-edition-is-getting-some-love/\u0026amp;\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T1mo98","CreatedById":148056,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-21T14:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould have done more research before buying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
