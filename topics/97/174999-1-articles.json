I closed the message, continued airbraking, deployed parachutes, and landed safely. Why the sudden FAILURE? My only guess is that the no-longer-needed Service Module (not even part of my vessel anymore) had just blown up from re-entry heat, and the program thought \u0022oh wait, a required part has just blown up! FAILURE!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2022 Acapello 13: orbited Kerbin, went to the Mun in spite of the setbacks, landed Jeb in the lander, got Jeb back into the Command Module, returned to Kerbin atmosphere, got the \u0022oh noes your parachutes have failed and you\u0027ll have to bail out and use personal parachutes\u0022 message, had all three of the crew bail out and deploy personal parachutes... and then suddenly got an \u0022I told you you should\u0027ve bailed out!\u0022 message from Gene Kerman and the FAILURE message out of nowhere. Again, I closed the FAILURE message and continued playing... Valentina (the one I was controlling at the moment) landed safely; the other two kerbals seem to have vanished into thin air (in spite of their parachutes having already been deployed); the crew capsule, ironically, made it to the ground completely undamaged! And yet FAILURE anyway. No clue why.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also been having problems with the Service Module part that is required to be used in the Munar 1 mission. I loaded it up with fuel tanks (of the 1.25m variety), and discovered when I reached the appropriate stage that they weren\u0027t feeding fuel to the engine (connected directly to said Service Module) at all. I started over, discovered that the tanks were attached to the ceiling of the SM, and tried attaching them to the floor of the SM instead--the \u0022fuel overlay\u0022 view confirmed that they should both be feeding fuel to the engine. When I actually flew it, though, only half of the tanks (either just left side or just right side; I forget) fed fuel to the engine; the other half remained full and untouched throughout the entire mission--and untouchable, too, since apparently the \u0022transfer fuel from one tank to another\u0022 ability has been disabled?? By some miracle of engineering and the Tsiolkovsky equation I made it back to Kerbin anyway, but, well, FAILURE; see above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hate to complain here, because KSP is such an amazing product and as a physics teacher I get so much use out of it both personally and professionally... but I\u0027m getting really tired of these bugs.

I cant seem to recreate the problems theyre having, but it sounds like the exact same you\u2019re experiencing. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6793336720\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/174355-sm-25-service-module-cant-be-used-for-fuel-wont-feed/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:223px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also agree that with all the bugs this DLC had a very \u201Cearly access\u201D feel to it. \u00A0I think it was forced to be released per a time schedule rather than by a quality milestone. \u00A0Its nice that they are attempting to improve the mission builder and add more features (unfortunately not any more parts), but my bank was charged the moment this was purchased and not 3 months later when the product is \u201Cfinished\u201D. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
