For those of you who haven\u0027t, I can tell you this: the results are mixed especially with the stock textures (we\u0027ll talk about mods in a second). The reflection shader it self looks amazing, but all the parts look like they\u0027ve been shrink-wrapped in shiny shiny plastic - not a good look! The reason for this is that the alpha channel in the stock textures (which the reflection plugin uses as a mask to determine reflection strength) was not optimized to be used in this way. Indeed, in many cases there isn\u0027t an alpha channel at all, thus, shiny plastic wrap death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of sheer curiosity, I started experimenting with a few textures to see what it would take to get the reflections looking like they actually originated from the surface of a part and weren\u0027t painted over the top of it. It turns out, that\u0027s quite a lot of work:P. It\u0027s not very skilled work, it\u0027s just tedious, repetitive and time consuming. But the results are promising so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this stage I would simply like to show you the fruits of my labour in the form of an Imgur album and share what I have learned. Because I am modifying stock textures and not creating new ones, I\u0027m sure I would not be allowed to setup a link to anything downloadable as I would be redistributing copyrighted material. Clarification on that subject would be much appreciated please. I\u0027ll return to this subject in a moment but for now, I\u0027ll move on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Results Of My Efforts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/wM9JJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I ended up overlaying a fine metal texture from real life and factoring that into the alpha channel too. This can be seen most clearly on the Mk1 Lander Can and the Mk 1-2 Pod in the images above. I probably went too far with the grunginess but it was just to see what effect it would have at this stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlat surfaces look mirror like no matter what you do to the alpha channel short of adding mountains of noise. Altering the normal map (by adding noise perhaps) could help here but due to the low resolution of the existing normal maps I have yet to find a way of doing this that doesn\u0027t look totally pants \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. Furthermore, altering an existing normal map (or creating a new one) without the original Photoshop file is very very fiddly indeed. Perhaps a subtle application of a layer of the same pre-rendered, hi-passed noise on both the diffuse and normal map might remedy the issue but I have yet to try this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, the best solution to mirror like flat surfaces would be a configurable parameter for the plugin itself that scatters the reflection (or something to that effect). Ideally, this should be controllable on a per part basis in addition to the already existing configurable parameters (Shaw, are you reading??? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome Mods fare much better without any alterations to their textures\u0027 alpha channels. KW Rocketry is an example: All that is needed is a config file for the KW parts and they\u0027ll look decent enough. But even here the alpha channels could be further optimised for getting convincing reflections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConclusion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you go - sorry for the text slab. In short, making parts reflective is possible if extremely fiddly, but well worth the effort (IMHO).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on the level of people\u0027s interest (please make it known below) and, subject to licencing, I\u0027d like to develop things into something my fellow kerbanaughts can download and use (I\u0027d be hesitant to call it a mod because it\u0027d really just be a load of textures and a config file... but there you go). If I can\u0027t do that with stock textures then perhaps a mod like Ven\u0027s Stock Part Revamp, or KW, or... something else??? Suggestions? All subject to Licence of course. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I shall continue my experimentation and report back further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaterz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERexable x\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T19:21:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rextable\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Z3R0_0NL1N3","CreatedById":60881,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T09:30:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello there!
