Or rather, my version of it. This plane was designed to test lots of at the time new ideas, such as closely grouped canards and digital fight control (for more info, see here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_HiMAT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_HiMAT\u003C/a\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hDsqcky.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hDsqcky.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks, IMO, pretty close to the real thing. However, there are two small problems, the first is the nose (but I wanted to keep this stock, and can\u0027t think how to get it any better-any comments welcome on that) and the engine, which is similar to both ksp stock jets but at the same time, noticeably different. I know B9 has a perfect engine for the job, but again, stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zQHVEOE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zQHVEOE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of performance, despite the awe inspiring manoeuvrability of the real thing, in stock ksp it\u0027s responsive but slow to turn, and care should be taken on landing to avoid breaking engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for anyone who wants to test it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/x0gs5mj2lwxwpp2/Rockwell%20HiMAT%20Replica.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/x0gs5mj2lwxwpp2/Rockwell%20HiMAT%20Replica.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(also, feel free to use it in any kerbal based stuff you like (YouTube vids, ect) but post the link, I wanna make sure you treat her right.
