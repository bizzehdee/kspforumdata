I had a brief conversation with jofwu about it [here](https://github.com/LouisB3/USILS-Patches/issues/1) and I don\u0027t anticipate any problems, but I figured I would double-check with you to make sure. Thinking about submitting some updated pull requests to Nertea for USI-LS support of the crew tubes in Stockalike Station Parts and Near Future Construction, which are habitable but don\u0027t actually have seats.\n\u003E \n\nShould not be.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Grumman said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have two questions:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1. According to the wiki, if I turn off wear \u0026 tear in USI-LS\u0027s configuration, UKS will turn it back on. Can I counteract this by turning it off in UKS\u0027s USI-LS.cfg file as well?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2. Would you be willing to extend the formula for the rate at which unhappiness accumulates to allow for more complex behaviour? At the moment, your formula appears to be something along the lines of:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **(monthly unhappiness) = NoOfKerbals / (Hab-months \\* BaseHabTime)**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What I would like is if the rate was instead:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **(monthly unhappiness) = (NoOfKerbals \u002B Offset) / (Hab-months \\* BaseHabTime) - Offset**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ...with Offset defined in the config file. If Offset = 0, unhappiness is accrued at the same rate it is now. But if someone set Offset to greater than 0, then it is possible to create a sufficiently large space station in which Kerbals could live indefinitely or even lose unhappiness without returning to Kerbin, with the threshold being ((1/Offset) \u002B 1) Hab-months per Kerbal. An offset of 0.02 (i.e. 1/50) requires 51 Hab-months per Kerbal, an offset of 0.05 (i.e. 1/20) requires 21 Hab-months per Kerbal, and so on.\n\u003E \n\n1.  Yes,  2.

When trying to do a \u0027rescue a kerbal from orbit\u0027 type contract, once I get within range of the pod and switch to that pod, I cannot make the kerbal EVA because as soon as I switch to him he is grumpy and refuses to work, despite me having accepted the contract less than 15 days ago. So i thought he should not yet be grumpy, but he was. In fact he is actually constantly switching back and forth between being grumpy and returning to work. So my question is, What files/lines should I edit in order to at least get him to return to work long enough to get him in EVA?

Unhappiness gained per month is always positive, with the rate only reaching 0 at infinite Hab-months per Kerbal. Multiplying the effective number of hab-months per Kerbal can never reach infinity, so the Kerbal is always getting more unhappy.\n\nThe purpose of the offset is to allow something like the blue line, where the rate reaches 0 at a finite number of effective Hab-months per Kerbal (in this case at 21 Hab-months per Kerbal for Offset = 0.05). Under this system, it is possible to build something like an orbital hotel where Kerbals can go to become less homesick, instead of Kerbin being the only place in the entire system where that is possible."},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-05T03:12:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, v1per said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@RoverDude](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/) I\u0027m re starting the work on my parts and something I didn\u0027t get to do last time around was to implement support for various mods.

Right now it only shows predictions based on present supplies, and with greenhouses you just need enough to start the cycle, the rest is fertilizer... And that remembers me of another point. Is it possible to make a bigger fertilizer pack?

In the life support status window in the Editor I have lots of info, but I\u0027m not sure where it all fits in.  Im trying to build a habitation module but I\u0027m unsure on how to calculate it.  Im not sure what the \u0022Months\u0022 numbers mean (why is it showing 1?)  Is there a standard formula I can use?\n\nThanks! \n\nEDIT: Ok, think if found out the formula but still not sure what the \u0022months\u0022 number means.  All I know is that if I make it the same as the number of crew I get the same figures as on the USI LS wiki.  However these numbers don\u0027t correlate with the numbers in side the Life Support Status Window.\n\nFor a habitation module with 1 cupola and 3 hitchhiker bays I do:\n\n30\\*13 = 390 Base Days\n\n390\u002B1125 Extra Days = 1515\n\n1515\\*2.76 = 4181.4 Days Habitation\n\nNow in the USI-LS wiki it states that a Kerbal-Month is 30 days, so this gives me 11.61 Kerbal years - but I don\u0027t think this is correct.  I think an actual Kerbal Month is 35 days?  This would give me 9.96 Kerbal Years (for one crew member) - which is what is shown in the Life Support Status window.\n\n**So - I\u0027m still confused about what the \u0022months\u0022 number means in the Life Support Status Window, and also why a Kerbal-Month is 30 days in the calculations for Habitation days, but is actually 35 when working out the total in game time for habitation.**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-07T07:46:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2016 07:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by funkcanna**"},{"CreatedByName":"funkcanna","CreatedById":138944,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T08:17:33Z","Content":"Also one more question - when working out Supplies, does the amount of mulch produced per day also reduce by 70% when using a lab for recycling?
