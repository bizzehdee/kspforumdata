With PreciseWarp, you can control speedup (timeScale) and precision (fixedDeltaTime) separately. You can also pause the simulation and still be able to issue commands, create nodes, etc.\n\nIncreasing timeScale will speed up time. But this demands more CPU. So, there is a limit on how fast you can go.\n\nIncreasing fixedDeltaTime will reduce simulation accuracy, so your ship might break up if you increase it a lot. On the other hand, it also speeds up time, up to what is set in timeScale.\n\nSo, the key is to find a balance between the two.\n\nDownload: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wt3g7jl8ofulvv4/PreciseWarp.zip?dl=0)\n\nSource included in download.\n\nLicense: MIT"}]}
