With PreciseWarp, you can control speedup (timeScale) and precision (fixedDeltaTime) separately. You can also pause the simulation and still be able to issue commands, create nodes, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncreasing timeScale will speed up time. But this demands more CPU. So, there is a limit on how fast you can go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncreasing fixedDeltaTime will reduce simulation accuracy, so your ship might break up if you increase it a lot. On the other hand, it also speeds up time, up to what is set in timeScale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the key is to find a balance between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/wt3g7jl8ofulvv4/PreciseWarp.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDropbox\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESource included in download.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELicense: MIT\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
