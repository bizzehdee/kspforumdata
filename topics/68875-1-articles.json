LV-T30, some fuel, a fin or three, and a solid booster or three, then an upper stage with an LV-T45, a bit of fuel, and finally, a capsule, a bit of fuel, and an LV-909 for the rest. Don\u0027t forget a parachute!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re getting into really big ships, then take a step back, and try a minimalist approach. I find it\u0027s VERY helpful to have something like VOID, MechJeb, or Kerbal Engineer Redux to get delta-V calculations in the VAB. For a munar flyby, figure ~5000 m/s for ascent (that gives you a very wide margin of error), ~1000 m/s for munar transfer (again, a plenty wide margin of error), and, a few hundred m/s for munar orbit, and return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re actually trying to LAND, then I STRONGLY recommend Minmus first. It\u0027s MUCH more forgiving in terms of difficulty, as well as dV required for landing and takeoff. The dV required to get there is a bit more, but not much. Your 1000 m/s is still plenty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T16:29:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sam1133\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sam1133\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI just cant seem to get it right, no matter how many tanks i stick on by the time i want to do my burn to leave orbit and head for moon, i am out of fuel...i am stumped,...please any help\u003Cp\u003Ethanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esam\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebtw.. i am early in career, so no fancy bits yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s your flight profile look like?

In fact, adding more fuel onto the same amount of thrust reaps rapidly diminishing returns, which is dictated by the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s start with a Mk1 pod and use the rocket equation to see how we can get it to the Mun. If I add one FL-T400 fuel tank and 1 LV-T45 engine, you\u0027ll get a dV of 1818m/s (ASL). Add another FL-T400 and you get 2785m/s (a 53% increase). Add a 3rd - 3414m/s (\u002B23%) - and a 4th - 3864m/s (\u002B13%) - and you see where this is going. Meanwhile, your rocket has gone from weighing 4.55t on the launchpad to 11.3t, and your thrust to weight ratio (TWR) plummeted from 4.5 to 1.8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, 3864m/s dV is not enough for low Kerbin orbit, let alone munar orbit and back, so you\u0027re going to need to add at least another 2000 or so m/s dV. If you try to add just fuel atop the same engine, you\u0027ll very quickly not have enough TWR to get off the ground: at 9 tanks your theoretical dV is 5025, but your TWR of .9 means you won\u0027t get off the ground until you\u0027ve burned up nearly one tank of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA TWR of 1.8 is a good regime to be in, so let\u0027s go back to 4 tanks, with dV=3864 and TWR=1.8. Now, to effectively increase dV you\u0027re going to need to add thrust along with more fuel. To do that, let\u0027s add a couple of radial decouplers to the sides, stick FL-T400s to them, and stack another FL-T400 on top of each, with an LV-T45 underneath each one. You should now have 8 fuel tanks in a line (2-4-2) with 3 engines underneath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, order your staging so that only the two side engines fire in stage 1, then stage 2 cuts the decouplers and fires the middle engine. On the pad your rocket will weigh 23.35t. When the two side engines fire you will have a TWR of 1.75 - nice. That 1st stage is good for 1316m/s dV (ASL), and when that is done you fire stage 2 with its 4467m/s (vacuum), which totals 5784m/s. And I believe that will get you to munar orbit and back (with practice, anyway). If not, add another tank on each side and fire all three engines in the first stage to maintain good TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I very much recommend installing the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/a\u003E mod, which does all this math for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-11T06:19:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2014 06:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dust\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUsed the wrong Isp values\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
