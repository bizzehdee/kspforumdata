There is no stopped in reality, nor in the Kerbal universe; everything is relative. The test would be to build a large platform on the end of a rocket, launch it into orbit, and have the Kerbal get out of a pod that exits onto the platform while the rocket is gently accelerating and see if he can walk on the platform while it\u0027s still thrusting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJK\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"corvustech","CreatedById":111036,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T20:33:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFull stop referring to a parking motion in relation to the sun such that x Y and Z are all 0 in relation.

The small thrusters @ 5% have hardly any visible thrust. In order to get into that position though he had to outrun the ship slightly with his EVA pack, could capture that because it was a sub-second maneuver in order to minimize the impact speed and maximize the odds he would be able to stand up. This should work with real world physics, but flying being handled as a separate state messes it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECentrifugal force was going to be the next test if this worked, since it would take little/no fuel and not mess up the \u0022studio\u0027s\u0022 orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how 0 absolute motion would really help. 0 relative velocity is fairly close to a normal EVA in a high orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last trick i tried today was to have Jeb ride up on the platform (no seat \u002B added a lip).
