So after landing collecting samples transmitting, collecting again etc. I engage escape boosters go into orbit collect more data in low orbit, transmit, collect again, etc. and then look for a vector that would set me on a collision course with Kerbin, burn, collect more data in high orbit. Then I start wondering: will the craft be worth more in recovery if it has been in orbit around multiple bodies (M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn \u002B Mimis). Found a vector that would take me within 10k meters of the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn surface, burn again. Right as I entered M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn influence i looked at my watch. 3.15pm! No shave, still in civilian attire, bed not made, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point instead of saving and quitting the game, I decided to multitask. Cut the mission not to include orbit, made a queue for science transmission in near orbit (as I have not exausted the science there previously) and burned again to intercept kerbin (M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn was going to shoot me over the north pole @ a Kerbin exit velocity as i had to burn prograde @ Kerbin in order to intercept the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn in the first place), increased time compression, and started to clean, etc. checked on my path, queued more science in M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn high orbit and time compress again (just a little, didn\u0027t want to overshoot). Shave, got back, decoupled booster and lander can (making sure i did not leave any stray samples in the can) and turned my nose retrograde. Changed. The capsule was starting to enter atmosphere, very fast I might add, still going the speed that would have taken me out of Kerbin influence. The burn passed in just over a second and the super sonic cloud formed around and behind the ship. Engaged parachutes splashdown recover. (gained over 1000 science for all experiments performed) quit the game and looked at my watch. 3.27pm. Bingo. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
