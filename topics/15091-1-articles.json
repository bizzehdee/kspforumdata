Get in an orbit around the Mun, then change the inclination so that it passes over your stranded kerbal. Decelerate in time to land in the area of the stranded kerbal, then adjust. My current designs often have two stages landed, so I can land with one, then go somewhere else with the other. You want to end up within about 15 km of the kerbal if it has jetpack fuel and you can EVA well, or within ~200 m if he has no fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"amore555","CreatedById":23863,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T07:53:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dielos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dielos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice looking lander!
