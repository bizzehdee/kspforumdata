There\u0027s a reason why the game pops a warning message into your face everytime you try to go faster than 2x physics warp for the first time in a new game! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a mod, BetterTimeWarp, which improves physics warp to not be so weird anymore (and allow higher warp rates to boot). Unfortunately it has not officially updated to 1.1.x yet because the author is quite busy. If you\u0027re willing to experiment though, there\u0027s an unofficial recompile somewhere in the thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magzimum","CreatedById":167187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-18T07:04:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my experience, the game can sometimes even throw your rovers/rockets around for no reason at all, even without time-warp. I\u0027ve had a rover which was landed on Minmus safely, got parked (brakes on) and after I returned to it flipped itself into the \u003Cs\u003Eair\u003C/s\u003E vacuum, as soon as the focus came onto it. Also I had a rocket which would shake itself apart on the launchpad, but only if I reverted back to launch... not if I loaded it from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Weird.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut physics warp makes everything WAY worse. Planes start shaking, rovers bounce. I use it with care, and I almost always press Quicksave before I turn on a physics warp, just in case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
