This is intended for the Grumman TBF Avenger replica I\u0027m working on, but I thought I\u0027d share it with you all.\n\n![yDNnpG.gif](http://share.gifyoutube.com/yDNnpG.gif)\n\nIt\u0027s small enough to fit within the fuselage of the Avenger, while still turning and staying in place. I have yet to make it jump the bearing.\n\nThis model has rotational limiters in place which currently allow 160 degrees of rotation (to avoid the cockpit), but can be adjusted to increase or decrease it\u0027s range.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

It does have a slight issue while the plane is accelerating; the turret is pushed against the back and turns a little rough, but that shouldn\u0027t be hard to iron out, especially once it\u0027s installed in a proper sized fuselage."},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T22:40:09Z","Content":"Pics?"},{"CreatedByName":"RixKillian","CreatedById":145397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T01:52:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Pics?\n\nI didn\u0027t take any; the old avenger is so undersized that it looked like it was carrying a beach ball.
