I created a new design off a previous SSTO I had created (I use the term SSTO loosely since it\u0027s never made it into orbit). I always have the same issue!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a very heavy plane, so the velocity during take-off is quite low, and decreases slightly as I raise my prograde vector. Here are some pictures of the ascent, and the design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kaos8ni.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Kaos8ni.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4jnDgV0.png\u0022 alt=\u00224jnDgV0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XBc83yT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XBc83yT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q4oP2n2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Q4oP2n2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2mk8k9v.png\u0022 alt=\u00222mk8k9v.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now at 12 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Gqk4df2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Gqk4df2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E17km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5txqf01.png\u0022 alt=\u00225txqf01.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xgbi7xP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xgbi7xP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E23 km.
