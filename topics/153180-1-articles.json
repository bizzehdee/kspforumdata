Seems like there is no fully functional work around currently, since \u003Cem\u003EI couldn\u0027t transfer crew reports manually\u003C/em\u003E (from a Mk1 lander can) to a storage unit. (And the units ignore cross-feed restrictions, that might have been a handy fix, connecting units via couplers.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn my opinion, \u0022\u003Cem\u003Ecollect all\u0022 should not take experiments from other storage units at all\u003C/em\u003E. This function very quickly creates a jumbled mess that can take a lot of time to figure out. Also, there is a dedicated function for transferring between them anyway, so I\u0027d call that the \u0027bug\u0027, rather than just changing the priority of checking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-28T23:28:10Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2017 11:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Z3R0Gravitas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
