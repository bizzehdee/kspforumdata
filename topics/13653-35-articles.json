To use it you\u0027ll have to connect a fuel line with one of your Kerbals. Just float next the \u0022FT\u0022-Box, press g for grapple, float to your target fuel tank and press g again. It\u0027ll then show a transfer-GUI in the ship with the FT-Box. Use the same procedure to remove the fuel line. Unfortunately it\u0027s only a LineRenderer now... it would be great to render it as a real fuel line.\u0022\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I won\u0027t touch the kethane pack with a ten foot pole is that everything we\u0027re doing here is striving for realism, then there\u0027s friggen laserbeams shooting magical kethane from one ship to another. I can\u0027t rationalise it, my imagination only extends so far. But here lies a solution! The ORDA docking mod fixes your issue, and gives you a snazzy hose and a reason to clone kerbals and keep them in a Mun base for three years or until their teeth fall out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody is forcing you to use it.

It\u0027s not like it\u0027s instant transfer several million kilometers away. You still need to be within 50 meters or else it won\u0027t work. I transfer up to 7,200 liters from the miner to an orbital tanker/refueler. It takes almost an hour just for the transfer. I don\u0027t care if it\u0027s magical pixies that carry jars of kethane over, the physics and restrictions are there so it\u0027s good enough for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bradley101","CreatedById":39760,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T21:41:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHelp i have every thing installed but cant find kethane!
