All types of propellant on-board have been depleted, and it seems there is no way to push the ship anywhere. The air/oxygen reserves are not great enough to consider venting air as a viable option. So you have decided there is one option left: to throw the cargo overboard. You figure if you throw individual cargo containers overboard at the right part of your orbit and in the right direction, you just might be able to push the ship out of orbit of this asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the asteroid is itself in high orbit of a planet with a moderately thick atmosphere, and the cargo ship is fully capable of withstanding a descent from orbit to surface with no power or fuel. So all you need to do is nudge your cargo ship a little bit further than out of orbit of the asteroid. We\u0027re also going to assume patched conics are real, so you can gradually throw cargo overboard over the course of several orbits and not have to worry about gradually falling out of orbit. Specifics of the asteroid orbit are not given, as the exercise is to find how much dV you can come up with, and we\u0027ll just assume it\u0027s enough to get the job done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe total mass of the cargo is 10 tons, and the mass of the ship minus the cargo (including you and your snacks) is 1 ton.

Since you will be ideally impulsing at a given point of the orbit (looking for gravitational slingshot), you might be performing one/few launches at the optimum spot every orbit. If you throw one object from an orbit, the resulting orbits of you and the thrown object will be different, but will coincide in the throwing spot. If the resulting periods happen to be armonic, then the object will hit you after so many orbits. Hopefully, the expelled object might collide with the surface, or you might happen to doing a few throws every orbit (not just one at the very precise instant), so you might be a bit higher every orbit at that point. In a bad scenario, the resulting orbit might be a 2:1 armonic, and although you might raise your apo several meters, the impulse spot will just stay 1 inch away, and you will have arrow striking at you at 100 m/s the orbit after (hope it is a blunt hit).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T23:26:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fjarandag\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENot second orbit, projectile turns twice but vessel once\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gm537","CreatedById":66746,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T19:58:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot sure if this is the right section, but I figured it\u0027s a challenge involving spaceflight...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section seems like as good a place as any, there is definitely a type of challenge to it and it\u0027s really unique.

If you throw a single 9 ton container retrograde, the container will have previous_orbital_speed - 10 m/s and your empty ship \u002B90 m/s. Whereas if you throw infinite/many objects of infinitesimal/tiny mass, then Tsiolkovsky/rocket equation is aplicable and you will get 100 * Ln(10/1) = \u002B230.2 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* However, presumably if projectile mass is smaller, thrust is smaller and energy/thrust is less efficient.
