While Tylo does requre an extra step to reach it\u0027s not very hard. Tylo is basically brute force in terms of how much delta-v you need to carry. Moho requires more finese - it does require a good amount of delta-v, but if you are off even a little the delta-v costs skyrocket. I guess I would have to consider the ships required. A ship with enough delta-v for Tylo could do Moho even with mistakes, so I guess I\u0027d have to rate Tylo as the harder one.
