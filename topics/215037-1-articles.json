It\u2019s impossible at this point to tell whether the engine has been staged and is active, or if it\u2019s inactive. Which then leads to the nail biting question, \u201Cif I stage now will I activate the engine? Or drop the next decoupler?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOptimally I\u0027d like for the stage to not expand into the current slot until it has actually been staged. Additionally color coding stages to indicate whether they are active or not would also help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T18:23:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like to have my staging extended all time (KSP1 -like) so definitely some better indication is needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
