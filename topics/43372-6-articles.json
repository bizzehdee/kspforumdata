No, not at all. They don\u0027t even look terribly likely to make a single launch, let alone a dozen of them a year for the next 50 years.

Undoubtedly the lack of oxygen and the calorie restricted nutrient dense diet[49] contributed to low morale.

They considered that would be a project failure by definition.\u003Cp\u003EIn November[when?], the hungry Biospherians began eating emergency food supplies that had not been grown inside the bubble.[50] Poynter made Chris Helms, PR Director for the enterprise, aware of this. She was promptly dismissed by Margret Augustine, CEO of Space Biospheres Ventures, and told to come out of the biosphere. This order was, however, never carried out.
