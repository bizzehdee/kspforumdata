Which itself makes science harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to increase the science rate gain in my career game. I\u0027ve had the bar at 160% when i started the campaign. But its too little to my enjoyment. It started to become a massive grind thus far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny way to edit the career file? Can you guys point out how to do so?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidSquid","CreatedById":196199,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-16T12:13:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your save game files you\u0027ll fine a line \u0022ScienceGainMultiplier =\u0022, maybe try modifying that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs always, have a backup copy, better safe than sorry\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
