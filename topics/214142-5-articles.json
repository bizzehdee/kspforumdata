This is finalized in 2017. Then PD starts looking for a suitable work-for-hire studio to develop KSP2 while SQUAD carries on with KSP1, and settles on Uber, perhaps because of Nate\u0027s pitch.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUber is renamed to Star Theory and starts work on KSP2 in mid to late 2017, with a really optimistic 2-year development cycle. They believe they can do this by building on the KSP1 codebase.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBy mid 2019 it becomes obvious that they can\u0027t deliver. PD starts negotiations with them about how to get the project back on track. These negotiations break down completely, and PD decides to cut bait. However, they still really dig Nate\u0027s pitch/concept and the creative approach, so instead of looking for another work-for-hire studio, they propose to found an internal studio and hire them as the core team. The engineering team doesn\u0027t come with them, either because PD doesn\u0027t\u00A0want them, or because they preferred to stay with ST.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0Early 2020, IG starts building a new engineering team. Some way into that process, but after the regrettable 2021 release date announcement, the new engineering team makes it clear that the codebase is a dead\u00A0end and they need to start over.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClearly the 2021 release date announcement was a bad call. I don\u0027t know what was behind that, but I will point out that at that time it wasn\u0027t Nate or IG calling the shots, it was PD. Maybe PD felt they\u00A0had to announce it for 2021 for internal corporate reasons \u2013 to get the funding to found IG from T2. That kind of thing isn\u0027t unheard-of!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClearly there were other similarly bad calls: the EA was botched \u2013 at the very least in expectations management.\u00A0So on those points we\u0027re in agreement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u0027s also where we part ways. I don\u0027t think KSP2 is built on the KSP1 codebase, and I think it is fundamentally sound \u2013 not\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eexceptionally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0competently managed, produced, or executed, but not exceptionally\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebadly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0either: nobody \u003Cem\u003Ewants\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a buggy alpha, yet somehow non-buggy alphas are the exception in the industry, not the rule. It\u0027s just not\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efinished.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0I\u0027m also pointing out that this is IG\u0027s first release, and even if you have experienced people on board, that\u0027s always going to be difficult and messy. Releasing is a team sport and if a team hasn\u0027t trained together for it \u2013 by, you know,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emaking releases\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u2013 it\u0027s not going to go perfectly smoothly. The studio I\u0027m at has been doing this for a few years now, and just last week we passed certification for all of our platforms (Sony, XBox, Switch) on the first try, a week ahead of schedule \u2013 and we had never managed that before. It took us a lot of practice to get there!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I remain quite optimistic that the project is fundamentally sound, the EA will turn around, we\u0027ll start to see tangible process, and over the next six months to a year they\u0027ll get their release cadence straightened out too. They will learn as they train together. I do recognize that your arguments aren\u0027t entirely without merit and you might be proven right in the end \u2013 but we\u0027ll all see how that plays out.

I\u0027m sure they have data we\u0027d rather not know. For example, why development started from scratch, although there were bases in the 2019 gameplay trailer, and after 2020 we saw some separate buildings of an unclear purpose only a couple of times. We know almost nothing about bases at all in 2023. About the same probability as you claim about a complete restart of development in 2020, I dare say that in 2019 we were shown just base models, and not functioning units.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TackleMcClean","CreatedById":192825,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-11T22:09:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of looking at the code, has there been any theorycrafting regarding the \u0060ReplayFeature\u0060?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketRockington","CreatedById":223189,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-12T01:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224256936\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678533388\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113880\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shdwlrd\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, shdwlrd said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/223189-rocketrockington/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022223189\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/223189-rocketrockington/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RocketRockington\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I have to ask, is there any positives you see within KSP2?
