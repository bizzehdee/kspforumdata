I assume FAR still represents a more realistic and harsh model but from some threads about reentry problems with the new stock aero (speaking about issues I never had with FAR) I could be wrong...\n\nI would love if some of the more informed or accademic players could share some insights as this question can\u0027t be answered with \u0022just try them and chose which you like best\u0022. I would like to know which is the more realistic model and how much different it is as I can\u0027t judge that for myself.\n\nBonus points if you could rate them in comparisson (for example: stock is 5, NEAR is 7 and FAR is 9)."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T11:51:27Z","Content":"Talking about NEAR is irrelevant since it ferram4 will not update it for 1.0"}]}
