Recently I discovered a simple way to estimate the TWR, which is ~1 tonne per 10 thrust. Using this formula I have verified that the launchpad is indeed sticky, as rockets that can hover over the launch pad with 95%\u002B fuel remaining at 40% thrust require sometimes 70% thrust or more to take off initially. If I land these elsewhere, on any other terrain, I do not have this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else noticed this?

TWR is calculated as newtons of thrust divided by newtons of weight. In space, the TWR of your ship as a whole would indicate how many G\u0027s it will accelerate at. So TWR would be calculated, i think, as: (1000 x thrust in kilonewtons ) / (1000 x mass in tonnes x 9.81 N/kg). Which simplifies to thrust in kilonewtons / 9.81 N/kg x mass in tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think thats how it works, but i\u0027m not entirely sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alfondoo","CreatedById":66096,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T12:21:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI ran into this the other day. Testing with various sizes I actually found that if the engine exhaust is touching the launchpad the thrust is effectively \u0022blocked\u0022. If you make a craft small enough, you can actually start with it on the floor and thrust up, you won\u0027t move until you rock the vessel sufficiently to topple it and as soon as the exhaust finds air you\u0027ll lift off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch clamps are a winner.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
