Thanks for your consideration. \n\nEDIT: Please turn on the RCS, the plane doesn\u0027t fly correctly without it. It should be turned on at the same time as guard mode. I also can not determine how to adjust the guard mode settings in the editor, but they should be set to 1/360/3500 before flight, same as the FA-33.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-26T18:43:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2015 06:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CreativeCombat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T23:28:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8ruciv5gwixju8n/AABmDCtbM8OZYqoccVQr12fBa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8ruciv5gwixju8n/AABmDCtbM8OZYqoccVQr12fBa?dl=0)\n\u003E I made a series of planes, this picture is of the first one that could fly. \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/nKygxYO](http://imgur.com/nKygxYO)\n\u003E \n\u003E This is of the most successful variation of the final version. \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/YMTvrKy](http://imgur.com/YMTvrKy) \n\u003E \n\u003E If Alphasus would consider adding it to his tournament, I would much appreciate it as I\u0027d love to see my planes in action against others so I can improve them.
