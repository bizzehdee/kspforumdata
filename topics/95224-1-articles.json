I was thinking it might be a fun little challenge to see if you could build a really big space station, and then get from one end of it to another without using EVA fuel at all. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T05:43:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be possible, but it would be a very boring trek of just...climbing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T08:52:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should add in this mod for the challenge:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8bOlpwHSj0?start=485\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eedit: I think that might be the video you were talking about\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-01T08:55:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2015 08:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chengong","CreatedById":118810,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T16:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a better idea, how about a challenge to see if one can swim to the island runway?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ihtoit","CreatedById":78942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T02:16:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok, how\u0027s this for a variation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need the B9 mod, specifically the HX parts. I just got through thowing together a 242-part ship, including struts, which not only got to orbit, but did it with a pad mass of OVER 6,000 tons and yes, because I was using the awesome plasma engines (I have a new favourite engine!) used 96% of the fuel it went up with - final orbital mass (hence payload) at 100km was 980 tons. Physically, even on the pad it\u0027s mostly space (as designed, I wanted a traversible internal space which I got with the hollow structural parts), so when I say it\u0027s BIG, you\u0027ll need to use LOTS of launch clamps for launching ANYTHING HX.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo screenies this time, but when I get round to a big ship mission in my 365 campaign, HX is where I\u0027ll be going! Awesomely big, awesomely powerful ships (I mean, 27MN!?
