And fun is the whole point of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve said it dozens of times, and I\u0027ll say it dozens more: Science in KSP is a perfect example of of a failed new feature in a computer game. It\u0027s not fun. And that\u0027s not because it\u0027s not finished. Making it fun can\u0027t be done by adding more biomes, or more science parts, because the thing that isn\u0027t fun is the core mechanic involved. Click a button to open a dialog box. Click another button to close it. Repeat endlessly. More parts and more biomes just mean more of the same. I think the whole concept of science must be fundamentally reworked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Squad pulled resources, they thought the same thing. They felt that resources weren\u0027t fun, that the whole idea of resources, if it was going to be included at all, needed to be fundamentally reworked if it was going to be fun. And that was probably a good call.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, coming up with ideas that are fun is not at all easy. Felipe came up with one fundamentally fantastically fun idea: Allow people to build rockets using a bunch of parts, like lego, and then allow them to fly said rockets. All of the construction, all of the launching, all the way up to your first landing on the Mun, is the player engaging this fundamentally fun challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then, there has only really been one new and fundamentally fun gameplay element added to KSP*: More complex intercepts. Interplanetary transfers, gravity assists, ship to ship intercepts (which turns into docking when you combine this idea with the first). This engages the player in a different challenge: the challenge of working with orbital mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETangent time: Notice that these are also the two \u0022hard\u0022 things about KSP. Building rockets is challenging and fun. Orbital mechanics is challenging and fun. Felipe has been quoted as saying that at first they weren\u0027t sure whether they should keep all of the orbital mechanics, intercepts, and stuff, because they were worried it was too complex. But it\u0027s the complex things that are challenging, and it\u0027s the challenges that are fun. This truth often seems to be forgotten when people claim that certain other ideas, if included, would make the game too complex (like any additional heads up or heads down telemetry and vessel information, or life support, or transmission that required line of sight between relays).\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we want resources to really be fun, then there has to be a vision greater than \u0022land on planet with appropriate part attached to ship. Press button. Turn on physics warp. Wait.\u0022 There\u0027s no additional challenges created by this. There\u0027s no additional gameplay other than the clicking of yet another dialog box. This is what Squad realised when they shelved the resource plans. This is what Felipe meant when he said that \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPeople feel that once you land on another planet, there isn\u0027t much else to do.

Most ideas were just alterations to the processing flowchart that Squad had presented. The flowchart itself was never the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some considerations that I think might be worthwhile when trying to come up with a really inspired system for \u0022resources\u0022:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Resource production and resource consumption are obviously linked in terms of game mechanics. So whatever \u0022resources\u0022 might end up being, it seems like it would be worth thinking about \u0022supply\u0022 mechanics at the same time. Think of this as some form of life support mechanic.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Resources and resource usage need not merely be \u0022in situ\u0022, change your paradigm and consider that it can have an effect on the game as a whole. Perhaps the Mun is the only place that has some critical component material needed to produce RTG\u0027s, so in career mode your supply of RTG\u0027s is limited by your ability to bring back RTG materials from the Mun. And so on for other, more advanced, parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Bases are \u0022pointless\u0022 in KSP right now in the sense that they are merely static works of art in a static world. A base that \u0022gathers resources\u0022 is also, however, pretty worthless if it is only gathering it for its own use. But imagine if you had to supply the base yourself? Imagine if Ike could *not* sustain a base, but Duna had the stuff needed to support an Ike base. Resources and life support would combine to increase the variety of challenges: Now you need your Ike base to have a large \u0022snacks\u0022 container so you don\u0027t have to constantly resupply it. Now you have a gameplay reason to learn how to do precision landings next to other objects. Now your base is an organic, changing part of your save, not just a static work of space art.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are just some of the kinds of very high level, broad ideas that I think would need to be fleshed out before any resource mechanic was a really worthwhile thing to pursue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E* Arguably there have been a couple more - aircraft parts for atmospheric flight, rover parts for rovers.

This would allow smaller vessels to make interplanetary trips. The purpose of this style of resource mining is to allow players the option of either continuing to rely Kerbin for all fuel resoures \u003Cem\u003EOR\u003C/em\u003E setting up a more complex logistics system using ISRU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrbital construction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The surface of Kerbin is the second worst place in the Kerbol system from which to launch vessels into orbit, after the the surface of Eve (not including the surface of Jool, which isn\u0027t supposed to really exist). If other resources (e.g. Metal, silicon, blutonium, etc) were included in the game, either on asteroids or on planets, then vessels could be built in space using these resources. This would allow players to choose to spend resources launching missions with relatively inefficient launch vehicles, \u003Cem\u003EOR\u003C/em\u003E spend resources on a getting an off-world refinery/construction site started to boot-strap up a more efficient launch site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m recommending these options because \u003Cem\u003Ethese options could be completely ignorable\u003C/em\u003E if balanced right.
