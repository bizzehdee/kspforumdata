The plan was to install 0.9, have a short look at it, try out a few things and get a feeling for the controls. You know, so when 1.0 arrives I would be able to dive right into it. Well, that didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t quite work out as of now I have already played 34 hours and will probably play many more before 1.0 comes out. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just of these games that you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t put aside once you started. Last Friday I intended to play until around 9pm and then watch a movie before going to bed around midnight, but when I quit KSP the clock was showing 5am the next day \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E So far I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve done dozens of orbiting missions around Kerbal, Mun and Minmus, landed on Mun four times and on Minmus twice. Well, and I guess I will do a few more Mun missions during the week to unlock some more techs and then have a shot at Duna on the weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I should have known that I would not be able to just have a short look at it. See, I am absolutely passionate about everything about space and the exploration of it. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve spent hundreds of hours watching documentaries, reading books and articles about space and space exploration. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m also a science fiction fan, having watched hundreds of movies and TV series and read dozens of novels. And you know what else I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m absolutely passionate about? Computer games! Now you do the math.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I really enjoy about KSP it that it is both fun and challenging. It\u0027s easy to learn the game, but hard to master it. And it has a really good difficulty curve where each new mission incorporates well known elements that are no problem by now, but also new challenges that need some serious figuring out and probably testing to get right. And there is also a high feeling of accomplishment when you get it right. When I first went to the Mun with a completely new and untested heavy rocket and made it there, had a perfect landing and got back to Kerbin with the last drop of fuel (meaning my guestimating about the fuel needed for the mission was absolutely spot on) I felt like the king of the world \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E By now Mun landings are almost routine (having done 4 so far), but still every one of them feels great and I have made multiple screenshots of every single one because I was so damned proud seeing my lander standing there on the surface with Bob Kerman standing next to it grinning all over his face \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course it can be absolutely hilarious at times. Once I had a rocket that was too heavy for its first stage, so it didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t lift and only sat there on the pad. I then thought **** it and hit stage 2 so at least I would see some pretty fireworks before I had to go back to redesign the rocket. As expected the whole thing exploded in an epic fireball, boosters flying of in all directions and the landing pat blew up too. But when the smoke cleared you know what was still there, lying on the destroyed pad? The capsule, with Bob Kerman in it, smiling like a child at christmas...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, fantastic game, even though it isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t finished. But with the help of all these fantastic mods here on the forum the time until more features are added can be easely bridged. I will be playing this for hundreds of hours at the least and will be having a fantastic time planting Kerbal flags all over the system. And if time allows I will show up in some of the threads here as it seems to me that you have a really great community here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echeers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T14:52:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard the forums!

Well, all I managed to achieve during all that time and after countless complete failures (as in not even reaching Kerbin orbit) was a rocket that barely made it into orbit with the help of the transfer stage (you now, the one that should only be used for transfer). So the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Clander\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 had to fire its engines during transfer because the transfer stage didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have enough fuel left after I had to use it for achieving orbit around Kerbin. Therefore the mission was reduced to an incredibly expensive Duna orbiting mission. And I had barely enough fuel left to make it back. I actually had to put the ship into an elliptical orbit with a periapsis within Kerbins atmosphere so the ship would gradually slow down each revolution and finally deorbit by itself. Man was that mission a failure (and the deorbiting was tedious as hell). But then I went to the wiki, read a few things about engine efficiency and rocket design and now I have a rocket that makes it into Kerbin orbit with the intended stage and with fuel to spare. Funny thing is, the rocket is now about 50% lighter but still has about the same payload. Funny because until now I was under the impression that if my rocket doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t make it into orbit the solution would be to add more fuel, more thrusters, bigger thrusters, more stages etc. Well, apparently not *g* \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t use any math or mods that help with construction though, because I think it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s much more fun (and more rewarding) just guestimating what is needed, test that stuff, watch it explode in hilarious ways and then go back to vehicle assembly and adjust it until it works.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T14:06:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 02:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by theoneandonlyboiler\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
