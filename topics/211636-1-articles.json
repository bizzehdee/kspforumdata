I do not have enough delta V to get back to kerbin. But I do have a communication satellite orbiting the mun, and 2 comm. satellites orbiting kerbin. I thought I\u2019d be able to use the mun comm. sat. as a relay for my science data. can\u2019t seem to transmit data back to kerbin. Got me wondering if it\u2019s possible. So is it?
