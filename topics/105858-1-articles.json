I\u0027ll have to go back to my old Heat Transfer and Aerodynamics textbooks to confirm but for now:\n\u003E [http://www.thermopedia.com/content/291/](http://www.thermopedia.com/content/291/)\n\u003E \n\u003E Equation (2) and (3), since it\u0027s Air, and you want an accurate model you need to use the compressibility equations. However, it can quickly spiral out, since in that equation is also depend son the Prandtl number but only for certain ranges of Prandtl numbers. We don\u0027t want to have to do CFD for all of this, so a line must be drawn somewhere.\n\nYour source says:\n\nq=h(T\\_w-T\\_r)\n\nwith \n\nT\\_r = T\\_atm \u002B1/2\\* r\\*V^2/Cp\n\nMy formula is:\n\nq=C0\\*rho\\*V\\*(V^2 - 2\\*Cp\\*(T\\_w - T\\_atm))\n\nif we make the simplification that r=1 everywhere (an overestimate), then we can substitute T\\_atm = T\\_r - 1/2\\*V^2/Cp\n\nq=C0\\*rho\\*V\\*(V^2 - 2\\*Cp\\*(T\\_w - T\\_r \u002B 1/2\\*V^2/Cp))\n\nq=C0\\*rho\\*V\\*(V^2 - 2\\*Cp\\*(T\\_w - T\\_r) - V^2)\n\nq=2\\*C0\\*rho\\*V\\*Cp\\*(T\\_w-T\\_r)\n\nso **our formulations are equivalent** and your h = 2\\*C0\\*rho\\*V\\*Cp\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T15:35:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 03:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87**"}]}
