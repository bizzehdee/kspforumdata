These mods make the game more than just building rockets and hurling them into space. They force you to concern yourself with more things than just the default when playing the game, but not necessarily in an obsessive numerical sort of way. I\u0027ve never enjoyed mods that force large volumes of calculations on the player. Some like that, but I don\u0027t. As I was perusing the list of mods today, a couple thoughts occurred to me for potential mods. Now, I don\u0027t have the knowledge to mod them into the game itself (I\u0027m a programmer, but I have no experience modding KSP or Unity and haven\u0027t the time to learn any time in the near future), but nonetheless, I figured sharing them might be a good idea. Who knows, perhaps something such as them already exists and I simply don\u0027t know of it. Anyways, without further ado, here are my ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESalaries \u0026amp; Skills\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOverview\u003C/strong\u003E: All hired Kerbals are now paid a salary.
