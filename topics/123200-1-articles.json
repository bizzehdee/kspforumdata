So you can save quite a bit of fuel on you rescue ship if you don\u0027t bother to match velocities. Just go sailing past at a relative velocity of up to 200 m/s or so. As soon as you get within 2.3 km, immediately switch to the shipwreck via [ or ], go EVA, and match the kerbal\u0027s velocity to the ship instead of vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T02:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbals on rescue don\u0027t become yours until you \u0022load\u0022 them (get within....1500m?) so you reloading your save may have reverted him being loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I encourage [, or ]. they are invaluable \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
