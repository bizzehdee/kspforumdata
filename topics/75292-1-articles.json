The first is an Excel spreadsheet of blast and thermal effects; I\u0027ve never used it, since I don\u0027t have Excel, but it\u0027s reputedly quite good. However, the ones I really recommend are the other pair of calculators, a couple of closely-related programs used (possibly to this day!) by the US Defense Nuclear Agency, which calculate the effects of nuclear (and, for BLAST.EXE, non-nuclear) explosions. They have a wide range of capabilities and a LOT of options for customization of the simulated burst (read, re-read, and re-re-read the help screens, because they provide huge amounts of useful documentation for this!), including the type of weapon (pure fission, boosted fission, or fission-triggered fusion, and different efficiency categories for each, plus \u0022clean\u0022 and \u0022dirty\u0022 configurations for the fusion weapons), the burst height, and the type of surface at the burst point (used in calculating cratering effects). However, because they *are* DOS programs from 1984, they aren\u0027t the most user-friendly. However, they should run in any version of Windows I know of (not sure about 8, but I know that up through 7, you can run them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the burst height setting is also one of the most important in there; most of the calculators out there \u0022assume optimum burst height,\u0022 but the definition of \u0022optimum\u0022 varies depending on what you\u0027re trying to maximize. These calculators generally maximize the 5psi blast radius, to provide maximum casualty numbers. While this may be appropriate for some targets (particularly if the war goes into a countervalue mode where you\u0027re attacking cities and industrial sites rather than military targets, and for airfields without Hardened Aircraft Shelters), most nuclear weapons targets are highly hardened and would require a different (lower) burst height, to maximize the radius of the pressure curve that would cause failure of those targets. Some examples would be how most US nuclear missile silos are reputedly hardened to withstand an overpressure of 500 psi, while some Russian silos are hardened to 2000 psi(!); the US silos would require a very low burst height indeed, while the Russian ones would almost require that the silo itself be caught within the fireball, mandating a surface burst to destroy them. Likewise, command and control bunkers would generally require surface bursts to dig them out and collapse them. While all of these (except the Excel spreadsheet and BLAST.EXE) provide some estimates of fallout radius, that isn\u0027t entirely accurate, as they don\u0027t account for downwind drift of fallout and really only show the short-term fallout zone, not the areas that would be contaminated in the 6-36 hour period. Also, *none* of these (and as far as I can tell, *no* publicly-available tools) provide prediction of the effects of high-altitude bursts intended to generate EMP effects; the best rule of thumb there is to use geometry to find the line-of-sight radius to the burst and then assume that all non-hardened solid-state electronics within that circle are fried. (Radiation/EMP-hardened electronics, like used by military forces, and old-fashioned vacuum tube-based hardware can both survive within that radius, but if they\u0027re close enough to the burst point, then the induced currents in the copper wiring itself will still fry it. Again, just a rule of thumb, but I\u0027d say about a 150-mile circle around the burst point would have high enough EMP to do that.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there are four truly important things to remember when writing your hypothetical war\u0027s target list and weapons allocations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) What is the target each weapon is being used for? Unless it\u0027s either the 1950s (with the doctrine of \u0022Massive Attack\u0022 in place), a punitive retaliatory strike by a nation already devastated by an attack, or a madman terrorist out to kill as many people as possible, cities will generally NOT be targets. \u0022Countervalue\u0022 strikes (i.e., strikes aimed at industrial infrastructure and the civilian population, meant to devastate the recipient\u0027s economy and chances of postwar recovery) are not only distasteful and quite possibly war crimes, but they\u0027re also inefficient in the use of weapons, particularly as a first strike option, as they leave your enemy entirely capable of responding in kind. \u0022Counterforce\u0022 strikes (i.e., strikes aimed at \u0022blunting, reducing, and degrading\u0022 the enemy\u0027s warfighting capability in general, and nuclear forces in particular) are seen as vastly preferable, as they not only have the potential for limiting the level of violence employed (ICBM silos, for example, tend to be located in thinly-populated agricultural and undeveloped areas, so hitting them causes relatively few casualties), but every successful strike decreases the enemy\u0027s capability to retaliate. (Command, control, and communications centers also fall under \u0022counterforce\u0022 targets, though they tend to be located in closer proximity to population centers, as do airbases and submarine bases. However, even those would likely generate less violent retaliation because of the presence of obvious military targets being struck at.) The first step is to determine what targets need to be hit, and ranking them in priority so that you know which wave of attacks they\u0027re hit in. (Again, economy of force and controlling the level of violence to try and avoid spiralling out of control into Armageddon are keys to selecting waves of strikes, as the idea is that you launch a strike, then there\u0027s a pause as you give the enemy a chance to surrender before launching your next wave.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Once you have your target list completed, you need to know what sort of effects are required to destroy each one. This has a direct effect on how you attack it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) You then need to determine the burst height that maximizes the radius of the effects curve matching that. If a given weapon\u0027s ideal burst height for a given target results in an effects circle smaller than the Circular Error Probability of the weapon (a measure of accuracy; CEP is defined as the radius around the aimpoint within which there\u0027s a 50% chance of the weapon actually hitting), then you almost certainly need to select a larger and/or more accurate weapon. After all, if the odds say that the weapon will land far enough away from its target to *not* destroy it, there\u0027s not much point in firing in the first place! (Note that accuracy is likely better than yield; the US no longer stockpiles the 9-megaton \u0022city killer\u0022 warheads used on the Titan II ICBMs, or even the 1-megaton warheads used on early Minuteman ICBMs, instead preferring strategic weapons in the 125-550 kiloton range with much greater accuracy, as it\u0027s possible to have many more of them. Likewise, for \u0022soft\u0022 area targets like cities, simulations have shown that it\u0027s more cost-effective, in terms of building the warheads, to blanket them with a pattern of smaller weapons than to try to use a single huge one. We do still have some weapons up to 5 megatons or so, but those are for special purposes like digging out deep command bunkers with a series of surface bursts. Russia still has a limited number of 20-megaton weapons that were specifically designed to collapse Cheyenne Mountain, but those are similarly special-purpose weapons, and efforts since 1970 or so in all nuclear powers have been more towards increasing the weapon accuracy and decreasing the warhead size.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Once you\u0027ve determined what your target is, how \u0022hard\u0022 it is, and what the appropriate weapon and burst height to destroy it are, you have one last major consideration--what is the reliability of the weapon system? Just how likely is it that the whole thing will operate as planned and put the warhead within the CEP circle? Manned bombers, for example, are extremely good at putting the weapon on target--IF they can get past the enemy\u0027s air defenses. Ballistic missiles, on the other hand, are more likely to suffer random errors (particularly due to the winds aloft during boost and entry) that throw the weapon off-target, but are very hard to defend against. Cruise missiles combine the worst of BOTH worlds(!), albeit with some amelioration in each (small, hard-to-find targets for air defenses, and their autopilots will correct for wind drift to some degree). All options have a nonzero chance of failure of the delivery system (ICBM/SLBM blows up during boost, cruise missile autopilot has its gyros tumble and dives into the ground, manned bomber\u0027s crew is killed by radiation from a nearby burst or just plain gets lost, etc.), and there\u0027s also a small, but still nonzero, chance of the weapon itself failing to function at all, or of fizzling and not producing full yield. Once you figure out the odds of everything working right, getting the weapon to its targeted burst point and the weapon firing as designed, you can then use that to work out how many weapons you actually need to use to reduce the target\u0027s odds of survival to an acceptably low number (i.e., \u0022guarantee\u0022 target destruction). Again, this may end up seriously affecting the choice of weapon, as what would otherwise look like a highly attractive option might not be reliable enough to be viable given the size of your inventory--particularly if you\u0027re in a situation where political authorities have authorized a limited number of weapons to be released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that you need to run all four of these considerations past EVERY TARGET to decide what gets hit, when it gets hit, what it gets hit with, and how many are aimed at it. Only after you know all these things for EVERY target on the list can you really say what the war will end up looking like. (You may also be surprised to see what you thought were certain targets end up being passed up as being too much trouble and/or too expensive in the number/size of warheads required...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d personally recommend that you get a copy of the old game \u0022Bravo Romeo Delta,\u0022 a US/Russia strategic nuclear war simulator set in the late 80s/early 90s, which may not be the *most* accurate out there, but playing it repeatedly will give you insight into the sort of decisions that go into nuclear war planning and help with defining your target list and weapon assignments...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T15:22:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Ireland, we have a simple plan - tune to Radio 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow consider that we in Ireland referred to World War 2 as \u0022the Emergency\u0022, and a 3-decade paramilitary struggle as \u0027the Troubles\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not trying to be flippant, but in the event of nuclear war, I pretty much expect to tune into Radio 1, to find Joe Duffy explaining how to put on sunscreen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BadRocketsCo.","CreatedById":101686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T19:21:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, rdfox, you have done a lot of homework \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E .
