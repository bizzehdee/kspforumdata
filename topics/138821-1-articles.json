I don\u0027t know how many others have had this problem, but I have received lots of crashes while in the editor, mostly CTDs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile watching my Task Manager, the RAM usage would go up fairly high. So I put -force-d3d11 in the command line, and what do you know, it reduced both the amount of RAM being used (like it always did) and the amount of crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this post is just to say that, if you\u0027re suffering crashes, try that command line, and it just may help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
