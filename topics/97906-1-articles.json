This presumably still works with asteroids, as I went through the asteroid redirect tutorial again to make sure it worked there. That doesn\u0027t appear to be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is an issue is that I can apparently no longer target center of mass for debris. I know all about how the AGU is supposed to work - attach, use free pivot to target centre of mass, lock, and you\u0027re good to manipulate the object\u0027s path using engines/RCS/whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy can I no longer do this with debris? Reddit user nguyenco replied with the following statement to that question: \u0022As of the latest update, I don\u0027t think that you can target the center of mass of debris.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes no sense to me for a number of reasons. It renders the AGU relatively useless compared to the way it was before, while still retaining (To my knowledge) the nonsensical flaws that it has always had in the past. Being able to rescue stranded Kerbals, or being able to transfer fuel, or being able to control the engines/SAS/RCS of the debris come to mind as examples of this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite all of that, apparently it\u0027s now impossible to know the CoM for a spent stage, but you can approach an asteroid and somehow magically know where it\u0027s CoM is without doing science of some sort? Where is the logic - even the Kerbal logic - in something like that? There is none.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast but not least, I can\u0027t find mention of them changing the AGU in any of the changelogs, nor on the KSP Wiki. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s going on with this? Is this a bug? Did Squad change it and not put it in the changelog? If they did, why would they make a change like that, which makes absolutely no sense?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your time and any replies you might be able to give me!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T22:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo changes that I know of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you target anything, it\u0027s the CoM that is targetted, isn\u0027t it?

The only thing I\u0027m allowed to target when approaching the debris is the stack seperator, which is of course nowhere near the center of mass. I\u0027ve tried right clicking all over the debris, and I get nothing. Once the AGU attaches, it stops treating the debris as a target as it becomes part of the ship, and I therefore lose the ability to try and target it\u0027s CoM - not that I can figure out how anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your suggestion about lateral movement, I presume you mean using RCS to try and translate in some direction other than forward and backwards? I\u0027ll try that out but I don\u0027t see how that would actually align the CoM... Doesn\u0027t make sense to me just thinking about it, but I\u0027ll give it a shot in a couple of hours and report back when I\u0027ve tried it. Even if it does work, it still doesn\u0027t explain why I can\u0027t target CoM to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Genesis6496943","CreatedById":136717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T05:57:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060ve had no luck with aligning with the CoM by pulling or moving laterally along any axis, or by combining the two.
