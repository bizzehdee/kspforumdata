It allows superior performance in Molten Salt Reactors, but at the expense of higher Actinide production. Not that the latter should actually be a problem- Molten Salt Reactors are currently being studied for use as \u0022garbage disposal reactors\u0022 much like the current CANDU heavy-water reactors, and should be able to burn Actinides for ThermalPower as long as new Uranium/Thorium continues to get mixed in (the Actinides have to form part of a fuel-mix with Uranum or Thorium, they won\u0027t burn on their own...) Theoretically, a Molten Salt Reactor would never have to actually remove any Actinides- it could just keep adding fresh Uranium/Thorium in and burning up the existing Actinide wastes for additional efficiency. Thermal Power production would be reduced as a result however...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich reminds me, does anybody have some good data on the relative Thermal Power and reactor temperatures that would theoretically be achieved by running a Molten Salt Reactor actinide-rich (such as to consume the Actinides as reactor fuel) as opposed to filtering out the actinides? I believe ThermalPower declines substantially, but reactor temperature increases somewhat- and my initial instincts are to estimate the decreases in ThermalPower and increase in reactor temperature at around 20-30% (vs. Uranium at the very high levels of enrichment that would be utilized for rocketry applications) and 5-10%, respectively.
