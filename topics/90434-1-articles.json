There should also be parts to increase the capsules monopropellant stores, it charge capacity, and//or its reaction wheel strength. Each part would also have to have a volume stat, and placing parts would be akin to a jigsaw puzzle, for example if you strip out all the instruments from the Mk1 capsule, perhaps there would be enough excess internal volume for two kerbals, (but you would need to add batteries and reaction wheels outside the capsule). On the other hand you coal make you\u0027re Mk1 capsule have barely enough room for one kerbal but fill it up with life-support, RPM, etc (with the associated mods) and different stock instruments, radar altimeter, navball, etc. Fully customizable capsules (and probes) would make an excellent addition to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seshins","CreatedById":71258,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T00:23:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Every much like this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T00:46:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould be good for a Science Module as well.
