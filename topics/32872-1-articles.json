Still not sure why he left. I miss him. Anthony (Damion Rayne) I think was one of the best community managers I\u0027ve ever seen a game have. My guess is there was a lot of non public ridicule during the website blow up that wiped all our posts back several months and had the site down for a long time. But I never saw any public vitriol and in fact saw a lot of gratitude for his hard work getting everything back up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
