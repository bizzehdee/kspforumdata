If you don\u0027t mind putting in some design and assembly work, you can make a functional payload amazingly small and light. There\u0027s a community of balloonists in the UK that goes utterly crazy at this, and they make their designs pretty public.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Make sure Jeb is well affixed to the payload, to avoid what happened to ours at 1:37:14 in the video:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/hNh9qFLP9ts?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual, plastic Jeb was a bit of an afterthought on our mission, the University at Buffalo Nanosat/SEDS Joint Experimental Balloon (which was launched to measure radio noise levels for a proposed 2.4 GHz link for our cubesat). He was a totally unauthorized model cranked out from our 3D printer in clear and green PLA, then decorated with white-out and Sharpie. The visor on his helmet was from a $1 pair of sunglasses, and was intended to serve as a mirror for watching the envelope during flight. It ended up misaligned enough that you could only see the edge of the envelope once in a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShortly after the balloon burst, it becomes evident that Jeb and his carefully engineered mounting structure (i.e. some foam, tape, hot glue, and a scrap of 1/8\u0022 all-thread that we slapped together in about 2 minutes) were aerodynamically unstable, and the resulting vibration fatigued the mount to the point of failure after about 25 seconds. Starting around 26km altitude, Jeb then conducted an unplanned, independent descent toward an unknown (and likely subterranean) resting place in rural New York. While this may be a completely appropriate fate for a Kerbal, we want to make sure it does not happen again. It was pure luck that we didn\u0027t end up reading about somebody getting impaled by a plastic space alien on a metal rod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T22:42:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s exactly what I was thinking about.
