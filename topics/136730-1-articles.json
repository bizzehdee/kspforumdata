I can best explain this with some storyboards:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBrett is performing a 2-day mission in space to study the effects of microwaving popcorn in microgravity. His craft needs water, food, oxygen, CO2 scrubbers, and waste disposal facilities, but isn\u0027t fitted with exercise or washing facilities. His mission is short enough they\u0027re not needed, he can always shower when he gets back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJenna is undertaking a six month mission investigating a strange monolith. Her craft is equipped with similar facilities to Brett\u0027s above, but also includes water recycling, two dozen boxes of wet-wipes, and some jumbo-sized rubber bands. The first shower back on Kerbal will be amazing, and getting used to full gravity again will be tough, but manageable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nZorblax is the machine intelligence managing an off-world colony. The colonists have access to centripetal gravity, full gym facilities, showers that don\u0027t require breathing masks to use, and an enriched environment with entertainment and socialisation facilities. Nobody wants to go home, and some colonists were born here in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea would be that kerbals have (optional) strength, hygiene, mental, and physical health stats. Facilities provide both a set-point that these stats move toward (showers are better than wet-wipes), and also determine the rate at which that decay occurs (being in space for prolonged periods will cause your mental health to suffer, but a well-stocked library and crew members you like will slow the rate at which it happens).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFacilities may require resources to run (water, wet-wipes, electricity, etc), may produce waste, and may be limited in how many kerbals they can support. Kerbals being low in one stat may influence others: a lack of hygiene or strength and influence mental and physical health.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn advanced mechanic may be that having different types of facilities provides bonuses over a single facility. Having a library *and* a videophone is better than either one on its own. Standard rations may be fine for keeping you alive, but mixing in some freeze-dried ice-cream and tubes of vegemite can add variety and influence mental health appropriately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe end goal for me is that when planning a long voyage, or a station with long-term residency, I have to think more about facilities over the basics of food, water, oxygen, and waste. And even if I do, then kerbonauts will still need to come home eventually for health reasons, unless my station is so amazing it\u0027s become a full and enriched habitat (which would be a serious megaproject).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nippie1995","CreatedById":154866,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T22:28:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222510965\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136730\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460515805\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022148336\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022anxcon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 13 april 2016 at 4:50 AM, anxcon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntechnically already works atleast to a point, in config i can add a stat bar \u0022Hygiene\u0022 and resource \u0022Water\u0022, when water not consumed hygiene falls, low enough and death effect fires - so the only bit \u0022new\u0022 is adding a disease effect.....which i have no idea what itd do besides death \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\u0022\u003EWell, every shortage of a resource just causes death.

There, along with the other bars, stands \u0022Hygiene\u0022 or \u0022Cleanity\u0022, even if that is not a real word. It says 100%. As soon as you run out of a certain ressource, f.e. \u00A0Disinfectation Liquid, that \u0022Hygiene\u0022 bar will drop. And when it drops below 40%, your Kerbal has a chance of getting a disease. Now the Kerbals UI also has a\u00A0bar which says \u0022Health\u0022. Once that will drop below 50%, your Kerbal will \u0022die\u0022, but without the death part. Which means that he wont be able to control the ship, do EVA\u0027s and so on, but if you give him medicine, his health bar will fill up again. Although when you dont give him medicine, and the bar reaches 0%, he will actually die. There is also a change that when there are other Kerbals with a\u00A0sick Kerbal in a habitat, they will get the disease too. It could even transfer between habitats. As long as a Kerbal is sick, he carries the disease with him, meaning that moving between habitats wouldn\u0027t be a good idea, since that could infect other Kerbals.
