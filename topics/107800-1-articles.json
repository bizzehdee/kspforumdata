The RMB seems to lose functionality randomly, disabling my ability to look around with the camera. Everything else continues to work fine, and nothing appears in the debug menu. This happens randomly in almost any screen where you use the RMB to look around. (Space Center, Tracking Station, and in Flight.) I have not however seen it occur in the VAB or SPH. I can\u0027t seem to pin a time that it occurs. Sometimes it\u0027s fifteen seconds into my first launch after booting up my game, sometimes I don\u0027t taste it until two hours into my play session when I\u0027m in the VAB designing my third rocket of the day)\n\nWhen I first encountered the problem (back in 0.90) I thought that the only way to deal with it was to restart KSP. As time went on, I tried closing applications in the background when the bug occurred. This seemed to stop it from occurring and even restored functionality to my mouse when I did so with the game open.\n\nI then found that the bug would occur even if there was nothing going on in the background, so I tried *opening* another application. This would fix it as well. This then transitioned into *doing something* in an application. (Generally whenever it occurs now, I open Itunes and play a few seconds of a song, stop it, then return to the game to restore my ability to look around.) While not game-breaking, it is extremely annoying.\n\nI still can\u0027t figure out what causes this, perhaps something to do with how the game is reading input."}]}
