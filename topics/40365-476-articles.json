Is nobody else having this issue after updating to 0.25?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: It seems that only certain vessels are causing this. I was clicking on the craft that I was running my Duna mission on and it seems to be one of the \u0022corrupted\u0022 vessels. A bunch of my other satcoms and such seem to be working okay. When in the tracking station, and I click one of the \u0022corrupted\u0022 vessels, I lose the ability to click any any other vessels, hence thinking all of them were borked.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-12T17:12:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2014 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Atrius129\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T17:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth MechJeb and SCANSat add extra nodes without having Treeloader... can whatever method they use be adapted to KPSI?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cairan","CreatedById":85361,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T17:41:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xfrankie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xfrankie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that the Vista is further down the science tree, but there\u0027s not much point in using anything else once you get it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes there is, the D/T Vista will kill kerbals on EVA or on nearby ships, so I always put a nice pair of maneuvering engines such as plasmas or attilas so that I can efficiently match velocities during rendez-vous without having the engine cut on me at a distance of 2.5 km from the target...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ABZB","CreatedById":98947,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T18:04:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerekL1963\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DerekL1963\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBoth MechJeb and SCANSat add extra nodes without having Treeloader... can whatever method they use be adapted to KPSI?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethey don\u0027t add new nodes, rather they, like KSPI, have features that trigger on purchase of specific nodes - but they use existing stock nodes only.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArcFurnace","CreatedById":109240,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T18:07:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerekL1963\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DerekL1963\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBoth MechJeb and SCANSat add extra nodes without having Treeloader... can whatever method they use be adapted to KPSI?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose aren\u0027t true \u0022extra\u0022 nodes; Squad added empty nodes to the end of the tech tree, costing 1000 science each.

We could rearrange the stock tree, particularly those top-level \u0022experimental\u0022 nodes, but that would break any other mod that uses them (IIRC KW Rocketry in particular has quite a few parts on the Experimental Rocketry node).
