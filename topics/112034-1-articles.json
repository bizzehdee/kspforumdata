I jumped up a jet only plane out of the atmosphere so it had a suborbital trajectory with a few minutes in space. I had a capsule waiting in orbit to rendezvous and dock with it, only problem was I forgot the docking port on the plane so I had to guess the center of mass and push it. When I intercepted the plane we were just about to fall into the atmosphere so I didn\u0027t have much time. It was really hard to find the right spot to push the craft so I lost more altitude than I had hoped. Once I found the right spot we were around 55km and I was sweating like a teenager talking to a girl with my heart racing in my chest. I gently built up the thrust to 100 so I wouldn\u0027t lose the spot and managed to push it out of the atmosphere to a 200\u002B apoapsis(there was no time to check the map view).

A third contract was there to collect science around the sun. Perfect, I can kill three birds with one rocket, and make about a million kerbitsBucksUnits doing it. I spent a lot of time designing and testing the vessel, deciding it should be a science base. I don\u0027t have any docking ports unlocked yet, so it wouldn\u0027t be feasible, or at least easy, to do a return mission. But why not make it a permanent base, I haven\u0027t tried out the new daily remote science thingy.

All good, I may have to wait a full orbit to get to a point where I can plot an intercept, but Kerbals would rather wait in space for that kind of thing than on the ground. But while I\u0027m waiting, why not fulfill that contract to collect science around Kerbol. So, I open container that holds the little sciency bits on the hopper, and notice that it clips through the tanks I added last minute. It shakes and shudders, but holds together. Darn it, I hate that. That\u0027s what you get for last minute additions; that is management doing something without consulting the engineering section, bypassing quality control.

Couldn\u0027t do it, impossible. Like, needle on another planet\u0027s haystack sort of impossible. But I found a willing rookie one-star pilot willing to sacrifice her life. Or at least her free time. So, with the remaining science I had saved up (I don\u0027t always spend it in one place) I researched the Claw. Built a simple ship: lots of gas, and a section that will detach with a new lander can and sciency bits. Launch. Get to orbit, plan trajectory and full-throttle. Upon leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI, I plan and execute a trajectory that gets me to within 12,000 km but at about a 30* angle of the Ike mission ship. But we\u0027re learning stuff here, lets try it. About halfway through the plotted course I make some little adjustments along the 6 axises. Intercept is now ~9,000 km away. And so on and so forth. I would stop time-warping every time I reached halfway through the remaining course, stop the time-warp, and rotate to prograde and see if going forward or backward would get the intercept any closer, and do the same with normal-antinormal and the other axis (the light blue one) as well. And wouldn\u0027t you know it, by the time the intercept was a few days away, I got it to within 5 kilometres! The relative velocity was still rather extreme, like 2,200 m/s, but I had just enough delta-V to pull that off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/career/Ike%20Mission/Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.07.50-PM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.07.50-PM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t felt this proud of a KSP accomplishment since the very early days, perhaps my first Mun landing.

The mission is now two ships: the fixed-up original and the spontaneously separated probe. But all is not well, at least from the gameplay perspective. The story part is fine, things are progressing nicely. I have managed to get both the ship and the probe almost into stable Duna orbits. Doing this, however, has been very frustrating as switching from the one vessel to the other is causing my game to glitch. If I adjust the course of one vessel and time-warp, this vessel stays stationary in the map while the other proceeds normally. I have to quit the game and reload, then it works for a bit, then starts to glitch again. It\u0027s very strange and makes me want to give up. I won\u0027t, but I\u0027ll probably wait a few days to simmer down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to get the probe into the correct orbit in respect to the contract\u0027s specifications, then I have to land the Ike mission on the ground.
