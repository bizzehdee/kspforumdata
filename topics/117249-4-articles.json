In the cold night, sensors such at pitot tubes and such tend to freeze up, and there are often de-icers in place. The autopilot is disengaged, officers turn the deicing units on, and the sensors warm up back to life. It\u0027s often not unusual to have these kind of failures. And even so, there\u0027s the Auxiliary Power Unit, and an emergency Ram Air Unit that provides little - but just enough - power to control the aircraft in an engine failure and such.\n\nA similar incident to MH370 occured in 2009 - Namely, Air France 447. A pitot tube froze, the first officer was mistaken, stalled the airplane, crashed above the South Atlantic. It was certainly avoidable, albeit tragic. The majority of it\u0027s pieces, sunken at depths lower than the Titanic, took 2 years to be fully explored. It\u0027s a very similar case, took a long time to be fully explored, a transocean flight, etc. It was an A330-200 flying, instead of a Boeing 777-200ER."},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T14:25:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Then finally there is the clone identity 7x7-yzz, and in each aircraft\u0027s cockpit the exact designation is posted. \n\u003E So basically for each base variation x there is a fuselage length and wingspan variant y, and as the aircraft ages various minor part designs are made zz.\n\nNot quite.

All they can tell you is what was on it when they delivered it to the customer that first took delivery. \n\nAs I described in my post earlier in this thread, wing parts like flaps, slats, spoilers and ailerons each have their own part number and serial number pressed into a data plate that is permanently afixed to those parts. This is because those types of parts can and do get swapped around from one aircraft to another over the lifetime of the airframe. Their composite sub components may get water in them, causing delamination due to freeze/thaw cycles. They may be damaged by lightning strikes. They may even get damaged due to bird strikes, tire failures, collisions with ground vehicles, etc. In the event, you don\u0027t want to have to ground the entire aircraft for a week while you fix what is an otherwise removable part. Instead, you find a way to swap it out (whether by leasing or buying a replacement part, by robbing a serviceable part off an aircraft that is in heavy maintenance or by using one of your own spares) and fix the damaged part in the back shops while the aircraft keeps earning revenue. The operating airline is then responsible for keeping a record of what S/N is on its aircraft and the maintenance history of that part, along with the back to birth records of where the part came from.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There is one remote and disturbing possibility.

(The 757 and 767 share the same type certificate).\n\nThat\u0027s correct and they have the 747-800 coming out that will be even more different aircraft. The 747SP for instance is often equipped with very different engines, and a much shorter body. There are also alphabetical suffixes that apply. In general however the zz designates a common package that a company will buy, since even within the y-variants they may purchase engines from a different manufacturer, etc. But since we are talking about the 777. And I forget who, but one engine manufacturer is equipping the longest range model with a thruster capable of generating 100,000 ft/lbs of thrust which was at the time the largest thruster ever made for a commercial AC, so the types of variants still apply. Since a given company has planes that fly from certain length runways or may have to avoid certain terrain around airports, etc they may opt for a different engine package than the next company, or they may even have multiple engine packages for the same plane. \n\n\u003E Boeing doesn\u0027t really care if an operator moves a part from one aircraft to another. The operator may ask Boeing for confirmation that a part can be swapped from one airframe to another if it isn\u0027t clear from the existing approved documentation, but Boeing isn\u0027t required to keep a list of what is on a given aircraft. All they can tell you is what was on it when they delivered it to the customer that first took delivery.\n\nAnd so I posited a potential caveat below, conspiracy or not, it could be a careless book-keeping. The problem with the base theory is whether this is likely a part that would be swapped. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E As I described in my post earlier in this thread, wing parts like flaps, slats, spoilers and ailerons each have their own part number and serial number pressed into a data plate that is permanently afixed to those parts.\n\nThe assumption is that the serial number would be conserved from the point of last contact to the point it ends up on the island. I believe that this has been done, but hypothetically if it were seriously damaged then you would have to go by structural indicators such as materials used in the part during a given time frame and the manufacturer. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E D-checks are planned maintenance and would not ever be required because you lost a flaperon. The aircraft would certainly be grounded for a series of conditional inspections that may also spill over to the rest of the world-wide fleet of that type design if the loss was deemed to be due to a design fault, but you don\u0027t go performing invasive inspections of everything on the aircraft just because you lost a part off the wing.\n\nI don\u0027t think anyone is saying that, and even I say its extremely unlikely but you could come up with a scenario. For example suppose you had two AC both just inspected and certified fit to fly, you then remove and swap the component from another aircraft which does the same job but was made a year earlier and had a different part supplier for certain components, then you remove the serial numbers and add the AC specific serial number to the part that was not hijacked, banking on the fact that no-one would notice the minute structural differences. Then I added that the part is kicked from the craft mid-flight and append this with a low intensity charges and a hydrolic line shutoff. Theoreritically if such a plane were to loose alot of weight, it could gain altitude and fly at a lower IAS for another hour or so, be well further south than the last ping, and so no-one would be looking for it. If we really wanted to get into conspiracy, the luggage would not be loaded on the craft, but instead an additional fuel tank was added and somewhat higher takeoff weight and speed. Or they may have simply filled incompletely full tanks for that particular flight with more fuel. Then the part shows up on the beach but the numbers don\u0027t match and the planes wreckage is never found. This would be something that and anarchist might choose as a form of terrorism, trying to undermine trust in the investigative authorities, regulators and the government. \n\nThis is what you call and \u0027if and if and if and if then argument\u0027 and its not something that has good statistical value, but the problem, I must point out, is that in investigations of past events similar complicated scenarios were devised that did not involved equipment sabotage. For example, the Concorde crash is being blamed on debris from a continental flight that was picked up and damaged the Concorde\u0027s wing. IOW any scenario that one could come up with is highly unlikely true because of all the complexities. Consider the mid-flight explosion of the 747, a very safe AC, because of an electrical short in the fuel tank. \n\nBecause of all potential complexities that might be true, there is a relatively good chance that one of thousands or millions might be the actual explanation, and that the current generalized explanation that a rogue pilot flew the plane until it ran out of fuel crashing in a rectangular box in the Indian ocean might not be true. \n\nLet me make it clear, someone begs the issue could this bizarre *investigators wont sign off that this is the planes part* because they have some other explanation in mind, then you can with enough caveats create such an scenario.....but neither the premise or the supposition are very likely. I assume they are nearly impossible.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nJust a reminder the ID for AF-447\u0027s airbus was involved in a taxi-ing tail-strike incidence months before it disappeared. I assume it had nothing to do with the accident. But a previous ground strike incident for a Japanese 747 was found to be causal for a mid-air loss of control incident that eventually resulted in Mountain crash."},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T17:34:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think anyone is saying that, and even I say its extremely unlikely but you could come up with a scenario.\n\nB787\\_300 did.
