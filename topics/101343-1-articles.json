I was a bit disappointed by that, because I loved everybody\u0027s awesome ideas. Between the last relevant post in the thread and now, have there been any mental health mods for KSP? If not, it\u0027s something I would be really interested in because it would add a lot more immersion to the game and would give us emotional attachments to the wellbeing of our Kerbals (killing them a-la Danny2462 gets a bit boring after a while ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)). The idea of the Kerbals not responding to inputs once they \u0027snap\u0027 is really what caught my attention the most and would be an interesting way to essentially fail a long mission. It\u0027s something other than simply not having enough delta-v and/or electric charge.\n\nI know that at its core, KSP is a space flight simulation game but little aesthetical things like the Chatterer mod and even the goofy Kerbals themselves give the game a lot more charm and let it stand out from just another physics simulation game.\n\nI would love to make this mod myself but I lack the experience. I could teach myself how to code all this stuff, but it all sounds too complex. I\u0027m an artist, not a programmer. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nTL;DR: Are there any mental health mods for Kerbals?"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunrana","CreatedById":138830,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T04:40:57Z","Content":"I did some work on a psych reports mod awhile back, where a science lab would let you collect information on how deep space was affecting the minds of your kerbals. but it was just another type of science report."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T06:18:52Z","Content":"There are a few concepts ideas, like the KerbSocial one you mentioned.

My [AmpYear](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108591-WIP-0-90-Pre-Release-AmpYear-Power-Manager-Reserve-Power-Ion-RCS-v0-12) mod, although primarily about power management, does have my \u0022Cabin Craziness\u0022 concept within it. \n\nGive it a go. Whilst a WIP I have now completed extensive testing. That said, I am working with an idea of breaking the \u0022Cabin Craziness\u0022 out into something a lot more expansive. It currently has a Craziness attribute attached to crewable parts and this slowly goes up based on how crowded your crewable parts are and how far from Kerbal you are. Use of Luxury items within the cabin reduces this. But I am looking for more game dynamics than just - add a part and turn things on and use some electrical charge and all will be good.

I\u0027m not too sure how their Courage levels could come into play. \n\nHeck, this would take a looooot of work and I wouldn\u0027t even know how to go about even starting working on a mod for this, but maybe Kerbals have \u0027Morale\u0027 and \u0027Anxiety\u0027 levels that fluctuate depending on what they experience on their space travels, that you can see by hovering over the Kerbal\u0027s facecam. Morale should be kept as high as possible, whereas Anxiety should be kept near the middle (after all, exercising caution is healthy and keeps your mind sharp!) \n\nIf a Kerbal has high Morale it means they are happy and devoted to the mission, if they have low Morale they will start to lose hope. If they have a too low Anxiety level they will become incredibly bored, but if it\u0027s too high their actions become panicky and unpredictable. It would be cool if we could see what mood the Kerbals are in from their facial expressions on the facecam.\n\nI dunno, just thinking out loud here. I wish so knew how to make this stuff a reality \u0027cause I would totally do it."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T19:46:11Z","Content":"There\u0027s also [KeepFit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67739) for physical health"}]}
