The problem is, I have no idea where to start. I like to think big, but that can be tricky if you don\u0027t know the basics. I\u0027ve seen some pretty impressive, sprawling bases, with linked hab modules and I\u0027m thinking that\u0027s something I want to do! So, where the heck do I start!? Are there interesting mods/parts to play with? Are what should I keep in mind? Should I try to lift as much of it as I can in one go, or launch many little pieces?

Almost all parts are, including docking ports, so your fuel tanks can be pretty much anywhere. I should mention that you alt\u002Bright-click both tanks you want to use, as it took me a long time to find that out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend your station:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Is on or near the equator, for convenient launches after refueling\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Is on the flattest terrain you can find\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Is on a very big deposit (Kethane converts to much less fuel)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Has lots of extra docking ports: you never know what you might come up with later\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Has a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of solar panels, because conversion and mining take up a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of electricity. So much, in fact, that mining at night on battery power hardly buys you any extra time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Has multiple drills, because one large converter can convert Kethane at least 4 times as fast as one drill mines it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Docks from its sides, because it is damn nigh impossible to land on top of a surface station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Has an easily detachable rover or other craft for delivering fuel to vessels that want to refuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that last point, I used to use a sort of rover with a carefully placed, protruding docking port at a measured height above the ground. It was a 3/4 rockomax tank with landing gear wheels and rockomax small radial thrusters on front and back to move around. It could roll up and very easily connect with the Kethane mining rig at the same level with a normally placed port to refuel. The plan was to give ships inline docking ports so they could land on the Mun upright and a safe distance from the mining rig. Then, the \u0027rover\u0027 could bring the fuel up and use its measured-height port to dock with the inline clamp and refuel the ship. This didn\u0027t work at all, because it called for more perfectly flat terrain than the Mun can offer, and translation (RCS) is not an option on the ground, so adjusting horizontal line-up with the ship\u0027s port meant driving away, turning, and driving back. I only got it to work once. In my later, much better design, I used a lander with small radial thrusters that it could use to tip itself over and deploy wheels. It\u0027d refuel, tilt itself back upright, and take off to low Mun orbit to refuel the waiting ship. This used considerably more fuel, but it didn\u0027t cause loss of hair/sanity\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malachai","CreatedById":61407,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T00:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm...Good thoughts, good points.

Seriously, this is NOT a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to Ringer\u0027s suggestions, I\u0027d just add one point: when it comes time to transfer fuel, relying on horizontal docking ports can be really problematic, as it forces all future designs to put their ports at the same height. There are a few ways around this, using mods; for instance, my own mobile fuel refinery has a winch from the Kerbal Attachment System mod. When I want to transfer fuel to a vessel, I just drive over to it, grab it with the winches, and lift/pull until it lines up with the right docking port. The next major version will supposedly add dedicated fuel ports for this purpose, so that the winch itself can be used to transfer fuel. But I\u0027ve done this on a smaller scale as well; one of my old bases had a downward-facing docking port, and my mining rover had an upward-facing one, plus a winch to pull the two together. Much easier to align properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut honestly, my suggestion for Kethane is to not make a static base. Stick some big wheels on your refinery, so that you can drive it from the deposit to where your ships are landed, and then you don\u0027t need a small transfer vehicle. Instead, you\u0027ll have one giant vehicle with everything it needs onboard. (Imagine the Sandcrawlers from Star Wars, and you won\u0027t be too far off.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastodon","CreatedById":57231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T01:27:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have the link of the scott manley base vid?
