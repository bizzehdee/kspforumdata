As an update here (and I\u0027m only here, because my game crashed due to a small glitch where when I was trying to make a spaceplane, the parts I was holding had both come off, and stayed \u0022attached\u0022 as well. the game began flipping ****, and when I tried to start on a new ship, it froze just ike water that flash freezes at low temps), I have actually come up with a grand solution to my Intergalactic City project. Currently, yes, the idea that being able ot atmosphere scoop liquidfuel is a good idea, now, I have no way of getting it to another planet. Thermal jet engines powered by Antimatter drives (Oh, hai, I like that name/idea), and so far, I can see my spaceplane taking off at a remarkable speed, and hitting orbit with relative ease, provided that it does not break apart. 4 thermal jets powered by Antimatter drives. Can\u0027t wait to see how fast that flies without the antimatter driven thruster. Gonna just ram scoop some materials form another planet, return the plane home (if I can manage that.

I\u0027ve tested some bigger 3.75m antimatter rockets in the next update and they should hold together a lot better. Until I get the update out, you could possibly try some of the stronger struts from a pack like KW Rocketry. You could also try switching the tankage over to LiquidFuel and using the rocket in LiquidFuel mode, that would reduce the thrust and increase the specific impulse. I don\u0027t know how heavy your ship is, so it\u0027s tough to say if it would provide enough thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat are your thoughts on 0.22 Fractal_UK?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rough plan at the moment is to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Change my science system such that zero-g environments provide almost the same science everywhere: the reason I didn\u0027t do this to begin with was because there was no system for transmitting science and I didn\u0027t want to make it too hard. That means you\u0027ll need to land your science labs on interesting celestial bodies to get the high science generation rates. Zero g labs will get a lower rate (this change is likely to be made before 0.22).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1b) Make some new experiments, particularly rover experiments. (This change may be made before 0.22 depending on how speedy SQUAD is feeling at the moment how much time I have to devote to development).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Make this pack\u0027s science system interchangeable with the stock one such that my science labs generate stock science, however that works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Add technologies so that basic parts can be researched like the stock parts. Add new technologies for the upgraded parts. Then there will be a minimal science upgrade cost to turn one of my basic parts into one of my upgraded parts, sort of like now only the upgrade cost will be tilted toward the initial cost of researching the tech rather than toward performing the upgrade each time as it is now. Due to the nature of this mod, most of the parts are likely to be toward the end of the tech tree (with a few exceptions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) In sandbox mode, I\u0027m assuming SQUAD will consider that all technologies are automatically researched, so in sandbox mode you will be able to perform any of the part upgrades using the smaller upgrade cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that all of these are subject to change depending on how the stock science API works and what SQUAD actually implement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
