I\u0027ve seen them blow up at speeds under 3 m/s. Mission report says that a structural failure occurs on the linkage to the leg to the attached part. I\u0027ve seen this happen with both the medium and large landing legs. Honestly, I\u0027m having more success with landing directly on engines. The legs should be surviving a 3 m/s landing, regardless of the surface gravity or craft mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPotential alternate theory for what is happening is that maybe reentry is \u0022deforming\u0022 the craft, and maybe the radial decouplers are just breaking? Visually, the craft doesn\u0027t seem deformed in any way, so I doubt this, however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the report:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/wwN2hQw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/wwN2hQw\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(win10, intel i9-9900k, nvidia rtx 2080 super)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
