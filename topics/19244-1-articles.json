With each passing year, computers are stronger and storage gets bigger, so its not unfeesible for many computers to run virtual machines with an older OS installed. Essentially, you keep all the stuff you want, and then migrate your entire system (well, all the memory that describes it) into a virtual machine on your newer computer, to live on in that computers hard drive. For the more sentimental people, this also means your beloved system never has to die a cruel death to the march of progress that has made your love obsolete. It can live on forever (in a very literal sense) in your new rig.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if your going to do this, you should pay attention to your computer. More cores and RAM are useful for virtual machines (since you will still have to run your actual operating system at the same time). If your doing anything heavy with the virtual, 3 or 4 cores is a good idea. Also, some processors are built with features specifically designed to allow it to virtualize like this, so that the emulation process is not such a burden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf computers reach their next technological milestones in our lifetime, they might not resemble the ones we use now at all.
