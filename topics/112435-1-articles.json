Sometimes I do not want to tuck them away in the reaction wheel or stack decoupler - even I sometimes need to refuel monoprop on those multi-mission landers.\n\nThanks,\n\nTML"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T09:29:40Z","Content":"You could make them smaller with TweakScale, make a small inline tank with Procedural Parts or take the small radial tanks from Tantares (and delete everything you don\u0027t need)."},{"CreatedByName":"ThreeMartiniLaunch","CreatedById":62595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T21:42:50Z","Content":"Thanks.
