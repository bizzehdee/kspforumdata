I cannot get a simple plane down the runway without it losing yaw control and crashing! This has been a problem for me across many versions of KSP. I try tweaking everything I can think of: types/number of wheels, steering on wheels enabled/disabled, wing shape/size/placement, control surfaces size/placement/authority control/deployment, reaction wheels setting/quantity, engine quantity/size/placement, ...and probably more. I\u0027ve even tried with all three levels of runway; at level 3, the plane seems to take a little longer to start wobbling, but still does long before I reach a speed that will allow take-off. I\u0027m using only stock plane parts (see list of mods below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAAAARRRRGH! I have a Career Mode game with several contracts that require flying around Kerbin, and I can\u0027t even get off the %\u0026amp;*@! ground. Specifically, once my plane exceeds ~35 m/s, a yaw wobble begins that only gets worse as my speed increases. Eventually, my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E cannot halt the swerving, and almost immediately my own keyboard control cannot override the swerving. I swing off the runway and crash. Every. Single. Time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy KSP version is 1.2.1 (updated by Steam), and these are the mods I have: DMagic Orbital Science, Extraplanetary Launchpads, Firespitter (came bundled with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E mods), SCANSat, Tarsier Space Technology, TweakScale, and six \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E mods (Asteroid Recycling Tech, Freight Transport Tech, Konstruction, Exploration Pack, Submarine Pack, and Modular Kolonization System).

It should be just behind the center of mass, so it\u0027s easier to tilt the plane up on it like a seesaw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft has almost no pitch control.

With a 2x2 setup like this, KSP planes tend to lose stability as one of the wheels\u00A0slightly lifts off the ground and the other then imparts a yaw force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022649659210A2AA92D132E98E25190F551E341C240\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022551\u0022 src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/154640637434358466/649659210A2AA92D132E98E25190F551E341C240/\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-15T08:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecurring questions like this is why I stared the FAQ.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/127403-frequently-asked-questions/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time I wonder why I even bothered to do it.
