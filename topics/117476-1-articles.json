You have to do things differently for each design. The bottom line is, experiment until you find something that works for your particular plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, you can divide and SSTO\u0027s launch into 4 phases:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EInitial subsonic flight\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESupersonic flight\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERocket to Ap\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECircularizing\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ascent profiles for phases 1 and 2 depend on jet TWR. The less you have, the flatter you have to climb. In fact, you might even have to climb slowly to 12-15km then dive back down to 10km just to break the sound barrier before starting another long, slow climb trying to build up as much speed as possible before the jets die at about 25km. But if you\u0027ve got a lot of jet TWR, you can just go straight up to like 15km, then level off for really high speed. Phase 3 depends on rocket TWR in the same way. Some folks say it works best if you have enough TWR to vary your pitch so that you can keep your Ap 45-60 seconds ahead of you, but that isn\u0027t always possible. Just remember that the longer you burn the rocket here, the less fuel you\u0027ll have not only for Phase 4 but also going beyond that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
