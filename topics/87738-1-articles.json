If you\u0027ve selected \u0022control from here\u0022 on a Mk2 inline docking port, the navball markers are not properly aligned with the ports. Attempting to dock by navball will see you bumping the top of your fuselage into the receiving port about a metre off target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Thinking that if I\u0027m going to have to dock by eyeball all the time I may as well do it properly, I set up some RPM cameras in the edge of the port and go to do it from IVA. Problem: as soon as you switch to the IVA mode, control shifts away from the docking port and back to the cabin, throwing the navball markers off by a further 90 degrees.

When controlling from a port, you\u0027re looking in the direction the port is facing, but you\u0027re looking FROM the root part of your vessel. All is nice and dandy if root part and docking port line up; if they don\u0027t, you\u0027re getting that offset error.
