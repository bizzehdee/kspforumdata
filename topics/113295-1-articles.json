I am thinking of making a space station soon on my main career mode profile, and I went to do the in-game Docking Tutorial. All went well so far; the orbital inclination adjustment and everything else, but then I ran into a bit of trouble. When you have to intercept your orbit with the other craft\u0027s, I cannot seem to make the orbital difference less than 5 km, like Gene Kerman says. I have been trying for almost half an hour now and cannot get it right. Are there any tips or good ways to do this? Thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T04:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(assumes you are already within a few km range of the target)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) target whatever craft youre trying to dock with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) change the navball so that it is in target mode (click where it says \u0022orbit\u0022 or \u0022surface\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) burn retrograde to kill off any relatve speed between yourself and the target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) use the navball to travel directly towards the target (pink circle with the dot in the middle)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) when you get close to the target switch to retrograde to kill off any relative speed between yourself and the target (again)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) repeat steps 4 and 5 until you are sufficiently close to the target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) use rcs thrusters to make the final alignments once you are within about 100m (a little tricky but gets easier with practice)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T04:47:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you Jkool, this will help me in the future!

I use maneuver nodes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain set the target first. Get in an orbit either above of below the target in roughly the same shape, and then use a maneuver node (prograde or retrograde, depending on your orbit relative to the target). When your projected path crosses the targets path you will see 2 arrows indicating you closest approach to the target. play around with the maneuver node (move left / right, change speed slightly) until the arrows are aligned. Note that you may need to make one or more revolutions of your orbit to find the correct path, but eventually you will find a maneuver that gets you within a few km of the target. Then you can follow my previous post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have maneuver nodes you might have to wait until you unlock them, cause without them its pretty much impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T05:02:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis seems to be the best way, and indeed I do have maneuver nodes unlocked, thankfully!

Usually you can just raise your apoapsis to match the target orbit and then orbit until the targets predicted location overshoots and then raise the periapsis until the distance to target winds back to a close approach, you should be able to get it within a few hundred metres.

The closer you can get your initial rendezvous the better, but the principles are all the same no matter how far away you begin.

This reduces the initial dV and the amount of relative velocity you need to kill. Likewise, you can skimp on step 5 a bit - will take less fuel, but more orbits to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your target is in a very high orbit, and you are in a low orbit, simply use a maneuver node to directly intercept them where target position and intersect point match. At that point, burn retrograde at the target like the dickens to match the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking itself is a bit of a pain without RCS or Vernor thrusters. If those are unavailable or unappealing, consider using spider engines at low throttles with the main engine turned off. Hitting your target with heavy rocket blasts is counter-productive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
