That fraction of particles would be on the order of e^(-1000000/6000), if you plug in the numbers, then the expected quantity of such energetic particles in the entire sun would be around 10^(-15).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, how do you define the temperature of the corona? The mean free path for a particle in a gas is around 1km (for a particle density of 10^15 per cubic meter, as it is in the corona). Accelerated by the sun\u0027s electromagnetic field, perhaps? A mean electric field of 0.1 V/m would be enough to impart this kind of energy to an elementary charge over these lengths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: The question about defining temperature is rhetoric, of course. I was hinting, that more conventional methods of heat transfer hardly would play a major role in this problem as was stated by the OP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-25T15:35:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2014 03:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LLlAMnYP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
