While I really like that parts get unlocked progressively, the science collection feels very much like a memorpeger (MMORPG), and that\u0027s a horrible way to do things, especially in a single-player game. I\u0027m actually using MM right now to change that, so that all experiments give 100% of their scienceCap on their first use (seriously just clicking, transmitting, repeating, and then doing a return anyway is boring), and they either transmit 100%, or they require a sample return. It makes things more interesting, since there\u0027s an actual decision to be made when constructing a probe, instead of just spamming all the things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T15:36:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@ Rowsdower - yes, I\u0027ll be trying career mode again in 0.24.
