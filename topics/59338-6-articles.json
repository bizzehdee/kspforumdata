Equal ratios of East African Black, West African Black, North Americans Native, South American Native, Pacific Islander, Northern European heritage, Southern European heritage, Middle Eastern, Indian subcontinental, Asian, etc... Not only that, interracial offspring would not only be encouraged but probably mandatory. After a few generations the ship will have the the gene pool well mixed, and probably provide the best seed population for the new planet.

The majority of people on this ship are more or less going to be custodians. You will need repairmen, janitors, food service workers, and a whole list of other menial, non-scientific jobs. Yes, there will be a need for doctors, and engineers, and \u0022smart people\u0022 jobs, but the vast majority of the people on the ship will be completely average people, and you will have to have that or unrest will happen. Do you think someone who was a CEO back on Earth is going to want to be cleaning toilets for 30 years? Or be happy doing it? Not even close.
