Where I get confused is this, if I have a stage where I have a combination of different fuel types. For example, I have a rocket similar to the Space Shuttle, with a liquid fueled engine and 2 SRBs. To calculate the total Delta V for that stage, would I calculate the Delta V for the liquid engine, then the SRBs and add them together, keeping their fuels separate, or would I find the average Isp for both types of engine and the total fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings really get confusing for me when it comes to the mass and calculating the Delta-Vs separately. I need to use the dry/total mass of the entire ship when doing the calculations, but should I use the dry or the total mass for the SRBs when calculating the liquid engine? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not concerned about possible efficiency issues, just curious about the calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-17T23:27:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2013 11:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ChainsDD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T23:08:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore we begin, I\u0027m going to assume a \u0022best-case\u0022 scenario where the solid-rocket boosters run out of fuel before the liquid engines do, and are dropped as soon as they\u0027re empty. The other way around is possible, but generally less efficient for a number of reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to do this is to treat both phases of the burn as two separate \u0022stages\u0022: On one stage you\u0027re burning all of your SRBs and part of your liquid fuel, and on the second, after you\u0027ve dropped the boosters, you\u0027re burning the rest of the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe determining factor on the delta-v of this first \u0022stage\u0022 is going to be the time it takes for your SRBs to finish their burn. Since you can\u0027t throttle a solid rocket, this is going to remain more or less static. (In reality, of course, changing values of Isp as your rocket rises through the atmosphere are going to make this a little wobbly.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you know that, you\u0027ll need to figure out the amount of fuel burnt by your liquid engines in that time. We\u0027ll call this parameter \u0022delta-m\u0022 or \u0022dm\u0022 (for change in propellant mass) for now. You can use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edm = (F * t) / (g0 * Isp)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF = average thrust in kilonewtons provided by liquid engine for the duration of the burn (which will be full thrust if the throttle stays at max; otherwise, it gets tricky)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Et = burn time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eg0 = standard surface gravity (9.8 m/s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe value you get should be the mass of the liquid fuel (including oxidizer) burnt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll take this value and subtract both it and the propellant mass of the boosters from the craft\u0027s full mass to find the remaining mass of your craft. When you run the rocket equation, you\u0027ll plug the full mass into the rocket equation for m0, and the remaining mass for m1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we need to find the Isp for the combined system, which gets tricky when you have engines of different specific impulses. You\u0027ll need to find the total rate of propellant mass flow (mDot) to do this. You can find the mass flow rate for each engine or booster using the following equation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EmDot = Fe / (g0 * Isp)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFe = The thrust provided by that engine or booster\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp = The specific impulse of that engine or booster\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you add all the mDot values together and invert the equation to find the average specific impulse for the entire stage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp = Ft / (g0 * mDot)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFt = Total thrust of all engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlug the values you\u0027ve derived for m0, m1, and Isp into the rocket equation. That should give you the delta-v for your \u0022first stage.\u0022 Mark that down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow subtract the dry mass of your boosters from the remaining mass (to represent dropping your empty boosters). That is your new m0 for the \u0022second stage.\u0022 Subtracting the remaining liquid fuel in the stage to find your dry mass will give you your new m1. Again, solve the rocket equation with those values. Record that as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow add the two delta-v values you\u0027ve gotten to find the total delta-v for both the liquid engine and the boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChainsDD","CreatedById":88502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T23:28:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat looks good to me :-) Thanks!
