I think if we had a part that was similar to a fuel line, but could be used by a kerbal on EVA to connect Craft A to Craft B (similar to Kerbal Attachment System) ... would something like this satisfy your need? Once connected, it would act as a resource transfer line for fuel only.\n\nFor base connection parts, I think to be useful they would need to be lightweight, surface-attached/non-rigid parts -- I am envisioning something like a docking port ... tubular that can be pulled out by a kerbal on EVA and is flexible.\n\nI think surface base building needs something like this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T13:49:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 01:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Caelib**"},{"CreatedByName":"TothAval","CreatedById":142030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T13:58:23Z","Content":"i would love some sort of KAS functionality in stock, it would be the most intuitive and natural way and i am backing your idea, a lots of mods show that this is working and a lot of fun and it would render my suggestion invalid if something like that would be integretated in stock. anyway, in case this is not about to happen, which would be pretty sad, there has to be a solution for increased comfort in playing. unfortunately building bases on the ground or refueling stuff on the ground is as uncomfortable in stock as it can get, which is really sad and which i tried to adress with this idea ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
