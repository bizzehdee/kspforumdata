I don\u0027t want to do this discussion over that thread because it would interfere too much in the current round\u0027s gameplay, so here we are. If you haven\u0027t played the game, come over and check it out, since probably only people who played it will understand the context of this discussion thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---update---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew topic this time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe number war is a complex game, and due to its vagueness (both intentional and unintentional), sometimes there are conflict between the teams that require an official 3rd party arbitration. The game master(GM) is the one handle such things, along with rule update and game progress monitor. As you can see, this game does require some effort to manage despite being just a forum game. Now,I am looking for a person who could be a GM to look after things when I am busy/away. This is on a purely voluntary basis and not binding in any way. I am not expecting you to check the thread all the time as that would be my job, it is just whenever you are free and I am not there and something came up and require a GM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing a GM means the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You are no longer allowed to participate in the game to maintain neutrality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You have a responsibility to answer questions regarding to rules and help guiding new players with the game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You must have a firm understanding of the rules and its nuances, particularly on edge cases, and help updating rules/drafting new ones to ensure the game runs smoothly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your decisions will be final for all cases of conflict, thus a fair judgement is required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#fafafa;\u0022\u003E- You will be aware of the existence of the hidden \u0022team zero\u0022, and while you are not allowed to rule favourably for them, you can still post messages of encouragement with this colour: #FAFAFA . PM me with #To the origin as subject if you can read this, and I can tell you more about team zero.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere might be some responsibilities \u0026amp; duty I can\u0027t think of now, but mostly it is about player interaction and cases arbitration. Post here if you have any questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing a GM does NOT means the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You have to look for errors. This is the responsibility of the player, as per rule 6. However, keeping track of the general progression and noticing errors when it happens is still recommended to find cases that are skirting the rules and create a precedent. If you find one, talk with me and we can figure things out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You have to revert progression with each error: A GM\u0027s revert is powerful, and can even null a win if required, so use it only when it is absolutely needed. Let the player spot errors and revert by themselves, while you stand by and check if the revert is valid in case someone brought it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Helping a team in anyway with your GM power. For example: you cannot help a team even if it looks like the other team are winning unfairly - as long as they play within the rules(and even if they are not sometimes), you do not intervene until you are called upon. GM intervention is only in cases where rules are not clear and requires clarification immidiately so people stop doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone is interested, PM me. Edit: Going to take 2 people, as 3 GMs would be able to resolve stalemate decision easier. While there are formal no requirement for this position (cause it is just a forum game, lol) it would be nice if it is a long time player of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew Update: I have got my 2 GMs: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/127137-Dman979\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDman979\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/128703-Deutherius\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDeutherius\u003C/a\u003E !
