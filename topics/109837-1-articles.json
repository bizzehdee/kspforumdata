So after some careful looking investigation it came to my attention that there hasn\u0027t been one of these since the all Mainsail-Orange Tank lifter days... And taking into consideration that KSP 1.0 released a mere few weeks ago, I decided it was about time the KSP forums took another dive into the realm of....... REALLY BIG LIFTERS! Now that that\u0027s over with, the challenge itself is quite simple. The goal is to build the most powerful lifter you possibly can and deliver a payload into a circular orbit around Kerbin.\n\n![b3Idn5S.png](http://i.imgur.com/b3Idn5S.png)\nLet me know if the contrast is too much. I was going for a really light retro-ey look. Use at your own discretion.\n\n**SUBMISSIONS**\n\nYou need to build a lifter with the greatest carrying capacity you can muster, throw a payload on, and get it into an orbit circular within 1 kilometer (Difference between Apoaps and Periaps should be less than 1000 meters). BAM! You\u0027re done. Post a screenshot of your Launcher in the VAB (Or SPH ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)) and on the pad, as well as one showing its final orbit with the Apoaps and Periaps highlighted. Finally, I need a screenshot of the map view info tab after payload jettison and one of the same payload in its final orbit with the resources tab open. Sandbox mode is not required, but highly recommended.\n\n**RULES** \n\nObviously, no cheats. The only mods allowed for the \u0022Stock\u0022 challenge are Kerbal Construction Time (for recovery), Flight Manager for Reusable Stages (for recovery), and Stage Recovery (also for recovery, see Bonus Points section for more details). If it wasn\u0027t obvious already, Stock Parts only for the stock challenge. The modded leader boards allow usage of only plugin-less parts mods eg. SpaceY, KSPX, etc. Parts clipping is permitted to an extent, which means no magical fuel tanks clipping inside each other or any other \u0022cheaty\u0022 shenanigans ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif). I\u0027ll leave the participant to be the judge of this but a good rule of thumb is if you have to ask yourself if it\u0027s cheaty, it probably is.\n\n**THE PAYLOAD**\n\nThe Payload can be anything at all as long as it includes only stock parts and has mass. The payload is defined as any SINGLE object the lifter delivers to a circular orbit around Kerbin which does not have room for fuel (Xenon, Oxidizer, Liquid Fuel, Monoprop). Any submission not fitting this definition will not be eligible for a place on the leader board.\n\n**THE LIFTER**\n\nThe Lifter can be absolutely anything as long as it has the ability to carry a payload to a circular orbit around Kerbin. The more powerful the better for you.\n\n**THE POINTS**\n\nPoints received per entry are based on the lifters capacity. The formula is **M\\*O** where **M** is the mass in tons of the payload and **O** is the final Apoaps of the payload to the nearest kilometer (Since a periaps could still be 900 meters bellow it and round-able to a different number). All bonus points are added to this. The greater the points you have, the better. A 20 ton payload to an 80 by 80 kilometer orbit without taking into account bonus points is around 1,600 points. My suggestion is to go for higher altitude over greater payload weight.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\n\n**BONUS POINTS**\n\n\u002BAny recovered funds\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D2. Recovery mods highly recommended but not required. Additional screenshot of any recovered funds required. Anything from boosters recovered on launch, to a probe core with a heat shield returning after satellite delivery, to a space plane landing is admissible.\n\n\u002B6,000 for no fuel lines. I\u0027m going to go with your word on this one. \n\n\u002B6,000 for less than 500 parts used.\n\n\u002B5,000 for no struts. Again, taking your word for it.\n\n\u002B500 for a craft file. This is to encourage sharing. I\u0027ll post it in the OP next to your username on the leader board if you choose to submit one.\n\n\u002B1,000 for no ion engines.\n\n**STOCK LEADERBOARDS**\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\n9.\n\n10.\n\n**MODDED LEADERBOARDS**\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\n9.\n\n10.\n\nGood Luck Kerbanauts ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif). Constructive criticism is welcomed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T22:56:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 10:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Spacepetscompany**"},{"CreatedByName":"ghostbuzzer7","CreatedById":138096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T20:02:16Z","Content":"I nominate Zokesia Skunworks CIRA 1000 Ton lifter to LKO ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120646-Cira-VIII-1000-tons-to-LKO%21](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120646-Cira-VIII-1000-tons-to-LKO%21)\n\nInteresting challenge though"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T21:32:09Z","Content":"In other words, this is a challenge to see who has the beefiest computer.
