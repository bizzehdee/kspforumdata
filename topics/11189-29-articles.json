I\u0027ve found that for my designs at least, NERVAs don\u0027t work too well with low part count ssto\u0027s. The low TWR of NERVAs means many maneuvers will require more dV, and the relatively high mass of each NERVA (2.25T) reduces the overall amount of dV that you get (on small craft anyway). The LV-909\u0027s on the other hand give me a good TWR allowing me to do maneuvers for less dV cost. Likewise, the single jet engine has a much easier time pushing two LV-909\u0027s and the lower mass of those engines gives me nice boost to overall dV once I\u0027m in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get around this by having 20\u002B air intakes and a few jet engines take you to 40km\u002B at 2000m/s\u002B and then using a NERVA or two, but then you don\u0027t get a low part count which is what I wanted (especially since extra intakes will probably require extra struts).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-23T23:03:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2013 11:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PotatoOverdose\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carazvan","CreatedById":73074,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T09:54:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a run to Duna and back ... it\u0027s the 3rd album in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/41382-Ant-SSTO-%28versions-2x1t-Payload-VTOL-Docking-or-Vertical-Landing%29?p=532717\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAnt SSTO Presentation\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"japa","CreatedById":9777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T11:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/eHerK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

People have been asking me for a video of how I build my crafts so I decided to make one sens I wanted to try some stuff out for future crafts. Its not my best craft so its more experimental.\u003Cp\u003EI went with a low profile slim wing with closely mounted engine nacelles. This allows the wing to support it self with out the help of the fuselage or external struts and that was a must to accommodated the cargo hold or it would just collapse on it self from previous experience. The closely mounted engine nacelles allows fuel to be stored in them with out adding stress on the wings and the low profile wing in combination with the closely mounted engine nacelles allows for landing wheels to be placed optimally to take stress of the fuselage and wings. The Cockpit is mounted with a 10 degree down tilt to allow for IVA take of and landings and overall easier IVA flight. A probe core is mounted at the default angle to allow for a proper vector when doing burns in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also has stock cargo bay doors that can open and close. Not my idea so I wont take credit for that. But they do help stiffening the fuselage when close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cargo bay is relatively long and can hold more jumbo tanks then the craft can carry but the intended cargo tends to be a lot longer VS weight then a few jumbo tanks so I wanted a long cargo bay, as long as posible. Benchmark payload was 63 tons and thats its max with out any further optimization to the craft. The craft is 99 ton dry weight so its not a light one due to a lot of I beams, many are cosmetic but most are structural. Further optimization with less esthetics\u0027s could reduce tonnage and increase payload capacity with 16 tons at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think its sufficient to lift my Explorer version 2 or a equally capable version of it sens it was about 58 tons.
