That\u0027s the cause, since the config syntax changed in TU at some point ago. I can only write configs for one version or the other, so I preferred to support the latest. I can provide you a test patch I have, or you can simply delete the TU configs which lets Firespitter take over again; but you\u0027ll lose the PBR shading on my parts.\n\u003E \n\nSo from what I understand is that he is using Firespitter instead of TU\n\nAnd the problem I am getting is that it adds a slider?(same slideryou can change the amount of fuel in a tank) to select the texture for his parts instead of just only buttons. But since TU uses another syntax, and probably overrides Firespitter bc of that, it gives an error that says \\*Textures not found\\* and when I press one of the buttons it resets to default\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-12T16:17:54Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2018 04:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Pointblank66**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-12T16:16:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just now, Pointblank66 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I also forwarded the problem to Akron, who manages ProbesPlus.

I think the TEXTURE tag got renamed to MATERIAL or something relatively simple like that. Unfortunately once I changed the tags in my config to match the new usage, it broke any installs that use the previous one. I believe this is the issue he\u0027s having. A mismatch of TU version to my configs. One of the two is either too new. or too old. \n\nThe way my texture/material switching works is that it is handled by Firespitter as long as you don\u0027t have TU installed. Once TU is detected, it handles it instead and all references of Firespitter are removed from the parts using:\n\n    @PART[*]:HAS[#author[Akron]:HAS[@MODULE[FStextureSwitch2]]]:FOR[CoatlAerospace]:NEEDS[TexturesUnlimited]\n    {!MODULE[FStextureSwitch2] {}\n    }\n\nThis is a basic sample of a material configs used by v0.16 of my mod:\n\n    KSP_TEXTURE_SET\n    {name = Silvertitle = Silverrecolorable = falseTEXTURE{shader = SSTU/PBR/Metallictexture = _MainTex, Coatl Aerospace/ProbesPlus/Assets/mat_fsilvertexture = _BumpMap, Coatl Aerospace/ProbesPlus/Assets/mat_foil_NPROPERTY{\tname = _Metallic\tfloat = 250}PROPERTY{\tname = _Smoothness\tfloat = 0.7}}COLORS{\tmainColor = white\tsecondColor = orange\tdetailColor = white}\n    }\n\nAnd this is one using the new syntax in v0.16.1:\n\n    KSP_TEXTURE_SET\n    {name = Silvertitle = Silverrecolorable = falseMATERIAL{shader = SSTU/PBR/StockMetallicBumpedtexture = _MainTex, Coatl Aerospace/ProbesPlus/Assets/mat_fsilvertexture = _MetallicGlossMap, Coatl Aerospace/ProbesPlus/Assets/mat_fsilvertexture = _BumpMap, Coatl Aerospace/ProbesPlus/Assets/mat_foil_N\n    PROPERTY{\tname = _Metal\tfloat = 1}PROPERTY{\tname = _Smoothness\tfloat = 0.9}}\n    }\n\n[@Pointblank66](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152789-pointblank66/) Hopefully this helps you figure out exactly which version of TexturesUnlimited you need.

Like the battery?\n\u003E \n\nThe \u0027usable volume\u0027 displays the -deployed- stats.  Basically the volume container is setup as-per-normal, and when it goes to apply the resources to the part, it checks if it is inflated or not, and applies the multiplier only at that time.\n\nThese parts changed a bit in how they are (logically) set up.  The battery and propellant containers do NOT expand/shrink with deployment --  They are small enough that they can be seen as a permanent function of the part.  This was (at least in part) to allow for un-inflated modules to still be usable (battery/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E/propellant).\n\nThe only portion of their volume that shrinks/expands is the \u0027user configurable\u0027 portion, and this container functions much like it did in the past -- the full volume is only available when the part is inflated.\n\nWith the GUI open, so you can see the values in the GUI do not change based on inflation status:\n\nPre-inflate:\n\n![mjFa4KL.png](https://i.imgur.com/mjFa4KL.png)\n\nPost-inflate -- notice no change in the \u0027usable volume\u0027, but there IS a change in the actual amount of EC in the part.\n\n![TEx8Pkq.png](https://i.imgur.com/TEx8Pkq.png)\n\nAs I stated in my post -- if you want to adjust the \u0027user configurable\u0027 volume of the part -- patch the \u0027volume = XXX\u0027 line in the model definition.  E.G.:\n\n    @SSTU_MODEL[ST-HAB-A1]\n    {%volume = 100\n    }"}]}
