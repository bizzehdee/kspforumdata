This mod uses NEAR if installed. Here is what the NEAR mod page says in bold that I failed to read when I grabbed the mod:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENote: To avoid possibly exacerbating any of the win64 KSP build\u0027s instability inherent issues, this mod will disable itself if run on a win64 build of KSP.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can only imagine the conflicts cause by NEAR not working if Trajectories tries to reference it. FYI this is true for FAR as well, which is not surprising. In short I am sure it will work just fine if I unistall NEAR. My only request is that you note on page one that this only works for stock drag on win64 KSP and that it may cause serious issues if used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS. I am totally bummed about NEAR I used it just fine on 0.24 win64 KSP. IN any case I will keep this mod and dump NEAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacke","CreatedById":103694,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T05:34:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mcirish3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mcirish3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am totally bummed about NEAR I used it just fine on 0.24 win64 KSP.

There are a large number of bugs in Unity 64-bit and KSP 64-bit on Windows. Because of all the crap mod builders received about bugs beyond there control under KSP 0.24, many have decided to have their mods disable themselves under KSP 64-bit on Windows and say so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
