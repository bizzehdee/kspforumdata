Kerbals who run out of supplies with that mod effectively become tourists and shut down until resupplied.\n\nTo avoid it? Keep them fed! To turn them back to kerbonauts? Feed them!\n\nAssuming they\u0027re in your station, and that your station has a docking port, send up another ship with some supplies to dock with it and feed your poor kerbals."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T23:01:48Z","Content":"As Landwalker says, this is not something that happens in the stock game. The main four Kerbals - Jeb, Val, Bill and Bob will work even if they don\u0027t get fed, but everyone else will go on strike if they go without food for fifteen days."},{"CreatedByName":"LupinoArts","CreatedById":120233,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T23:07:39Z","Content":"Thanks. That worked. I was only confunsed since i had plenty of food, oxy and water aboard. But i also use UKS/MKS which has its own \u0022supplies\u0022 resource.
