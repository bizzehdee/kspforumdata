The weird bit\u00A0is that this even happens with parts with nose cones so that it has the least drag with the nose into the wind as it were. I mean here even the centre of mass is shifted slightly forwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt got me thinking, though I understand a fair amount of physics I can\u0027t figure out why it doesn\u0027t\u00A0fly aerodynamically? -And once sideways it\u0027s incredibly hard to orient any other way (as you\u0027d expect).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo am I being an idiot here and missing something I really should\u0027ve learnt by A-level physics, or is there some underlying phenomenon at work here?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCheers,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJack\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cunjo Carl","CreatedById":162109,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-17T08:12:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, welcome, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175020-daredemon666/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022175020\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175020-daredemon666/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@DareDemon666\u003C/a\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re not crazy. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a version prior to the latest release (1.2), individual components tend not to fall in sensible ways. My favorite was single airplane wings on the ground in v1.1- would flip themselves upright like bopbags rather than lay flat. This seems to have been fixed in v 1.2- Thanks Devs!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mentioned this happening on jettisoned parts with multiple components, though. It\u0027s not uncommon for decoupled things to briefly turn sideways due to the torque of decoupling \u002B aerodynamic forces if it\u0027s bottom heavy. This is normally followed by random tumbling though, and it sounds like your case isn\u0027t. Maybe, are you describing something like a \u0027flat spin\u0027? I have to admit, I\u0027ve only ever noticed my ejected junk peel away and slow-tumble erratically like you might expect (or for something particularly aerodynamically inclined, eventually flip around and nosedive like a dart). If you post a picture I\u0027d be happy to hm and haw some more, but otherwise we can leave it as you\u0027re physics understanding sounds good!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re curious to see a real world example, check out these videos of the the space shuttles SRBs decoupling:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/uuYoYl5kyVE?list=PLe8qRS4LwO8mYtQEFcjh8S0xT1nM3VaQ4\u0026amp;t=123\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/uuYoYl5kyVE?list=PLe8qRS4LwO8mYtQEFcjh8S0xT1nM3VaQ4\u0026amp;t=123\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/2aCOyOvOw5c?t=110\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/2aCOyOvOw5c?t=110\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DareDemon666","CreatedById":175020,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-17T08:52:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the answer!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the case of jettisoned stages it might be the motor\u0027s\u00A0mass\u00A0throwing things off, but then I\u0027d expect it to fly with the engine forwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also mostly see things like boosters falling \u0027away\u0027 from the craft with a slight spin - shortly becoming random spinning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems most likely that I\u0027ve got an out of date version, I\u0027ll go take a look...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce again, cheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
