You can get a pretty good model going by specifying wing area, center of pressure, glide ratio, critical angles of attack, and slope and intercept for the lift coefficient between these extremes. It\u0027s pretty close to what KSP does, and if your wings aren\u0027t doing anything weird, it\u0027s good enough. Of course, KSP wings often do something weird.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a procedural wing, you could bake out the same characteristics and still use the simple model, but it\u0027s actually more work. What you can do much easier is to treat each section as its own wing. Technically, it\u0027s nothing new compared to building out large wings from many, many sections, but such wings already behave better than larger parts. Procedural wing would also eliminate all the self-intersection and overlap problems when you are building compound wing, so you\u0027d basically be getting the best version you could have hoped for with careful design automatically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, KSP stock wings have other concessions. They have a floatier feel due to lower drag at high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, they generate same amount of lift regardless of position, etc. That\u0027s likely to stay as is, by the sounds of it.
