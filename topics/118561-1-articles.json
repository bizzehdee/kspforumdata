Also the R\u0026amp;D labs \u0026amp; Astro Center don\u0027t have Esc key support. I play science sandbox so not sure about the rest. It always seemed odd to me that you can only Esc key out of the Tracking Station - I mean even before there was a save prompt in the VAB/SPH it would auto-save your ship when heading to the launch pad so why not on quick Esc?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
