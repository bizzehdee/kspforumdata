This is because the center of mass is also the center of rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETarget the docking port on the other vessel, line up your own before moving in [to make rotary changes as you see fit], then translate forward quickly, and gradually decelerate as you get closer. This is so that the target wont have much time to deviate off center, thus wasting time on radial and normal translations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Oh, you already knew? Well shoot... I guess the answer would just be practice.
