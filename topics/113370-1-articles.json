If you\u0027re not doing any docking, you definitely should try to compact your vessel enough to where your Delta-V usage is at peak efficiency.\n\nNow if you\u0027re landing on Duna as well, it may be a good idea to bring a supplement lander as a backup in case of calculation \u0022errors\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T15:08:11Z","Content":"And I tried the docking tutorial and I spent like 30 minutes doing the attachment to the other ship.

How could I do this better? And should I be using docking mode cause I did it with the rcs controls which was annoying and I kept missing the docking portand having to back up.\n\nPersonally, I find that Docking Mode is much harder for some reason.\n\nIt\u0027s difficult to give a verdict without knowing your orbital parameters, but let\u0027s run through the book just to be safe.\n\nThe rocket design should have RCS blocks as far away from the center of mass as they can. This is because the center of mass is also the center of rotation.\n\nTarget the docking port on the other vessel, line up your own before moving in [to make rotary changes as you see fit], then translate forward quickly, and gradually decelerate as you get closer. This is so that the target wont have much time to deviate off center, thus wasting time on radial and normal translations.\n\n...Oh, you already knew? Well shoot... I guess the answer would just be practice. Docking IS one of the more difficult objectives in the game."},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T18:03:28Z","Content":"thx u were a great help and I have already docked my new probe heading to gilly to it to refuel ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T05:53:09Z","Content":"before any long voyage where you will encounter the unknown, practice in Kerbal orbit. and hit F5 often, which is quick save but you probably knew that."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T08:55:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E before any long voyage where you will encounter the unknown, practice in Kerbal orbit. and hit F5 often, which is quick save but you probably knew that.\n\nOr if you knew how to, you could do a bit of orbital math to plan ahead and to know what to expect."},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:03:46Z","Content":"The probe ran out of fuel heading strait for gilly and it just slammed into gilly.

Did your probe not use the Ion thruster?"}]}
