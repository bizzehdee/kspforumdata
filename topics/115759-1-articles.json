It does not appear to be a display issue, as if you have less than 1 science in the Mobile Processing Lab, and transmit it, the total science will go up without the science in the lab decreasing, and this can be repeated indefinitely.

And that data lasts a long time. I\u0027m not sure if your comment is a side note or a potential explanation, but what I believe I\u0027ve run into would take the lab from WAY overpowered to easily abused for extra science and overpowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf what I described in my first post is not just a bug in my copy, then I think the problem would be in the code. I don\u0027t consider myself a programmer whatsoever, but I have learned to write a little code in school, and what I believe might be going on (take this with no less than 2 grains of salt) is that a floor function (rounds a number down to the nearest integer) may be missing from the code that enables the transmission of data from the mobile science lab.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"haltux","CreatedById":29407,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T15:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I understand correctly, you have found an exploit that allows you to earn a fraction of a science point, for free, and repeat that forever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have some labs active somewhere, pressing the fast forward button gives you hundreds of science points, for free, more or less forever (at least long enough to complete the science tree).

I see how the science lab\u0027s design flaw renders my bug relatively insignificant. Other than performance issues from being on a Mac, I have not noticed any other bugs, (other than potential UI bugs, which I think are far less significant and I can\u0027t figure out how to replicate), so I thought that this was a something that I should report, to be safe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for clearing things up, and to everyone else for the help. For all we know, a developer may have noticed this bug and fixed it for 1.0.5 or whatever is rolling out next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope on some future update the science lab will be balanced, as it is among my favorite features.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
