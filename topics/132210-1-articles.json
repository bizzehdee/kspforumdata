So I just quit the career mode and went back to my sandbox mode save. When playing my career mode I was thinking about companies like SpaceX and agencies like NASA and ESA. Those are privately and government funded companies. So this brought me to a thought of having a gamemode where you can either get privately funded or government funded and not have silly contracts. For example, start a privately funded career mode and have contracts from other agencies around Kerbin like KASA that give you contracts to send their probes into deep space or land probes on the Mun. You would also have worry more about cost then science because you are being privately funded. However in government funded mode you would have to worry more about science and less about money since you are funded by the government.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI open this idea to the devs of KSP and anyone who would like to have these new game modes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sDaZe","CreatedById":111181,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T02:18:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngreat idea!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Optimist","CreatedById":151904,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T02:27:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222412024\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132210\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455586774\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157177\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbonaut.Bacon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, Kerbonaut.Bacon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0However in government funded mode you would have to worry more about science and less about money since you are funded by the government.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s funny\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T02:38:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222412109\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132210\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455589646\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151904\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Optimist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, The Optimist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s funny\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe in the Kerbalverse government works the way Kerbals think it should?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T13:38:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven more customization is needed.
