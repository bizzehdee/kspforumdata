This first stage (4 boosters clustered around the second stage) is only on a sub orbital trajectory so no problem there. The upper (transfer) stage has enough left over fuel to de-orbit itself after delivering its payload so no problem there either. Its the second stage that is the problem.\n\nI thought I was being clever but ditching it while in a ~650km x 35-45km orbit even though it still had a little fuel left \u0026 using the transfer stage to circularize before rendezvousing with a station at ~2500 km or in Munar orbit. My thinking was that with a pe of \u003C45 km the debris (2nd stage, separator ring and nose cone) would de-orbit after a 2 or 3 orbits. But it doesn\u0027t. It seemingly just whizzes through the upper atmosphere many times with no penalty. \n\nIf I \u0022fly\u0022 the debris it will burn up after no more than 3 orbits, but left to itself its \u0022on rails\u0022. Is this a \u0022feature\u0022 of the \u0022physics bubble\u0022? Do I have to ride along with the debris for it burn up? After 7 (of 8) fuel tank and two solar panel boom launches there is a lot of stuff still up there that I was hoping would go away by itself...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T16:00:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerBlammo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T15:36:32Z","Content":"Yes, you must fly with it in order for the orbit to degrade.

I know I can delete stuff from the tracking station, but I thought it would be nice if it went away by itself. I do have surplus fuel on these launches so maybe for future ones I can ditch the 2nd stage with a pe below 25km and see if it gets deleted automatically.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T16:00:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerBlammo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T16:02:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks everyone.

If it falls below 25km later it should be automatically deleted."},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T18:58:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My thinking was that with a pe of \u003C45 km the debris (2nd stage, separator ring and nose cone) would de-orbit after a 2 or 3 orbits.
