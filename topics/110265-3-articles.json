Good luck to all of you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk2-Try to do more with the internal weapons bay, try adding more space for weapons and other stuff in there.You need to figure out a way to mount an external fuel tank(decouplers) to the aircraft.

So, I can either add more control surfaces or move the main wing (and thus CoL) slightly forward. If I add control surfaces, I run up against the weight requirement. If I move the CoL, they plane becomes too maneuverable, and will spin out at High-alpha, and will lose too much energy in regular turns. Which one do you want?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe EFT goes inside the weapons bay. It takes the spot of 2 bombs, so two bombs total instead of 4. The bay gave me a lot of trouble, especially with the ARAAM- they like to blow up. As far as I know, you can only use it for bombs (all three types), the EFT, or low-altitude stealth Kerbal insertion- see James Bond. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E I think that it can also be used for ground refueling, too, if I put a docking port in it.
