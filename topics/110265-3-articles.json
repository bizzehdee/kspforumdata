It had countermeasures last I looked at it. I believe they were on the wings. And the ladder should be tied to the gear action group so it retracts and extends with the gear. I will have a look at the engine and intakes for ways to improve performance. Moving the wheels back causes a longer takeoff roll. \n\nLooking forward to the next competition it is quite fun. If you ever have need of an ultra fast interceptor, have a look at the original f-2 talon. It can do Mach 2 at 100m. (Yes that is supposed to be 100m)"},{"CreatedByName":"TMasterson5","CreatedById":144591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T08:30:23Z","Content":"ExplorerKlatt it might be tied to the gear.

As long as it is carries something internally. Also good job getting amraams in there they are tricky. Just make sure that they can deploy out of the bay and actually fire.

It is also the most basic of the craft, and cheapest. Unfortunately you did not test the craft in the atmosphere it was designed for, a realistic atmosphere (FAR), so you didn\u0027t get the full potential of the Akula in your test. As far as most bang for your buck, the F-119 Akula would be your choice, but seeing as you are going with more \u0022exotic\u0022 designs that would be expensive losses when faced against the F-119C Akula that is your choice. \n\nIts a shame really because there is a twin engine fighter currently under development by HARM for most nations twin engine cheap multi-role SSTO combat aircraft needs.\n\n![PckHFK5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PckHFK5.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"TMasterson5","CreatedById":144591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:39:40Z","Content":"Hodo the challenge specifically said stock aero so that is your fault.

Keep the planes speed though, the thing is stupid fast and handles well.\n\nHey Tyler, just have a couple of questions about the new specifications. First are you positive the forward canards don\u0027t move? I\u0027ve never had that problem during testing, even in the video you can see that they move, but if they definitely don\u0027t work for you, it\u0027s an easy fix. The other question is about the fins, I guess you mean the ones on the wing roots, but just want to make sure you don\u0027t mean the ones on the wingtips.

I actually kind of like the way the ones on the edges look.

Remember, the aircraft you submit for the finals MUST resemble the original design. This period is for final tweaks only. you may switch out small parts or even large parts if they keep the appearance of the plane the same. You may also add any new features that you wish to. You must re comment on this thread with your final design by 2359 EST on May 28th to be considered. Good luck to all of you!\n\u003E \n\u003E Mk2-Try to do more with the internal weapons bay, try adding more space for weapons and other stuff in there.You need to figure out a way to mount an external fuel tank(decouplers) to the aircraft. Also it is slightly slow to turn so try to add some more control surface area.\n\nOk. So, I can either add more control surfaces or move the main wing (and thus CoL) slightly forward. If I add control surfaces, I run up against the weight requirement. If I move the CoL, they plane becomes too maneuverable, and will spin out at High-alpha, and will lose too much energy in regular turns. Which one do you want?\n\nThe EFT goes inside the weapons bay. It takes the spot of 2 bombs, so two bombs total instead of 4. The bay gave me a lot of trouble, especially with the ARAAM- they like to blow up. As far as I know, you can only use it for bombs (all three types), the EFT, or low-altitude stealth Kerbal insertion- see James Bond. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif) I think that it can also be used for ground refueling, too, if I put a docking port in it. Again, it\u0027s main function would be ground attack, as the missiles don\u0027t like the 1.25 adapter.\n\nAre there extra points if the entire thing is ground-refuel and rearm-able? Say, EFTs and hardpoints attached to docking ports? (Will definitely turn up the weight, tho.)\n\n\u003E Dman all of the requirements remain the same.

As you said it will mess with the weight a lot and will certainly mess with the aerodynamics of the plane also. As for he weapons bay. I assure you it can be done to get them to work because I have a bunch that I have build that both missiles work with. It just takes some time to get it to work right.
