In general, their mass moving around usually isn\u0027t a significant issue for me, so you may get some better suggestions if you tell us why you care about it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T03:29:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didnt really cared about mass...

In that case, you\u0027re stuck with either disabling the CM\u0027s RCS tank until after you decouple, or transferring from other tanks into it prior to decoupling. I\u0027ll be happy to be wrong, but I doubt that tweakables will change that significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne solution which works for now, is to have a single RCS tank or group of tanks somewhere near the top of your rocket, so that you\u0027re not dropping unused RCS fuel with earlier stages. That\u0027s how I\u0027d approach it, unless I was anticipating needing a massive amount of monopropellant and felt that there was a significant advantage to losing some of the dry tank mass along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T04:00:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
