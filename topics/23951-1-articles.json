First off though, I would like to thank Squad for being so awesome and offering everyone who purchases the game before May the expansions for free. My question, though, is how will that work for people who either switched their game over to Steam (such as myself) or people who have bought the game on Steam originally? Will we all get individual activation codes when the plug-in\u0027s and DLC come out or will they be available for download in our library the day of release? I apologize if I\u0027m a little clueless about how this works but an explanation would be appreciated.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROFLCopter64bit","CreatedById":58314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T03:23:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.
