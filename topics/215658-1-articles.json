This is especially true if the assembly has been rotated or inverted, or if an individual part has been rotated or changed from its original orientation. For example, place a large fuel tank and then place a docking port on it. Then rotate the docking port 90 degrees. Now take the whole assembly and drag it across a separate assembly a few times. You will likely see that the docking port has reset its orientation or changed its orientation to something new.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhats more, If you had symmetry mode on, and had multiple of the same assembly, you might find that only SOME of the docking ports had changed orientation while others remained the same, even though they should be perfectly identical.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ashandalar","CreatedById":202969,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-21T18:22:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also experiencing this.
