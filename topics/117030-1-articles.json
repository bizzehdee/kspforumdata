An orbit just under escape speed is necessarily highly elliptical with an apoapsis arbitrarily distant from the primary, and at an arbitrary distance from the primary it takes a negligible amount of delta-V to change from any closed orbit to any other closed orbit.\u003Cp\u003EIf we limit ourselves to transferring between closed stable orbits then intuitively I would expect the most demanding orbital change to then be a 180-degree plane change of the lowest stable orbit. I believe (but have not proven) the most efficient transfer would be a bi-elliptic. That would be a burn to nearly escape speed, an arbitrarily small burn at apoapsis arbitrarily far from the primary, and a circularisation from nearly escape speed. At any given height escape velocity is \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12 times circular orbit speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore the maximum required delta-V for a transfer between two orbits is 2x(\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12-1) or \u003Cstrong\u003E82.8%\u003C/strong\u003E of the speed of the lowest stable orbit. Far less than twice the escape speed, which is 2x\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12 2.83 times the speed of the lowest stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course you can use more - this analysis assumes that one you are given your orbits you want to get between them as efficiently as possible. There is also the big caveat that I am assuming an unlimited sphere of influence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we do not limit ourselves to closed orbits then of course we can choose two trajectories shooting through the system as fast as we like and have any delta-V requirement to transfer we like. If we do not limit ourselves to stable orbits, and instead allow suborbital trajectories, I am unsure what impact this would have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: By considering the bi-elliptic transfer, rather than the Hohmann transfer, I think you can prove that a 180 degree plane change of the lowest stable orbit is indeed the most demanding orbital change. If either the initial or final orbit is any higher it will have a lower orbital speed and correspondingly a lower escape speed at that altitude, and thus require less delta-V to escape from or enter from escape.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T14:06:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 02:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cantab\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T14:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf we limit ourselves to transferring between closed stable orbits then intuitively I would expect the most demanding orbital change to then be a 180-degree plane change of the lowest stable orbit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is more demanding to perform a 180 degree plane change at periapsis of an orbit with the minimum safe Pe and an Ap just inside the SoI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess it depends on how \u0022maximum dV\u0022 is defined, one can spend an arbitrarily large amount of dV between any two orbits by burning inefficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T14:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk thanks Red, now I understand it, I was not imagine the case of a retrograde orbit or any kind of inclination change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T15:54:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo simplify what K^2 said:\u003Cp\u003E1.
