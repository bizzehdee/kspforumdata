Each of these three is available in Post #2 of this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*One is the \u0022stockalike\u0022 set. This set is from MFS 3.3 (though J_Davis and Chestburster are currently reworking it to use all the new goodies in RF v4). This tries not to change thrust or mass from what you\u0027re used to. This supports the most engines. Also, so as not to change mass, it comes out of the box setting RF for non-realistic mass mode (aka KSP-style mass mode), where engines mass 3.2x what they would in the real world and tanks about 4x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*One is the RealEngines set. This is by SFJackBauer, and it uses various models (from various parts packs) to represent real-world engines like the Merlin 1D, the SSME, the RS-27, Vulcain 2, RD-107, etc. Because Squad\u0027s engines don\u0027t look like real engines, they\u0027re not supported. RealEngines supports the least number of engines, but each one is lovingly set to be an exact 1:1 performance clone of a real engine, with as close a model as SFJackBauer could find or tweak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*One is the Reaching for the Stars set by me. It\u0027s a set of real\u003Cem\u003Eistic\u003C/em\u003E engine configs: that is, a set of configs that mimic real-world performance but where no particular engine is a 100% copy of a real-world engine. It\u0027s designed for the universe I describe in my Mission Reports series (in sig--sadly unupdated in some time). Because I\u0027m not constrained by needing to duplicate the look of realworld engines, RftSEngines does support Squad engines and many others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can of course do what jrandom just described: use RealEngines, and then copy in any engine from RftSEngines that isn\u0027t modified by RealEngines.

I Nuclear Thermal Rocket Engine\u0022 don\u0027t have Engine Config modules (no tech levels, and the fusion engines / radial boosters still use LiquidFuel). I realize the NERVA uses a HybridEngine module instead, but I think it should still have tech levels since the LV-N does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) the NovaPunch RCS ports don\u0027t have EngineConfig modules like the stock RCS ones do (i.e. monopropellant only)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) the stock R.A.P.I.E.R. engine doesn\u0027t have an Engine Config module (no tech levels for the rocket mode, and still runs on LiquidFuel)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) the control panel for StretchyTanks is glitching where it shows the amount of mass that would be added for filling it with a given fuel: for example, it says \u0022LiquidOxygen Max: 7200 (\u002B0.018 tons)\u0022. When you fill it with LiquidOxygen, however, it adds ~8 tons. The opposite is true for the ElectricCharge resource on the service module tank, which says \u0022Max: 720000 (\u002B203.4 tons)\u0022, but in fact adds 2.034 tons. Image below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) not only do Bobcat\u0027s Soviet Engines still use LiquidFuel, they don\u0027t have any tech levels either (but I think you already know that one, since they\u0027re both done in the EngineConfigs module).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NpG4nue.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NpG4nue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot complaining or anything.
