I have been playing for almost 2 years and with my latest creation my first stage was struggling to perform and burn too much fuel. So I began to wonder if my throttle settings and the overheating (which I always like to keep to a minimum) was a factor. I never figured out for sure. I did figure out that one of my fuel lines (x4 with symmetry) was detached and I was flying with 4 fuel tanks that were not being consumed :-) . I fugured that out a few days ago, but I am glad you asked because I was starting to wonder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that the rest of you \u0022experts\u0022 have provided an answer, assuming it is correct, I am going to push my engines up to the red line for speed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Killerdude8","CreatedById":73130,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T17:13:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnically, Yes, Actually?
