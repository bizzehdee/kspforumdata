With more and more missions being launched each day (everyone\u0027s still working on the \u0022and coming back home\u0022 part) Jeb\u0027s little ragtag enterprise has blossomed into a huge, slightly less ragtag enterprise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re so huge, in fact, they\u0027re opening up a brand new office! In order to...uh...reasons, they\u0027re planning to open one up on the Mun! They\u0027ve pledged to make it the biggest, most magnificent office complex ever built, probably because by now there\u0027s so much scrap on the Mun they might as well move right in!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately their lead architect was also a kerbonaut and got stuck on Minmus during a mission, so they\u0027ve resorted to calling you in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a stock part challenge, as the title suggests, concerned with building a very particular type of Mun base: an office complex. Using whatever stock parts you can, build a Munar habitat that can house as many Kerbals as it possibly can, looks as good as possible, and because this is an office skyscraper, is as tall as possible. It can have no engines of its own, and must be a module made for permanent usage on the Mun. For extra challenges, try some of the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EConstruct a special office somewhere for Jeb, Bob and Bill (or just Jeb) and put them in it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPut other things that an office complex would have, like a company parking lot for ships and/or rovers, a shuttle service, a private communications line with Kerbin, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOnce you\u0027ve got your employees on the Mun, think of the most creative thing to do with them. I dunno, one of those team exercises HR guys talk about or something.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake at least one screenshot of the finished product, and feel free to take any other photos of the complex you made at any other times-during its construction, if you took on any of the other challenges here, whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about it.
