Space stations are so 2013. But since I\u0027ve just learned how to dock and complete good rendezvous, I figured I\u0027d actually try something that I have watched on Youtube and read about on forums, so the project is underway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plan is to keep things very realistic, and seeing a lot of stock ISS builds (GameplayReviewUK was the best) over the last few months, I really wanted to build the station in a way that was similar to the ISS. My end result after the first module launch wasn\u0027t exactly ISS-related, but it worked well, and soon I had 3 more modules up and now I\u0027ve recently added a 4th. I\u0027ve strayed off the path, but I think it\u0027s a good thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, the station consists of a core module, which contains a few small batteries and solar panels, and a 4-way docking adapter. On one side, I have the AB Truss Segment, basically a connector between the truss and core, docked. On the other, I have a simple service module that contains about 500 Monopropellant, and some large temporary solar arrays. Above it, I have a docking adapter and the node 1, which is a 4-way docking adapter made from a PPD-10 container. From that, I have my first living quarters, the lab module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought using the lab was better for living quarters than the PPD-10 Hitchhiker because its interior shows actual food, seating, supplies, and beds, which I thought was unique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy avatar is the mission flag, and I hope to get some more modules added, and hopefully add some private spacecraft to the station, as in making a KSP analog of SpaceX. I\u0027d also appreciate if you could send me creative module ideas or craft files, since I\u0027d like to see some interesting parts and community development, much like the international partnerships of the ISS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoping for the best now, as I launch the Aeris 4B (Modified 4A) to dock with the station! Wish me luck, and I would love to see some contributions from the community!

The first was an unmanned tug launch containing the SSTO adapter, which was just a structural fuselage with docking ports. It went well and the approach was done without error. The second was the Aeris 4B launch containing Kelcas Kerman, which also successfully approached and docked with the SSTO Adapter. At this time, I\u0027m working to deorbit and land the Aeris 4B for later reuse!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astrokerb","CreatedById":151932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T00:41:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool!

Basically an energy module. That way you can have the electricity to continously run research, refineries, docking/guidance lights, radiators, communications arrays, and all kinds of other things. also, you would have an easy source of electricity in case you ever decide to turn it into a giant ion powered starship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, maybe add a large habitation complex to it that can be multiple modules if necessary.
