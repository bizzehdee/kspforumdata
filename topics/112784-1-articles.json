The less maneuvering I have to do at the last second before touchdown the better. I\u0027m having an awful time landing my shuttle. Even just a few degrees of yaw away from my direction of travel is disastrous when the wheels hit the ground. So I need to avoid making course adjustments at the last second.\n\nNow I\u0027m coming in from the east as you normally would from orbit. You follow the 90 degree heading all the way in and that will get you in the ball park. But when it comes time to really dial the approach my eyeballs are only good for so much. I tend to use the iva view to zoom in and line it up better, but again it\u0027s just not enough.\n\nWhat I need is a docking port alignment indicator for the runway. A mod, or tool or anything that can help me hit the perfect heading to line my craft up with the runway. This way I can concentrate more on my glide angle and nail the landing.\n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T00:29:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 12:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T18:57:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What I need is a docking port alignment indicator for the runway.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85353](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85353)\n\nLike this one?"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T19:01:36Z","Content":"Ill have to check that out.

Though I might recommend using a rudimentary rover in lieu of flags and then relabeling the thing as a base once it\u0027s in position. Why do this? Because the visual range increases from 30 klicks to 100 klicks, giving you more time to get aligned.\n\nHow rudimentary of a rover am I talking about? In career, take a Stayputnik, stick a fuel tank, a Wheesley engine, a pair of radial intakes and some bush-plane gear on it, plus a radial chute. That\u0027s all you need. Add a battery or solar panel if it makes you nervous. Set the thrust limited down low, and then just give it enough thrust to overcome the inertia. Hit the brakes and pop the chute when it\u0027s in position.\n\nIf you find you need a third point to help with the alignment, put another one of these at 1 kilometer inland. Additional rovers can be added at five kilometer intervals inland for increased accuracy. You can even use them for a glide slope - take your distance to any given marker, add it to the distance that marker is from the Runway, multiply the result by 100 and add 100 - the result is roughly where you want your altimeter, and from there you can tell if you\u0027re high or low.\n\nMyself, I use NavUtilities. But even then, there are merits to having a visual system like this - not the least of which is being able to tell where KSC is from orbit and having a good guess as to where you want to do your de-orbit burn."},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T20:20:31Z","Content":"I\u0027m a big fan of planting flags at either end of the runway, you can see them from miles away and you can use the two of them to see if you are lined up correctly."},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T21:24:29Z","Content":"You do not need airbrakes do land a shuttle with far.

The key here is that for most craft, no more than a 10 degree glideslope is good, and when powered, 5 degrees is ususally the maximum. Notably, those angles are really low, so your final approach should almost hit the hills to the west of KSC before landing eastward, or you should be no higher than the top of the VAB at 2km out landing westward. Again, these are real-life approaches, designed to keep aircraft stress and impact with the ground to a minimum. Kerbals dont care about keeping things intact for longevity, so you can abuse the craft more on landing than in real life."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten 2X4B 523P","CreatedById":134404,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T21:57:05Z","Content":"I use rovers myself, works well."},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T22:41:12Z","Content":"\u003E Also, speedbrakes and (if you have realchutes) drag chutes can help slow your approach.
