But I am not that picky, just so long as its balanced right and looks decent and runs good on my computer. Balance is the big thing though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the standard space station parts size, the real thing would be to get the docking port size and have that standardised but apart from that, I thing a good range of sizes would be best for the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-02T06:24:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you make something long enough to hold a SRB and wide enough to hold a LFT then youll be safe. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
