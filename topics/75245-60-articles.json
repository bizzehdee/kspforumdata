Theoretically you could try to do it by manually programming a suicide burn, but I\u0027d hope your probe is very sturdy. (If you have an airbag mod, though, it might be doable).\u003Cp\u003EWith RemoteTech, Moho is very hard to even get an orbit around because you need to shed a lot of excess speed very quickly, and because slight errors in the burn execution will lead to huge errors in the trajectory. If you need to make a long orbit insertion burn (say, 10 minutes or more), I\u0027d suggest you pick a high periapsis (say, 100-200 km) for your insertion burn, then adjust the orbit later. That will give you much more margin for error at the cost of only a little more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I abandoned the landing idea, and just sent an orbit only probe.
