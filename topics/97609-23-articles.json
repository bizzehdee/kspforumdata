Even though i am not the most talkative on the boards i still have my share on reading and making myself an opinion. I joined KSP back when Version .11 was released and therefore i have seen a lot of stuff change over time. I was there when Kerbalkind first made a manned docking on stock parts, i was there when the first rovers landed on Duna and i was there when the transition from Alpha to Beta was made.. and now as we all know we will soon the the transition from Early Access to Full release, from Beta to 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis whole matter has raised a lot of doubt on the forum and i see a lot of reaction being rather negative on the whole matter.. and i would like to bring the heated discussion to a point that is again reasonable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen i first heard of KSP the game was \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BEjust\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C starting a rocket and flying arround for a bit.. nothing even remotely close to career, no science, no docking and a nice K.I.A. picture when the flight went really wrong (I really miss that one!). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack then there were a lot of promises. New Planets, Spaceplanes of all sizes up to the point of SpaceShuttle-crafts, career mode, science, resources, linux compatibility and much more. So here we are now, three years later and what did we get? Basically everything on the list was promised years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this is a bit plain.. let me put it differently. Back in the days KSP, when Early Access was not a scheme to scam people but a nice way to back projects that just made promises, there was a whole different game. In the occasional news the community was informed of what would happen next and there always was the bigger scope of things into which a lot of small parts did fit into. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been updates adding a lot of parts and others like .18 that introduced a whole lot of new gameplay content beyond parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut pretty much all the updates got considerably more complex every time. Every new feature introduced was by itself a big task and always demanded changes to the game as a whole. Think of the following features that were introduced and increased the scope of the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Spaceplanes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BEJust\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C some parts..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rovers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BEJust\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C some parts and Kerbal-usable-modules (right click ingame on a part.. e.g. repack parachutes, repair wheels etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Docking\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Just a few parts but a whole bunch of changes like a reassigning root-part in game, combining crafts into one, changing savegames etc.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Career Mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E More than enough to sum it up here right now,) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as you can see new Features grew more complex and so did the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course when a program grows more complex it opens up the possibility of exploits and bugs \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and we all have experienced these.

The game definitely IS stable. A lot of the bugs that still exist are either not critical or squad cant be blamed for it as Unity by itself is a buggy framework at some things. Sure.. the incompatibility of the Windows x64 binary IS a concearn.. but this is a problem coming from the framework, not from squad, equally to the vile Linux problem when the game misbehaves on Non-english distros.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont want to say that mods introduce bugs and make the game less enjoyable, no, but i want you to look at the stock game right here right now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game now looks pretty much like the game promised several years ago.. yes. There are things still missing like interactive IVAs, more Planets and clouds.. but really? I dont think they are neccessary to have to call KSP \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BEcomplete\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BEcomplete\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C matter is also misleading. A lot of people consider a software as \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BEdone\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C when it is 1.0 or released. This is not true at all. How many games or programs do you know that are released and are bug free and no longer maintained? Well, how many programs of that kind do you know that are worth talking about? Pretty much every software i know was updated after its initial release a few times.. and some programs i knew were way more buggy than KSP is. A lot of programs are only good after they hit 1.5 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 so a release with bugs in it is nothing special at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut ok, i think that KSP is not compatible to traditional version numbers.. KSP is a game which has changed over time and i trust SQUAD when they say that KSP will keep changing so a ever increasing version number would have been the better solution... Just call Version 27 to be out of EA and continue to work on 28... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso i expect we will see a lot of discussions coming up when 1.9 hits and we approach 2.0.. but well, thats another story... ;0) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in a traditional sense ksp will be a game ready for release. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, i can live with that since i know that from now on Squad doesnt have any excuses anymore to put a lot of effort into bughunt und debugging or increasing the performance without having to give a thought about introducing another big feature.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for me the transition to 1.0 means that now finally bugs can be tackled and later performance can be increased.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what about missing features? Well.. truth to be told: I hope that new features or parts will be scarcely seen until the performance is fixed. On windows KSP is already now on the boundary of what 32bit executables can handle and when now furthermore parts, ivas and whatnot are introduced it might just be too much to handle.. so first things first I\u0027d say.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing i\u0027d like to ask you is to keep trusting squad. I\u0027ve read that people wanted refunds and such.. but really? What havent you got after buying KSP. I must have played more than 1000hrs of KSP (Steam has recorded 422 hours.. yet normally i play from cmdline) Thats about an hour per day.. for three years.. I cant think of any other game except maybe Ultima Online i have enjoyed that much.. and looking at the last few AAA titles i played i dont see any numbers that are even close to that so... in the end i have paid like $20 and got a lot of fun out of it. So.. who of you can truly say that investing the equivalent of two pizzas and getting hundreds of hours fun out of it is a bad balance? So far squad never lied to us. They made.. bad decisions on what to announce for certain updates but in the end we got everything that was ever officially announced and the game is basically what was announced in the beginning when it was first sold.. Till this day there has not been a single moment that made me mistrusting anything offically said by any squad member and i suppose it is the same for most of you as well... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo just let 1.0 happen.. discussions about its quality can be done when it IS done. So any speculation about its moddability, quality, buggity is right now only speculation and nothing more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have seen past updates being postponed for quality reasons. We have seen updates and hotfixes being released pretty fast.. but we have always got pretty good results and nothing makes me think we wont get a nice and clean 1.0 release. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd keep in mind: We dont have any date yet on when 1.0 is about to ship.. there will be surely enough time for the Experimental and QA Team to do their job ;0) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is nice to build up hype before a release, but i dont think it is now the time for some \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BEloud\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C members of the forum to raise speculation and hype on the negative assumptions they do on things that have not yet been tested or seen by anyone but the devs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy 2ct \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 in too many words ;0)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-26T18:14:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2015 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nachtwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nanobot","CreatedById":108199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T18:13:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope they decide to split up the release into \u00221.0 public RC\u0022 and \u00221.0\u0022.
