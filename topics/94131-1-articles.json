But think about it. If you draw an imaginary line from the center of mass to the contact point of the wheel. That\u0027s the axis that the vehicle has to rotate on to tip right. If like me you have a 4 wheeled symmetrical design then it would tip in the four cardinal directions on the average of two of those axis. The more vertical those are the easier it should be to tip them. Thus The wider more spread out and low to the ground design would prevent tipping of the vehicle. As to why it lurches I think it\u0027s because the acceleration that the wheels give is a particular amount and unless I\u0027m missing something I don\u0027t think I can throttle them. So unlike in a car where you gently up the velocity you can\u0027t seem to do the same in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
