Here\u0027s the low-down on what\u0027s been happening:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - sharpspoonful reported that most of the modules with transparent windows weren\u0027t loading their internal spaces properly in the VAB/SPH editor scene, unless said module was a root part. After consulting with JSI RPM maintainer MOARdV, he\u0027s fixed the plugin to use a better method of iterating over part config nodes to extract the Internal model needed for the transparent pod effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I haven\u0027t had a proper look at the non-functional Blinkenlights yet, but I\u0027ll do so sometime this weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027ve stripped out the FAR definitions for the Warehouse and Payload Bays, as FAR now uses voxel-based aerodynamics with emergent drag occlusion behaviour for cargo / payload bays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I never heard back from Kanddak regarding his MODEL{} node switched plugin, so I\u0027ll probably drop plans to consolidate parts using that.

However, for the past couple of years, various new features, parts, functionality and optimizations have made the parts pack grown to be much more than the initial brief, and so up until now, I\u0027ve been denoting my official stable releases in the R0.XXa format, denoting release candidate alphas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinishing off the IVAs for the modules would complete one of the major milestones for the project. \u003Cstrong\u003EThus, I\u0027ve decided that the upcoming R0.04a version will be renamed as the V1.0 release.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERest assured, however, I still plan on continuing work on this parts pack long after the grand V1.0 release - things like external FLEXracks, trusses, solar panels, planetary outpost landing kits, airlock porches, a dedicated station manager plugin, compatibility with other-addons such as EPL and MKS/ORS, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T21:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(Quickie) Progress Report, 15 June 2015\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENumber of days without a KSP-runnable laptop: 138\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMOARdV and I are still investigating the issue behind the non-functional rack blinkenlights, but here\u0027s a nice animated GIF preview from the Unity editor showing what they\u0027re supposed to look like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iAYWIqT.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022iAYWIqT.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFig 87\u003C/strong\u003E - (WIP) FusTek Internals FLEXrack blinkenlights\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StEligius","CreatedById":81789,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T03:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBetween all the blinkenlights on telecom, network and various data acquisition systems I\u0027ve been around I think your animation is wonderful!
