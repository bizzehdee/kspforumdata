And the only way to get it back to Kerbin is if they either: Go back (not get stuck far from kerbin), transmit the data to another vessel/space station in range, or something else you could figure out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also, hide most of the planets and addd a telescope or something (Also add a part, for rockets in orbit or something) to search for planets then you go to them yourselves and gain info\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemrav","CreatedById":91029,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T18:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1 : good idea but..... voyager 1 is way out there and we can still communicate \u002B if we limited the things then people complain of transmitting being useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 : its planned however its probably going to be more of a ground based observatory... devs didn\u0027t shed much light on it...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeel","CreatedById":89647,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T22:05:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell the basic comunitoron could have a range limit, since it\u0027s just an antenna. The dish version however would not, since it can be directed and focused. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever it could be interesting if you had to have line of sight (so a big planet could block you), and if you actually needed to point the dish at kerbin (just make it possible to \u0022control from here\u0022 on a dish, then set kerbin as target, and it should be easy). Similarly a relay system, where you transmit to another ship would require some targeting - and it might be required to get science of the surface of a planet if it\u0027s hard to get line of sight back to kerbin, just transfer to an orbital probe that can relay the message.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore with varied transfer rates some science could take a very long time to send, requiring a long window within line of sight - further complicating the communication in some cases (though I would add a manageable way to store/queue data so you can fine tune your transfer. You could even split the data into smaller packets if you pass into sight for regular but short periods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amaroq","CreatedById":57607,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T22:43:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI doubt hiding is going to happen, as we discovered Uranus in 1781, Neptune in 1846, and Pluto in 1930, so if KSP simulates the 1950s-1970s space race, all the planets in the system should be discovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the \u0022transmission issues\u0022, you might enjoy the mod Remote Tech 2, which does implement communication limits, including occlusion of line of sight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T22:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlanet occlusion would be good, though remotetech already does this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
