It\u0027s a bit complex, in that there are two forms (away-from-Kerbin and been-in-this-bucket-too-long).  The first tracks how long the Kerbal has been in space, and never resets.  The second tracks how long they\u0027ve been in their current vessel/ship, and resets with each ship.  Both are affected by ship size/type of spaces/number of crew, etc.\n\nCurrently USI-LS can\u0027t be completely closed loop either - you need a resources (fertilizer) that you can only get on Kerbin.  (Though RoverDude has said that there will be a way to generate it in the future.) So my thought was that this system could be a closed loop (in that you can get anything you need to keep it running off-planet), suitable for initial exploration and colony setup before the bigger greenhouses get built/shipped in.  The downside being that morale mechanic - You *can* run it forever, but your Kerbals won\u0027t be happy with you.  (And what happens then is configurable.)\n\nI\u0027d offer to help more, but I want to actually get through the science tree once before investing in playing with a life support mod.  (Though I\u0027m tracking the info so I can mentally compare how it would work, and tracking this mod as something I intend to use as part of that.  I actually have installed Soylent and used the parts, but just as a \u0027ok, this base would need some supply something\u0027 cosmetic thing so far.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T18:30:30Z","Content":"Hello,\n\nWhile I havnt looked into making food out of algae (there may be a certain type that is better for food making (not blue-green?)), I found a recipe for making a compound that ends up being a material for a reverse osmosis filter used in all the purifiers/extractors to filter out the smallest particles (a required filter for drinking water (I also use carbon for that as well)), AND I am making Ethanol, which in turn makes antiseptics.\n\nI also make cellulose from the Algae; for First Aid Kits and clothing material !

Chiton (micro shrimp shell) is a useful material also I think? \n\nI\u0027d done some reading and forward osmosis sounds useful also; for example a concentrated edible (glucose) solution and a FO membrane will pull 85% of the water out of urine without energy input, you have to activated charcoal filter it first. e.g. [HTIWater.com](http://www.htiwater.com/divisions/personal_hydration/products.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-03T00:14:09Z","Content":"Hello,\n\nHeh...how do we know Kerbals spout humanoid byproducts?!
