Anyway, the launch stage is a ring of jet boosters that go around the plane cockpit area, then a looong hull (mk2) that goes along the plane\u0027s bottom, and a big rocket engine on an MK2 to MK3 adapter so that center of thrust is flush with center of mass.\n\nThe process of separation looks really impressive as the airplane extricates itself from the ring of boosters, going in reverse on RCS and turning tail to a side to get past the hump on the back.

I usually also have a fin on those large boosters that \u0022catches the wind\u0022 and helps them separate cleanly.\n\nThe radial boosters \\*will\\* hit your center stage. But did you notice what\u0027s the unit of impact durability of components? m/s. If you go with your engines off, they will bounce off harmlessly. If you\u0027re going 20m/s relative to them when they bounce, things \\*will\\* explode.\n\nThe \u0022untouchable\u0022 approach is difficult to execute. Accept that things will collide, bounce, scratch, just make sure they do it within allowable force, and things get much easier.\n\nIf you get better at that, you can accept controlled destruction of parts as an important aspect of the game.\n\nI have a return/reentry vehicle with an mk3 passenger cabin, a cargo bay, a fuel tank just big enough to get back home, and a weak engine of good ISp. And **\\*not enough parachutes\\*** to slow it down to a safe landing speed.\n\nThe engine is the crumple zone. It explodes upon ground impact, producing just enough upward force to slow down the rest to a safe speed.\n\nDamn the 1.0.3 new thermal model. Yesterday I was testing an abort sequence for my SSTO MK3, and couldn\u0027t get it right. The idea was to include a bunch of separatrons inside the cargo bay (just behind the cockpit) and make them fire into the walls. By destroying the cargo bay, the cockpit would get separated. OTOH yesterday I successfully made a cluster bomb. Lots and lots of separatrons on a liquid fuel fuselage, plus a strut with a couple separatrons aimed \\*into\\* the fuselage. As it explodes it frees the 100 or so separatrons attached to it, flying \\*roughly\\* in direction the thing was aimed.\n\nSimply, an engine/solid fuel booster can change any part into a decoupler.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T10:08:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 10:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T11:13:13Z","Content":"Too bad ullage motors have no place in stock KSP yet, as they would add another very interesting dimension to our staging events.\n\n Not sure if there are any mods which mimic it..."},{"CreatedByName":"WeirdCulture","CreatedById":76591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T11:23:13Z","Content":"Both.
