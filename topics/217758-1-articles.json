Let\u0027s say you are a simple man who wants to make a large solar electric space probe, you have two issues though, you don\u0027t have an orbital colony advanced enough yet to make an entire spacecraft from scratch, and the spacecraft needs so much scaffolding that you can\u0027t send it up in one piece. You can do a lot of tedious orbital assembly to get the scaffolding you need.. but this presents another option. All you need to send up to get the spacecraft you want is this (pretend the XS fuel tanks is metal storage).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022134.53\u0022 height=\u0022639\u0022 width=\u0022475\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418965221630017537/1120072929355518023/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom there you dock it to an orbital colony, and from the orbital \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E interface, you can choose to import a spacecraft.

Here you can move it around as much as you want. In this case, your orbital \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is the lowest level, so all you need is scaffolding. You break the spacecraft in two, use the metal in the storage to make a bunch of trusses, then use the solar panels already there and attach it to the sides. With all that said and done, you now have a spacecraft like this that you were able to send up in a much smaller package then if you were to assemble it orbitally traditionally.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022102.83\u0022 height=\u0022653\u0022 width=\u0022635\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418965221630017537/1120075521817051257/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ability to do this seems like it could enable a lot of really cool designs when it comes to things like solar panels, radiators, and radiation management, and it would add a way to modify spacecraft \u0022on the fly\u0022. The ability to do this would also be very nice for things like taking advanced engines on spacecraft and moving them over to other spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-18T19:44:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2023 07:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Strawberry\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CiberX15","CreatedById":68461,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-19T15:01:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo is the idea to allow bringing materials up to orbital ship yards? I was under the impression that that was already an intended feature. My impression of the base building mechanics was that you could build a base either in orbit or on a planet. That base could then build new craft so long as it had the resources to do so. The resources could then be supplied either manually by flying a ship there, mined and processed on sight (if you\u0027re on a planetoid), or they could be delivered autonomously. In any case my understanding is the ship building component just needs resources, it doesn\u0027t care where they come from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that I say that though I\u0027m not 100% where I got my mental image of what that feature is supposed to look like.
