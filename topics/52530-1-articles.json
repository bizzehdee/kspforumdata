This was before I knew there was a quick-save function. So for the past 12 hours I have been trying to rescue him from an orbit around the Sun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWilson\u0027s orbit is huge and making an orbit intersect is really hard, I finally made a 12km separation intersect path after countless attempts, but even so I cannot rendezvous with his ship. When I switch to space view and hit F4 I can get within 3km of him, but he zooms past because of the velocity difference. I tried chasing him from that point but by the time I catch up the orbit disparity is massive even though on the map view I cannot differentiate between either orbit path they are that close. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole orbit is roughly 32 billion meters, there seems so little room for error and any burn I do must be accurate within a few hundredths of a second to make intersects work. Is there a better way to do this ?
