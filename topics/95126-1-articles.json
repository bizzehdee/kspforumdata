Rockets don\u0027t cost \u003Cem\u003Eenough\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe root of the problem is that the \u0022Funds Penalties\u0022 applies to the cost of building upgrades, but \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E the costs involved in running missions (part costs and part unlock costs). Compared to normal mode, buildings essentially cost about 4x the normal cost, while rockets cost just less than 2x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ideal career mode would have rocket costs \u003Cstrong\u003Ehigh\u003C/strong\u003E while leaving building upgrades normal. I want to emphasize building cost-effective rockets rather than running a hundred contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m going to try something like this instead:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Funds Rewards 30%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Funds Penalties 30%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may think, \u0022Funds Penalties 30%?! But that\u0027s less than Easy mode!\u0022 Well, that\u0027s not really true. What\u0027s really important is the \u003Cem\u003Eratio\u003C/em\u003E between rewards (all of your income) and the costs. By setting both to 30%, they keep the same scale as if they were both 100%, like adjusting for inflation. BUT that\u0027s not really true either. Since rocket costs do \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E change with any of the sliders, getting just 30% rewards will drastically cut down the profit margins for each contract, making it harder to build up cash, thereby increasing the effect of any penalties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESettings like this should make reusable ships much more important. I\u0027m not sure yet how Strategies are affected by the sliders, but if they aren\u0027t affected at all, this should make the funds-for-science and science-for-funds strategies a bit more reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T15:15:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is development discussion \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think there\u0027s a way to change part, and by extension craft costs in the code yet, so it\u0027s more work than just adding another slider, also I think building costs shouldn\u0027t be the limiting factor, instead you should get far lower returns on your contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe offered contracts also should be harder, and be possible with available tech but certainly not beginner friendly, it\u0027s meant to be hard mode, not hand-holding new player mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are not a good pilot and play on hard, you should expect a rough time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T15:18:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think this is development discussion \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI intended it to be more of a discussion about how players can use the existing custom sliders to create a better \u0022Hard mode\u0022, rather than suggesting how the game itself should be changed, but I suppose it\u0027s hard to have the former without at least implying the latter\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torquemadus","CreatedById":97777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T15:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe pic below shows my \u0022rebalanced\u0022 settings for Hard Mode.
