With the tall and narrow tanks, I usually do not strut them vertically, even if they are 6 tanks high. Orange tanks: I always strut between them. The non orange rockomax tanks I might strut if they are 4 tanks tall, otherwise I only strut them if testing reveals they need it. An effective solution is to skip over tanks when placing struts. Using the small cubic struts to extend outwards from and tank and then strutting the cubic struts works very well, so tank #1 is strutted directly to tank #4, with #2 and #3 in the middle unstrutted. Building a taller rocket usually is better in terms of manuverability (the distance by which the thrust vector passes by the center of mass determines tourque) if you\u0027re using gimbaled engines, but can lead to wobbling. So tall but not too tall works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bunzmaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bunzmaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-If I add a series of Radial Decouplers up the side of a tank (vertically) , when I attempt to attch something to them it will only be solidly connected to one of the decouplers. even though the others appear to be in solid contact. I end up having to use struts to connect everything.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the correct behavior. For now there can only be one \u0022parent\u0022 for a part, so the tanks are being joined to the tank below or above, not the decoupler. You can attach a side tank with only one decoupler, and then use the struts to connect the tanks further up the stack. Otherwise you can make each lateral tank parented to different decouplers, leaving a gap between tanks which would need fuel lines to connect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bunzmaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bunzmaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-If I add a struts connecting an item that is in an early stage, to say the command module, does that strut automatically disconnect when the staged piece disconnect from the rest of the ship? Does that stress or cause any damage?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, struts only work within one vessel; when you decouple, the spent stage becomes another vessel so the struts automatically disengage. Strutting between stages is very common and very effective, and there will be no harm doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther tip. When strutting multiple stages, I typically start at the bottom stage and strut up, so that when the stage disconnects the mass of the strut falls away with the stage (because it is parented to the bottom stage). This might not actually do anything in game because struts may have some special physical properties, but it is something I do anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Colonel_Panic","CreatedById":61997,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T05:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bunzmaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bunzmaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI do my best to keep my Rockets/vehicles as simple as possible, but lately I\u0027ve been building larger rigs for landers, and to pickup stranded Kerbals.\u003Cp\u003E As I add more Rockets and Fuel Tanks I\u0027m starting to have issues with keeping everything together, I\u0027ve landed on the Mun without anything falling off, but now as I start to go bigger I start to have issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If I have 2 of the orange tanks one on-top of the other, and a Mainsail on the bottom, sometimes the 2 tanks aren\u0027t securely connected. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I need to add struts to the seams between every tank?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it better to refrain from placing tanks one ontop of the other?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can stack tanks. You can also add struts in 3 symmetry around the joint to reinforce it, even if you can\u0027t see the struts externally.

For best practice, use the \u0027long\u0027 decouplers positioned near the top 1/3 of the stack, and use a strut to reinforce near the bottom. Note: you may experience extreme wobble and stability problems. This often is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot the fault of poor reinforcement\u003C/strong\u003E but rather the gimballing on the outer engines causing a positive feedback loop and oversteer. Fix this by setting them to a control group to toggle gimballing, and turning the gimballing off before flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bunzmaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bunzmaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-If I add a struts connecting an item that is in an early stage, to say the command module, does that strut automatically disconnect when the staged piece disconnect from the rest of the ship?
