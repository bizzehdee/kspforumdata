EXTREMELY slowly. At first I thought it might be Active Texture Management reloading textures since I had just Updated and reinstalled B9 aerospace among other mods, so despite how slow it was loading (IT TOOK 4 DAYS!), I persevered. Today when I got home I checked my computer and KSP had crashed after 4 days of continuous loading. Thinking that it would load faster now that it had loaded the game once, I started it up again, only to find that it was loading at the exact same speed. I still thought that ATM was the problem, so I removed it, however when I started it up again it still loaded at nearly the exact same rate (marginally faster). By this point I was getting pretty frustrated, especially since the earlier crash did not generate a crash report so I had no idea what the problem was. I reinstalled the game (and kept my mods), but no dice there either. I finally gave up and google\u0027d the problem, and heard of the network adapter solution, but that didn\u0027t work either! I am officially out of ideas. As far as I know none of my mods conflict, so that shouldn\u0027t be the problem.
