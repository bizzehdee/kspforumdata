I plotted my course and got within 40.000 km for about 1500 m/s dV. After reaching the descending node I burned an additional 900 m/s to synchronize the planes. After some month I set up a correction burn of about 200 m/s to get an intercept with Dres. In the perapsis I perfomed the insertion burn for another 1900 m/s.

So Jeb was ready to move on. He had about 4500 m/s left to get to Dres orbit and back to Kerbin. As I can aerobrake this should suffice.

I realized I\u0027d need a starbase that could refuel based off of local materials rather than pricy launches, a virtual Kerbilon 5 of trade and commerce. I also realized that the Kethane vs. Karbonite \u0022resource format wars\u0022 had begun, so such a station should be able to detect, refine, utilize, and be a base for testing both resources. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lacking any sort of base around the Mun, I\u0027ve spent a lot of time around Minmus, enjoying its lower gravity and small surface area. I realized, though, the Mun would likely have a better supply of resources and is easier to reach for less maneuverable craft, so I set to work with this around Mun. I use LAZOR for one reason: the docking camera. Highly recommend. The rest of the mod is space magic but docking camera 4tw. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order of flight, the modules above are separated as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Administration and habitation (Center). This is where my krew can kick back when off duty. This module holds up to 10 kerbals because Lander Cans make great station admin modules. Clampotron Sr\u0027s at each end formed the foundation for the spine of the station, and the spokes end in standard model Clampotrons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Power Plant (Far right, with solar arrays). A couple of parts mods included advanced batteries that are rather massive, as well as the Karbonite reactor module that lets you burn it for power. Stacking two generators, decorating with standard solar panels and covering it in XL batteries upped the station to over 4k capacitance. I knew this would be needed for the refineries to come, and to manage liberal use of RCS when things start getting wobbly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Science Module (Far left, rear). This module is a typical science pod with antennae, a cupola, and RCS. It actually replaced the main engine that brought the Admin section up for balance. It also has the station\u0027s resource detection suites. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Karbonite Processing Facility(Bottom left, mostly orange): This was the first challenging thing to dock. This is partially because it had to dock to an arm without spinning the station, and partially because I forgot it\u0027s a bad idea to Dock Under the Influence. I had to rotate the entire module and thwack the spinning station with the module size adapter to successfully dock. This is also the first ship to which I fitted Winches from KAS....and how I figured out I need things to actually winch to. Oh well, EVA tethers!. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Kethane Processing Facility (Bottom Right, mostly Green): The station was more stable now with so much mass facing the Mun, so I had an easier time of docking this. It\u0027s basically Kethane processors wrapped in Kethane storage tanks. Both this module and the Kerbonite module can allow ships to dock. This module I successfully tethered to the station core with a KAS winch for additional stability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Fuel Storage Facility (Ridiculously huge thing, top): All of that refining of fuel and monoprop has to go somewhere, and here is where. By strapping detachable LVNs to the smaller tanks, getting the payload to the station was easy. In hindsight, I think I\u0027d better rotate the station so this module faces downward toward Mun before filling it up, I made it way too big and high capacity. It can\u0027t store Xenon; I didn\u0027t have it unlocked yet. The winches are there to assist with future refueling operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal krew space: 2 admin module, 2 Science module (currently unmanned), 1 power plant copula, 1 fuel storage copula, 8 habitat (unmanned), 2 Karbonite plant, 1 kethane plant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActive krew: 7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax krew: 17\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit: 54.2k/53.5k\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext step? The mining begins. I\u0027m considering adding a Xenon module and using Ion ferries to carry raw materials from Mun to the station.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-25T15:29:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2014 03:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by corvustech\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpacing for readibility\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aramil","CreatedById":95952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T15:46:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made a B9 Battlestar \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1193.photobucket.com/user/aramil1701/media/ksp/screenshot17_zpsd23ce234.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1193.photobucket.com/albums/aa351/aramil1701/ksp/screenshot17_zpsd23ce234.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot17_zpsd23ce234.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1193.photobucket.com/user/aramil1701/media/ksp/screenshot5_zps168e567e.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1193.photobucket.com/albums/aa351/aramil1701/ksp/screenshot5_zps168e567e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot5_zps168e567e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1193.photobucket.com/user/aramil1701/media/ksp/screenshot7_zps00d181b1.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1193.photobucket.com/albums/aa351/aramil1701/ksp/screenshot7_zps00d181b1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot7_zps00d181b1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1193.photobucket.com/user/aramil1701/media/ksp/screenshot6_zps3c7b8559.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1193.photobucket.com/albums/aa351/aramil1701/ksp/screenshot6_zps3c7b8559.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot6_zps3c7b8559.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
