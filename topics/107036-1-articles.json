Directory moves. Modded parts in stock directory or that point to stock directories may not work.\n\n- MK1 parts have moved here \u0022Parts\\Structural\\mk1Parts\u0022\n- NASA into the Parts directory.\n\nMods that point to Models in these directories will fail to work, and will paint orange in your debug reloads. \n\n2. Obviously the cfg files are reformatted, other modules may be added. On certain parts (adapters, decouplers) this module has been added. \n\n    DRAG_CUBE    {        cube = Default, 3.272327,0.7808633,1.97612, 3.272327,0.7810537,1.97612, 11.00077,0.8435503,0.4720254, 11.00077,0.8433413,0.4720254, 3.272327,0.7660723,1.97612, 3.272327,0.7661255,1.97612, -2.384186E-07,0,0, 3.7678,0.8747007,3.7678    }\n\n(I think they probably could have rounded off at the 4th digit)\n\n3. The bottom .. \u0022nod\\_stack\\_bottom\u0022 should\u0027ve flipped its attach vector.\n\n    node_stack_bottom = 0.0, -0.4365587, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3\n\n will become \n\n    node_stack_bottom = 0.0, -0.4365587, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 3\n\n4. The tech-tree id string may have changed. So you will have to manually change the string to one in the list. \n\n5. This line has been added\n\n    bulkheadProfiles = \n\nCommon entries are \u0022size1, srf\u0022, \u0022size0, srf\u0022, \u0022size2, srf\u0022, \u0022size1,size2\u0022"}]}
