This can be seen in the overall shape, the positioning of the power cartridge, and the position of the safety system. While the M26 used a crude flip-switch, the M48-LA is fitted with ambidextrous use fingerprint scanners, to ensure that the gun is being wielded by its owner. The power cartridge also carries a remaining life readout, and the darts auto-retract, allowing for quick change of cartridge and cartridge reusability. However, the M26 is fitted with a laser target, which the M48 lacks. It does, however, come with iron sights.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
