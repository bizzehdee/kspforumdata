For me there was a time when I had a ton of mods (especially, when plugins appeared - I even had my own), then there was a time when I went pure stock (with stock growing up to such a size and functionality and me barely having the time to learn new features), now I\u0027ve installed kOS (and totally love it - I\u0027m better at engineering than piloting, but I don\u0027t want the MechJeb type blackbox that does everything for me either).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, whatever fits your story. But I\u0027d like to see your Kerbals developing and trying out some colonization technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, I miss the times of 0.14-0.15 a bit, when the plugins were in their early, most Kerbal state - bunch of great ideas venturing into the unknown, not afraid of messing up. Somehow, the frequency and scale of subsequent updates had shaken this medium too much, forcing it to grow way too serious way too quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T20:21:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deddly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deddly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have a question: how did they identify the saboteur?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElementary my dear watson.
