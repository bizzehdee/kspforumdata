Between the animations of the characters, the freedom in designing, and an entirely overall relaxing experience, I find myself playing KSP quite often.\u00A0I run a 24/7 YouTube channel focused on science, working with the USGS, NASA, NOAA and other agencies. Science has always been a passion of mine. Being retired now, and able to do my channel as non-profit as my hobby, and using my experience when I worked in an agency, I find myself streaming and sharing this game with people who watch my channel, periodically. I even recently had a friend come and visit me recently, to build a shuttle together. Took us about six hours of having fun and making all kinds of bad ideas work through sheer luck.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith KSP 2 being announced, I am both excited and also wondering what they will do to top the core experience of the game. Designing the crafts and testing them fills almost all of my time, but I also like to watch orbits play out in accelerated time. I see a few new things in the brief video presented, but overall, the experience looks the same. This might be answered by reading the forums more in depth, now that I know about this website. Fortunately, when I posted this on Steam, someone notified me of the much more in depth information on this site that I was missing. I tend to not read too much into the Steam posts, as I do not understand the current tone of that social media. I tend to post and hope for the best, which was a guiding light to here in this situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am sure I will find many of my answers as I peruse through the forums here. However, just to note, my curiosity is currently about depth of the Kerbal background and world/system. I am wondering if this is mostly a graphical update, or if they are going to expound on the complexity of the Kerbal lore and reality. Either way, I am definitely on board to play this, and plan on adding KSP 2 to my gaming library once it is available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to friend me on Steam, I am OldManGamer(OMG). Look for Tom Baker (Doctor Who) playing chess with K-9. Glad to be here, and looking forward to this game coming out. Cheers and Game On.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-29T06:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/199981-kerbal-space-program-2-knowledge-repository/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0you\u0027ll find pretty much everything we know about the game, I also suggest you to take a look at the other KSP2 subsection, the dev diaries, and to follow the account of the game creative director, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/205123-nate-simpson/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022205123\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/205123-nate-simpson/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nate Simpson\u003C/a\u003E, he has the habit of revealing entire new gameplay loops just by replying to some other users questions or speculation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OldManGamerOMG","CreatedById":212481,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-29T06:42:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFantastic!

As you look through the threads here you will probably find that all of us here are speculating on what the new mechanics of the game will play like as well as suggesting to the devs what we in the community would like to see implemented for the devs to consider.

This is an exciting time for video games. We have come so far in so short a time, and games have taken realism to another level. KSP 2 is definitely fitting in that category, from the sounds of it. I should be sleeping, but enjoying my puppy sleeping on my legs. He likes to cuddle with me.
