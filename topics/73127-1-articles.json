I\u0027m more excited about KSP than I\u0027ve been about any other games in recent years. Even though I\u0027ve played it for over 400 hours already, I\u0027m still looking forword to new challenges. And I even bought / built a new computer for it. I love it as much as I loved to play Lego as a child. I\u0027m fascinated, as a Computer Science student, by the modular system that KSP uses and believe that this approach (by modularizing functionality and allowing users to create their own complex systems) could be used in many others areas as well. And I\u0027d like to expand my professional knowledge in this area. The possibilities for KSP seem endless. And while most of my and our ideas might remain daydreams, I like to at least send out some suggestions. But I\u0027m going to split these suggestions into individual threads. I will link these threads here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egreetings from a guy from Austria/Salzburg, living in Karlsruhe/Germany at the moment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELukas\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T00:32:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVelkommen, Infosoph!
