We not only have the problem of everyone getting backed up when firespitter wasn\u0027t updated for a week (talk about first world problems...) where if we had more contributors who could have pushed out an update, that would have been a bit smoother, but you also have the distribution problem noted here where incompatible versions are getting pushed around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMM is pretty close to a community common dll at this point. Devs are removing it from their distributions because it\u0027s so common, and if you are using tools like CKAN it\u0027s easy to ensure that the single installation of MM is up to date - something you can\u0027t do with multiple installs. I\u0027ve got kspapiextensions, firespitter, MM, AdaptiveDockingNode, BDAnimationModules, InterstellarFuelSwitch, KSP-AVC (which has a somewhat different approach to this problem), ModuleRCSFX, and RasterPropMonitor. Now, USI has his own tools that I don\u0027t think are used by anyone other than USI, which is just fine as is, but all of those others I listed are used by multiple mods on my system. Keeping them all in check is a nuisance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me the community (including the devs) would be better served if many of those were merged into a handful of common dlls but in a single package, maintained by multiple people (sarbian could still \u0027own\u0027 MM, but if he had to step away for a while, any of the other guys could easily step in and push a maintenance release out), and pushed up out of the individual mods and into a single install. You\u0027d keep MM as a single dll that handles all aspects of patching mods, you\u0027d keep RPM as handling all aspects of IVA, you\u0027d have one that handled all animations, one for all fuel and resource handling, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy $0.02, easily offered since I\u0027m not (yet) part of that dev community having to deal with it first hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCardinal","CreatedById":22874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Diazo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Diazo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E ..... part bloat is one of my pet peeves ......\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, you asked for it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t just combine the different parts into one but remove the need for multiple instances of that (combined) part.

Using the Fuel Sensors (really resource sensors), I was able to control power drain well when I engaged my engines. However, I wasn\u0027t able to control charging my caps because the fuel sensors only read one way. Any chance of letting the fuel sensors fire off when a resource passes some mark while INCREASING? I think this would be even more useful now with ISRU implemented in the stock game. (e.g. auto-stopping drills and/or converters when tanks are topped off.) Oh, and add an auto-reset option to the fuel sensors as well if you\u0027re gonna implement bi-directional triggering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one small pet nitpick: during my use of this mod in 0.90, the AG selection with AGExt installed was set in clusters of \u002225\u0022...

(If there was a Group 0, I wouldn\u0027t say anything...) Any chance you could shift that group selection grouping to actually be 25 AGs per cluster?
