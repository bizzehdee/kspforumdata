I just dock with standard stability assist although I do like haveing a mod that adds a proper alignment indicator, either as its own window or to the navball. Properly balanced RCS placement also helps alot. There\u0027s also an easy trick for no RCS docking as long as at least 1 of the 2 craft has a docking port lined up with its thrust vector. Get close and kill relitive velocity, swap to non thrusting ship and point its docking port at the other ship, swap back point ship at the now aligned docking port and give a little tap of thrust, perfect dock every time as long as you dont take too long.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T10:22:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve put off upgrading until all my mods are updated but this feature seems like MJ\u0027s Smart A.S.S. only with less options.
