I was testing an Orion capsule and whilst re-entering the atmosphere my separated orbiter \u0027trunk\u0027 passed below me. I then used timewarp which caused the \u0027trunk\u0027 below me to visibly move forward and back in space. I made a video which I will upload here too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Has anyone encountered this before?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
