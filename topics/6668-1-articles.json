It is capable of repeated takeoff and landing, both with and without the war section. It should be noted that this is still in development, and is tail heavy. It has not been tested with weapons yet. The war section, if damaged or out of fuel, can be jettisoned. Current furthest range in testing was 182Km, flight ceiling at 9000m. Please bear in mind that by the end of this, the war section was gone, and the Cyclone had broken apart on impact.
