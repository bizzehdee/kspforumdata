However, during reentry, my wings exploded due to overheating, as well as the cargo bay, and mono-propellant tanks. The craft says that it\u0027s compatible with KSP 1.0.4. Should I just set ignore max temperature and unbreakable joints? Should I go in like the real shuttle, or go in nose first?"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T21:32:35Z","Content":"To just land a space plane:\n\n\u003E Deorbit burn to an orbit with a Pe of 45 km.\n\n\u003E Hold an AoA of 25-40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 until the atmosphere really bites at 20 km.\n\n\u003E Maintain a AoA above the horizon until Mach 4.\n\n\u003E Manuver normally around Mach 2.\n\nTarget your entry by varying the timing of your burn with the same flight profile."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T22:03:24Z","Content":"If you have access to airbrakes, include them on your design; they\u0027ll help you lose speed without gaining a great deal of heat.

The amount of lift and drag your craft has along with flight profile can make a difference of up to half Kerbin\u0027s circumference! Most folks learn their reentry from a fixed altitude (around 80 km) or use predictive tools to estimate atmospheric trajectory.\n\nIf you can save and load, deorbit once or twice and note where you wind up WRT the original Pe you set. I recommend starting with the Pe above your landing site. Unpowered landings are much tougher than powered decent. You only really get one shot at landing at your chosen site and energy management becomes critical to realize any cross-range capabilities."},{"CreatedByName":"I_Killed_Jeb","CreatedById":84817,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T23:52:15Z","Content":"I find that a Pe of 55 km approx opposite of KSC from an 85x85 orbit allows a very nice unpowered glide into the runway in a well-lifted, aibraked craft without *too* much concern for heat.\n\nSource: 10 hours of playtesting SSTO re-entries in 1.0.4"},{"CreatedByName":"almagnus1","CreatedById":78068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T00:32:14Z","Content":"Part of the Shuttle reentry involved S Turns, which is essentially putting the bottom of your space plane into the prograde vector while pointing your nose to the left or right, essentially making giant S\u0027s to bleed off speed in the 20k-30k region, where the atmosphere is biting in. You\u0027d then turn the other way, so you can correct the change in trajectory (thus flying an \u0022S\u0022, hence the maneuver name).\n\nIf you can learn to do this, it can help to slow you down. Expect to see SSTO confetti when learning though, as it\u0027s really easy to get TOO aggressive with this maneuver and rip the plane apart, especially with FAR installed.\n\nEdit: You may want to read [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle#Re-entry_and_landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle#Re-entry_and_landing), as this goes into detail on what I\u0027m failing at describing XD\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T00:42:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 12:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by almagnus1**"},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T01:14:00Z","Content":"Part of why angling up is helpful, other than bleeding off speed, is it keeps your altitude from dropping as quickly.

In thinner upper atmosphere it is a very high angle of 30-40, but around 20km altitude you\u0027d be pointed just above the horizon a few degrees. You can watch the little dial at the top that shows your vertical drop rate, and try to find the angle that minimizes that(keeps it as close to the 0 marker as possible, although you won\u0027t be able to get it very close to 0 descent rate, just that you are trying to find the angle where you aren\u0027t dropping as quickly).\n\nAlso, when you drop your 170km orbit periapsis down into the atmosphere, don\u0027t drop it very deep or you will come in too steeply and reach thick atmosphere too quickly.\n\nI usually don\u0027t drop my periapsis below 55k, but if I\u0027m coming in really hot from a high apoapsis, I\u0027ll only do 60 or 65k.

Without additional thrust, anything that dips that low is going down somewhere near Pe with correct flight profile. Spend too long too high and variances make it hard to predict landing site. I also strongly recommend keeping it above 36 km. That\u0027s about the height where lift starts to work. You want to linger there so let drag, not orbital momentum, take you there. Anything at our below 20 km is crazy. You are getting to the danger zone on orbital momentum alone and not allowing drag to do much work for you.\n\nFor fun, the extended mission for one of my cheap probes was a radial return from Minmus orbit. I added 500 m/s at the start to target KSC directly and another 1 km/s before reentry. I think it popped without any heat guages at about 36 km. It was relatively fine until that point."},{"CreatedByName":"TronX33","CreatedById":109784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T04:21:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As I said, sticking to a common decent profile really helps in reaching a specific landing zone, but what you use is up to you.\n\u003E A Pe of 45 km works well because there is a noticeable increase in drag at 50 km.
