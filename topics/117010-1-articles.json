The amount of lift and drag your craft has along with flight profile can make a difference of up to half Kerbin\u0027s circumference! Most folks learn their reentry from a fixed altitude (around 80 km) or use predictive tools to estimate atmospheric trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can save and load, deorbit once or twice and note where you wind up WRT the original Pe you set. I recommend starting with the Pe above your landing site. Unpowered landings are much tougher than powered decent. You only really get one shot at landing at your chosen site and energy management becomes critical to realize any cross-range capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I_Killed_Jeb","CreatedById":84817,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T23:52:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find that a Pe of 55 km approx opposite of KSC from an 85x85 orbit allows a very nice unpowered glide into the runway in a well-lifted, aibraked craft without \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E much concern for heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESource: 10 hours of playtesting SSTO re-entries in 1.0.4\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"almagnus1","CreatedById":78068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T00:32:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPart of the Shuttle reentry involved S Turns, which is essentially putting the bottom of your space plane into the prograde vector while pointing your nose to the left or right, essentially making giant S\u0027s to bleed off speed in the 20k-30k region, where the atmosphere is biting in.
