I do not understand why it differs from Surface readings when Kerban has no wind. I found this while flying west from KSC at about 20000m, Surface 1829m/s, Air Speed 1933m/s, Orbit 1636m/s. Note it is hard to keep straight and level at these altitudes so readings taken several second apart. Orbit is different because of Kerbans rotation but why is there a 100m/s difference between surface and air speed?\n\nI\u0027m sure I will be face palming soon ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T04:56:48Z","Content":"Uhh air speed?
