You need to figure out a way to stay in the upper atmosphere as long as possible and let it slow you down. There are lots of ways to do this, from a very high periapsis and many aerobraking orbits, to wings to give you lift, or using your heat shield as a wing to generate lift and keep you you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are coming in at less than 3km/s and you keep your periapsis no lower than 35k, you\u0027re going to be fine. If you are coming in steeper than that, you\u0027re going to have real trouble. If you are moving much faster, you should probably aerobrake a few times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse quicksaves, and practice your re-entry profiles and what your ship can take. It can be easier to use a slightly unbalanced ship to help your heatshield generate lift. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are down below 10km, keep an eye on your speed. If you\u0027re still moving really fast, let the atmosphere slow you down more. If you\u0027re opening your chutes at 1km/s, you\u0027re going to have problems. Get under 500m/s. Get under 300m/s. The atmosphere will really start to slow you down quickly under 10k, as it thickens very rapidly with decreasing altitude, just as it thins very quickly going up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pondafarr","CreatedById":99169,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T19:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDitto everything Cetera said. If you use mods, B9 aerobrakes can be useful as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xrayfishx","CreatedById":76147,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T19:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother mod that helps is RealChute. It makes the parachutes open slowly, therefore gradually decelerating your spacecraft, instead of making a 20g bump. If you don\u0027t want to use that, set the parachute deployment pressure to 0.5, it will open it at a very low altitude so you\u0027ve already slowed down by that time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WeatherMAN","CreatedById":112080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T02:24:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreeing with what Cetera and xrayfishx said: RealChute is a great mod that helps prevent the parachute snapping and with FAR you need to really skim the atmosphere. When I first started using FAR I realized just how \u0027steep\u0027 my entry was. Your goal is to enter into the atmosphere just enough that you won\u0027t get flung back out of the atmosphere on the other side. It takes practice, but it is well worth the quicksave/quickload time!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T09:22:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven stock KSP has a drogue chute you can use at high speeds and high altitudes in order to slow yourself down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"plasmeus","CreatedById":112078,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T19:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EB9 airbrakes are great(even if they are slightly op).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T19:50:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirespitter has airbrakes: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24551-Firespitter-propeller-plane-and-helicopter-parts-v6-3-(May-6th)-for-KSP-0-23-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24551-Firespitter-propeller-plane-and-helicopter-parts-v6-3-(May-6th)-for-KSP-0-23-5\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
