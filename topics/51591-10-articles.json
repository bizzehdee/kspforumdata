My antenna connection button is always red and even when the signal is supposed to be blocked I have control over my probe. is it because i\u0027m using 64bit or I just did something wrong? although I don\u0027t know what that could be as it\u0027s a simple-to-use mod. it used to work on my 0.242 64bit but now on 0.25 it\u0027s kind of broken, it won\u0027t let me send data when blocked, only stores it, as per your new additions but I do have control over probe still... which I don\u0027t want in a situation like that. if there\u0027s a simple answer and i\u0027m just an idiot, my apologies otherwise i\u0027d appreciate a hint \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T17:50:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you updated it ?
