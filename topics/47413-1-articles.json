The Phoenix rocket series will be coming out some later. I will be designating part of my stream this week (which will be on sunday at noon EST instead of saturday because I will be at SIEGEcon) to the development of this line. So far, it started as a prototype launcher I was going to use to launch my new heavy Kethosat to the Mun. The result of some tuning and playing with it is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img208/204/0l0z.png\u0022 alt=\u00220l0z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo keep part counts low (this model is already at 105), I am using Mobius Rocketworks to make the cluster engines, as it has welded cluster mounts. So far, it is fully re-usable (IF you can make orbit and switch back to the main stage in time).

I added another of the double rockomax 32s on it (largest white one), or rather, the equivalent thereof. It didn\u0027t really improve anything. by my calculations, the actually nominal capacity of this launcher is 19.22 tons. I have reached teh point where more is not helping, so time to go less and see if there is a happy medium. The of course we can make a Phoenix XII Heavy which will no doubt have a capacity somewhere around 50 tons minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I am assuming KSP uses metric tons and on that basis, we are running almost 6.1 more metric tons than a Falcon 9 to LKO.

That\u0027s the fancy term of RL, but in KSP it goes as follows: put small cubic struts on both sides of the top of each orange tank. Run struts from the lower parts to them, and from them to the upper parts and the cubic struts above them. Some of them to their corresponding pairs on the other booster for cross-support. The struts will distribute the loads among the parts, instead of the lower parts being much more stressed than the ones on top. That\u0027s how I build my huge boosters, and it turns out rock solid. Oh, and something from experience: struts don\u0027t affect lag as much as other parts: often you get better FPS due to decreased bending, instead of lower because of the increase in part count.
