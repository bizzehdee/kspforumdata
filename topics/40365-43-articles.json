Your receiver dish needs to be, very roughly, facing in the right direction too but you will generate some power so long as you aren\u0027t more than 90 degrees out of alignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022theSpeare\u0022 data-cite=\u0022theSpeare\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo Fractal, what do you already have in mind for heatWaste issues for the future?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot determined yet, it depends somewhat on the feedback I receive about the system so far and what I think is appropriate. Certainly you should expect heat generating components to start shutting down to avoid cooking the ship even more if you get overloaded with WasteHeat but there will likely be some more serious consequences if you leave the problem unresolved. Basically, I want to make sure players will have a chance to do something to prevent the problems getting out of hand without making the whole system danger-free.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mzxs","CreatedById":52969,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T02:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoh ok i thought it just transmitted power from one ship to another thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-04T02:41:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2013 02:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mzxs\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
