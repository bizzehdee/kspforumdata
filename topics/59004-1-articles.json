But i can\u0027t code and can\u0027t do a lot of things with mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i need someone to develope it with me. So my idea is actually new i researched to see if there is a mod out there with my idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd i didn\u0027t find anything, So here\u0027s my idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy Idea\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you want to create your own planet give it a name, Even moons, SOIs And Even Gravity settings? Plus much more settings. This mod will help you do that, It will have an interface, Accessible from the VAB or even in space, All you got to do is put the Part that is added on the rocket. If Your in the VAB then when your creating your planet, You\u0027d have a \u0022Preview\u0022 button, And as you make changes the preview camera will show you them changes. You can do it anywhere in KSP. Also EVA Interface will be accessible. So this mod would be very easy and simple, You can have an optional rocket part and an interface for the VAB and even when your EVA. So you can see your planet being created from the comfort of your favorite planet!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I.T Marcus","CreatedById":86085,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T01:54:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Lolaks, now before you get your hopes up I have no experience scripting either...but I\u0027m willing to learn and I am a little familiar with the Unity interface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMainly what I came to tell you in this reply is that you have a VERY good idea, but I may be able to help you expand the idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy stop at Planets and Moons? I propose instead of a custom planet creator, the player would be able to create a new star system! The way the player could travel between their new horizion is by simply getting on an escape trajectory from the current star, and once they reach a max Alt. it triggers an interface to come up (similar to the tracking station\u0027s) where is could be a map of the current user\u0027s galaxy. This interface would be easy to set-up I imagine, selecting the desired location and it would calculate the Delta-V required to transfer (if at all-possible) and basically subtract it from your current amount. Now for actual implementation of this you would also need new engines and resources to use (perhaps nuclear space jumps?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this would be a gigantic feat of accomplishment just to get a core version working! But why should the physists be the only one\u0027s to create interesting things? Maybe perhaps a lot of preset settings to combine?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you are fully dedicated to wanting to make this happen I just want to let you know that if you wish then you can COUNT ME IN!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-06T01:56:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2014 01:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by I.T Marcus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EForgot closing :D\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T02:32:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a few months of KSP scripting experience, but i know that this is possible with KSP and Unity, but it would require you to create a new planet, which is a very difficult thing (only one mod does it), or edit an existing planet.
