I can\u0027t seem to find a culprit in the logs, but I\u0027ve been suspecting tweak scale, which most of the spacecraft are made of. The rocket seems mostly unharmed, but in KER displays, the torque jumps from 30 kNm to around 500 kNm, which is fatal even for the rocket, with ~ (slightly tweak scaled) 8 large SAS modules/ 12 RCS/ 4 Vernors. the flight logs and the Console Unity Logs only really say structural failure between wings, which the spacecraft is made of. The photos below show the flight with most of the mods I usually play with, but the result remain practically the same with a barebones ProceduralFairngs, KAC, Module Manger, Tweakscale, Procedural Parts (Which I seem to notice nozzle placement is weird after rollout more than once) Ubio Part welding (some with Twekscale modules installed), and MagicSmokeIndustries, used in hinges.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I would not be surprised if that is what is tearing your rocket apart since stock ASAS can be a bit wonky with oscillations, have you tried using less, or disabling them in the early launch phase? I usually disable all the SAS Modules on a rocket during launch and let the thrusters gimbal do the steering, if that fails I often just stick 3 small rigid fins right at the back as that can work wonders with stability.\n\nHave you read the full list of the do\u0027s and dont\u0027s of ubiozur welding? I can imagine that would wreak havoc when used on tweaked parts (just speculating). \n\nThough your screenshots help me rule out a few causes, it would help if you could upload some more detailed screenshots, especially of the offset nozzles and the wing parts. If you are using massive (or in some cases even small amounts) of part clipping that could be an issue, if you do it might help to have a screenshot of the affected section. Also, if nothing else helps maybe you could provide us with the craft file, including a list of dependencies, so we can test ourselves.\n\nAlso I know this may seem dumb, but have you tried adding MOAR STRUTS or installing Kerbal Joint Reinforcement?"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnianBlue","CreatedById":141267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T23:15:09Z","Content":"Ah, I forgot! I had NEAR, as else the rocket would have flipped anyway (.90 Aero anyway). Yes, I ended up using a massive amount of offset/clipping. I did try KJR a while ago, but I ruled it out because it kept happening anyway. I did follow the guidelines for the Ubio Part welding (as far as I know). It depends on Magicsmokeidustries, Ubios part welding, Procedural Parts (and the blackheart texture additions), Procedural Fairings, and tweak scale. The wings are inside the actual spacecraft, as its main structure (and its thermal shield). Also, the offset nozzles seem to be a visual affect in the VAB...\n\nEdit: Here\u0027s the wing parts.

The 3rd stage (The one after you remove the main engine and boosters) is held together by nothing but a decoupler. Add some support struts to it From the top to the bottom. I experienced that trouble a long time ago when I first started. The tip of the rocket wobbles. So start adding some struts (or just use duct tape instead ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif))\n\n-----Edit-----\n\nYeah based on those images, your rocket\u0027s tip is just way unstable\n\n----Edit of another edit-----\n\nOhh and about your spinning issue, your booster stages are also held by nothing but manifold detachments. As repetitive as this sounds, use struts at the top and bottom of your boosters to prevent them from caving in to your craft and causing the death roll.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T23:32:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 11:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ghostbuzzer7**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T09:13:04Z","Content":"Ohhh yes, struts and moar struts (i think I said this before, didn\u0027t specify where though). I always (literally always) put at least 6 struts between the payload and the rest of the rocket. Also the boosters, the radial decouplers are stupidly weak, always strut whatever you strap on the side as the thrust will move the nozzles, inducing weird kinds of torque.

That way you do not need all those struts.\n\nAlso, I do not know if the fairing acually makes all these structural wings unfunctional. It could be that your center of lift is above the center of mass and possibly even shifted offcenter. Thats bad. With FAR/NEAR the center of lift should always be behind the center of mass.
