The rocket seems mostly unharmed, but in KER displays, the torque jumps from 30 kNm to around 500 kNm, which is fatal even for the rocket, with ~ (slightly tweak scaled) 8 large SAS modules/ 12 RCS/ 4 Vernors. the flight logs and the Console Unity Logs only really say structural failure between wings, which the spacecraft is made of. The photos below show the flight with most of the mods I usually play with, but the result remain practically the same with a barebones ProceduralFairngs, KAC, Module Manger, Tweakscale, Procedural Parts (Which I seem to notice nozzle placement is weird after rollout more than once) Ubio Part welding (some with Twekscale modules installed), and MagicSmokeIndustries, used in hinges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/WF83P\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
