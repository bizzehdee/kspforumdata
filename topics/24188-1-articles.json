It gets shared through the entire vessel. RCS is pretty much your best bet for stopping the spin without a workaround. If you don\u0027t want to do that (or it\u0027s just not going to work), just time warp for a second or go back to the space center and come back. That\u0027ll stop the physics from being calculated, stopping the spin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Peder","CreatedById":57860,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T13:38:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dr_jt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dr_jt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi,\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a station that I kind of hit a bit to hard when docking and started it slowly spinning. I tried to use RCS to stop the spin which caused a whole lot more spinning. I think my problem was compounded because I didn\u0027t pay attention to how my modules were docked together and none of the RCS thrusters are aligned to each other. I also can\u0027t re-dock for re-alignment because some of them are out of RCS fuel and I can\u0027t figure how to transfer RCS fuel. That is if you can even transfer RCS fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some easy way to stop the spin. If I can\u0027t I\u0027ll most likely have to scrap the station.
