That\u0027s a damn shame as it is quite a useful mod.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat surprises me is that there are other mods (such as Konstruction) that use articulated parts - arms, cranes, and the like - similar to how Infernal Robotics worked, but none of them quite manage what IR used to do.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCase in point, I want to build a crane that can pull a large (2.5 m) part off of a rover trailer and place it in the hold of a spaceplane. However, Konstruction\u0027s magnetic crane is too small to do so. If IR still existed I could simply use structural parts and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E parts to build my own crane. I guess my question here is, did IR truly get abandoned? Or am I just missing updates?
