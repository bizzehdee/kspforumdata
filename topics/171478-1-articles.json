The only way for me to use a CalculationsSheet, is to make one myself, so that\u0027s what I did. Using it for all sorts of hohmann-transfers, commsat-deployments and delta-v calculations. I know there have been other mods and sheets around for years, which can do exactly the same thing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made my own CalculationSheets to maintain the \u0027purist\u0027 way of playing, but without having to do manual calculations. I have no problems at all with non-purists, it\u0027s a singleplayer game, we all can play how we want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe green fields are for input, all other cells are blocked. I hope someone else will find the sheet useful.
