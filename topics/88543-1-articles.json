I suggest just sticking with your 95% approximation (that is, 5% of collected fuel being used to fight drag- which is actually EXTREMELY conservative... A streamlined vessel will expend considerably less fuel on fighting drag...) for the time being, until stock aerodynamics gets its overhaul at the very least...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce stock aero is overhauled, hopefully it will internally record the number you need to make an accurate approximation of drag- which is the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_coefficient\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBallistic Coefficient\u003C/a\u003E of the vessel when facing prograde (this is an inherent property of a vessel of a certain mass and shape) although it changes as a vessel gains or loses mass, what you want to do is multiply that in as an additional factor.

The requisite math involved, which must take into account all of these factors is far too difficult for a single feature of KSP-Interstellar in my opinion- and I suggest you just stick with the 95% approximation permanently. However, if you really want to figure it out, I suggest you approach Ferram4 (the creator of FAR, he will know a lot more about the Thermosphere above the Karman Line than me) and the creator of the Atmospheric Trajectories mod (he already figured out a way to get his mod to access FAR\u0027s data on Ballistic Coefficient, and I think also temperature/pressure variations with altitude, in order to make re-entry predictions fro spacecraft...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOnly if the amount of gained mass is higher than the amount of spend mass, it would be profitable, other your just wasting time and resources.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s going to happen at pretty much any altitude much above the Karman Line, so long as the vessel doesn\u0027t have huge flopping solar panels to generate excess drag (and then again, even *with* those panels at a slightly higher altitude).

However, keep in mind that the Atmospheric Scoop itself already has some intake area built into it, and should be capable of operating on its own at a slower rate. Giving the Atmospheric Intake part the *additional* ability to increase the gathering rate (but also the energy consumption) of a Propulsive Fluid Accumulator would be a good idea. I wouldn\u0027t create a separate part, as there\u0027s no reason to think a simple intake couldn\u0027t funnel the gasses to the same vacuum pump as the intake built into the Atmospheric Scoop part itself- rather the Atmospheric Intake should be toggleable to act as additional intake-area for the Atmospheric Scoop through the right-click menu. This should also be made to somehow work in-atmosphere, so if a player decides to scoop BELOW the Karman Line, the Atmospheric Scoop can still be used to increase their gathering rate (perhaps by allowing the Atmospheric Scoop to convert the IntakeAtm resource into the relevant resource being scooped, at an efficiency depending on the abundance of that gas?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important thing about Atmospheric Scooping Ship design (whether a Propulsive Fluid Accumulator that operates near the Karman Line, or a winged vessel that operates lower in the atmosphere) is the ratio of drag to intake area. Intakes necessarily improve this ratio, with a theoretical (but impossible) maximum for a vessel being when 100% of drag comes from the intakes themselves. This same principle actually also applies to spaceplanes- you want the best ratio of intake flow to drag possible (hence the phenomenon of Air Hogging in KSP, which takes this to physically-impossible extremes)- but lift and the necessary to pre-cool air for the engines at high compression-factors also becomes essential in that case...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI understand but I might found a better solution.

Unlike with a Thermal Rocket, where they\u0027re relative, (and ISP should be 75.675% and thrust 132.14% that of the next-heaviest thermal propellant Methane for any given reactor temperature...), it\u0027s possible to come up with a single concrete value for the plasma thruster, since a plasma thruster operates effectively the same at all reactor temperatures...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECORRECT Nitrogen efficiency/ISP: 78% efficient, ISP = 3090.34 s\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease see this post for more details:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104943-0-90-KSP-Interstellar-port-maintance-thread?p=1702243\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1702243\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104943-0-90-KSP-Interstellar-port-maintance-thread?p=1702243\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1702243\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I noticed something else that is off before- you assumed that the new 2.5 meter Nitrogen cryostat you added to KSP-Interstellar should have 4 times the surface area of the 1.25 meter Deuterium/Tritium cryostat, and thus require 4 times the power top operate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the time, that comment effectively slipped through the cracks because I had so much else I was thinking about. But unfortunately, that assumption is also wrong for \u003Cstrong\u003Etwo very important reasons\u003C/strong\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, due to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESquare-Cube Law\u003C/a\u003E a larger fuel tank (or cryostat) actually has LESS surface area relative to its volume. So, while a 2.5 meter cryostat may hold 4 times the volume per meter of length (if you simply up-scaled the 1.25 meter cryostat, the length also doubled as well though- and it should hold \u003Cstrong\u003EEIGHT\u003C/strong\u003E times the volume...) it actually has only twice the surface area per unit of length- meaning it has half the lateral surface area per unit of volume. This is looking only at the lateral surface area- the part that will be exposed to the outside environment. The cross-sectional area is indeed 4 times as great (and in many ways this actually dominates the power-usage of the cryostat, as conduction from the rest of the rocket will be the main way heat flows into the cryostat), but the cryostat is also twice as long- meaning it has half the end-plate surface per unit of volume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in summary, the 2.5 meter cryostats should hold exactly EIGHT times the volume of the 1.25 meter cryostats, but require 4 times the power usage IF HOLDING THE SAME PROPELLANT (more about that is a second). You were right about how the power-usage increases with size, but wrong about its relation to volume- which increases even more (by contrast, a cryostat with a 3.75 meter cross-section and triple the length of the 1.25 meter cryostat would hold 27 times the volume, but only require 9 times the power consumption... \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESquare-Cube Law\u003C/a\u003E again for ya\u0027...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second error was assuming that a Deuterium-Cryostat would require the same amount of power to operate as a Nitrogen Cryostat (of the same size). \u003Cstrong\u003EThat absolutely couldn\u0027t be further from the truth...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Deuterium-Tritium Cryostat has to maintain its contents at an EXTREMELY cold temperature: at -249.84 degrees Celcius or colder (as this is its boiling-point of Deuterium, the lighter and therefore more easily boiled of the two Hydrogen isotopes). This requires a LOT of energy. (a Helium Cryostat should require even more power- it has to maintain its contents at -268.9 degrees Celcius or colder, *just* above absolute-zero...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Nitrogen Cryostat, on the other hand, only has to maintain its contents at a \u0022modest\u0022 -195.79 degrees Celcius or colder. This requires A LOT LESS power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf one makes the simplifying assumption that one only has to expend an amount of power proportional to the difference between these propellant\u0027s boiling points and 0 degrees Celcius, then a Nitrogen Cryostat should only require 78.37% of the power of a Deuterium-Tritium cryostat of the same dimensions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd all this up, and a 2.5 meter Nitrogen Cryostat only requires 3.13 times the power of a 1.25 meter Deuterium-Tritium Cyrostat, despite holding 8 times the volume! However we\u0027re not done yet! There is still one more minor factor that must be taken into account...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny fuel tank in a vacuum is a pressure-vessel. Meaning that the mass of the container increases linearly with the volume, despite the Square-Cube Law. This is as larger pressure-vessels require thicker tank walls (the change in ratio in volume: surface area increases the stresses on each square meter of tank wall proportionally). However, thicker tanks walls are better insulators- meaning that even if no additional insulation is added on, the larger Cryostat will have to contend with slightly less heat leaking inside the fuel container!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we assume this relatively minor effect only decreases heat-leakage by 5% (this is probably under-estimating the effect of nearly DOUBLING the tank wall thickness), and then round-up to stay on the conservative side, then we get the following nice, clean number which I suggest you use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EA 2.5 meter Nitrogen Cryostat should contain 8 times the volume of a 1.25 meter Deuterium-Tritium Cryostat, but only require 3 times the power (15 kW vs. 5 kW) to operate.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-30T06:26:48Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2015 06:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
