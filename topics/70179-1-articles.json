Creating the complete 3D assets is a lot more work than setting them up in Unity and with config files. As a general rule of thumb, you need to be able to do some of the asset work yourself (or plugin coding if that\u0027s your niche) to attract help. Modders work for free (many take donations) so the value of a creative director, someone who comes up with the idea and sees it is completed as intended, really isn\u0027t there because at the end of the day, all these guys get is the credit for producing the mod and most modders feel wronged when sharing that credit with someone who didn\u0027t do much, if any, of the heavy lifting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModding KSP is really, really easy. Its even possible to use simple programs such as Sketchup to make your models. If you can at least learn to model basic parts, then you can easily attract attention and get some help with texturing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_evil_engineer","CreatedById":109350,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T00:14:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the input guess i need to get to work on figuring out how to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshiewowa","CreatedById":74879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T17:59:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want we can talk sbout this. just pm me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
