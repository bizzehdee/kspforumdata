You then follow this down ballistically and only burn at the last moment possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I never do this at Mun because you don\u0027t have all that much control over the slope you land on, due to starting from high enough to arc down like this. Unless you\u0027re aiming at something already on the ground in a known flattish area, you have no real idea what the ground looks like until it\u0027s too late to do much about it. This can cause landers to tip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what I do instead is the straight-down method. But I do this from no higher than 10km (and no lower than 7-8km).

If it has a higher thrust, its generally safer when you come down vertically because you can slow down faster (but uses more fuel because high-thrust engines are less fuel efficient than low thrust ones). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, for a low-thrust lander, you need to be able to get into a low orbit first so you have a shallow arc in your trajectory you can use for a longer braking burn. Engines like the LV 909, Poodle or LV N are ideal for this, and are the most efficient in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever i think your main problem stems with the Kerbal X itself - it simply doesn\u0027t have enough fuel for a safe landing. It uses a Poodle, so its efficient, but because the lander doesn\u0027t have enough fuel no matter what you try, you\u0027ll have a hard time reserving enough for a return trip. I just tested it out and i\u0027m on the Mun with 6 units of fuel left (no idea how you got 15% left in the tank). The main problem with the X is that you\u0027re carting down an engine heavier than you need, a heavy command capsule, parachutes, and a big decoupler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of that in an ideal world (ala Apollo) would be left in orbit around the moon, to save weight and fuel, and connected up with later during a docking. So you descend with a lighter landing capsule, a dedicated fuel reserve and smaller engine, on a shallow trajectory so you have plenty of time for a braking burn for that little engine. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheres a good tutorial with a two stage lander in \u0022To the Mun\u0022 under Training - this should give you an idea of what an efficient Munar descent craft should look like.

That takes more burning than getting to the Mun, but you more than make up the difference because you\u0027ll be going slower when you land.
