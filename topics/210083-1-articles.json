The user could then build his craft, let say, add a part \u0022here\u0022, hit the magic camera button, take a screenshot, and go back to his craft, to add another parts, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis way, we would gather XXX screenshots with the exact same framing so that a Timelaspe actually looks like something cool instead of accelerated x16 videos that record all the process. I kinda like it, actually, but i\u0027m a designer who take a LOT of care at each step and my craft usually takes about 15-50h to be done with multiple insignificant details that are not interesting or deadends / new ideas, etc. I really would like to get some proper timelapses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I would actually do is... Shooting everything in reverse. Like, my last 50\u002B hours \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is now finally done, but there is no way I would start it again from scratch. There is multiple fine details that are a pain in the ass to reproduce, I would have forgot some of them, etc. Instead, I can dismount it, taking a screenshot at each step, and then reverse the video. But so far, I can\u0027t do that without being sure to get the exact same framing. I tried to use some trickery like switching from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and back reset the camera position and framing and it could be used, but damn...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, a next major step would be something that help the... Dismount of the craft, like, moving the parts from the craft to the void, so that in reverse everything goes from the outside to the craft, automatically, but i\u0027m dreaming haha \u003Cspan\u003E:p\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIs this possible to control the camera in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, and to make such a mod ?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThanks !\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
