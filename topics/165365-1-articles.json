At first I thought it was because other parts were a bit too close to the in-seated kerbal but the same thing happens when I place a seat on top of a Mk I pod with no obstructing parts. Same catapultism every time. This did not happen to me in version 1.2 but appeared with v1.3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny insight to what is going on and how to work around (fix?) it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-10T15:18:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClick the \u0022useful mods\u0022 link in my sig below, install the patch to fix the seat eject.\u003Cbr\u003E\ninstall the \u0022Drill Action Fix\u0022 patch too, as the drills are missing their deploy/retract/toggle actions and yes, it\u0027s a known bug that will be fixed in 1.3.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy Landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-10T15:24:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2017 03:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Xyphos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-10T15:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwesome.
