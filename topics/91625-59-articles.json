In the Contract Configurator debug menu, press the \u0022force check requirements\u0022 button to force all requirements to be checked (otherwise there\u0027s short-circuiting for performance, and you may not be able to tell if a requirement is succeeding or not). For a contract to be offered, all requirements should show as green. For debugging purposes, requirements can be temporarily removed by unchecking them to force a contract to be offered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDATA Node Expressions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDATA nodes by default indicate required values. If the data node resolves to null, the contract will not be offered. To check this, view the output of the expressions on the right hand side of the debug window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContract Weights\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen choosing a contract to offer, the system will do a weighted selection between all contracts within the same group. So a contract with a weight of 2.0 will be twice as likely as a contract with a weight of 1.0 to be selected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, if you\u0027re not using a contract group yet, probably best to introduce one. In addition to what I mentioned above, there\u0027s logic for fairness between groups. It\u0027ll try to select equally between the groups, so there is no preference between Tourism, Anomaly Surveyor, KSS, etc. The exception is tjsnh\u0027s advanced progression contracts, because he doesn\u0027t use contract groups and set the weights on everything to 99.0 (I told him to change it, but it fell on deaf ears). Anyway, this is only and issue for you if you have that installed and are not using contract groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf none of this helps, then post up your contract config details and I\u0027ll take a look... maybe there\u0027s something else going on that I can help with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, things to keep in mind based on the above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEven with a very large weight, that\u0027ll only increase the likelihood of being selected within your contract group. This is by design to prevent one contract pack from pushing another one out of contention.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf it\u0027s a 3-star contract, it may not show up at all at the beginning of the game when the player has low prestige. If it absolutely must show up, better to use a lower prestige to make it more likely.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMake sure you\u0027re not hitting a generation failure due to a REQUIREMENT node. I don\u0027t think this is the case based on your other questions, but I\u0027ll throw it in for completeness. For example, if you had targetBody = AllBodies().Random, and then had a REQUIREMENT that says the player must\u0027ve orbited the body, then most of the time it\u0027ll pick a body the player hasn\u0027t orbited, and the contract won\u0027t generate. Of course, you most likely know this already, which is why you\u0027re asking for the expressions for flyby, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing to check - what\u0027s the composition of contracts look like? Is it mostly other Contract Configurator ones, or lots of stock ones? I have some logic for determining the Contract Configurator vs. stock logic and if it makes sense I can nudge the weighting a bit back towards Contract Configurator (I was thinking about doing that in 1.6.0 anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T15:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, ok.
