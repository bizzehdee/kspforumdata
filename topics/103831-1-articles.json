It seems to me that where KERBIN is relative to Moho\u0027s plane is way more important than what plane you orbit in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here\u0027s an explanation from the link I shared: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EYeah, so first I sent a test probe into equatorial low Kerbin orbit, then made a maneuver node from that probe to get to Eve. I had to cross Eve\u0027s orbit at an ascending/descending node (so that I would actually intersect Eve\u0027s orbit instead of going below/above it). So I added a liberal amount of inclination change to the maneuver node to make sure that happened. As you can see from the picture, it\u0027s going about 30 degrees towards the south (that node had about 1200 m/s prograde component and 1600 m/s southward component, for a total of 2000 m/s (Pythagorean theorem)). But it\u0027s inefficient to do such a huge inclination change when you\u0027re already in orbit. Much more efficient to do it during launch. So I waited until the KSC was right under the maneuver node and I launched the ship into an orbit inclined 30 degrees to the south of an equatorial orbit. It doesn\u0027t cost much delta-v to launch into an inclined orbit rather than an equatorial one, you lose maybe 50 m/s from not taking full advantage of Kerbin\u0027s rotation. But now, if you remake that same maneuver node in the new orbit, you don\u0027t have to add any inclination change, you can burn straight prograde to get the same effect, for only ~1200 m/s. Ships do this all the time in reality, when they need to go to an interplanetary destination where they need an inclination change, they first launch into an inclined orbit around Earth to save delta-v.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T14:05:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Eeloo, I did with an inclination at launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I waited for the correct time in the KAC window\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I launched half an orbit before the correct ejection angle is set (to Eeloo, it\u0027s on the dark side)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I set MJ for a 100km orbit with 15/20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination south. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You have less than half an orbit to plot for an encounter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The ship goes down and arrive at the equatorial node with the upward inclinason and ejection angle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- At that point burn prograde to escape and more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- After escaping Kerbin SOI, check your inclination angle.
