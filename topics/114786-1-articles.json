So this is the place to show anything that you have made in real life. It can be anything at all, just nothing to do with bodily functions! \n\nI will start:\n\nHere is a little bow I made a while ago.\n\n ![vxjgif.jpg](http://i57.tinypic.com/vxjgif.jpg)\n\n![15qq6f6.jpg](http://i62.tinypic.com/15qq6f6.jpg)\n\n![309oayu.jpg](http://i58.tinypic.com/309oayu.jpg)\n\nIt was made from a single oak board. I used handtools which took weeks due to the density of the wood. I used another board as a tiller and when putting screws into it I twisted off the head of the screw! \n\n The bow isn\u0027t particularly powerful, due to the size of the board it is small with a low draw weight. It could be used to catch fowl with practice.\n\n The grain is not really correct but due to the low draw weight and strength of the wood it doesn\u0027t compromise the strength of the bow at all.\n\nLet\u0027s see what you lovely people have made!\n\nMJ"},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T02:39:03Z","Content":"Does it still count if digitally made?"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T04:04:03Z","Content":"i make my own pcbs, all be it the quality is questionable. last 2 major attempts to build something both failed, both from the same misjudgement in engineering. i wanted to run the chip at 3.3v but neglected to put any level shifting on the programming header. the solution to this problem is yet another board to downshift the 5v programmer signals down to 3.3v, probibly with some zener diodes or voltage dividers, though one signal would need a mosfet that i dont have to boost the voltage to 5v, and i dont really feel like digging through my junk pile. one of the chips i fried was a socketed attiny84, but i had a backup. i also fried a surface mount tqfp atmega328 on a gamepad replacement board that i am not looking forward to replacing.\n\nheres one of my more successful builds. it works but i never finished writing the i2c/serial interface code. anyway the firmware i wrote wouldn\u0027t fit on the chip and needed some asm voodoo to make it smaller, though i never got around to learning avr asm. might just cheat and use a attiny4313, though i never got around to ordering one.\n\n[![IMG_0300_zpsd40ee52d.jpg](http://i213.photobucket.com/albums/cc103/Emperor_of_Nihil/SevenSeg/IMG_0300_zpsd40ee52d.jpg)](http://s213.photobucket.com/user/Emperor_of_Nihil/media/SevenSeg/IMG_0300_zpsd40ee52d.jpg.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T04:42:35Z","Content":"Does this count?
