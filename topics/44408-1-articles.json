Or two double-cones, as shown in the diagram. Pixel shaders could potentially be used to then paint the relevant black or grey circles on any moons passing through the cones. I\u0027ve suggested this a while back, and got told that this was apparently attempted and then abandoned (for now) as being too intensive an operation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I do think it would be pretty awesome to have. Maybe there\u0027s some way to cheese the effect with a \u0022planet is X radius and Y distance away, grey and black circle should be W and X in size and U and V in intensity\u0022.
