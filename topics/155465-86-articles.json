That\u0027s how KSP works. When you shift focus away from a vessel, it no longer does anything. It doesn\u0027t produce thrust, it doesn\u0027t generate power, it doesn\u0027t consume power, it doesn\u0027t process anything, the heat simulation is offline, collisions do not happen, and so on. For all intents and purposes, it stops existing entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are way around this, although they are sort of awkward. For example, if you have a stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E module onboard, you can run it while the vehicle isn\u0027t focused. How? Well, the moment you switch back to that vehicle, the simulation plays catch-up. It remembers how long ago you left it alone, so it will do all the processing for the missing time at once when you come back to it. The heat simulation does that same. The reason this is awkward is because it isn\u0027t precise - how does the catchup routine know how the illumination of your solar panels changed while you were away? How does it know that the fuel cell you were using would not have had enough fuel to keep going that long? It just doesn\u0027t. Also, when the heat simulation catches up, you sometimes get huge temperature spikes that can actually damage parts on your spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother way around this is doing real background processing for all existing vessels. There used to be a mod that did this, but it was only really compatible with stock and a very small selection of modded parts. Every single part that wanted to use it had to be individually patched to be compatible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTAC-LS for its part is doing its life support calculations independently from the vessels. It just remembers that vessel X has this amount of resources and uses them at that particular rate, so it determines that it needs to send you a warning in so many days. The vessel itself still doesn\u0027t actually consume or calculate anything; instead it will play catch-up when you load it again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I haven\u0027t touched TAC-LS in a long time, so I don\u0027t know how sophisticated its tracking of vessel resources has become. Maybe it is able to recognize if a vessel has positive EC generation and can factor that in. But in that case, the reactor should work. Or it doesn\u0027t have this capability, in which case no source of power (not stock solar panels, not fuel cells, not RTGs) would work, and you would get the same warning no matter what. Or, it is selective about which power sources it accepts - for example fuel cells might not be accepted because they can run out of fuel without TAC-LS noticing.
