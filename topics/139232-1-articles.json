I have a science lab crunching away at some data and I noticed that apparently in 1.1 once you put an experiment in the lab you don\u0027t get it back to be recovered or transmitted. My question is, once the lab finishes processing the data from these experiments, should I transmit it or recover the lab? What made me doubtful about this is the following note in the changelog: \u0022\u003Cem\u003ELabs with science can now be recovered for science.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 So will i get the typical penalty if I transmit the generated science instead of recovering it, or does this just refer to recovering experiments that weren\u0027t processed? Thanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T16:51:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo transmission penalty, because you\u0027re sending science\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Epoints\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and not science\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edata\u003C/em\u003E. The new thing in the changelog that you mentioned just means that if a lab has researched points, you have the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eoption\u003C/em\u003E of recovering instead of transmitting. Previously if you recovered a lab that had researched science points in it, you wouldn\u0027t get those when you recovered.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T17:36:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefinitely transmit. An MPL can only hold 500 science points at one time, so that\u0027s the most you can get if you recover the thing without transmitting. And they are very hard to land, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs FullMetalMachinist said, there is no penalty on transmission of science, and you can transmit repeatedly. Keep in mind that it takes 6 points of electric charge to transmit 1 point of science, though -- make sure you have enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
