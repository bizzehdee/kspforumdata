I\u00B4m pretty new to this forum however not so new to KSP. Now to my problem. In screenshots below you can see a rocket. By my design (inspired a little byt by Scott Manley). And there are few problems with it. When I launch it in around 4-8 km it is almost uncontrolable. It starts to swing around and so on. When I successfully arrive at orbit I don\u00B4t have enough fuel to get me to the Mun and back I always end up with only fuel in lander. And when I land on Mun I don\u00B4t have enough fuel to even get to orbit of Mun. So any suggestions ? I know this downstage can get me to the Mun because I used it for launching 2 satellites around Mun with almost same weight as my lander on this rocket. So will you help me with this particulary hard quest for me ?\u00A0 screens:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ctrlv.cz/fFRm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ctrlv.cz/fFRm\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ctrlv.cz/hOeQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ctrlv.cz/hOeQ\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-20T19:59:29Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2017 07:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by monstah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Draalo","CreatedById":158993,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-20T20:30:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223248747\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168728\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513788497\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022183692\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022abickocz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, abickocz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I launch it in around 4-8 km it is almost uncontrolable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is because you are maybe too fast at that altitude.
