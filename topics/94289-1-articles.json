This rocket sits right on the limits for weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can make it to low orbit of 73km and was used to achieve a first orbit contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be piloted by a engineer or a scientist but a pilot is much safer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen passing into the 50km zone on re-entry it is best to take hands off of the pitch controls and ride the hair-raising descent using the natural sway of reentry. It shouldn\u0027t blow up if a 45km periapsis de-orbit shape is made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAll parachutes need reset prior to launch \u003C/strong\u003E- I set them to pre-initiate at altitudes of 4000m the default is 25Km. Otherwise you will loose your chutes and crash into the ground. Parachutes have been tweek scaled to be smaller for the returnable stages. They all work and their scale saves weight. Also you may want to go into the setting on the base view and set parachutes to arm on deployment unless you want to arm them individually in flight prior to stage separation.. which is really hard or impossible if you don\u0027t have a pilot at the controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP14\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s117.photobucket.com/user/Martin_Ellis/media/Martins%20KSP%20screen%20shots/e5ec1832-596a-4de3-b400-60b843eca4ac.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i117.photobucket.com/albums/o75/Martin_Ellis/Martins%20KSP%20screen%20shots/e5ec1832-596a-4de3-b400-60b843eca4ac.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e5ec1832-596a-4de3-b400-60b843eca4ac.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design got me out of a money and tech pickle and pushed my limits of building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe changes to the game with 0.90 are awesome and the risks are high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: ignore the limits in the photo.
