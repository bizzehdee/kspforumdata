There are some gaps but I think it may be related to systems that aren\u0027t online yet like reentry heating and alarms. I do notice things get a little weird when you go off script, like if you make the maneuver they tell you to and then you change it before burning they tell you cut the engine for the proscribed maneuver rather than the one you made which could get a little confusing, but mostly all good.
