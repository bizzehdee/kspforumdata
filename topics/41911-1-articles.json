There\u0027s a field of debris surrounding the base, because I love to jettison and watch crash all the parts that aren\u0027t critical to base operations, like extra cores, landing stages, extra batteries etc. The power storage and generation unit is separated from the rest of the base by a big long girder. Can\u0027t have fuel supplies and many megawatts of electricity fraternizing with each other. The site is lit by a lighting tower. Fuel is stored in the two outriggers, and there\u0027s space for 7 kerbals to live, but currently manned by just one. I\u0027ll be adding a tractor shortly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uiRE4CM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uiRE4CM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt drives!
