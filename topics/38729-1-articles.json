You can edit the gravity compensation by fiddling with the multiwheels config XML file in plugindata (but this is on by default with a reasonable value, you shouldn\u0027t need to). CleverBobCat just pushes a force down on low gravity worlds, Modular Wheels changes the grip. A big difference in how this behaves is that modular wheels still feel low grav, just not low grip.

The dirt track vid is NOT a good example.....for that is NOT a loss of traction. Rather the driver is \u0027breaking loose\u0027 certain wheels in order to increase the weight applyed (and therefore the traction) of other tires. This is not just done with driving, as those cars use radical susppension set ups to help achive those controled slides.
