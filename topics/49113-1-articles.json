We can even design a research queue so that if we don\u0027t have sufficient employees in R\u0026amp;D center, the research will have to be started one by one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rate of gaining science points will be slower than the comm-antenna way, but scientists can access the sample directly instead of just having limited on-board sensors to get limited data, they can use more sophisticated devices/equipment to check the sample and thus, much more science points will be gained at last.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoneyFox","CreatedById":19237,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T03:39:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright... maybe this can be implemented with Mission Controller... i would ask if the author can add this feature...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
