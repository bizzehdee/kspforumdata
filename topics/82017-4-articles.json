But to someone not very familiar with KSPI it will be very confusing; trying to make reactors work was a pretty common question in the KSPI threadnaught. Hmm. Perhaps reordering the way you unlock the tech is the solution. First you get Nuclear Power after Large Electrics, giving you NFP and KSPI reactors as well as the stock radioisotope generator (so the node isn\u0027t empty). That chains to Nuclear Propulsion (which also requires something from the rocketry line) which gives you the LV-N and the KSPI thermal rocket. (Also has the benefit of pushing the LV-N later which is good because it\u0027s so OP.) Nuclear Power also chains to the NFP reactor upgrades as well as to the KSPI Fusion node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing I noticed - the KSPI orbital telescope thing is in an early science node, but it requires Liquid Helium as a coolant that isn\u0027t available yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, suggest consolidating the Karbonite jet and rocket engines into a single node.
