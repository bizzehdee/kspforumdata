The DC-9 has two engines roughly aligned with the fuselage centerline vertically, the nacelles are angled for airflow reasons but the nozzles are not.

If you start from the runway, your plane will be pushed nose down because your speed=lift is low. If you fly very fast and throttle down to slow down, your plane will do a backflip.\n\nOne way to do it is to angle the engine (upwards) so that CoT vector goes through CoM, that way it won\u0027t introduce any torque (although it will be a little less efficient and need some more thrust as the engine pushes it a bit downwards.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T13:23:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T13:26:13Z","Content":"If you want CoT above CoM, check out the He162."},{"CreatedByName":"SalehRam","CreatedById":138066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T13:49:24Z","Content":"I have managed to build something similar to DC10, DC9 in SPH, the thing is due to the nature of KSP, I could not manipulate the design of engines too much...

This gives it a good deal of power for the size but also lets it cruise faster and farther with less fuel use. At least at the time it did. \n\nThe DC-9 the engines actually are driving just above the CoM.
