When I boot up KSP, i choose my sandbox game (where I have all my progress and infrastructure) and get shown the view of the space center. However, when I go to click on the rocket construction center, it lights up but will not open. No matter how many times i click it it will not open. This is true for the spaceplane hangar and the place that shows you all of your flights. I can click on the science tree building and the astronaut center, but once i leave those the game totally stops responding. I cannot click on any building nor can i go back to the main menu, I have to quit the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have determined that the problem lies in the persistence file. I copied the persistence file from my saved game and copied it into a new, clean game. The same problems endured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea what to do about it and I really want to keep all of my progress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s.
