I might be adding sepratrons to stage #2 - booster decouple - and usually they\u0027re placed in stage #1, #3 or #4. Another example is launch clamps that get their own stage before the engines or one or multiple stages behind etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I usually like the automatic placement in the staging list, there are moments where an option to force parts in a specific stage would be very useful and cause less irritation. It could work like this: click once on the stage number and the stage changes colour (purple?) and parts added to the ship are forced to that stage until the number is clicked again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn another topic some people were also talking about the ability to drag a cluster of parts directly from one stage to another, instead of the current situation: click-expand-drag, which seems counter-intuitive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60892-Parts-automatically-ordered-to-the-wrong-stage-in-VAB-SPH-how-do-I-lock-the-stage\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60892-Parts-automatically-ordered-to-the-wrong-stage-in-VAB-SPH-how-do-I-lock-the-stage\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
