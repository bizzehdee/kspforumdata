To be reusable, a SSTO not only has to get into orbit, but also back from orbit. This makes rocket SSTOs a lot more complicated, because for low lift reentry bodies need about 10% of their own weight to be heatshielding as a rule of thumb. Due to the more gentle reentry that SSTO spaceplanes can use, they don\u0027t need as much heatshielding, but they will still need a lot, especially if you want the heatshield to be also reusable. However due to the tviolkovsky equation, you also need a very high fuel fraction.

There are a few fundamental differences between spaceplane design and rocket design that keeps this from being true:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; With a rocket, bigger is better. If your design is inefficient, just slap more fuel and engines on it; you can take an existing design and just add another giant stage to the bottom. It might not be pretty, but it\u0027ll still work. With spaceplanes, you\u0027re forced to design more efficiently, since beyond a certain point you just can\u0027t scale the design up easily. Smaller is often better, although if you want a design with more capabilities you\u0027ll have no choice but to grow. So the difference between a mediocre design and a good one is far larger with spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Spaceplanes have more variables to manage, both in the design stage (balancing center of mass with center of lift) and in execution (having to transition from air-breathing mode to rocket mode, managing speed versus terminal velocity, etc.). This makes them much harder to master, and gives more things for a competent designer to tweak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; At the moment, there are fewer workable parts for planes than there are for rockets, although certain mods (B9) really help here. This forces you to make design compromises you might not otherwise have to make, which again makes it harder to create a design capable of the things you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the original question, of what use there is for SSTO spaceplanes when rockets are freely available and there\u0027s no cost benefit to reusability? Here are a few answers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Trips to other planets/moons. An SSTO design can fly there, land, take off, refuel in orbit, and come home. Any design that has to ditch parts during an ascent can\u0027t do that. All you have to do is ensure you have a network of fuel depots at strategic locations (especially if you\u0027re going to Laythe or Tylo). This is an advantage of SSTO designs in general, and not spaceplanes in particular; when I did my Grand Tour way back when, it was in a non-plane SSTO. That last one deserves special mention; as others have said, you can land, take off, refuel, land somewhere else, take off again, etc. ad nauseum with a SSTO design. While there\u0027s no actual gameplay benefit to doing a Grand Tour as opposed to dozens of specialized missions, it\u0027s a bit point of bragging rights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Precision landings. A capsule that uses parachutes to land is unlikely to land exactly where you want it to, unless you really abuse quickload until you get it right. A design with atmospheric control surfaces has much more control over its landing point on any body with air, so if you\u0027re trying to return to KSC\u0027s airstrip it\u0027s much, much easier in a plane. (Also, on Laythe a \u0022brick\u0022 design is likely to splash in the ocean or land on a severe slope and tip over. Controlled landings there are very important.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that, they look cool and when we get an economy they\u0027ll have a distinct advantage.
