For simplicity, consider a spacecraft in a circular orbit. It fires its engine once to accelerate which converts its circular orbit to an elliptical orbit. The longer the burn, the longer the ellipse. Then, at the new highest point on its orbit (the far end of that ellipse), it fires the engine again to accelerate. That raises the lowest point of the ellipse\u00A0and, if the burn is timed right, converts the elliptical orbit back into a (now higher) circular orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know other folks have made the point already but if you want to play around with this sort of thing in a very visually intuitive way, you really can\u0027t do better than to grab a copy of \u003Cem\u003EKerbal Space Program\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in principle, a spacecraft wanting to rendezvous with the ISS could launch into a low earth orbit that\u0027s below the ISS orbit, carry out a single, perfectly timed Hohmann transfer, and arrive at a point in\u00A0\u00A0the ISS orbit just as the ISS reaches that point. In practice (again, as other folks have pointed out), that involves a big rocket burn right next to the ISS, which isn\u0027t a great plan. It\u0027s also a one-shot deal and if you mess it up, smacking into the ISS is a distinct possibility - also not a good a plan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a rendezvousing spacecraft will carry out a number of smaller Hohmann transfers to intermediate orbits (phasing orbits)\u00A0before making the final transfer to the ISS orbit.\u00A0 Takes longer but it\u0027s a lot safer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-09T09:11:04Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2021 09:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-09T10:04:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Rendezvous\u0022 is not the same as \u0022Intercept\u0022.

Shuttle on the other hand was perfectly capable of properly destroying the entire ISS if it hits even at low speeds, as well as the larger amount of exhaust produced (due to larger mass and as such larger propellant usage), combined with the manual operations, so you don\u0027t really have any other way but to be very sure of everything along the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-09T11:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orbital station should be equipped with a protective field to stop\u00A0meteoroids, which are 15..70 km/s fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen any quick rendezvous/intercept is trivial: aim the station, stick in\u00A0the field, and get carefully berthed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacescifi","CreatedById":197504,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-09T16:28:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223906138\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221610182084\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP, I have done a launch to rendezvous, and I did get too close once.\u00A0\u00A0 I called it \u0022Docking, with emphasis\u0022.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no revert in real life.\u00A0 You can\u0027t just reset the universe to previous save.\u00A0 So taking your time and apporaching slowly is the only way they will do it.\u00A0 I would imagine given some emergency they could do it, but that would also require a suitable launch vehicle to already prepped and on the pad, and in the right position to launch into the same orbit. \u00A0 The chances of very time critical emergency happening\u00A0 while all these other criteria are in place are so slim to be unimaginable.\u00A0\u00A0 Even then, if the right items aren\u0027t in the payload already, short of running up to an astronaut already in the capsule and saying \u0022Here, hold onto this wrench!\u0022, everything had to have been planned for a long time before then.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only time critical emergencies that would happen on the ISS are ones that would require them to leave, not stay.\u00A0\u00A0 Even then they have isolation doors, and capsules that can return to the ground rather quickly.\u00A0 Any medical emergency that is time critical can be dealt with on the station already.\u00A0 Anything else, the patient should be able to survive the 12 hours or so it would require to get them to the proper facilities.\u00A0\u00A0 Having spent a significant part of my career in emergency medicine, I cannot foresee any time critical medical situation not being handled (stabilized at least) on the station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I see no benefits at all to a rapid launch to rendezvous profile.\u00A0\u00A0 Even cost.\u00A0\u00A0 Yeah a direct ascent might save a few bucks, but the chances of damage to the station itself far outweigh those meager savings.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would mainly be valuable in a scifi story setting where a ship does not have the delta v to leave orbit and a planet is trying to shoot it down (missiles/lasers).
