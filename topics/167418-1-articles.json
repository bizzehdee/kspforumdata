Chelomei and Yangel were opposing to it with their own projects.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, in 1962 the \u0022N-(whatever)\u0022 program was reduced to a schematic design and financial estimations by a decision on \u0022ICBM, global (combat) rockets and launch vehicles for heavy space objects\u0022 development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe result was the early design of N-1 as we know it, named \u0022N-1\u0022. It was more lightweight, with 75 t payload to LEO (i.e. like \u0022N-2\u0022 should have earlier, but named \u0022N-1\u0022).\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, looks like the early project adopted the later designation.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(My own guess, as after 1962 Korolev didn\u0027t design ICBMs, and the rocket was designed mostly for space, probably at this moment \u0022N\u0022 could be rethought as \u0022Nauka\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut all parts of the lunar complex were designated by functional letters: rocket blocks A,B,V,G,D,E (alphabet)...,\u00A0 spaceships K (\u0022korabl\u0027\u0022, \u0022ship\u0022), probably \u0022N\u0022 really means \u0022Nositel\u0027\u0022 , and \u0022Nauka\u0022 looks like a folk etymology between the developers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut this is just my guess).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe final Korolev\u0027s project (1963) on 1965..1975 lunar program included:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- L1 assembly. Crewed lunar flyby or orbiter. Consists of: 7K (Soyuz\u0027s capsule and service module), 9K (booster), NK. Makes lunar maps. To be assembled in LEO.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- L2 assembly. Teleoperated rover. Nuclear powered, on tracks, range 2500 km. To be delivered as an assembly L2 (rover) \u002B 13K (lander) \u002B 9K. To be assembled in LEO and fueled by PK tankers Required 6 R-7 launches. \u003Csub\u003E(2500 km? Needs not tracks, but anti-grav repulsors)\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n- L3 assembly. Crewed ship with a lander, 200 t heavy. To be assembled in LEO, requires 3 N-1 \u002B R-7 (one with the ship, two with tankers, R-7 with crew). Consists of: orbiter LOK\u00A0 \u002B lander LK \u002B booster. Crew 2..3.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- L4 assembly. Lunar orbital mini-station based on 7K (looks like Soyuz, but with a cylinder instead of the sphere). Requires N-1. Consists of the minin-station itself and 3 9K boosters.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- L5 assembly. Crewable rover with cabin and snacks. Its lander, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crewed *assembly* was originally named Soyuz (literally - Union, probably for both political reasons and because it\u0027s an asssembly, joint, union).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThough the 7K ship itself was originally designed under project codename \u0022Sever\u0022 (\u0022North\u0022).\u003Cbr\u003E\nLater the 7K descendants inherited the assembly name \u0022Soyuz\u0022 (\u0022Union\u0022) (My own guess, just for political reasons, as its assemblies weren\u0027t anymore in trend).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n~1964. The program is totally reduced, \u0022N-1\u0022 redesigned again. Payload was increased from 75 to 93 t. Total mass increased to 2750 t. That \u0022N-1\u0022 which we have seen.\u003Cbr\u003E\nL1,L2,L3,L4,L5 were replaced with LRK consisting of LOK (Soyuz without the sphere, but with bigger fuel tanks) \u002B LK (lander).
