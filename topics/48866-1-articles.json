The drag model doesn\u0027t appear to have changed dramatically however, so they still add net drag to a craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drag on the overall craft is a function of the mass-weighted-average of the drag coefficient times mass of each individual part. The center of drag ends up being in a different location than the center of mass if your parts don\u0027t all have the same drag coefficient. When center of drag is behind center of lift (low-drag parts up front, high-drag parts out back), the drag force exerts a torque that tends to keep the craft pointed forward. When center of drag is ahead of center of lift, the torque exerted by the drag force destabilizes the craft and makes it want to point backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you ever notice in previous versions how aerospike rockets were always unstable in the atmosphere? This is because they used to have a lower-than-average drag coefficient, and you usually put engines at the bottom. Now in 0.22 the aerospikes have the same drag coefficient as the other engines and fuel tanks though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T11:53:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tavert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tavert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDid you ever notice in previous versions how aerospike rockets were always unstable in the atmosphere?
