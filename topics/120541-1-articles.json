Ways to earn money just from launching a ship and how good it does so you don\u0027t always need to test science experimental parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Upgraded Space Center Buildings like one super expensive allowing unlimited parts and weight but also a lot larger and stronger so when you launch a rocket it takes a lot more to destroy it, it would basically be made for giant ships maybe a new 5 meter part the launch pad would also look really good and have some reflective golden supports it also would have a really detailed collider so you could walk into it, it also have a working water tower that activates each time after you launch choosing the amount of water based on how much your rocket ways, the runway would be steel with diamond or gold sides with a small ramp at the end it would also extend out over the ocean the upgrades for space planes/rockets would cost 9,500,000 money. The Tracking Center upgrade would cost 5,000,000 it would be gigantic and could track a rockets orbit no madder how far away it is and stops parts from vanishing when over 2.5km or around that distance away and you can see rockets infinatly out so if you launch one that escapes the solar system you can see it no madder how far away it is, it also allows you to have better render distance from a ship so like when its super large but far you can see all of it not only part of it within render distance(I saw this in a modded game with a super giant ship surrounding the planet half of it was invisible/to far to render). The Research facility when upgraded allows you to not need at much research and you get lots more science parts for like analyzing a whole planet from any angle in orbit even seeing its layers of material not just normal ore, it would cost 4,250,000 to upgrade to with lots for decoration and radiation painted pillers(radiation from the science a kerbal gets when the goo starts to glow and they say it would be fun to paint a rocket with this). The astronaut complex when upgraded allows you to time warp walking kerbals with a specific destonation so it doesn\u0027t take forever to walk a long distance they also can run faster, hold on to ladders better, hold parachutes when falling, take their helmet off when in a fine atmosphere, they can run/swim faster and don\u0027t trip as easily, it would cost 4,500,000. The Mission Control would cost 4,750,000 and would allow sas to control super good, have it watch how much fuel you have and be able to hold you ship in a specific location relative to its orbit or altitude on the ground(it would help for getting a kerbal into a hover craft while its flying). All others would just be stronger, larger, look better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Animals like Kerben birds, cats, and more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Ways to remove parts from staging like fairings for decoration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. More ways to decorate ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Ways to make artificial gravity in space crafts that spin(mainly physics improvements).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Propellers for helicopter designs or lifting rockets up some use fuel and are very strong, others use electric charge but are not as strong, they both need intake air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. More modding tutorials(I can never find a working one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. More terrain objects like 3d collideable trees and forests, also better land texture changes like from grasslands to beach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Being able to have air in space stations like if you cut off all holes from space and if the parts can handle the pressure it would be hard but can be done\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. A type of Sas being able to turn on/off or change engine power\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12. Roads from the space center connecting to nearby watch places connected to it, mainly other research spots or rocket/plane launching spots mainly for environment ships or getting orbits at certain places not just along the equator or north access.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13. Parts having 3 models but only 1 of all together used unless an object comes within 15 meters heading super fast straight for it so when it hits the part can split.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14. Magnetic Engines(ones that can help get the ship off the metal launch mad or launch part farther).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15. Magnetic Pods(I want to be an inventor so this is one of my designs a sphere in the pod that has one spring but otherwise uses magnets to stay in place so if pushed forward would move forward if rotated steers if moved sideways goes sideways, it is made of lots of small magnets all pointing in one direction to keep it north or sound on all sides). I think that was a little much \u0022()\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16. Rare temparary worm holes allowing you to be sent to a random location the worm holds are randomly spawned and last 1 to 80 kerbal space program days astroids can come through them they arn\u0027t that big but some can swallow the largest astroids on the other side normally is giant astroid debree ones so large that they attract gravity they are randomly generated as they come within 500,000 km of your ship, some would be white with medal like trees sticking out of them like spikes, ships can link to them and set up space centers, some of them glow as if they were from some other galaxy they go really fast and all have gravity the biggest can be about half the size of minimus with such unique surface and gathering huge amounts of science, you could travel to them its like a distant 5,000,000,000km to 5,050,000,000km astroid sphere filled with like endless exploring, the worm holes are quite common around minimus for unknowns reasons and when formed rarely can split an atom of when a ship crashed into them making nuclear explosions there is always aleast 1 around minimus they can be found with a highly upgraded tracking center due to high energy amounts. When a worm hole is formed a huge blast of electricity is blasted temperarly malfunctioning nearby ships. In Sandbox mode they can be spawned in with alt f12. When 2 astroids collide it makes a huge explosion that can blow other ships away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are all my suggestions for now I forget the rest also done delete this thread for saying this but you should allow other solar system and planet suggestions it would be really good this that part is optional well they all are but you know what I mean. I hope you like these suggestions. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Also can you add a kerbal scientist face to the forum.

Also, MechJeb, one of the more popular mods, allows this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12- Well, technically, nothing stops you from building a mobile launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13- Not sure if this is what you meant, but if you mean to visually show damage on parts, I do agree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14- This type of propulsion only exist in theory in the real world. It is known to be possible, but the amount of energy required is astronomical, and we\u0027re not talking about a space craft now, only a small projectile.

This would also take up more memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10:I\u0027m not really sure what you\u0027re asking here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11: Action Groups. Although changing thrust limiters through action groups would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12: More objects to collide with/More textures = more memory usage. Also, mods already do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13: The main idea behind this is so collisions have more debris which take up more memory by adding more parts(with each part having it\u0027s own collision meshes and textures), and since most of the time you won\u0027t have an object colliding with you ship, it would be more memory for something that is rarely happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14: Normally magnets to not exert that much force to be able to list a ship of a launchpad. The only time the thrust from a magnetic engine might actually make a visible change in velocity would be if the engine were in space and even still it would need something to \u0027push\u0027 of against (turning it into a type of Ion engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15: So a gyroscopic command pod? This would also be a lot of memory for a small feature that might only be used in 1-2 pods. This would be better if it were a mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16: Kerbal only has parts/features that are realistic, and this would be something that feels unrealistic or something straight from science fiction(at this point in time).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
