In stock, since all drag is proportional to mass, etc, drag remains centered on CoM, so you never get these problems.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually PM\u0027ed Ferram and he said something along those lines, though i still dont quite understand it... it has something to do with high AoA\u0027s being non-linear... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEDIT: Also, 95% sure what I was thinking on part #2 of my initial post was that, if you don\u0027t start your LFE until after staging the SRBs, you get more dV, because you aren\u0027t spending any of your liquid fuel hauling the SRBs or their fuel. There\u0027s a good chance that will outweigh any savings from reducing gravity drag by going full-thrust from the start. I also tested the body lift thing: when you use FAR to tint lift, you start getting a lot of tint on your fuel tanks if you tilt your rocket at high velocity.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually tested this just now, and i think you are right-- when i burned with LFE simultaneously, i definitely did not have more deltaV. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose it was a stupid question since dropping the giant masses of the humongous SRB\u0027s before burning should be seemingly obvious, since it will be pushing less mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, pretending I wasnt allowed to drop those, I wonder if the quoted answer in the OP is correct...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose your answer #2 was a bit vague and i interpreted the logic/point incorrectly. sorry for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you do admit your #1 point was misinformed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E I hear lot\u0027s of people on the forums say that and I think its a common misconception \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe practical answer is \u00222.0 is already way too much TWR to have for more than ~30 seconds: throttle down those SRBs some\u0022.\u003Cp\u003EThe semi-practical answer is \u0022You lose so little to aero drag in FAR that you probably want to leave the LFEs alone\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe theoretical answer is \u0022Run simulations to get your answer, because it is one of those questions with the most evil answer ever: \u0027\u003Cem\u003Eit depends\u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\u0027\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-18T07:02:20Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2014 07:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
