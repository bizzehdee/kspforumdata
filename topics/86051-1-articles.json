Tailplane wings typically have a neutral or positive angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn particular, your tailplane is made of AV-R8\u0027s.

Set the wing surfaces to roll only. You don\u0027t appear to have any active yaw control (unless there\u0027s a rudder hidden beneath the tailplane), but that\u0027s no big deal.

Pitch issues are typically due to changes in your CoM as you burn fuel. Since you have an multi jet-engine setup in the horizontal plane, yaw issues are most likely caused by asymmetric thrust due to low oxygen (as Taki117 pointed out above, this does not directly result in a flame-out). Keep an eye on SAS yaw/pitch/roll correction as you ascend and throttle down (or switch engines) as soon as you see incremental changes in yaw. This should solve your problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-05T14:46:35Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2014 02:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Yakuzi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T15:07:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had the horizontal planes on the back of the central tank originally and the thing wouldn\u0027t move on the runway at full thrust, I think the model reckoned the drag on the tailplanes being in the jet exhaust was as much as the jets were providing in thrust!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust tried it with a single engine on the centreline and having only just managed to get it off the runway, nursed it to 26km and over 1200m/s, so it looks like it is asymmetric thrust, despite the engines not flaming out completely\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
