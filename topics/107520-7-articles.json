As of now, both are technically still running, even though both are shutting down many systems and activating their backup thrusters just to conserve the tiny bit of power left in those probes that mean that they can only communicate several times a week. Thankfully, we still have contact with them at all, and Voyager 1 is actually in interstellar space right now. It is actually the farthest man-made object from Earth, even farther than the dead Pioneer 10 probe, and even it\u0027s brother Voyager 2. But mind you, even Voyager 2 is amazingly far from all the rest of the manmade stuff that exists (and it\u0027s farther from us than Pioneer 10 too). These are truly wonderful probes that deserve to be remembered. (And a side note, the assent for this thing is pretty hard. Even though after that, it\u0027s cool; just know that. Also, taking control in the probe core on the launch stage is advised for that. Oh, *and* there is very little torque in the transit stage, but there is some. *And* it has a really small solar panel under the fairing, not none though.) \\*Done\\*\n\nSo here\u0027s the download link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6kMiFN2UFJoZkdsN01ob3BwZk0/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6kMiFN2UFJoZkdsN01ob3BwZk0/view?usp=sharing) And all I have to say is, goodbye.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T00:10:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 12:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RAINCRAFTER**"}]}
