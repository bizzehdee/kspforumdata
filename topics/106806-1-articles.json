But what we\u0027re lacking are contracts with a proper \u003Cem\u003EThunderbirds \u003C/em\u003Etheme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027m thinking of is an International Rescue themed contract pack. What would it include? Anything that echoes a classic \u003Cem\u003EThunderbirds\u003C/em\u003E episode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat were the plots like?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Some sort of disaster, natural or man-made, occurs. International Rescue must use some of their high-tech equipment to save the day. So, that\u0027s either a \u0022deliver payload X to location Y before time Z\u0022 contract or a \u0022drop item X on location Y before time Z\u0022 contract. These sorts of contracts could be long-range/light-payload (rocket), medium-range/medium-payload (aircraft) or short-range/heavy-payload (ground vehicle). Landed/airdrop/precise-airdrop/water-landing/etc add variety to all of these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Generic bad guys hijack some bit of industrial infrastructure. Again, similar missions to above. Altering the targets (anything from Moho orbit to right next to KSC, anything from a tiny probe to a 500-ton monster) and descriptive text allows for a lot of roleplaying variation from a fairly limited variety of mission structures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Giant machine goes haywire, threatens to crash into something. I don\u0027t know if this is actually possible to do, but if there\u0027s anyway to put a game-generated vehicle on an impact trajectory (especially if you can arrange for it to hit KSC), the contract writes itself. Doubly awesome if you could manage to make the impacting threat a gigantic slow-moving ground vehicle that has to be blown up or otherwise disabled before it reaches KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m no coder, so this isn\u0027t something I could put together myself. But it seems like most of it shouldn\u0027t be too complicated.

First, you\u0027ll get a few missions to develop some rescue vehicles (guess how many contracts there will be, and guess what they\u0027ll have to do...). Then you get rescue contracts (on remote parts of Kerbin and in LKO) with deadlines measured in days or hours rather than years. I like your idea of having Kerbals and/or spacecraft on impact trajectories, to make things even more urgent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea I\u0027ve had to imitate the \u0022vehicle-of-the-week\u0022 pattern is to require that one of several utility parts be brought on the mission -- the comm dish for the Transmitter Truck, the drill for the Mole, that sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure about missions beyond Kerbin, but maybe those missions can be restricted to come up only when you\u0027ve already got something around or on the planet or moon in question.
