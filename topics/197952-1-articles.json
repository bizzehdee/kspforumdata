The nuclear engine is real. I want to make a large rocket with nuclear propulsion, i must use a plane fuselage. The only rocket-friendly piece of liquid fuel tank is the 1.25 m part, which is mostly pointless because nuclear engines only make sense on large rockets\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m posting this because i\u0027m making a 2.5 m rocket, but i have to slip in a mk 3 fuselage, with one adapter in front and another behind. horrible. I\u0027ll try to put a structural tube and some mk 1 fuselage clipped inside. i\u0027m sure someone fixed it with a mod, but that would be just one more reason to make it official\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-07T13:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204876-king-of-nowhere/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022204876\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204876-king-of-nowhere/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@king of nowhere\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I feel like a bunch of new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E-only fuel tanks would only contribute to cluttering the part selection window.
