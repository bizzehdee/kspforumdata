I mean, if you were to draw a surface on which every point is at the same pressure(say 0.01 Pa), what will it look like? Will it be spherical or bulging as it rotates with the Earth? What will a surface drawn such that all points on it have the same mass density (or molecule desnity) look like? The two surfaces would probably be different, I guess, as pressure varies with both density and temperature, so the day and night side will cause the surfaces to do weird stuff. Does anyone have any idea what this is like? I can\u0027t find anything from my short google-fu, and nothing on arxiv either. Most of the research I see is on lower atmosphere wind flows and changes with pressure and temperature as you go up.
