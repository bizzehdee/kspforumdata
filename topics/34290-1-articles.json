How you\u0027d go about it is up to you, but the most obvious solution would be a decoupler on top of the capsule, some structural elements, and Sepatrons to pull the capsule away. You could also (as the other person did) add a few more Sepatrons to pull the escape tower clear of the capsule after it fired, although it may not be necessary if the decoupler is powerful enough. You should also add a staging sequence just before your orbital insertion burn which decouples the tower and fires the Sepatrons to remove the LES when it\u0027s no longer necessary. For a soft landing, you should obviously have parachutes on your capsule as well, although they should be on a separate stage/action group - if they fired with the abort sequence they\u0027d just anchor the pod to the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T16:24:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI skip the tower and stick sepratrons straight to the capsule.
