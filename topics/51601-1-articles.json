The military has oodles (infinite number) of a few basic rocket parts since the retiring of all ICBMs that are available to the space program (this way if a player runs out of money they can still do something). The last funding was used to build the contracts office (new game building) to secure the future of the space program. (Story is irrelevant, just how I thought of it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you click on the contracts office you get a screen with available contracts. They could be something like: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - place sub-assembly X in orbit around Y with inclination I, apoapsis A, and periapsis P (this way users could create challenge satellites for career mode) The max reward would be a function of mass and min delta-V (as calculated with basic orbital mechanics equations w/ Hohmann transfers) to arrive at orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - place a spacecraft with specs (power, comms, fuel left, # of Kerbals, ect) into specified orbit (users get to design their own space craft, but will want to meet the requirements as efficiently as possible)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - mission (eg. Return sample from Duna northern pole or fly sensor X to specified orbit for 1 week and transmit back/return results)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoney: When the contract is placing a spacecraft, the user will have a new option button (or whatever UI is best) to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cdeliver\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 the craft (which will then disappear/become unavailable to the user). Then the reward will be reduced via a \u0022success\u0022 factor. Maybe must be orbiting correct body to get any reward and the reduction is proportional to the required additional delta-V to go from the actual orbit to the orbit specified in the contract. Missions will more or less be pass/fail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional Details: The user may only be able to take X number of contracts at a time and canceling a contract will incur a fee (user\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s money may go negative [maximum negative amount?] in which case they can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t spend any money but all funds they do get will help get them back to black). Contracts are supposed to play well into users\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 creativity (use any launch vehicle, doesn\u0027t matter how it gets there, just that it does get there). They will want to complete missions efficiently because any parts they do buy for the mission will come from current funds. Users can also use the money they get to conduct their own science or personal missions in addition to missions such as resupply stations that will facilitate future contracts (increasing profit margins!). This format for getting money is meant to be extensible to incorporate potentially new contract types.

Once arrived, you\u0027ll need to \u0022start\u0022 the experiment and let it run for a certain amount of time (depending on the experiment).

But instead of just one Celestial body, you\u0027re given an itinerary of a list of Celestial bodies to visit and what to do when you get there (for example, orbit at a certain altitude for a few days, land on it, etc). And unlike payload delivery, you\u0027ll have to bring the \u0022parts\u0022 back. Part of the challenge is to plan for a multiple encounter mission (and/or plan for refuel stations along the way) while having to haul around a fairly heavy part that has a constant electrical requirement.

This is pretty much your space programs reputation with the world and \u0022corporate entities,\u0022 for lack of a better term, and determines just how much money they would be willing to invest in your space program. As you complete these missions, you\u0027re scored based on various factors such as Kerbal survival, speed, cost, etc. This score determines just how much more this entity would trust you in future missions. This little detail would open up \u0022factions\u0022 of sorts and can even make that second space center a possible competitor in the space race(IE you do bad, they get the contracts and not you). Influence would also influence the Kerbal Recruitment rate. If your space center has a bad reputation, then Kerbals will be less likely to visit that recruitment office. Of course to balance that out, using Jeb, Bob, and Bill would need to be discouraged in some kind of fashion(IE if Kerbal salary was a thing, they would be the most expensive since they\u0027re all just simply that awesome).

The easiest difficulty would start your space program out with more money, lower influence requirements for contracts and kerbonaut recruits. The easiest difficulty would mean a higher starting budget, higher rates of influence gained and lower rates on losses, and the influence requirements to open up contract opportunities. The hardest difficulty is pretty much the opposite of this and is designed for the most awesome of all kerbonauts with higher costs to everything, lower influence gain and higher influence loss, and mortal Jeb, Bob, and Bill because the truly awesome don\u0027t need to lean on immortal Kerbals to get the job done!

Why would commercial interests have a use for something near Duna? Most tasks relevant to the other planets would be more likely fall into the science category, apart from perhaps setting up remote science equipment for long term use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps part of the mission could involve designing the satellite for approval- personally, I imagine KSC as the only institution on Kerbin that actually builds space things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original reason for payload delivery is that it\u0027s considered a relatively low tiered missions. You just have to get the stuff there, and unlike science, don\u0027t have to send anything back. Although you\u0027re right, most of the payload mission could fall under science missions (deliver instrument there, leave it alone).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I didn\u0027t include satellite is that I don\u0027t want a mission to have a permanent effect on space. Parking a satellite would mean that space \u0022debris\u0022 would start to pile up as you do more and more of those missions.

As applied here, some scientist could request for scientific data using the stock instruments at a certain location/altitude/biome. This means that if you already have a satellite/station there with the right instrument, you can simply retask it to finish the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tw1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tw1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESpace tourism\u003C/span\u003E could also work pretty simply.

Payload missions are the easiest, get stuff there and leave it there. Science missions are next, get stuff there and MAYBE have to take it back (or have enough power to transmit it back). Tourisms are the hardest, requiring a long-term plan for hitting mutliple planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tw1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tw1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequests/contracts would work best if they were \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E relevant to where your space program is up to\u003C/span\u003E, this would add a lot to immersion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you\u0027ve only done a few flights to the Mun, then there wouldn\u0027t be many wanting to trust you to take then to the Joolian moons.**\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll get more Mun science requests, and maybe a few requests to put things in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, if you have bases and stations throughout the Kerbol system, and a very good track record when it comes to getting home safely, you would have a lot more scientists and tourists wanting to go to distant places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree.
