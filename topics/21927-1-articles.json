I\u0027m trying to create space stations, but I\u0027m having some trouble with the decouplers. I want to keep my station as free of decouplers as possible, but when I add more parts, they decouple away from my ship but stay on the station. Normally, this is great. But is there a way to change the direction they decouple? As in, is there a way to keep it attached to my main ship when I decouple away from the space station?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pebble_garden","CreatedById":30150,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-11T02:46:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe you can rotate the decouplers before attaching them; a 180 degree rotation should reverse the direction of decoupling.
