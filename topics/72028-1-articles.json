On the way back, the decision is made to collect as many asteroid samples as possible, then toss it at a random land location on Kerbin. So they accomplish that, bringing in around 300 SP worth of samples then boarding the shuttle to take them back. After the shuttle lands at KSC, the deorbit burn for the asteroid begins, and it is pushed to directly impact a certain spot on Kerbin. And thus, the reentry begins. The spacecraft then releases the asteroid at 9,000m while it is plummeting to the ground, and I switch to the asteroid, expecting it to hit the surface of Kerbin and explode, only for it to strike at 500 m/s, bounce a little, then stay at rest and stare at me like \u0022what, bro\u0022 as whatever remains of the spacecraft crashes and explodes behind it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ad55bPO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ad55bPO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELocal officials were very confused when a massive rock showed up overnight\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this intentional on Squads behalf?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone experienced a similar thing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd do you think we should make these asteroids weaker?
