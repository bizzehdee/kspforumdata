Aerodynamics will act very strongly on back-heavy things and cause them to flip over. It\u0027s why darts and arrows are heavy at the front.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are various ways to mitigate this, like with fins and strongly gimbaling engines, but the best way to fix it is to make sure you keep heavy things in front. This can be tricky because engines are typically very heavy. The center-of-mass indicator in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (looks like a ton weight, icon in the lower left of the screen) can help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing to watch for is a draggy front of the rocket, like with a huge fairing or lots non-aerodynamic parts jutting out various ways. Remember, the bigger the fairing, the more volume you have without appreciable mass, which is bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, going too fast too low can be a problem, as can turning too much all at once.
