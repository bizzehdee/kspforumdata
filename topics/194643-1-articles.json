keep this a brief introduction (because it\u0027s late here) and then maybe add to this post later...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving recently been reading up more about Aerospike Rockets, including coming across this superb article by The Everyday Astronaut:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://everydayastronaut.com/aerospikes/\u0022 rel=\u0022external

gain a really solid edge over normal rockets- I think an accurate conclusion is that, on their own, Aerospikes are just a *little bit* better than normal rockets for atmospheric stages, but not really worth the extra R\u0026amp;D effort if their additional usefulness can\u0027t be demonstrated more convincingly...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne technology that is also, similarly, is just a *little* better in atmosphere, but not really worth the effort to fully develop right now, are air-augmented\u00A0rockets (aka \u0022Ducted Rockets\u0022, aka \u0022Ejector Rockets/Nozzles\u0022 or \u0022Rocket Engine Nozzle Ejector (RENE)\u0022 and related to \u0022Ejector Ramjets\u0022 and multi-cycle applications like \u0022Rocket-Based Combined Cycle (RBCC)\u0022 engines...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-augmented_rocket\u0022 rel=\u0022external

nozzle, whereas the other technology (Aerospikes) is a nozzle design- and doesn\u0027t have any particularly requirements upstream of the nozzle, other than an unusual (toroidal-shaped for Toroidal/Plug Aerospikes like the J-2T, a bunch of small rockets with seoarate combustion chambers and normally-shaped throats in a line for Linear Aerospikes like the XRS-2200/RS-2200) throat design in some cases, which is one of the sources of the heat issues that aerospikes have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, here is some more background in the XRS-2200 in case it helps.\u00A0 Please note that, once again, the linear aerospike is s NOZZLE design- there are no special requirements for the many small combustion chambers that line the aerospike:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://heroicrelics.org/info/aerospikes/xrs-rs-2200.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://heroicrelics.org/info/aerospikes/xrs-rs-2200.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I got to thinking, what if an air-augmented rocket (of the design type where you have a rocket combustion chamber empty into a mixing chamber with ducted air, then the mixed gases are ejected through a typical rocket throat and into the nozzle...) were combined with an aerospike nozzle instead of the usual bell-nozzle?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not just suggesting combining these two technologies for the heck of it: one of the MAIN problems with aerospikes is managing heat transferred to the throat and nozzle of the rocket from the exhaust-gases.\u00A0 Air-augmented rockets have cooler exhaust gases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me repeat this: air-augmented rockets eject a cooler exhaust gas mixture than do conventional rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the gases from the rocket combustion-chamber are mixed (diluted) with cooler air from an air intake system- which may be hot due to compressive-heating, but not NEARLY as hot as the gases of a rocket combustion chamber normally are- you get an exhaust gas mixture that isn\u0027t nearly as hot as you normally encounter for a rocket of similar Thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Air-augmented rockets eject a larger mass of gases more slowly, with much\u00A0of the mass coming from the atmosphere rather than the combustion chamber.\u00A0 Thus the exhaust is both cooler and slower-moving, but the \u003Cem\u003EEFFECTIVE \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is *HIGHER* as you burn less fuel to get a given Thrust...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince Aerospike Nozzles struggle with heat issues, ejecting a larger volume of cooler and slower-moving gases would be desirable- ESPECIALLY as Aerospikes become easier to keep cool at larger sizes (note that the size of a nozzle is based on the Mass Flow Rate, so air-augmented rockets normally have larger nozzles) due to scaling-effects from the Square-Cube Law (please see the Everyday Astronaut article and associated content for more on why larger rocket engines are easier to keep cool...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAerospike Nozzles\u00A0increase the nozzle-efficiency at higher ambient pressures of a rocket of most any type- meaning you get more Thrust at seal level (higher Sea Level \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E), while they ALSO have superb vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E (unlike s sea-level optimized bell nozzle: which they tend to outperform even at sea level in terms of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E: usually by at least\u00A020-30%).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe usual drawbacks of aerospikes are issues with overheating that lead to the design of a heavier nozzle (even though an Aerospike is THEORETICALLY lighter-weight than a bell nozzle, you need so much extra mass for dealing with the heat issues they have that your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for the engine ends up being lower...) and added design cost/expense as Aerospikes are currently not at full tech readiness for use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real-life, I\u0027m also not aware of any issues stacking them (like in KSP) since it\u0027s not the actual nozzle itself that supports the weight in a stack arrangement- although as Aerospikes are prinarily atmospheric engines it\u0027s unclear why you\u0027d ever want to stack\u00A0them anyways...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT, the bottom line is that if you combine aeeospike nozzles with Ducted Rockets, you might have fewer heating issues (due to the cooler exhaust), as well as better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E due to not needing to invest so much mass in solving heat issues, and better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E than either approach alone...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome details/math:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Ducted Rockets improve Thrust in proportion to the mix-ratio of combustion products and air.\u00A0 For instance, in a 3:1 mix you get, to a first approximation, a doubling of Thrust and Effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E (4 times as much exhaust mass, moving a little over half as quickly: due to E = 1/2 M V^2 and the same amount of energy being spread among 4x the mass.\u00A0 Note that this ignores 2 compounding factors: combustion of some of the residual fuel from a fuel-rich primary rocket combustion chamber, which adds a little additional energy, and change in the molecular mixture of the exhaust gases: which slightly decreases\u00A0nozzle performance vs. a pure HydroLox rocket...)\u00A0 A 8:1 mix triples Thrust/ Effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- At the same time EFFECTIVE \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E increases (due to getting more Thrust for your fuel use), *actual* \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E based on Exhaust Velocity decreases: due to having slower-moving exhaust.\u00A0 The lower Exhaust Velocity (and pressure) means you don\u0027t need (and won\u0027t benefit from) as much expansion of your exhaust gases to reach ambient pressure, however, and ideal nozzle length/size is shorter/smaller for the Mass Flow Rate through the nozzle (though higher for the amount of fuel being combusted, as Mass Flow Rate through the nozzle is now many times higher).\u00A0 Large nozzles, low Expansion Ratios, basically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Aerospikes can very easily achieve some rather impressive expansion-ratios, as they ALWAYS (both at sea-level and in vacuum) expand the exhaust stream to very near the ambient pressure, if large\u00A0enough (at least, they do better at this than bell-nozzles, particularly at high ambient pressures...)\u00A0 But the more you expand your exhaust, the larger the spike/plug/wedge you need, and the more heating issues you have to deal with: so the lower need for expanding the exhaust of a Ducted Rocket (due to lower exhaust pressures/temperatures\u00A0leaving the throat of the mixing chamber) is actually *particularly* beneficial for an Aerospike Nozzle, as it saves mass, and Aerospikes struggle with their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E due to high mass... (lower expansion ratio required --\u0026gt; less nozzle mass needed)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Aerospike nozzles\u00A0obtain higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and Thrust, but lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, than bell-nozzles (if your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and Thrust go up 20% vs. a bell-nozzle,\u00A0your engine mass might rise 50% with an\u00A0Aerospike rather than bell-nozzle, for instance...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Most of the added mass is to deal with heat issues.\u00A0 To reiterate, Aerospikes are theoretically lighter than bell-nozzles, were heat not an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Ducted Rockets also have low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s but high Thrust and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E as little as 20% of a conventional rocket with similar Thrust, according to Wikipedia... But this is un-cited, and I think the author misunderstood: 5-6x the mass is NOT 20% the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E if you double your Thrust as well,\u00A0only about 32-40%...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis \u0022short\u0022 prompt has gotten way out of hand, so let me wrap up my idea...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAerospikes increase both Thrust and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E for the rocket chambers above them by a PERCENT, vs. a bell-nozzle.\u00A0 Keep this in mind...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDucted Rockets have higher base Thrust and lower true (exhaust velocity) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E than conventional rockets, but higher Effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, while mixing with air (once/if they switch to closed-cycle mode as they ascend to thinner air, which some designs such as RBCC are capable of, they perform similarly to a conventional rocket, but with a lot of extra weight...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you combine an Aerospike and a Ducted Rocket, you should get an even higher Effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E (and less low true \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E) than before at high ambient pressures.\u00A0 For example, if you have 720 seconds Effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E at sea level with a HydroLox\u00A0Ducted Rocket (a perfectly achievable number: you can more than double Effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, and for instance get well into the\u00A0500\u0027s\u00A0seconds with SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS that have been air-augmented...) and you swap the bell-nozzle for an Aerospike- which augments \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and Thrust at least 20-30%,\u00A0you should get about 720*1.25= 900 seconds Effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E at sea-level with an air-augmented Aerospike rocket\u00A0(note that TRUE \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, based on Exhaust Velocity, was only about 180 seconds with a bell-nozzle, and 225 seconds with an Aerospike: but 75% of your working mass comes from the atmosphere, and so Effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is 4x higher...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUNLIKE most airbreathing jets (except SABRE), this is easily a dual-cycle design: you can swap to closed-cycle mode and lose half your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E at any time... (some\u00A0Air-Augmented rocket designs are designed to\u00A0allow you to preserve Thrust by increasing the rate of fuel-consumption proportionally, however...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E in-atmosphere is extremely impressive, and no less than a \u0022normal\u0022 Aerospike outside the atmosphere (the RS-2200 was supposed to\u00A0be capable of achieving 437 seconds on HydroLox, for instance...\u00A0 Not a great deal worse than the Space Shuttle Main Engines, at 451 seconds...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is the main bogey of air-augmented rockets and Aerospikes both.\u00A0 But it\u0027s even lower for Ducted Rockets (probably about 30-40% of comparable\u00A0higher-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E conventional rockets with a good ducted rocket design, I\u0027d\u00A0guess around 25:1 - 30:1) than it is for Aerospikes (about 80-90% that of a comparable rocket is likely, once you consider that the RS-2200 was likely over-optimistic in its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E: which would have exceeded the Space Shuttle Main Engines, at 83:1 vs. 73:1...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0mass penalty for an Aerospike Nozzle would likely decrease with a Ducted Rocket, due to having fewer heat issues.\u00A0 But even if it didn\u0027t, increasing that Thrust and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E 20-30% would still only come at a fixed mass-penalty, attached to a much heavier (ducted) rocket engine.\u00A0 So \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E would fall very little (for a BIG, 20-30% increase in sea-level \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E), and might actually improve for the rocket as a whole (with the benefit of cooler exhaust-gases), by switching to an Aerospike nozzle...\u00A0 This is in sharp contrast to with a normal rocket: where Aerospikes impose a HEAVY (20% or so) penalty to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance, let\u0027s say you have a standard 1 ton, 1000 kN sea-level Thrust rocket (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E about 100:1, I will treat g at 10 m/s instead of 9.8 for easier math, as it won\u0027t affect the conclusions), 320 seconds \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you make it ducted (air-augmented), mass might increase to 6\u00A0tons.\u00A0 Thrust to 2000 kN.\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E has now dropped from 100:1 to 33:1.\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is now 640 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if you add an Aerospike to that normal (1000 kN) rocket, Thrust might\u0027ve increased to 1200 kN, but mass to 1.5 tons (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E now 80:1).\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E at sea-level from 320 to 384\u00A0seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo add an Aerospike to the ducted rocket, however, would\u00A0add 2 tons to the mass instead of 500 kg, due to having 4x the Mass Flow Rate (4x the nozzle size), if heat issues were no way alleviated by the cooler exhaust gases, or scaling-benefits (because larger rockets have fewer cooling-issues with their nozzles, up to a certain point, Aerospikes experience less of a mass-penalty relative to Mass Flow Rate as you scale them up...) and you had the same mixture of exhaust-gases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever that last one is a bad assumption we CAN\u0027T make here: the gases of the atmosphere (average MW about 29)\u00A0are substantially heavier than the gases of a HydroLOX engine (mostly H2O, MW 18).\u00A0 So much so, that even though the Mass Flow Rate is 4x higher, the VOLUME of exhaust gases only increases about 150%, and the nozzle-size needs only go up proportionally.\u00A0 So, 1.25 tons is a more appropriate mass-penalty (nozzle is 250% as large as with the standard rocket, where mass-penalty was 500 kg) even WITHOUT any benefit from larger engine size or cooler exhaust-gases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the Aerospike adds 20% to Thrust and Effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E due to higher nozzle-efficiency, like before, you would get 2400 kN Thrust, 768 sec \u003Cabbr

Thrust/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E only 20% (conservative end of the 20-30% range) you now have a 7.25 ton rocket,

ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is now 35.86\u00A0:1, HIGHER than before.\u00A0 If the mass-penalty is even a little less than before (due to scaling benefits or the cooler exhaust gases) then the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E improves further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, an Aerospike Nozzle, Air-Augmented Rocket should have better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, and quite likely\u00A0higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, than a normal Air-Augmented Rocket.\u00A0 It should ease some of the design challenges of an Aerospike (mainly, these have to with heat-management, which should be helped both by cooler exhaust and larger nozzle size) and has the same intended uses (to improve atmospheric Effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E on a rocket) and so I do expect the two technologies would be complementary- each eases the other\u0027s challenges, at least slightly\u00A0(Aerospikes suffer from heat-related issues due to having more surface area in contact with fuel, Ducted Rockets from low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight

(important for Ducted Rockets, which obtain higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E at higher speeds: presumably due to some effect of the increased mass or speed of the intake air) and spend a lot of time in the atmosphere, but still ascend beyond it: precisely the sort of ascent Aerospikes work best for (not to mention the reduced penalty for high engine mass on a spaceplane: which can reach orbit with overall\u00A0vessel \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E less than
