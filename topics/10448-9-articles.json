All but one of them left Kerbin SoI successfully. The one straggler unfortunately and accidentally caught a reverse munar slingshot and was flung back unto the surface of kerbin. The occupants of said bus radiod (before they were smashed to bits) that they thought this was \\\u0027an honest mistake\\\u0027 and that the vehicle performed flawlessly none the less and the contractors should be paid out in full.\n\nFuel officials on the launch site report that both Awaras and Fermun used frighteningly little fuel to put the bus on its trajectory, both of them used only 9 tanks of liquid rocket fuel. Fermun used an additional six tanks of jet fuel, however Awaras managed to get away with only three. Therefore Awaras takes the prize for most efficient bus driver. Congratulations!\n\nBoth Sal\\_vager and Fermun risked their crews with high G-return trajectories, however their astronauts are made of tough stuff and they all survived.\n\nThis turn also saw the founding of a joint engineering/launching initiative by Bellaby. A handful of players have already donated to this fund. To show their support the Kerbal government has sent over a few of its finest investment wizards which will manage the fund, netting it a cool 10% interest each turn.\n\n**Turn 9 technology price reductions:**\n\n-Salvage Tech II has been reduced in price by 10% to $7200\n\n-Liquid Tech II has been reduced in price by 10% to $11250 \n\nNow for the financial overview, in the past I\\\u0027ve kept some numbers obfuscated from you guys in order to protect some design and salvage secrets. However it has led to quite a few inquiries and a few more numbers have been added to the game, so I\\\u0027ve switched to a full transparancy budget overview. It will result in a fairly lengthy post, if anyone knows of a better way to do these things please let me know.\n\n**Turn 9 financial overview**\n\n**Awaras**\n\nTurn start balance: $46700\n\n*Mission flown: Complete one full kerbin orbit*\n\n**Expenses**\n\nTechnology: $8000\n\nPersonal Launch: $0\n\nMission craft cost: $15350\n\nCommunity pool contribution: $10000\n\nContract entry: $2000\n\nPenalties: $0\n\n*Total: $35350*\n\n**Income**\n\nMission Salvage: $5532\n\nMission Reward: $27500\n\nContract Reward: $8500\n\nCommunity Pool withdrawal: $0\n\nFundraiser: $1500\n\n*Total: $43032*\n\nEnd of turn balance: $54382\n\n**sal\\_vager**\n\nTurn start balance: $18750\n\n*Mission flown: Reach 200km altitude* \n\n**Expenses**\n\nTechnology: $2250\n\nPersonal Launch: $0\n\nMission craft cost: $12750\n\nCommunity pool contribution: $0\n\nContract entry: $0\n\nPenalties: $0\n\n*Total: $15000*\n\n**Income**\n\nMission Salvage: $250\n\nMission Reward: $17000\n\nContract Reward: $0\n\nCommunity Pool withdrawal: $0\n\nFundraiser: $1500\n\n*Total: $18750*\n\nEnd of turn balance: $22500\n\n**Fireblade**\n\nTurn start balance: $32080\n\n*Mission flown: Complete one full kerbin orbit* \n\n**Expenses**\n\nTechnology: $12500\n\nPersonal Launch: $0\n\nMission craft cost: $17100\n\nCommunity pool contribution: $1500\n\nContract entry: $2000\n\nPenalties: $0\n\n*Total: $33100*\n\n**Income**\n\nMission Salvage: $115\n\nMission Reward: $27500\n\nContract Reward: $5000\n\nCommunity Pool withdrawal: $0\n\nFundraiser: $1500\n\n*Total: $34115*\n\nEnd of turn balance: $33095\n\n**Robsr3v3ng3**\n\nTurn start balance: $20900\n\n*Mission flown: Reach 80km altitude* \n\n**Expenses**\n\nTechnology: $4500\n\nPersonal Launch: $0\n\nMission craft cost: $11000\n\nCommunity pool contribution: $0\n\nContract entry: $2000\n\nPenalties: $0\n\n*Total: $17500*\n\n**Income**\n\nMission Salvage: $3750\n\nMission Reward: $14000\n\nContract Reward: $5000\n\nCommunity Pool withdrawal: $0\n\nFundraiser: $1500\n\n*Total: $24250*\n\nEnd of turn balance: $27650\n\n**Issarlk**\n\nTurn start balance: $21030\n\n*Mission flown: Reach 200km altitude* \n\n**Expenses**\n\nTechnology: $2400\n\nPersonal Launch: $0\n\nMission craft cost: $18100\n\nCommunity pool contribution: $0\n\nContract entry: $2000\n\nPenalties: $0\n\n*Total: $22500*\n\n**Income**\n\nMission Salvage: $1180\n\nMission Reward: $17000\n\nContract Reward: $5000\n\nCommunity Pool withdrawal: $0\n\nFundraiser: $1500\n\n*Total: $24680*\n\nEnd of turn balance: $23210\n\n**Bellaby**\n\nTurn start balance: $27260\n\n*Mission flown: Reach 200km altitude* \n\n**Expenses**\n\nTechnology: $10000\n\nPersonal Launch: $0\n\nMission craft cost: $10250\n\nCommunity pool contribution: $5000\n\nContract entry: $2000\n\nPenalties: $0\n\n*Total: $27250*\n\n**Income**\n\nMission Salvage: $1180\n\nMission Reward: $17000\n\nContract Reward: $5000\n\nCommunity Pool withdrawal: $0\n\nFundraiser: $1500\n\n*Total: $24680*\n\nEnd of turn balance: $24690\n\n**Db101**\n\nTurn start balance: $24150\n\n*Mission flown: Reach 80km altitude* \n\n**Expenses**\n\nTechnology: $8000\n\nPersonal Launch: $0\n\nMission craft cost: $12500\n\nCommunity pool contribution: $1000\n\nContract entry: $2000\n\nPenalties: $0\n\n*Total: $23500*\n\n**Income**\n\nMission Salvage: $5588\n\nMission Reward: $14000\n\nContract Reward: $5000\n\nCommunity Pool withdrawal: $0\n\nFundraiser: $1500\n\n*Total: $26088*\n\nEnd of turn balance: $26738\n\n**Fermun**\n\nTurn start balance: $16550\n\n*Mission flown: Reach 200km altitude* \n\n**Expenses**\n\nTechnology: $2400\n\nPersonal Launch: $0\n\nMission craft cost: $13500\n\nCommunity pool contribution: $0\n\nContract entry: $2000\n\nPenalties: $0\n\n*Total: $17900*\n\n**Income**\n\nMission Salvage: $0\n\nMission Reward: $17000\n\nContract Reward: $5000\n\nCommunity Pool withdrawal: $0\n\nFundraiser: $1500\n\n*Total: $23500*\n\nEnd of turn balance: $22150 \n\n**Community pool balance**\n\nDeposits: $17500\n\nWithdrawals: $0\n\n*\u002B10% Interest: $1750*\n\nBalance available for next turn: $19250\n\n**Turn 010 announcements**\n\n- The 80km and 200km altitude missions have had their rewards reduced by $1000\n\n- The mission to complete two orbits, then land on either pole has had its reward increased by $5000\n\n- No contract this turn\n\nOP will be updated shortly with new mission rewards and tech prices.
