understand. \u00A0But core to the whole idea is the \u0022tiered\u0022 model for production. \u00A0When you first go to space, you can get by on stored snacks. \u00A0When you want to stay out there a while, you\u0027ll want to look into producing food in space, and that\u0027s going to take a while. \u00A0New \u0022Tiers\u0022 of production are unlocked by actually producing and consuming stuff produced in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mod is designed to encourage you to build a variety of ships. \u00A0To research agroponics, you\u0027ll need orbital space stations. \u00A0To research off-world agriculture, you\u0027ll need to land a farm and no, all that stuff you learned about agroponics isn\u0027t going to do you a bit of good on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get an idea of how \u0022Tiers\u0022 work, just look at the life support consumable, \u0022Snacks\u0022. \u00A0If you fill a container with snacks on Kerban, it\u0027s \u0022Kerban Snacks\u0022. \u00A0A kerban will eat one \u0022Kerban Snacks\u0022 every day. \u00A0Let\u0027s say you have a \u0022Tier 0\u0022 Agroponics module on this ship. \u00A0Given a little fertilizer, it can produce \u0022Tier 0\u0022 \u0022Agroponics Snacks\u0022. \u00A0Tier 0 snacks are far from haute cuisine, but nevertheless Jeb is willing to take one for the team. \u00A0But he\u0027s got limits; Jeb will be willing to con\uFEFFsume only up to 20% of his daily snack quota on Tier-0 quality snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tier 1 Agroponic Snacks\u0022 are tastier, and Jeb would be willing to take that as 40% of his diet. \u00A0But to be able to get out of the tier 0 kit, Jeb\u0027s going to have to choke down quite a few of those tier 1 snacks and Bill\u0027s going to have to spend some time trying to make them better. \u00A0Tier-1 is unlocked by kerbals consuming Tier-0 snacks and lab research on ships equipped with Tier-0 kit. \u00A0Once Tier-1 is unlocked, nothing changes on board Jeb\u0027s vessel - it still has the \u0022Tier 0\u0022 equipment. \u00A0A new vessel has to be designed that includes the new tier of agroponics modules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EHow Do You

to that mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mod doesn\u0027t come with a rich supply of parts, so it depends on a couple of mods with great varieties of parts for building orbital stations and planetary bases, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/StationPartsExpansionRedux\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStockalike Station Parts Expansion Redux\u003C/a\u003E and

too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarly gameplay is not impacted much by the life support modifications - your kerbals won\u0027t get mad about not having any snacks for 7 days, so you can get your basic science unlocked in career mode by the usual routine of trips to Mun. \u00A0Minmus is a bit of a problem since the round-trip times there are longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027re ready for that voyage to Minmus, find a container and select \u0022Snacks-Tier4\u0022 as the content. \u00A0Then mash the Cupcake button on your toolbar - that will bring up the life support calculator and you can see if you\u0027re going to have enough food on board for the trip. \u00A0After you launch, the cupcake button will still be there for you to keep track of how the supplies are holding out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EHow about a Space

Fertilizer (again, go with Tier4) and Snacks(again, Tier4). \u00A0And of course, check that cupcake button to see where you stand. \u00A0Strap some boosters onto that crate and git it up to \u003Cabbr

faster the research progresses, so make sure Jeb has plenty of friends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you get it up there, you can see from the Cupcake button how long you\u0027ve got until you will need to resupply the base and how long it\u0027ll take until you break into the next tier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan

because you\u0027ll not only want the farm part (look in the Life Support category) but also a resource gatherer and a fertilizer factory. \u00A0These parts look identical to the stock parts (because the author failed art class) but have different innards. \u00A0Be sure to look hard at the parts in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E - there are more details there about how the parts work, but at a minimum, you\u0027ll need Farms, drills, a fertilizer factory and, if you feel it, a factory to make Shinies, which will help defray the cost of the whole trip if you can haul them back to Kerban.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, the Cupcake button will help you understand what the requirements are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that you can\u0027t build body-specific things (like farms \u0026amp; factories) until you\u0027ve actually returned a ship from there. \u00A0Also, researching farming on the Mun doesn\u0027t do anything for Minmus - that\u0027s a completely separate problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EGet Your Wheels

anywhere...\u00A0 Well, what we\u0027re doing here is presuming that Jeb\u0027s uncanny piloting skills will land your base somewhere with minimal nearby supplies to support your early efforts at self-sufficiency.\u00A0 And early they are, at those early tiers, you\u0027re still dependent upon trucked-in supplies.\u00A0 But at Tier2, things start to get more interesting:\u00A0 you\u0027ll have to go out and mine resources from elsewhere on the planet.\u00A0 You\u0027ll need that orbital scanning part that\u0027s so far been whizzing around uselessly in space to spot some, and it\u0027ll do a whole lot better at spotting them if there are scanner satellites in polar orbits.\u00A0 That will point you to where the resources are, and you\u0027ll want another craft, like a rover, to fly out to where the resources are, pick some up, and bring them back to the base.\u00A0 Once you\u0027ve proven you can do that a couple times, you can just leave the rover at the base and the kerbals will automatically take care of that job going forward as long as there\u0027s a pilot there to drive it.\u00A0 (And yes, you need to make sure your rover has at least 2 seats on it.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EExtraplanetary

idea that a couple engineers can land not-terribly-complicated vehicle on Gilly and, in a couple months, fly off in a Romulan Battlecruiser.\u00A0 This mod revamps the production chain for EPL to change that equation.\u00A0 Now, it takes a mess of engineers to build anything big, and it\u0027ll take them quite a while, and it\u0027ll take some support staff (farmers, miners, etc.) to get it done.\u00A0 Further, making rocket parts off-world isn\u0027t a thing you can learn how to do just by collecting a few surface samples and mystery goo containers.\u00A0 You gotta do it to be good at it.\u00A0 So the production mechanism for rocket parts works a lot like they do for the other stuff in this chain.\u00A0 Your first rocket parts factory can only produce the simplest components, the rest needs to be trucked in from Kerban.\u00A0 As your kerbals gain experience building off-world, they\u0027ll be able to make more sophisticated components locally.\u00A0 The more rocket parts you build, the less reliant your kerbals will be on the homeworld.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContracts!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSupport for

I just lost a mission that was doing a simple flyby of the Mun. Granted, this was prior to upgrading the tracking station.. so I\u0027m eyeballing everything and it\u0027s not perfect.

Fertilizer is converted to snacks at a 1 to 1 ratio. Fertilizer is not produced on a vessel (no waste recycling or the like), so you have to take it from home if you\u0027re building a station (though the mod says you shouldn\u0027t?). The only real benefit to bringing fertilizer instead of just snacks is that fertilizer is more dense.. you can pack 1900 into a small container as opposed to like 95 snacks. I guess that\u0027s not an issue, though it does create some odd mass fluctuations as resources are converted.\u00A0All that said - it\u0027s extremely expensive in career mode. A small container of fertilizer is a whopping 28,500 credits \u002B 380 for the container. That\u0027s more than the entire station I\u0027m launching, and more than the rocket that\u0027s launching it. Also, why are there 5\u00A0different types of fertilizer and snacks? Wouldn\u0027t it be better if progressing in research simply increased the efficiency of your modules? As is, I have to have numerous different types of storage for various types of resources.
