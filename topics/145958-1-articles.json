Stock fairings are arguably hard to use, nearly impossible to make interstage fairings with them, they are impossible to duplicate, do not have clean lines. While Procedural Fairings are easy to use, can range in size from about 0.100 meters to a staggering 50 meters, yes you read that right FIFTY METERS. Can be conical or egg shaped, take SECONDS to put on and are easy to configure to your needs on the run while building.

Here\u0027s an idea. Add a new class of 0.625m rocket parts that look like they were cobbled together in an actual barn (I hate the barn, too, BTW, but I\u0027ll accept the notion for this). Those are tier 0 test rockets. Have a launcher part they come with (a rail) that you explicitly set to a launch angle, and they are unguided.
