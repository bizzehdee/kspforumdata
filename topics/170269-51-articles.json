Back in the day the audiophile people were complaining about quality losses of the cd in comparison to vinyl records. This is true for many recordings, but not generally. An extremely well made cd recording can be as good as an extremely well made vinyl recording, but in the case of cds number goes over quality. The cd was a dictate from the industry. Maybe a reason why vinyl records have a revival.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best reproduction technique is imo high bandwidth digital recording direct to a master disk(*) and then a high quality cast on vinyl (direct cut or direct to disk).

Not always, if it is a bad recording or just flat synthesizer music then it won\u0027t matter what plays it, but in many cases when played directly side by side, the analogue reproduction sounds better when played from a reasonable equipment, let\u0027s say 4.000 for players, amp and speakers. The turntable needs a little love when positioning and adjusting, speakers standard stereo triangle, no obstructions or corner positions.
