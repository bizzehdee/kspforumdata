By default you are much better off spamming batteries to get more electricity for your weight, the fuel cell should offer better electricity to weight ratio than batteries (otherwise they wouldn\u0027t have been used). To actually make it practical you need to set it to generate 10,000 units of elec for every 1 unit of rocket fuel (10,000 in batteries is only 0.5 in weight)... and also reduce the weight of the part itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal fuel cells can run on a variety of fuels.
