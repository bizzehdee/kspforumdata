Post 1.0 the big change from stock is that the shape of your craft matters, instead of just the lift/drag values of the parts being added together. That makes a lot of cool things possible, like building oversized/oddly shaped cargo bays from structural panels. It also means some of the counterintuitive aspects of stock stop happening, so parts in front of others will actually shield them from drag instead of only having things shielded while inside cargo bays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo try FAR. It\u0027s not as huge of a change as you\u0027d think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
