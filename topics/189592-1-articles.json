It goes something like this: I\u0027m clicking a certain node on a maneuver, say,\u00A0 radial-in. Every time I click it my encounter gets a bit closer, maybe a few kilometers. I do this 30 or 40 times and every single click the encounter gets a little bit closer. Then, for no reason whatsoever, at a random time the encounter just completely disappears. It acts as if the fraction of a meter per second I\u0027m adding is moving the encounter by millions or billions of meters, when the previous fraction of a m/s moved it by a few thousand. In fact, the closest approach markers usually act as if I\u0027m now off by a quarter orbit, like I missed the transfer window entirely. No, my transfer isn\u0027t on the edge of an encounter with another object like the Mun. If I keep clicking the node, sometimes the encounter returns, sometimes it doesn\u0027t. Direct trajectories from solar orbit to any of the moons of any planet, and the smaller planets like Moho, Dres and Eeloo, all constantly have this happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI swear to God this will stop me from buying KSP2 if it isn\u0027t fixed. I\u0027ve been playing for who knows how many years now, long enough to get the DLCs for free, and it has been like this every single time I come back to play. I know everyone doesn\u0027t go outside the Kerbin system. But encounters and maneuver nodes are so wildly important this part of the game. They must be completely rock solid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do I reliably, consistently keep my encounters from disappearing? Randomly fiddling with the node sometimes works but not always and it makes the process of refining a transfer even more extremely tedious than it already is. I have wasted so much of my time trying to circumvent this issue rather than actually building, flying or planning. I already have \u0022Always show closest approach\u0022 enabled; all this does is show me that it\u0027s skipping to the next orbit\u0027s closest approach (which, as I said, isn\u0027t an encounter at all)\u00A0when it loses the one I already have, instead of it just disappearing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock game plus both DLCs, all completely up to date.
