I\u0027ve had terrain scatter set on 10% since forever, but when I got on land, there were no trees, so I just assumed this particular biome didn\u0027t have any. I drove for many clicks across totally empty country, then saved and quit the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA while later, I restarted the game but when I tried to select the rover from the tracking station, the game crashed instantly. This happened several times. I could select other ships in orbit no problem, so I then used the map view to switch from one of them to the rover. And the game crashed. But this time, at least the rover appeared on the screen for a moment before the crash. And in that brief movment, I saw a light, 10%-ish scattering of trees all around it, including behind it where they had been no trees when it drove through there before I saved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crash logs all implicated the temperature gauges, nothing about trees. But I went to settings and turned terrain scatter off completely with the button, not the slider.

From what I\u0027ve always seen, once scatter is generated for a given patch of terrain, it stays there forever in that particular saved game. Now, if you start a new game and go to the same place, the scatter will be different because it\u0027s randomly generated, but again, it will be persistent within that new game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd anyway, that\u0027s not the issue I was having. I was getting zero scatter at all for a long while even though apparently it should have been visible. 10% scatter isn\u0027t much but always before, even in low-scatter biomes, you get at least 1 tree/boulder/cactus per kilometer so can always see numerous examples, provided there\u0027s supposed to be some there to begin with. IOW, no scatter visible has always meant that none was supposed to be there, and that\u0027s what I was thinking as I was driving along here. But when I reopened the save, suddenly there were trees all around, in such density that I\u0027d have noticed them before had they been being drawn then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, we have 2 possible problems. Either the game in the 1st session wasn\u0027t drawing trees when it should have been, or in the 2nd session it decided for reasons unknown suddenly to start drawing trees where no trees should really have been.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to favor the 1st option. There might be some adaptive framerate thing that cuts down on detail as needed to keep the game running as memory starts to run out. Given that I\u0027d been playing for a long time crossing the ocean before driving up on land, probably memory was getting full so the game just didn\u0027t draw the trees. Then, when I restarted the game, memory was pretty empty so the trees got drawn, and they by themselves were enough to crash the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T12:53:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrees.
