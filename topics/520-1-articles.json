I just went into my first orbit and using the OPA makes it damn easy. I\u0027m trying the micro tank and engine out because I wanted a better model, haven\u0027t used it yet. So tell me about how you guys do this, do any of your just do vertical lift off and landings? my orbit reentries are never smooth at all. Also, can you land the module in water and have it not explode?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnman","CreatedById":1731,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-17T17:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt helps to first reduce your lateral speed.
