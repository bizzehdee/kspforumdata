The concept of SXT is perfect as it includes stuff stock doesn\u0027t have while being really lightweight, especially for the amount of parts it has. I have only tested some of those parts but from what I have seen while using them in career and scrolling a bit in a sandbox they fill some of the voids the stock part catalogue has which is always good. It has the potential to become my favourite part-only mod because as I said it offers a lot for it\u0027s size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for KSC\u002B\u002B, it is like Environmental Visual Enhancements in that both are visual additions that add a lot to the game. The clouds (and with Astronomers visual pack that I only recently found the aurorae) as well as KSC\u002B\u002B are stuff that once you are used to it don\u0027t want to play without. The trucks driving around the space centre and all the other stuff make it a lot more...lively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took the trucks for a ride in a sandbox and it is really fun to drive around the enhanced KSC.

Would it be possible to add it to the available truck parts someday? It would be nice if you\u0027d consider it even though it is just more of the same.
