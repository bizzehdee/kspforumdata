You\u0027re not double-checking as much, but it might not be necessary. Basically, you will take more risks, but if the risks are small compared to the possible gain, you will feel that your brain is \u0022optimized\u0022. Your brain is actually not optimized, in fact it probably took a small hit to the reasoning part, but the time and simplicity gained from the increased risk-taking behavior could outweigh it by far. Couple this with the increased self-confidence and people think that their brain suddenly works better when they\u0027ve had a drink or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebig caveat here: while certain creative cognitive processes might come easier when you\u0027re slightly inebriated (note: easier, not necessarily better. Alcohol adds nothing, it just takes away some things), just about everything else takes a hit. I know that there are people who think their driving actually improves after a drink or two, that\u0027s just straight up wrong. Coordination, reaction time, everything that requires physical actions is worse. If you\u0027re a writer, your storytelling might go smoother, but your typos will increase. If you\u0027re a painter, your inspiration will come easier, but your ideas will become harder to be perfectly translated to canvas, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enote that this is based on personal experience, observation of other people, my personal limited knowledge of human psychology and simple deduction on my part.
