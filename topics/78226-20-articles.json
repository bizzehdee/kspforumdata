Tested working with Stock and RealChutes on my system. The calculated values for terminal velocity and the actual values are a bit off. For RealChutes SR predicts, in my limited testing, about 0.3 m/s lower than RealChutes does. For Stock parachutes I\u0027ve seen errors up to 1 m/s above OR below actual physical values. I\u0027ll try to improve those figures in the future, but they\u0027re close enough that it should be reasonable.\u003Cp\u003EIf you encounter issues, please let me know (preferably by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eincluding the output_log.txt file\u003C/a\u003E). If you notice some designs that have predicted values WAY off from actual ones, let me know and include pictures of the craft, along with what SR predicts and what you actually see for the final velocity at sea level. Remember that the editor predictions use THE WHOLE CRAFT, not any particular stage.
