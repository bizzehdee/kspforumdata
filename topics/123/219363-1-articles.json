My girlfriend and son recognized the music and asked me to put it up on the tv.\u00A0 We made a few rendezvous\u0027 with long forgotten debris before I was asked to just burn up all our fuel and just see how big of a kerbolar orbit we could make. Well, it turned out to be the case that Kerbol now has a sphere of influence that I hadn\u0027t noticed before. We still had a little over 6000dV when we decided to shut down our SWERV engine. Time warp took us a few decades into the future where we found ourselves outside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of Kerbol. Looking back, our home sun could not be distinguished from the ocean of stars behind us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe decided to make what was supposed to be a one way trip into a rescue mission. Returning to Kerbol orbit only took about 500dV, but reaching the apogee of that orbit would\u0027ve taken 1400 years, so we burned towards the sun until we could arrive at our apogee in only 5 years. We were several degrees antinormal from the Kerbolar-Kerbin ecliptic, so we burned normal at the apogee about 300dV until our ascending node occurred several years outside of Eloo\u0027s orbit. At that node, we aligned with Kerbin\u0027s orbit. We were going to reach the closest approach a few months before the planet would be there so we burned a few \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E retrograde in order to get an intercept. We were lucky enough to get a close flyby of Minmus on our way back to Kerbin so we set ourselves up to fly by at 16km while moving at just over 12km/s relative to the minty surface. We EVA\u0027d our pilot so he could ride out the scene like some kind of space cowboy. Even without timewarp the planet whipped by in only a few seconds. Lucky for us(and our pilot), reentry heating hasn\u0027t been implemented yet, so we aerobraked with Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. It took a few tries to figure out that 27km periapsis was enough to shed the right amount of speed to put us into a stabile orbit. We burned most of our \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E getting back and I keep forgetting to equip pilots with parachutes, so we\u0027ve got a recovery mission planned for next time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately, what was meant to be a quick test of frame rate turned into several hours of fun and experimentation that was not dominated by the few small manageable bugs we ran into. I\u0027m glad to see the result of the hard work the devs have been putting in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-09T19:02:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow long did the mission take by the in-game timer?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
