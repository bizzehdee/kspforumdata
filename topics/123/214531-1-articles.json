So far that hasn\u0027t exactly yielded any results, \u003Cstrong\u003Edon\u0027t tell me if they\u0027re not there, I\u0027d like to discover that for myself\u003C/strong\u003E. Despite this, this afternoon I managed to find some rather interesting terrain features on the new Kerbin, including a set of 4 lakes around where the inland \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E used to be. The main topic of this thread however is what I found next: Worldseams!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022P3nVs06.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/P3nVs06.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlying along the river north of where the inland \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E used to be, I discovered this seam in the world going east/west. Now, I\u0027ve programmed something inspired by the PQS system from KSP1 for a university project and typically, you see variations in the height between different parts of a PQS-style terrain system when two different parts of the terrain are at slightly different detail levels. You can get it to not break most of the time, but it\u0027s difficult to completely stop from happening, especially between different faces of the quadsphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think that\u0027s what\u0027s happening here though, as in theory standing right on the edge of these two plates of the planet, they should be at exactly the same subdivision and thus match each other perfectly. I\u0027m sure whatever it is, fixing it will probably give the devs headaches too, to which I offer my deepest sympathies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, it\u0027d be rude not to jump in:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HpOIDyh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/HpOIDyh.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyup, it\u0027s the ocean down there. Jeb was quite happily bobbing up and down on it but it didn\u0027t show up well on screenshot sadly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, after some shennanigans trying to crash my plane into it I set off to continue my search for interesting terrain when I found another one heading north.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022jLmzxHd.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/jLmzxHd.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided to follow this one to see if I could find somewhere it met up with another seam, maybe a corner of a couple quadtree nodes intersecting or even a corner of the cubesphere, in which 3 of the planet\u0027s sides met up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JxyB5YZ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JxyB5YZ.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoing this I had to do some fairly close to the ground flying, and swap between each side of the seam as which side was on top kept on switching. The plane I\u0027d built, while not the most manoueverable, is definitely nicely suited for this kind of close-to-the-ground acrobatics. If anyone wants the workspace file for it, I can put it up on gdrive and add it to the thread. It\u0027s a really nice little plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally my efforts were paid off, as I caught the faint hin of another seam on a hill going in a different direction. I tried to put my plane down as close as possible to it, and ended up near these rather peculiar flowers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022w7t2nzN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/w7t2nzN.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuge luck, this seems to be one of the corners of the PQS system\u0027s cubesphere, with 3 of the planet\u0027s faces breaking off from each other at 120\u003Cspan\u003E\u00B0\u003C/span\u003E angles!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YOj5H5g.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YOj5H5g.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what it looks like if you try to plant a flag close to the exact corner. The animation was completely messed up but the flag managed to go down anyway. Jeb looks chuffed with it, definitely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TZLrw9S.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/TZLrw9S.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here\u0027s where it is on the map if you want to try and seek it out yourself. As you can see it\u0027s sort of close to a bend in the furthest down river on the green bit of the western continent, Included are the markers for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and another jet parked on the north pole. Aside from the fact it\u0027s a meeting point between 3 different seams, it\u0027s location is another thing that tips me off to this probably being a corner of the PQS\u0027s quadsphere, as it\u0027s about at the latitude where I\u0027d expect one to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223TD0WGq.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3TD0WGq.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a fun little journey.
