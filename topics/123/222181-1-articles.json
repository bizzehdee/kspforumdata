At one point, one of the main characters uses a rocket powered science chair to either escape a swarm of nanobots, or get to a meeting faster, I cannot remember. I think a derivative may have been used to catch up to a rocket launch at one point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis short lived series featured recording by me videotaping the screen (in episode 1, without even a tripod) with my camcorder, while simultaneously voice acting and also flying whatever ship happened to be on the screen. This series is, in retrospect, an incredibly important piece of my KSP history, but also incredibly embarrassing, and will probably never see the light of day, at least not for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Duna monument had thankfully remained unspoiled for me (although I thought it had partially been spoiled at the time). Thus, I didn\u0027t know what to expect. However, I knew three things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. My precision landing skills aren\u0027t great on the best of days, let alone with limited fuel in an entirely new aerodynamics system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Rovers are still reportedly buggy in KSP 2. I have only seen post titles about this and not videos, and I have not experienced it myself, but I thought it would be a good idea to steer clear of rovers for the time being.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. The two monuments I Had encountered so far were both very tall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, I thought I should bring a jetpack style rocket hopper instead of a traditional rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022IxUrQH6.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/IxUrQH6.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first test flight of the Science Chair ended in disaster after the probe core was found to be backwards too late. From now on, the chair is controlled from the Kerbal\u0027s sideways control point because I couldn\u0027t be bothered to fix the probe core with how deeply it was buried inside the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second test flight was much better. Jebediah was able to fly the science chair from launch pad 1 (I think it was pad 1 at least) to the top of the air traffic control tower, to the top of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, to just outside the astronaut complex, all on one tank of gas. Since Duna has significantly less gravity, the fact that three precision-ish landings were accomplished in Kerbin\u0027s gravity meant that the design likely had enough range to hop from the landing site to the Duna monument, hop around a bit and loiter for a sufficient amount of screenshots and sightseeing, and then fly back to the landing site with plenty of margin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022wzX1MO4.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/wzX1MO4.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe then tested ingress and egress, and approved the basic design. The only change requested was the addition of solar panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarlier, we had wheeled out a really stupid command pod with four radially placed wheels to complete the rover contract with something that couldn\u0027t even rove, and it got made into a Lightyear tires commercial, and they didn\u0027t know any better!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis unlocked the first Kerbin sightseeing mission, which required I fly a lander can to Kapy rock.

I did not test this lander (I regretted this), assuming I knew what I was doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter this, the Science Chair was launched (no screenshots, sad).\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0I realized that, although the engine gimbal could probably compensate for the relatively light Science Chair hanging off of one side, for aesthetic reasons, another payload was desired to visually balance the mothership.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022zRq6G2d.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/zRq6G2d.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThus, the Duna Glider was designed. The current manned lander can only reach one biome on a good day, and its landing site is geographically constrained. The Duna Glider is designed to boost the science gain from the mission. It will be dropped off in orbit and glide above and to at least 1 biome, hopefully two, carrying the sniffer and the normal science experiment, so loiter time is desired.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIf possible, it is desired for the craft to fly back to the crewed landing site if it has the fuel, to allow the samples to be launched back to orbit too, although I don\u0027t even know if you can grab samples on EVA like you can in KSP 1, so this might be impossible. This is also not likely to happen in the first place due to the relatively small amount of fuel on board.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe first iteration of this design had WAY too much dihedral, and was virtually uncontrollable at any negative pitch angle as a result, so I reduced it to what you see above, and added a fourth fuel tank as its range was a bit lacking. It is enough to reach the island airfield and loiter above it for at least three minutes, and I got the science from Kerbin\u0027s mountains, which I had not gotten yet. Unfortunately, the airfield itself does not appear to be its own biome (or maybe I didn\u0027t get close enough, I landed basically on the very edge of the runway so it might not have counted) so I did not get additional science.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, the design was satisfactory. If I could redo this, I would have used symmetry and strapped three or four of these things to the mothership for enhanced flexibility, but I bounce between being very enthusiastic about KSP 2 and very fed up with it, and I was a bit fed up at the time, so I just sent one up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022Ze1NKKa.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Ze1NKKa.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd off I went to Duna! The phase angle was eyeballed, and I had to burn about 200-300m/s extra versus a normal transfer unfortunately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will notice I didn\u0027t launch crew. I was originally going to launch the crew on Explorer N4, or a larger vehicle for a larger crew, but crew seem to sneak in very easily in KSP 2. Over three separate launches, I had accumulated three separate crew on board the Infinity... And I guess Bob really wanted to fly the Science Chair, because he stowed away inside it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I decided a crew of three was just fine and sent it on its way to Duna without launching additional crew or any drop tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo minor course corrections later, the crew arrived at Duna, but the fuel situation was looking a little grim. I\u0027m not going to say it\u0027s hopeless until I see the Delta-V without all the equipment attached, but there are a few factors that alarm me. Due to the latitude of the Duna signal, a polar orbit was entered, which would severely constrain or increase the fuel consumption of the return leg. We have to get into Kerbin orbit due to the lack of a re entry capsule, so we can\u0027t just blaze in at Mach 87 like we usually do. Ideally I\u0027d like to reuse or preserve the Infinity. Lastly, I had kind of hoped to also go to Ike as an afterthought, but there is definitely not enough fuel for that now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022ULQyn7F.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ULQyn7F.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd thus, the ISV-01 Infinity entered Low Polar Duna Orbit.
