took away the aerogui so it is harder to design for aerodynamics.\u00A0 You sometimes have to balance space performance and atmospheric performance.\u00A0 The airliner jet engines on there do not go very fast and are very efficient as you can see in the first picture so there is not much need for aerodynamics.\u00A0 The \u0022DIY interstellar\u0022 modded nuclear cheat engine in center has no need for that either as it is very efficient with 4000 isp and 750kn thrust.\u00A0 Additionally, the real F-32 is not super aerodynamic but as I mentioned the \u0022Mike\u0022 model I made is more aerodynamic but will never be going to space by itself because it has a thinner body.\u00A0 I like the idea of huge fighter planes so adding more and more fuel is fun even if it makes the vehicle look fatter.\u00A0 This vehicle is a true \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E with enough power with 4 panther engines under afterburner to easily lift it with the huge \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E loadout.\u00A0 I typically launch it like a rocket with small long rockets under the wings and with hydrogen droptanks on the other hardpoints.\u00A0 Before they took the aerogui away I noted that launching like a rocket somehow gives a plane a higher top speed at least with the whiplash engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will keep those \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E units in mind but I do not plan on doing more extreme landings like that.\u00A0 Other vehicles in the line like \u0022November\u0022 are for lunar landings with 2 small nuclear vertical engines.\u00A0 There is another variant \u0022Lima\u0022 with aerospike vertical engines with more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Then there is \u0022Papa\u0022 with rocket style landing only with a cocoon of liquid engines and parachutes around it for venusian operations with mega \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Balancing fuel manually and changing one set of vertical engines thrust limiter dynamically are other ways to balance without taking a hit on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should have added that I did try to transfer fuel optimally manually before the summit attempt but control was still marginal at that altitude especially when perched at an angle.\u00A0 This vehicle is duel fuel with hydrogen for the cheat engine and methane for the large jets and panther vertical engines.\u00A0 It does not seem possible to design this vehicle in the way that methane flows evenly.\u00A0 This is because hydrogen fuel has been prioritized over methane because I never want to get \u0022stuck\u0022 in space.\u00A0 So roughly speaking the methane is at the front, the engines are at the back and the hydrogen is evenly distributed along the sides.\u00A0 Because there is so much engine weight at rear a hydrazine \u0022ballast\u0022 would need to be inserted at the nose which would affect the vehicle\u0027s ultimate fuel mass percentage.\u00A0 But I only use ballast on planes if I have to and never on space vehicles because of the aforementioned problem.\u00A0 So unbalanced methane on the nose it is.\u00A0 There is enough time to transfer fuel on the go under \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E control or after an austere STOVL landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me the in-game lighting both at the space center and on vehicles is really weak right now compared to KSP 1 and I did not want to go overboard on the parts as it was around 100 already.\u00A0 The mountain was unrealistically pitch black but I landed anyway.\u00A0 But the real problem was suspension settings causing a bounce and flipover.\u00A0 The save/load system works perfectly for me and with the morning light and brake and suspension and fuel distribution tuning the landing was successfully accomplished on the next try with a little luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would have been better to have an antimatter powered nuclear thermal engine because even with 12000 isp or whatever I only get about 2 hours flying time given that so much fuel weight has been prioritized for hydrogen.\u00A0 I need a good 100000isp or so and about at least 50k \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to really be happy.\u00A0 So the suborbital jumps were necessary unless I wanted to sputter around at 150 mps and then run out of fuel shortly after.\u00A0 I refuse to dedicate more mass to terrestrial usage though!\u00A0 It pains me to think of having to add a bunch of whiplash engines on there just to slow the game down and get a pathetic speed boost compared to the Interstellar engines I am used to working with.\u00A0 The technology we have to work with now is just absolute Oregon Trail trash and it is a miracle that I could accomplish what I did with that mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sylvi Fisthaug","CreatedById":228381,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-14T00:16:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe files of the images broke \u003Cimg
