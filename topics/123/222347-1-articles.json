As the game seems to be playable now. And yes it is. It has some bugs and stuff (Even some bugs that are exactly the same as in KSP1) but now i really having fun! I started a play trough of the Exploration mode. Normaly i cant be bothered with a mission report. I just have fun on my own. But Kapy Rock mission was so challenging and it was fun to fail. Just like the devs hoped for. I think.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here it is: My fist mission report for the kapy Rock mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo i could have just build a plane an fly there. But i would waste most likely 30 real world minutes just flying.\u00A0 Also i don\u0027t want to fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK so i needed several tries to finish this, I would say 15-20 over all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat i tried:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 Directly deorbit above it. -\u0026gt; Cant do it. Its not precise enough. Closes i got was 7km from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Directly deorbit with another 1.Stage to make the last km with a new rocket -\u0026gt; Rocket was not powerful enough. Problems with directions. Cant make manuver node when the game is paused (FeatureRequest!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Deorbit with a plane and fly the rest. -\u0026gt; Problem here is: You need to be at Kappy rock. not moving f\u00FCr 10 sec to do the obersavtions.\u00A0 Not so good in a plane. Otherwise it was ok. I could see it for the first time really close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Like 3 but drive to Kapy Rock with the plane. -\u0026gt; Did not work, Plane design was crap and it kept tipping over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Go for the classic: Rover mission. Deorbit rover, drive there. -\u0026gt; My first design was too top heavy and the wheels where not powerful enougjh for Kerbian Sand dunes. The rover could not go up the sand hills with just 2 wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Drag Racing rover. Deorbit rover. Drive there. -\u0026gt; This time! Mission Success! The rover had 6 Wheels. and 12 Sepratrons as boosters so i could use those 6 times to help climb kerbin sand dunes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis worked! I finally got there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome tips:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best orbit is a 0 degree orbit (Polar orbit) to do this. You want to fly from top to bottom. Orbit at 150km.\u00A0 Periaps to deorbit shoud be 23 km. Anything over 25 will land you in the ocean 20 will land you on the edge of the dessert.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rover needs to have the heaviest part on the bottom. You need at least 3-5 pusches with sepatrons. Otherwise you cant climb the slopes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn autobrake is mission and for no no mod exists so you need to be aware of your brake. Use it in seep slopes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got pics but i cant seem to integrate them into the post. A diredct upload feature here in the forums would be much better. HDD are dirt cheap...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill update this with pics when i figured it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver and out\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-30T16:39:20Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2023 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 30\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by ManuxKerb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-30T18:27:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo show pictures, upload them to a hosting service and then copy the links they provide into your posts here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechieV","CreatedById":229200,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-11T17:09:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224354053\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222347\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221703960871\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/30/2023 at 7:27 PM, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo show pictures, upload them to a hosting service and then copy the links they provide into your posts here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah.
