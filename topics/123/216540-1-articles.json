My goal was to land an unmanned probe safely on the surface of Eve. However, the Kraken had some other ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, as all missions go, and finally found the perfect vessel after three failed attempts. Everything was going perfectly! I got to low Kerbin orbit, I injected for an Eve encounter, and went on my way. I made a distant flyby of the Mun, which served for a little Delta-V savings AND some beautiful pictures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I eventually made it to Eve, I burned retrograde to get into a near 2,000km orbit. After some more pictures, I decided to deorbit the craft and separate it from the previous stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEntry went smoothly, no flipping, no insane G-force, and it was overall just perfect. As the probe broke the cloud layer, the parachutes were deployed, and shortly thereafter, opened up to slow the craft down. It was still about 2500m up when I noticed that we were gonna land in the water. This is where things started going wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought to myself; \u0022Oh, it\u0027ll be fine. The heat shield will keep above the water anyways!\u0022 I would slap my past self for being so foolish. As the craft descended, I cancelled out the time-warp, running at real time. Once I hit the surface of the water, I thought I was done. But, the probe sunk into Eve\u0027s ocean. I was panicking, trying everything I could to stop it, but it wouldn\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, that\u0027s my tale of a curious probe who ended up being 500m below sea level on Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sylvi Fisthaug","CreatedById":228381,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-16T21:31:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat!
