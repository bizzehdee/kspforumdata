No doubt there are things I did not know/understand that could have made this go better, but I had fun despite all the unexpected challenges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, here\u0027s the GPT\u0027d version of my mission to make it more fun, or just skip that and see the steps below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the year 2023, the Kerbal Space Program launched an ambitious lunar mission, with the fearless Bill Kerman at the helm. His mission: to boldly set foot on the moon, a celestial body shrouded in mystery and cheese.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs fate would have it, Bill\u0027s lunar landing was a touch too exuberant. He managed to plant his feet on the moon\u0027s surface but found himself marooned, his trusty spacecraft now a fuel-less hunk of metal. Bill was stranded, but not forgotten. Back at mission control, they hatched a daring rescue plan: send Valentina Kerman, space pilot extraordinaire, to bring Bill home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nValentina rocketed to the moon, her heart set on saving her compatriot. The landing was far from textbook, but she touched down a mere 10 kilometers from Bill. Surely, they thought, a brisk lunar stroll would reunite the two astronauts. The universe, however, had other plans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs Bill lumbered toward Valentina, he and his ship inexplicably fell through the moon\u0027s surface. This was no ordinary lunar quirk; it was a bug, a glitch in the very fabric of space-time! The heroes at mission control sprang into action, tinkering with the JSON save files in a desperate attempt to right this cosmic wrong. Alas, their efforts were in vain. But hope springs eternal in the heart of a Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nA eureka moment: time-warping! By manipulating the flow of time, the moon could be rotated, allowing Bill and his ship to emerge on the surface once more. But their troubles were far from over. Now 42 kilometers apart, the two astronauts faced a grueling journey to reunite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill, the eternal optimist, clambered into his glitched ship and somehow managed to launch it skyward, before landing and shaving 20 kilometers off the distance. He then donned his trusty jetpack and blazed across the lunar surface, only to run out of fuel a mere 5 kilometers from Valentina\u0027s ship. Undeterred, Bill trudged on, dreaming of a hero\u0027s welcome.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUpon reaching Valentina\u0027s ship, a crushing realization set in: her vessel had also fallen prey to the insidious bug, rendering it incapable of returning to Kerbin. Despair loomed large, but the indomitable Kerbal spirit refused to be extinguished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith renewed vigor, they turned once more to the JSON save files. Scouring through lines of code, they found a previous save with Valentina\u0027s ship upright and functional. The moon\u0027s lack of storms and wind couldn\u0027t possibly have toppled the spacecraft - this was a bug, and they were going to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd fix it, they did! Bill boarded the now-upright ship, and together, they rocketed away from the treacherous lunar surface, hearts swelling with relief and triumph. With deft orbital maneuvers, they made their way back to Kerbin, their homecoming heralded by a graceful re-entry and a perfectly timed parachute deployment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the end, Bill and Valentina were saved, their harrowing adventure a testament to the resilience, determination, and ingenuity of the Kerbal spirit. The mission, against all odds, was a resounding success, and their tale of lunar derring-do would be remembered for generations to come.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here\u0027s the actual mission step by step:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nFlew Bill Kerman to the moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nRan out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nSo Bill is stuck there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nSend Valentina Kerman in a bigger rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nValentina arrives and lands about 10km away - not ideal but OK and I\u2019m new to all this so a 10km walk can\u2019t be too bad right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nSwitch control to Bill Kerman.
