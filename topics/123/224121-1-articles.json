The \u0022Lift\u0022 is built to lift anything that fits and balances between the two pylons. I think the rover weighs 1 ton? It was designed to be able to deliver a rover to Duna and return to Duna\u0027s orbit with only the Kerbals onboard. From a previous excursion to Duna (the monument mission) it was decided that Duna should be treated as \u0022Pretending to have an atmosphere\u0022, therefore the lift was designed to land on a \u0022very large moon\u0022. The great thing about this design is that on any smaller moon the rover and lift work in tandem as a really cool biome hopper, and the docking capabilities allow it to refuel with the interplanetary transport vessel waiting in orbit that holds a very large methalox reserve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Duna-Rover-and-Lift-2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.postimg.cc/0y1w2k93/Duna-Rover-and-Lift-2.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis second shot is also from the video and gives a peek of the undercarriage.\u00A0 Blueprint view in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E was my best friend in lining everything up. I really enjoy that feature.\u00A0 The bottoms of the pylons are radial attach points, I think. Something from the prior launch system.

There are three stabilizers alogether- 2 extra small stabilizers symmetrically opposed to the central small stabilizer. The small stabilizer is set to toggle on an action group and is manual only while the other two are set to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E only. It\u0027s a great way to stabilize the rover for long journeys and I\u0027m quite sure I can circumnavigate Ike at 10-15m/s with the design. The thrusters are required to redock on Duna. The tolerances for rolling over are just a little tight, and the gravity a bit too high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Duna-Rover-and-Lift-4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.postimg.cc/130N8ktz/Duna-Rover-and-Lift-4.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommander Tedly and Professor Nedmin are discussing options on where to go next.
