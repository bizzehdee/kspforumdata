Zaltonic is giving out more cash as advance and for completing the contract. They also want more back for failure. Granted the difference is only 1 percent, but it is consistently and exactly that over all three values. As the other rewards are in the single digits, differences that small simply won\u0027t be visible, or they got rounded out entirely. It does seem an awfully small factor though. I do also think that the company traits not getting reflected on the objective rewards is likely worth filing a bug report for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
