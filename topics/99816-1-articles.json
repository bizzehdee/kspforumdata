So many other great threads on this forum but I just can\u0027t figure out this space plane design. I\u0027ve read probably fifty different tutorials and guides on making an SSTO and have used all the methods described in making this plane. But, it just can\u0027t give me a stable lift!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using two RAPIER engines with liquid fuel, and two Attila thrusters which aren\u0027t used until I reach my orbital altitude. The wing design is a little different but I didn\u0027t think there was any problem with it. I monkeyed around with straightening them out with the elevons but didn\u0027t seem to help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane is able to take off from the ground at the end of the ramp but isn\u0027t able to get any lift until it reaches there. As you can see, I am employing the typical weight/thrust ratio needed for a space plane. When I reach the end of the ramp for takeoff it lifts up REALLY quick when I slightly pull back the controls for a little lift. Then, I\u0027m usually able to equalize it but when it get back towards prograde, it starts to ease over to the left or right without any reason. Once it does this, it just starts spinning slowly around and I\u0027m not able to regain control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I doing wrong here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop-view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/534011101588879631/F181D40E0D53143CDD388E888282B6DFB52298FA/\u0022 alt=\u0022F181D40E0D53143CDD388E888282B6DFB52298FA\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see the wheels are aligned well and in front of the elevons (maybe too far?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/534011101588879998/7456EDDBC14549E2961F0B1B76954E4707B36D88/\u0022 alt=\u00227456EDDBC14549E2961F0B1B76954E4707B36D88\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wingspan is larger but seems balanced, and both tilt a little to the front at the ends.

Whatever else may be amiss, you\u0027re definitely lacking leverage - lift in this case comes from the rear elevons angling up to push the back end down. While still on the runway, you\u0027re trying to pivot the plane around the rear wheels by pushing on down on the shorter of two levers - meaning you need more down force than the plane has weight. I\u0027d consider swapping the two forward wings for some active control surfaces, say a pair of canards, tweaked to only operate for pitch. These will directly lift the nose without fighting leverage, and should help get you the control you need.

The likely cause of this is the way you have the wings attached. Wing position has a lot with how the game calculates lift in general, and it assumes that certain wing parts will be aimed certain ways (for example, a Wing Connector A is designed to generate lift if it\u0027s placed with the long end touching the fuselage/adjacent wing; turn in sideways (so it looks like a Wing Connector \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E and it generates \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eno\u003C/span\u003E lift. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose it\u0027s possible that the game is calculating \u003Cem\u003Enegative\u003C/em\u003E lift for the wings...certainly in a quantity enough to overcome the lift that is being generated by the lifting body parts you\u0027re using (such as the Mk2 Cockpit).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T13:33:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFlipping the wing parts 180 degrees won\u0027t matter.

If you turn them 90 degrees you get no lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFailure to take off until you reach the end of the runway is simply because your plane cannot lift its nose to angle its wings. For a tricycle gear like yours, move the main gear closer to the CoM to make it easier to lift the nose, and/or add more pitch control authority whether it\u0027s more or bigger elevons or moving the ones you have further back. Alternatively for any style of landing gear ensure the plane sits on the runway with the wings angled up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYaw instability is because your tail fin is too far forward. At best it\u0027s doing nothing and it might even be destabilising the plane.

Two RAPIERs oughta support up to 26 tonnes of takeoff mass, so I\u0027m guessing that you don\u0027t have enough lift-generating parts on the design for its mass. As a rule you want the sum of the lift coefficients of all your lift-generating parts to be roughly equal to the mass of the craft in tonnes (a 26 tonne craft would need a total combined lift coefficient of 26, the equivalent of 13 Delta Wings; you could get away with a 1:1.15 ratio, which comes out to 12 Deltas, but the 1:1 is easier to remember). I\u0027m also seeing a grand total of two Elevons on that craft and small ones at that...Elevon 1s, I believe. You might not have sufficient pitch authority to bring the nose up.
