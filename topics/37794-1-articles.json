I\u0027ve plugged it in a few times, but it makes planes considerably more complicated to design so I usually get frustrated and uninstall it. Maybe after 0.21 and the ASAS changes I\u0027ll give it another go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an optimal ascent with stock aerodynamics, you want to stay as close to terminal velocity as possible (this isn\u0027t really practical above 15km or so, as the atmo drops off very quickly). You can look up tables on the wiki, or get readouts from Kerbal Engineer (and probably Mechjeb?). In stock, about the cheapest I\u0027ve ever gotten to LKO was around 4200dV (measured using Protractor\u0027s counter), but that was with a light, powerful rocket that was able to accelerate quickly during the gravity turn. Heavier rockets with slightly lower TWR tend to require closer to 4500dV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
