It is currently weapons free but has the room for at least 8 anti capital ship missiles inside a pair of reinforced missile magazines next to the MAC cannon which will be added in the future. The main super structure is made of a large number of independently reinforced dual plated armor sections along with a central truss spine reinforced with two independent truss spines. Engine and fuel tank are both in a reinforced cage armor section with a separate spaced dual plated armor section to protect it from missiles and other such objects that could threaten the ship in general. Reactor is 32 independent reactors mixed with 32 independent large batteries. The ship itself is made more spaced out and from multiple independent sections to minimize the spread of damage. Range must be improved at only 800 to 1000 m/s of delta V but has a huge number of torque generators. Improved edition could exceed 2000 m/s of delta V in the future versions of the heavy frigate.\u003Cp\u003EPrototype Paris Class Heavy Frigate Download: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/9mzsy32p3c5piu9/UNSC%20Paris%20Class%20Heavy%20Frigate.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/9mzsy32p3c5piu9/UNSC%20Paris%20Class%20Heavy%20Frigate.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/v8l6v\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
