But luckily there was an engineer onboard with all necessary tools and an old satellite with lots if small panels on orbit with enough dV for making close approach. So I decided to pick a panel from the sat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now to the main problem: after attaching the panel to my ship it fell apart (F3 menu showed me lots of structural failures on all linkages). I reloaded so many times and the best result I could achieve is to timewarp a few times and then again my ship was broken. Another thing to notice is when I start a timewarp the ship changes its orientation (not too much but more than usually for 1.25m rocket) and sometimes it explodes at the moment I press \u0026gt; button. Sometimes it even fly away from me with tremendous acceleration before I get aboard again. I suspect that it could be a problem with service bay, but before I put a panel everything goes fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the mods I have: KIS, KAC, KER, Docking Port Alignment Indicator, Transfer Window Planner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPD: Just checked that the problem wasn\u0027t in the service bay. Reattached the panel to the sat - the same happened. When I start the timawarp vessel changes its orientation and the attached solar panel appears in space near the craft on a fraction of a second. While tried to make a screenshot of this (timewarp on and off) the ship changed its speed (by about 3 m/s relatively to the target, was something very close to 0).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T12:51:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by orven\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T13:23:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait, KIS is updated but KAS isn\u0027t?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about the winches and stuff?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T13:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DMSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DMSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWait, KIS is updated but KAS isn\u0027t?\u003Cp\u003EWhat about the winches and stuff?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother headcracker...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgflip.com/l8okm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022l8okm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T14:45:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Enceos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Enceos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother headcracker...\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgflip.com/l8okm.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://i.imgflip.com/l8okm.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen that a few times now...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smurfalot","CreatedById":72587,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T15:22:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaiiden\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaiiden\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ein addition to the VNG plugin already mentioned, v2.0 of RealChute is slated to have kerbal parachute packs in it\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe beauty of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25305-1-0-Vanguard-Technologies-EVA-parachutes-still-works\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVNG mod\u003C/a\u003E (with the extra EVA plugin) is that all kerbals have it automatically, you do not have to make the kerbal try to put on the parachute while they are falling to their doom.

But I like the option of \u0022physic\u0022 that it sounds like it would put it on their back and disable RCS. But I can\u0027t figure out how to make that happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second issue I\u0027ve run into, and I don\u0027t know if it is related or a bug. But say for example I have two items with the above settings. I can drag 2 out of inventory and put them on the kerbal, and they both say \u0022carried\u0022. I was under the assumption that carried would be restricted to one item at a time. Now if I attach both of those items to a craft, and then remove one, when I go to remove the second it won\u0027t let me as I am carrying one already. So the carried thing works in that case. But when pulling from KIS inventory I can pull out what seems to be an unlimited number of items that are set carriable = true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I figured out the first question, getting an item onto the kerbal\u0027s back. But the second seems to be a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I set Equipslot = back for 2 items, I can still pull them both out of inventory and onto the kerbal, as if it isn\u0027t checking item slot \u0022back\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I detach one item and put it back on the kerbal and then try to detach the second one, it will tell me the item slot \u0022back\u0022 is in use.
