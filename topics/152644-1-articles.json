Moves super slowly when facing this direction, but as soon as the camera is turned enough to not see the opening of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, no lag at all. No lag in any other aspect of the game, either. Anyone else seeing this problem?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.2, no mods\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
