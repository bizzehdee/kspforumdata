I imported my craft file with the blender 2.8 mu model importer and the texture shows up fine, but when I export it as a .fbx and import into fusion it shows up as white with no texture. I believe this is a blender issue, so I am asking here. So does anyone know how to export the model from blender with the texture?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am using blender 2.8.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-24T05:39:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2018 05:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Nucleartaxi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
