This is Duna, Laythe and Jool. Between these plants, only Kerbin and Laythe provides an interesting opportunity to explore large parts of the planet because of how we are able to use high ISP jet engines to fly around. Understandably Duna (and it\u0027s Mars counterpart) lacks a combustible atmosphere to allow for this, so we are pretty much limited to a small area around the initial landing site (depending on how patient you are to drive even a tenth of the way around the planet). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis at least to me, makes Duna a far less interesting place to explore because you can visit so few places in a single trip. Ion engines are an interesting idea for a solar glider for Duna, but seems to limit your potential solutions for exploration to one path only. This often means that unless you are extra fiddly with the construction of this thing, it will fly very slow, use massive amounts of wing surfaces (which is unwieldy to get into orbit from Kerbin), and most likely won\u0027t hold a Kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if electric propellers are already a planned feature, but in case they are not, there are a lot of very good reasons to have them included into the game. For one thing it is a technology that is simple and has been available to us for the better part of a century. It also has real world applications, going as far as NASA suggesting an electric powered propeller/glider for Mars. Another thing would be that it gives an alternative atmospheric engine to the jet engine, it only needs electricity to function, but is ultimately non-functional in space. It also gives another use for electricity as a resource apart from ion engine usage and being needed to keep probe cores alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho, I am interested in hearing your thoughts on this, even if the idea of electric propellers had been suggested before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T13:08:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think they have been suggested before but I really like the idea of having a couple of sized propellers.
