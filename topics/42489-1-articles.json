The question\u0027s in the title: given that the dynamic pressure on a vehicle is one-half the local atmospheric density times the square of the vehicle\u0027s velocity (i.e. q = 0.5*rho*v^2), how exactly do you calculate the altitude at which that value is maximized?

So, max Q isn\u0027t max drag, but the max ratio of drag compared to the drag coef times the, in this case, mass. Assuming a single rocket stage for simplicity\u0027s sake means that Q is highest later in the stage, when mass of the stage is lower due to propellant loss and velocity is up because of the burn.
