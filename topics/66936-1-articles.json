Corals are pretty brittle. Pieces break off during storms even on parts that are completely submerged. A floating structure would be under all sorts of stress. But maybe if it just barely floats, allowing for larger waves to roll over it, and is stronger than regular coral, maybe? You\u0027d also have to modify how this thing grows. Normal coral grows in tiny corallites, which are usually rings of tiny little calcium disks. (I was unfortunate enough to run into a coral while diving once, and able to study the patterns on my skin for nearly two weeks.) These definitely have the room to hold gas for buoyancy, but you\u0027d have to come up with some very clever modification to prevent gas from escaping.
