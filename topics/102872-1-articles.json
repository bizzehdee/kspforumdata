It could work somewhat like what Crusher described about throttle dictating the \u0027gear\u0027 you are in. Also, another way to do this would be to have 3 settings: high torque, high speed, and mixed mode. High torque would be similar to gear 1-1 on a 21 gear bike. Mixed mode would be like 2-4, and high speed would be like 3-7.
