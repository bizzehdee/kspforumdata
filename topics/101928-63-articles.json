It used to be possible to use it while attached to a Kerbal\u0027s back.\n\nYou can make a sort of \u0022science backpack\u0022. Stuff the desired instruments into a standard container; if desired, use tweakscale to shrink it so it just fits the volume needed. Make sure you bring tools too.\n\nIn the field, carry the container (a smaller one should actually be smaller on your back if you like that), when science is wanted, drop it on the ground as containers practically always survive dropping. Take out instrument needed, attach to container, and use. Make sure to remove it and stow it before picking the container up or it will fall off and probably blow up.\n\nNot as elegant as using direct from inventory but containers make great workbenches and tweakscale actually works great on them, scales the volume and everything. I\u0027ve actually got a number of premade \u0022packages\u0022 using custom sized containers with a selection of essential gear for specific tasks, or even \u0022build it in the field\u0022 kits, like a model rocket kit I made."},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T13:38:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there I chance we could get a variety of KIS containers, like flatter ones that fit well for longer surfaces, and rectangular 1.25m/2.5m/3.75 (and rounded)?\n\nTake a look at the \u0022**Mods using KIS\u0022** in the OP.
