The IAU and the New Horizons Team (the latter of which is running this site), have not really been getting along; the IAU is pretty set on following underworld theme for Pluto (literature for Charon, if I am not mistaken), and the New Horizons people, are having been proposing a bunch of different things unrelatedly. \n\nConsequently, I am pretty skeptical that this is going to get very much on the actual nomenclature for the planet, it just seems rather strange.\n\nAlan Stern has been involved in a somewhat questionable site contrary to the IAU already, confounding [Uwingu](http://www.uwingu.com/), which among other things sell names to Martian Craters, which the [IAU heartily called a scam](http://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1402/) some time ago."},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T16:14:29Z","Content":"I nominated Kzanol, the thrint, from Larry Niven\u0027s World of Ptavvs, \n\n\u003E \n\u003E who left some equipment on Pluto"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T05:47:32Z","Content":"Probably, they will just give the names of all underworld creatures they can remember (Styx, Eridanos, Cerberos, Tartar, all three Hekatonkheires, Anubis, etc, etc).\n\nExcept Gollum.
