You\u0027re good enough flying manually to land somewhere in that area but can\u0027t land immediately adjacent to the Kethane mining station. So you have to move the Kethane from the mining station to wherever the ship needing it happened to land within the overall area. That\u0027s a good use for a rover.\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, it\u0027s about the only practical use for them, other than when exploring Tylo. If you want to visit multiple biomes, it\u0027s FAR FAR safer, quicker, easier, more interesting, and requires WAY less of your personal time, to fly, either atmospherically or suborbitally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrabbing and attaching are functions provided by the KAS mod, but when you use the mod, you can apply those functions to just about any small part. However, in terms of Kethane, KAS does make it easier to connect things together to pump resources around. HOWEVER, KAS still seems to be broken for 0.24 so for the time being, don\u0027t count on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can still use docking ports, however. It\u0027s just that docking things together on ground that it\u0027s perfectly level can be a real pain, especially of the masses of the vehicles involved change due to carrying different amounts of fuel, so their suspensions are at different amounts of flex than when you built the thing. But you can overcome this as well by mounting one of the docking ports on an arm equipped with Infernal Robitics hinges and such, so you can adjust it to fit as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, but the only \u0022real\u0022 supplies / resources given in KSP are (with Kethane mod) Kethane, Liquid Fuel, Oxidizer and other fuels?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS seems to work for me.

Life support adds at least 6, sometimes more depending on the mod. KSP Interstellar has many more. So do Extraplanetary Launchpads and MKS or whatever they call it nowadays. And now there\u0027s Karbonite as well. Seriously, you can have resource panels so big you can\u0027t find what you\u0027re interested in amongst all the others.
