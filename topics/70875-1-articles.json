Any body suspended in space will remain in space until made aware of its situation.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHunter steps off a cliff, expecting further pastureland. He loiters in midair, soliloquizing flippantly, until he chances to look down. At this point, the familiar principle of 32 feet per second per second should take over. However acceleration goes from 0 to terminal speed in nearly an instant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E2. Any body in motion will tend to remain in motion until solid matter intervenes suddenly.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether shot from a cannon or in hot pursuit on foot, cartoon characters are so absolute in their momentum that only a telephone pole or an outsize boulder stops their forward motion absolutely. Sir Isaac Newton called this sudden termination of motion the stooge\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surcease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E3. Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation conforming to its perimeter.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso called the \u0022silhouette of passage\u0022, this phenomenon is the specialty of victims of directed-pressure explosions and of reckless cowards who are so eager to escape that they exit directly through the wall of a house, leaving a cookie-cutout-perfect hole. The threat of skunks or matrimony often catalyzes this reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E4. The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater than or equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the ledge to spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it unbroken.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuccess in safely capturing object is in inverse proportion to the value, weight or fragility of said object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E5. All principles of gravity are negated by fear.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPsychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to propel them directly away from the earth\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface. A spooky noise or an adversary\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s signature sound will induce motion upward, usually to the cradle of a chandelier, a treetop, or the crest of a flagpole. The feet of a character who is running or the wheels of a speeding auto need never touch the ground, especially when in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E6. As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is particularly true of tooth-and-claw fights, in which a character\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s head may be glimpsed emerging from the cloud of altercation at several places simultaneously. This effect is common as well among bodies that are spinning or being throttled. A \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153wacky\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 character has the option of self- replication only at manic high speeds and may ricochet off walls to achieve the velocity required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E7. Certain bodies can pass through solid walls painted to resemble tunnel entrances while others cannot.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis trompe l\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2oeil inconsistency has baffled generations, but at least it is known that whoever paints an entrance on a wall\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface to trick an opponent will be unable to pursue him into this theoretical space. The painter is flattened against the wall when he attempts to follow into the painting. This is ultimately a problem of art, not of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E8. Any violent rearrangement of feline matter is impermanent.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECartoon cats possess even more deaths than the traditional nine lives might comfortably afford. They can be decimated, spliced, splayed, accordion-pleated, spindled, or disassembled, but they cannot be destroyed. After a few moments of blinking self pity, they re-inflate, elongate, snap back, or solidify.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E9. Everything falls faster than an anvil.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorollary: Anvil or other massive objects will slow their downward velocity and move over subject upon notice of said object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E10. For every vengeance there is an equal and opposite re-vengeance.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the one law of animated cartoon motion that also applies to the physical world at large. For that reason, we need the relief of watching it happen to a duck instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E11. A sharp object will always propel a character upward.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen poked (usually in the buttocks) with a sharp object (usually a pin), a character will defy gravity by shooting straight up, with great velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E12. The laws of object permanence are nullified for \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ccool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 characters.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECharacters who are intended to be \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ccool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 can make previously nonexistent objects appear from behind their backs at will. For instance, the Road Runner can materialize signs to express himself without speaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E13. Explosive weapons cannot cause fatal injuries.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey merely turn characters temporarily black and smoky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E14. Sharp object will always travel in a direction as to the most damage.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA knife, meat cleaver, box of nails, etc. will always, regardless how thrown or dropped, will travel sharp side forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E15. Gravity is transmitted by slow-moving waves of large wavelengths.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir operation can be witnessed by observing the behavior of a canine suspended over a large vertical drop. Its feet will begin to fall first, causing its legs to stretch. As the wave reaches its torso, that part will begin to fall, causing the neck to stretch. As the head begins to fall, tension is released and the canine will resume its regular proportions until such time as it strikes the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E16. Dynamite is spontaneously generated in \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CC-spaces\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 (spaces in which cartoon laws hold).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe process is analogous to steady-state theories of the universe which postulated that the tensions involved in maintaining a space would cause the creation of hydrogen from nothing. Dynamite quanta are quite large (stick sized) and unstable (lit). Such quanta are attracted to psychic forces generated by feelings of distress in \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ccool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 characters (see Amendment B, which may be a special case of this law), who are able to use said quanta to their advantage. One may imagine C-spaces where all matter and energy result from primal masses of dynamite exploding. A big bang indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T22:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFavorite off topic post!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Legendary Emu","CreatedById":71911,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T22:47:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHehehheheehe Well done! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-29T19:21:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, I can see my friend in mid-air just there!
