But I want action! Can someone who actually knows how to mod (not my area of expertise) create actual weather systems on the different planets in the Kerbol system? For example Duna, the game\u0027s analogy to Mars, should have massive dust storms that cover the whole planet, with a potential to block visibility and damage bases and vehicles on the surface. Jool should have winds of several thousand kilometers per hour. Venus should have a cloud covering and temperatures hot enough to melt iron.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is already a mod like that, please inform me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T15:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAVP has dust storms on Duna and cloud cover on Eve. Let me correct you for a second. Jool should have much slower winds, seeing as it is far away from Kerbol, not close. *Eve shouldn\u0027t have ship melting temperatures, seeing as it\u0027s only 50 degrees Celsius above boiling point of water.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leoworm","CreatedById":136802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T16:13:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere currently is a mod that adds wind but is aiming on adding a fully-fledged Weather System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96031\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96031\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T16:21:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 04:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Leoworm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
