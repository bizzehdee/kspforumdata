Now I am getting WorldsFirst contracts and cannot clear them or turn them off. I have uninstalled KSP a couple of times now and reinstalled them and I am still getting the same contracts. They show up without me accepting them or anything and with every new career modes. Did I royally screw it up? The only thing I can think is that this setting is in the registry stuck somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Li0n","CreatedById":142527,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T10:20:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you mean the \u0022record\u0022 contract ? Like \u0022Land 100km from KSC\u0022 or \u0022Fly at 300m/s\u0022. If yes I believe it is intended that they appear at each new game. I can see them with Contract Window\u002B at the very start of a career without accepting any contract or tweak the debug menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bpotter599","CreatedById":67735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:57:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes. Those are the contracts I am talking about. I thought it was a bug or something because in the past you had to select each contract. I went ahead and wiped my computer and reinstalled KSP and there they are again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
