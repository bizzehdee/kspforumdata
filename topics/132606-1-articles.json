The game runs fine with low parts count and I\u0027ve been playing sandbox for a very long time (including unexpected disassemblies and whatnots close to KSC).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut meh Q_Q...\u00A0I started a new career mode game and obviously have to start off with very short pocket rockets and early staging. However, when I decouple a stage and that discarded stage hits the ocean or ground, the game locks up ;/. Not sure if this is due to some debris memory leak. Will of course try to play with no staging, but staging is clearly essential to things throughout the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing this is a common issue that had shown up in the past?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am well aware of the 64bit-workaround being frowned upon and\u00A0I may revert to the 32bit version.
