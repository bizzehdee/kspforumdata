Ever wish you could access those options while in IVA or Map View? Don\u0027t feel like setting up action groups for everything? Then **Part Commander** is for you! **Part Commander** consolidates all the right-click menus from parts on the active vessel into a single interface (with the optional ability to \u0022pop off\u0022 selected parts into their own windows if you wish).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
