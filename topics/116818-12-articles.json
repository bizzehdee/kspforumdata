I\u0027ve also checked the persistence file as you asked and found that there were no entries of the module you had mentioned.

Find the vessel location at a certain time (t) and the location of all influencing bodies nearby.\n\n2. Calculate the resultant acceleration from each force  at time (t)\n\n3. Update the orbit based on the change in velocity as a vector.\n\nNow this works perfectly fine in regular 1x game time. However in timewarp this is a different matter all together since in an N-Body scenario a position point in the future can really only be determined by the result of forces acting on a satellite across the entire duration, of course this can be simplified but is still processor intensive.  My current system to manage this works as follows:\n\n1. Determine the UT at which timewarp began. Determine time since this began or since the last update to the system.\n\n2. Define a time interval to sample the vessel across the time since timewarp began. (Since the Orbital Decay mod does everything based on steps of 1 second (for simplicity) this means a time interval at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E full timewarp could be more than 100000 seconds in the future!)\n\n3. Find the velocity vector from the acceleration vector imposed by n number of bodies in the system.\n\n4. Calculate a new orbit prediction from State Vectors of the velocity and position at the current time.\n\n5. Save this orbit to a list and update the time of last update.\n\n6. Update the actual orbit of the vessel to this value when timewarp has ceased.\n\nThe main problem is with point 4. KSP has a function that does just this, called .UpdateFromStateVectors(pos, vel, body, UT). However this automatically updates the actual orbit (thus updating before timewarp has ceased preventing 5. .and 6. from correctly working. What I am working on now is an extension to the orbitdriver.orbit method that will return a new orbit based on the state vectors but not actually set the orbit into \u0027reality\u0027. Which is a real pain!!!\n\nThe conics management has been put on hold until I can get the actual orbit predictions working properly, at which point I will delve into generating orbit lines for \u0027predicted paths\u0027, a rendezvous management system (Disable nbody movement if within 500Km of a vessel maybe), and possibly varying frames of reference - yay pretty pictures!\n\nIn the meantime I would be grateful if anyone could help out at the Github page, looking over some code offering suggestions, pull requests are all welcome!\n\nWhitecat106 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"leudaimon","CreatedById":153781,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-23T23:38:00Z","Content":"[@Whitecat106](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/140086-whitecat106/) Really nice mod!\n\nAs per requested by a message in game, I\u0027m submitting the Lat/Long and body because of a MasCon issue: 0\u00B031\u002716\u0027\u0027 N, 82\u00B051\u002715\u0027\u0027E, on a GEO orbit.\n\nIn a sidenote, to install RVE, just follow these instructions: [https://github.com/Pingopete/RVE-KSP-1.0.4/blob/Linux64/Readme.txt](https://github.com/Pingopete/RVE-KSP-1.0.4/blob/Linux64/Readme.txt)\n\nEdit: Also, there is some further problem with RN\u0027s US probes and this mod.
