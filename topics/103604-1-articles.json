KER also provides this information. Generally you\u0027ll only really need/want to type in delta-V values when setting up a transfer; one trick you can use to get around the widget\u0027s limitations is to set one axis of the burn first and then set the other axis to increase the burn magnitude to where it needs to be. KSP now remembers what orbit the node was on when you drag it around the orbit so adjusting times is no longer a tedious exercise in constantly adjusting orbits.\n\nAbout the only thE: only thing KSP needs for the node gizmo is refined fine-tuning of the node and more information.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T16:32:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 04:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex**"},{"CreatedByName":"wnderer","CreatedById":102068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T15:11:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Obligatory \u0022there\u0027s a mod for that\u0022: [PreciseNode](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-0-23-5-PreciseNode-0-12-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes)\n\u003E I would also love for this functionality to be in the stock game.
