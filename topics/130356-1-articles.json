You can land on the sea as fast as the crash tolerance of whatever hits the sea first is. The faster you hit the more drag is produced. As long as when the next part hits the water, you are then traveling below that parts crash tolerance, everything is still fine. You have various levels. Structural/cargo/passenger/plane parts between 50 and 80, (The Mk3 engine mount is a fav of mine) then everything else falls between about 6 and 20.
