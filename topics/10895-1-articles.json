You can also re-balance with weight, by moving existing engines around or adding extra fuel tanks or structural pieces. If it\\\u0027s too heavy, add some more wings -- the Delta Wings are the best, and ALWAYS make sure you have enough control surfaces to ensure maneuverability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\\\u0027s too hard to pitch up or down or perform a roll, add more horizontal control surfaces -- ailerons/elevators -- and if it\\\u0027s too hard to turn left/right (yaw), add vertical control surfaces (rudders).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T08:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have canards get rid of them.

It turns beautifully this way (or at least, the plane I\\\u0027ve tried all this on works well this way). The plane I use is quite heavy, with three sets of wings AND a makeshift tailplane, and five engines. It still manages to land when all the fuel\\\u0027s run out and the engines are dead, though. Gracefully, to boot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will make one more recommendation. SAS (Avionics Package) to keep you stable on the runway, turn it off to actually get in the air, then re-enable it to get you to a good \u0027safe\u0027 altitude, where there\\\u0027s room for mistakes. Keep SAS on constantly when in the upper atmosphere (rarefied air makes it harder to control the plane; you\\\u0027ll need a lot of assistance), and you can use it either on or off for landing; it seems to work pretty well both ways, though I prefer to land without it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T18:33:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVexx, can you post a craft file if it\\\u0027s stock?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T22:05:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I\\\u0027ll just post a link to the thread in the Spacecraft Exchange, since I already made a thread there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying instructions are included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12528.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12528.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T11:19:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve cfg-edited in a copy of the Basic Jet that has no thrust vectoring, and it does seem to improve the situation slightly.
