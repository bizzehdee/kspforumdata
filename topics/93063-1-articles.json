I have done a ton of different missions and for most of them I get 0 XP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that my pilot got 2 XP for \u0022orbit around Kerbin\u0022 and he and my scientist got 1 XP for \u0022flight in Kerbin\u0022, but I have done all sorts of different missions on and around Kerbin and neither of these guys has gained any more XP than that. The scientist was present for an orbit and did some science up there, but apparently that didn\u0027t count as he came back with 0 XP gained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume that it works like science from biomes, you can only get so much from one place before you have to move on. Has anyone figured out what kind of milestones you need to achieve to gain XP for each of the three Kerbal classes? Is there more that I could do on Kerbin that I am missing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for the Engineers, is there anything they can do other than repairs and repacking chutes? If you fly well enough you won\u0027t take any damage.

You can get XP for flight, flyby, orbit, landing, and planting a flag for each celestial body. Kerbin is a bit more restrictive (I think just flight, orbit, and flyby). And as you say, you must continue to give your kerbals new experiences. You can\u0027t just send the same guy up on 20 local Kerbin flights to level him up. You can, however, send 20 different kerbals up on local flights and they will each earn their 1xp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, each kerbal can only gain experience for category per celestial body, per flight (but can earn from multiple bodies per flight). So plan accordingly. Engineers, scientists, and pilots all earn XP the same way. So no, you won\u0027t need to break things to earn your engineer XP. Just take him on some flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your scientist went on an orbital flight and didn\u0027t get any XP, then that might be a bug. You can hover over the kerbal names in your astronaut complex roster and it\u0027ll tell you what they have logged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T18:58:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does this work when you take more than one Kerbal on a mission?
