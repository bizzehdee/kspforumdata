Keep my mods updated through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E. All of sudden after some updates, I\u0027m getting some crashes to desktop with no message or warning. Weird, I can load a Blue Dog save and play a Apollo mission all the way through with no issues. But, If I try to load other non-Blue Dog saves, I get instant kick to desktop. If I try to build a new craft from scratch, I get a way into building it, and again same crash to desktop. This is freaking me out over here and just been happening since yesterday! Here\u0027s my log maybe for someone (who knows a lot more than me) can look at it to help me out. Thanks. A side note. I saved a copy of this game to a different location a couple of weeks ago (before I installed the BDB mod and B9 part switch, and before a few other mods were updated). I can go into that copy and load those saves I couldn\u0027t load in this one and play them just fine and also build new crafts just fine.

I think when I installed the Blue Dog mod and it\u0027s dependencies and then\u00A0 updated some other mods, this problem began. Now in that one (the one I have on Steam) will only play Blue Dog Apollo mission but apparently everything else I try to do with it crashes to desktop. I have another copy of\u00A0 1.3.1 that I use just to play\u00A0 FASA Apollo Moon missions (as the FASA mod is not compatible with 1.4.3), and it plays flawlessly. I also have another copy of 1.4.3 before I had installed Blue Dog and it plays everything I throw at it fine. So right now I have three favorite craft I fly and have to use a different copies of KSP to play each one. I think in the Steam copy, I got some corrupted stuff going on. I was hoping someone could make some sense out of the log I posted that might tell me what I need to change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-10T10:26:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2018 10:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by MikeO89\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tonimark","CreatedById":187967,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-11T17:31:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni have seen the same bug too i have posted a suddenly closes thread check it out\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
