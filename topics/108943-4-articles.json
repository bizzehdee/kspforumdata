I responded that it could only do that when expendable, and with a upper stage, so it was cheating. It was not supposed to be reusable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what you propose would basically be a reusable SLS with a hypergol upper stage. BTW, Hypergols are not cheap anymore due to enivronmental and handling costs. And any design that needs NTRs is a unrealistic dream. I know KSPers love NTR, but still...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday, you\u0027d just use a SLS w/o upper stage (IUS would be used for MEO, GEO, and planetary robotic missions, while Exploration Upper Stage is used for manned lunar and asteroid missions.) with 2x F-1C Dynetics-esque boosters. These would land vertically via smaller landing engines (which can also serve as booster verniers). The SSMEs would be reused Vulcan-style, with helicopter recovery, while the core would be expendable. Even then, since Dynetics \u002B SLS Block I could launch 120T to LEO, you would have a lot of payload capacity left over. So much, you might be able to just put a massive inflatable heat shield on the core, then return both the tanks and the engines via parafoil and horizontal landing on a runway. The deorbit burn would be done by disposable small solid motors. The boosters can\u0027t be reused like this since you would need jet engines to do so, and those would increase the complexity enormously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, fuel tanks are about 45% of cost (excluding avionics).

It\u00A0fits into the main body and is equipped with multiple high-thrust hypergolic engines which also act as the OMS and RCS system. These\u00A0allow the crew cabin to eject during launch abort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor crew transfer only, the payload bay is fitted with an additional internal tank and a\u00A0disposable strap-on tank, allowing SSTO with the loss of the external tank alone. For unmanned flights, the crew cabin module is replaced with an autonomous control module with an auxiliary fuel tank but the same hypergolic engines. For manned flights including payload, or for higher-dV unmanned\u00A0missions, 2-4 strap-on FH-style boosters are attached with propellant crossfeed; these detach at fairly low speed to return autonomously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe-entry will be...exciting. The aerospike already has to be able to handle very high heat fluxes and will probably already be actively cooled, so the orbiter enters tail-first and upside down to burn off most of its speed, with active use of the RCS system for stabilization. As soon as enough speed has dropped off, the orbiter begins to rotate forward, exposing more and more of its underside. The lower\u00A0speed at this point means that the heat shield on its underside can be constructed of a lightweight, non-ablative, lower-performing, highly reusable material rather than requiring the tiles that the Shuttle used. Active RCS stabilization continues as speed decreases, ultimately entering a low-L/D gliding flight:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022re_entry_profile.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s28.postimg.org/ukh4pqsel/re_entry_profile.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orbiter does not make a very good glider and cannot manage a level approach, which is all the better because it doesn\u0027t have heavy landing gear. Instead, the RCS system returns the craft to a high angle of attack, and the aerospike engines are ignited, killing terminal velocity in a near-suicide burn. Then, the RCS system reduces power, allowing the angle of attack to drop until the orbiter is horizontal, and both the RCS system and the aerospike engines in combination fire to lower the orbiter to the ground:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Landing_approach.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s29.postimg.org/v3zopba8n/Landing_approach.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the aerospike cannot be directed downward enough to execute such a landing, then additional RCS thrusters can be incorporated in the aft portion of the orbiter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmbitious? Perhaps...but it seems like the best possible combination of geometry to allow for the capabilities of the shuttle with next-generation technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe amount of hypergolic fuel, internal fuel, and the\u00A0number of strap-on boosters can be adapted to each mission. By using in-orbit staging and/or refueling, the orbiter could easily manage a lunar transfer. Depending on the fuel capacity of the crew cabin, it could manage a landing on its own on hypergolics, or lunar-orbit refueling could allow the entire orbiter to make the descent to the lunar surface and return to refuel and make the transfer to LEO again. The ability to take off and land vertically in a horizontal attitude reduces the instabilities and risks of vertical landings and allows far simpler crew egress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-09T21:48:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2016 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by sevenperforce\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Emperor of the Titan Squid","CreatedById":158183,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-09T21:44:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say that we make the first stage tanks built in and reusable, winged or Saturn shuttle style.Baikal boosters, falcon style upper stage.

It\u00A0fits into the main body and is equipped with multiple high-thrust hypergolic engines which also act as the OMS and RCS system. These\u00A0allow the crew cabin to eject during launch abort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor crew transfer only, the payload bay is fitted with an additional internal tank and a\u00A0disposable strap-on tank, allowing SSTO with the loss of the external tank alone. For unmanned flights, the crew cabin module is replaced with an autonomous control module with an auxiliary fuel tank but the same hypergolic engines. For manned flights including payload, or for higher-dV unmanned\u00A0missions, 2-4 strap-on FH-style boosters are attached with propellant crossfeed; these detach at fairly low speed to return autonomously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe-entry will be...exciting. The aerospike already has to be able to handle very high heat fluxes and will probably already be actively cooled, so the orbiter enters tail-first and upside down to burn off most of its speed, with active use of the RCS system for stabilization. As soon as enough speed has dropped off, the orbiter begins to rotate forward, exposing more and more of its underside. The lower\u00A0speed at this point means that the heat shield on its underside can be constructed of a lightweight, non-ablative, lower-performing, highly reusable material rather than requiring the tiles that the Shuttle used. Active RCS stabilization continues as speed decreases, ultimately entering a low-L/D gliding flight:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022re_entry_profile.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s28.postimg.org/ukh4pqsel/re_entry_profile.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orbiter does not make a very good glider and cannot manage a level approach, which is all the better because it doesn\u0027t have heavy landing gear. Instead, the RCS system returns the craft to a high angle of attack, and the aerospike engines are ignited, killing terminal velocity in a near-suicide burn. Then, the RCS system reduces power, allowing the angle of attack to drop until the orbiter is horizontal, and both the RCS system and the aerospike engines in combination fire to lower the orbiter to the ground:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Landing_approach.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s29.postimg.org/v3zopba8n/Landing_approach.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the aerospike cannot be directed downward enough to execute such a landing, then additional RCS thrusters can be incorporated in the aft portion of the orbiter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmbitious? Perhaps...but it seems like the best possible combination of geometry to allow for the capabilities of the shuttle with next-generation technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe amount of hypergolic fuel, internal fuel, and the\u00A0number of strap-on boosters can be adapted to each mission. By using in-orbit staging and/or refueling, the orbiter could easily manage a lunar transfer. Depending on the fuel capacity of the crew cabin, it could manage a landing on its own on hypergolics, or lunar-orbit refueling could allow the entire orbiter to make the descent to the lunar surface and return to refuel and make the transfer to LEO again.

Yes, wings are wasteful but my\u00A0goal isn\u0027t to be the most efficient, but to have the highest safety and lowest operating costs. Half a dozen astronauts and their gear don\u0027t mass very much, and being able to land either under power or with a shuttle-style glide is one heck of a safety feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor vertical launch systems, the 2016 version of Falcon 9 gets impressively close to qualifying. They\u0027re already assembled horizontally in a hangar, and have pretty simple support requirements, so no trouble there. But it isn\u0027t reusable enough yet. I\u0027d want to see 2nd stages recovered and reused, and we\u0027d have to do something about that trunk. Musk\u0027s said their internal analysis concluded recovering the 2nd stage was possible but not economically practical right now, so maybe the next generation.

If I remember correctly. Although those numbers are based on a Falcon Heavy comprising three Falcon 9v1.1 boosters rather then the larger, enhanced Full Thrust version. And whether the boosters are reused or not also factors in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOdd, it does, although I had never seen those before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI chose that shape because I\u00A0wanted to maximize internal volume and re-entry cross-section but also maintain a small ascent cross-section to avoid excessive drag and aerodynamic loading. I also wanted the option of a crew module with the same basic shape for launch abort reasons. I need to run the numbers to see how close to SSTO this would get in its various configurations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I mentioned above that the RCS/OMS system is based on a hypergolic SuperDraco-style engine. You\u0027re right, though; linear aerospike engines can be used quite easily for pitch control during ascent but a horizontally-oriented vertical landing\u00A0would probably be asking too much. And gimballing conventional engines by 90 degrees is out of the question. I am just wary of the weight cost of adding more thrusters for landing alone. I have a design knocking around in my head that would allow the ascent engines to be used for horizontally-oriented takeoff and landing, which is pretty much the ultimate spaceship fantasy, but it is air-augmented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeh. I\u0027ll run the numbers on that too, just for kicks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing a HLV for crew transport is a pretty big waste, I agree, but using completely separate systems instead of\u00A0recombining components to fit each individual mission is a big waste as well. That\u0027s why I rather like the idea of a cargo shuttle\u00A0with a removable crew module, so it can take crew up SSTO by putting an internal tank in its payload bay OR\u00A0be configured for heavy lift by swapping out the crew module for additional tankage and slapping on some reusable boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 53T numbers are for disposable FH, that\u0027s why it\u0027s so high.
