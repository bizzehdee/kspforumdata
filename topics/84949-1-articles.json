When I turn on rcs and use lateral or attitude controls, they dont fire, no fuel gets used. I\u0027ve tried using stretchy tanks with HTP (With RCS set to HTP) and a few other RCS props, attached to a fuel tank with said RCS fuel, and a command pod with a kerbal in it. I don\u0027t know what to do. I\u0027ve tried the regular RCS tanks, regular tanks with RCS fuel, stretchy tanks set to RCS cnofiguration with the appropriate RCS fuel, command pod with RCS thrusters and a little hydrazine/HTP inside and probably a few things I forgot but to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-19T17:46:33Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2014 05:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SanderB\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-19T08:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I don\u0027t think this the appropriate forum section for this question (\u0022support - modded installs\u0022 would probably be better suited, or better yet, you could follow the instructions in the OP of the Realism Overhaul thread), let me try and help: First of all, double-check that you have moduleRCSFX in your gamedata folder.
