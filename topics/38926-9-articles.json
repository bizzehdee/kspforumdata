The large quantity of accessable kethane discovered on Laythe has de-emphasized the need for orbital stations at either Bop or Pol. The first and most important decision is that the exploration of the Jool system will be headquartered from a single orbital station at Laythe. The fact that MASEC wants to get started as soon as possible, combined with the fact that not all of the desired technology is available yet, and only so many vehicles can be sent to Jool at one transfer window, mean that operations at Jool will be built up in phases. The first phase will take with it mostly existing technology, and operations will be expanded later when newer technologies and techniques become available. At the moment, the first two phases are more or less planned out, and should take place over the next two transfer windows to Jool if possible. There will be also be a series of Osiris Development Missions, or ODMs, to develop the technology and techniques used at Laythe and elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EProject Osiris, Phase 1\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUKS Laythe Station\u003C/strong\u003E: An orbital space station, similar in design to but slightly larger than Kerbin Station, to be placed in a circular orbit at Laythe\u0027s equator. It will contain enough habitable space for between 12 and 16 Kerbals, and will include a kethane refining and fuel storage module, but probably not kethane storage. All operations in the Jool system will be based from here. The decision to use one large orbital station is designed to keep the teams in close contact with each other at all times, rather than spread out over two or more orbital bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Aten IEV\u003C/strong\u003E: Just returned from Duna, this vehicle is currently docked to UKS Kerbin Station, but will be returned to service for the mission to Jool. Once there it will be the primary means of getting about the Jool system, including pushing around the various landers that will be developed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFlying Fox SSTO Spaceplane\u003C/strong\u003E: Formerly known as the Horus SSTO Spaceplane, Flying Fox is being transferred to Project Osiris. The discovery that Laythe\u0027s atmosphere will support jet engines means that this SSTO will hopefully become the primary means of exploring Laythe\u0027s various islands. There will likely be two of them taken during Phase 1, for redundancy. While Flying Fox has been throughly flight tested in the Kerbin system, no attention has been paid yet to how it handles as a rover on the surface, so at least one ODM will be dedicated to trying this out on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAn Anubis-based Lander\u003C/strong\u003E: The performance of the Flying Fox in the Laythe atmosphere is still unknown. Rocket landing and ascent is, however, well understood, even in atmospheres, such as Project Anubis\u0027 landing on Duna. This vehicle will be similar to the Anubis lander and will carry a Fennec rover underneath. It will however be designed to be reuseable, and therefore a single stage, capable of landing on Laythe and returning to orbit. This vehicle does not yet exist and the first ODMs will be to design and test it, but this should progress quickly as it\u0027s largely based on existing technology. While the long-term plan is to get down to, and up from Laythe using SSTO aircraft only (because they are easy to precision land), a reliable rocket-based vehicle is desired in case an aircraft breaks down and a crew requires rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENAMLARV/Fennec\u003C/strong\u003E: The tried and proven Mun lander/rover combination. Calculations have determined that NAMLARV/Fennec is capable of landing on Vall without modifications. Fennec should also handle fairly well on Bop, which is similar to Minmus in terms of gravity. It may not handle well on Pol, however, and while NAMLARV is overpowered for both Bop and Pol, this is seen as acceptable over the alternative of designing a whole new lander for those moons. NAMLARV will be important in finding landing sites for kethane production, since nobody\u0027s seen the surface of Bop or Pol up close yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAn Amphion-based Kethane Extraction and Recovery Vehicle, and a dedicated Heavy Nuclear Tug\u003C/strong\u003E: An upgrade to the existing Amphion in service at Minmus. That vehicle only has to shuttle from Minmus Station to the surface and back. In this case, the base will be at Laythe, so the new Amphion will be partnered with an unmanned heavy tug, based on the existing Hercules MkII, which will ferry it to Bop or Pol, and remain in orbit while Amphion goes to the surface. Once Amphion and its load of Kethane return, it will then push it back to Laythe. Since Phase 1 does not involve the use of Laythe\u0027s kethane (or any permanent structures on Laythe yet), this will be the primary source of fuel until Phase 2. The new Amphion will be more aggressively designed with a higher capacity than the current one, using Bop as the design constraint. This will enable both Bop and Pol to be used for Kethane, instead of having to choose one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EPlanned for Phase 2\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELaythe Surface Base\u003C/strong\u003E: This will be a technological challenge. MASEC will have to design and build a surface base capable of supporting 6-8 Kerbals on the surface of Laythe, and design a way to deliver it to a specific point (to be determined later) on Laythe\u0027s surface. Once in place, this will serve as a base of operations for Laythe exploration, rather than relying on expeditions dropped from orbit. While orbital stations are often modular in design, the surface base will probably be one large piece assembled on Kerbin and launched at once. The base will be on the Jool facing side of Laythe, and preferably on or close to the equator. Proximity to kethane will be considered, but isn\u0027t critical. The development for this will include dropping a similar base from Kerbin orbit onto a remote location, probably on the south polar ice cap, and train Kerbals in living in a hostile environment for long periods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMore Fennecs\u003C/strong\u003E: At least a pair of dedicated Fennec rovers will be dropped onto Laythe to support the surface base. Idealy the surface base will be on one of the larger islands, and this will allow exploration near the base location without using the Flying Fox. Plus they\u0027re handy to have around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELaythe Kethane Wells\u003C/strong\u003E: Unmanned, solar powered kethane drilling wells on one or more of the accessible kethane reservoirs. They\u0027ll contain drills and converters, with minimal tankage. Preferably located in flat areas where aircraft can easily land. These need to be reasonably precisely landed, and will all be away from the equator, so delivery methods are still being considered. This will permit surface operations on Laythe to be self sustaining and independent from space operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHorus Space Shuttle\u003C/strong\u003E: Once Flying Fox verifies that flight in Laythe\u0027s atmosphere is fairly straightforward, the window will be open to deploy the Shuttle there. The Shuttle will serve two functions, idealy. One will be crew rotations between the surface base and the orbital station, replacing rocket based transportation. The other will be transporting fuel from the remote kethane wells to the base, acting as a refueling vehicle/fuel storage for the Flying Foxes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENAMLARV Heavy\u003C/strong\u003E: A much bigger, more powerful NAMLARV lander (with Fennec, of course) capable of landing and returning from the surface of Tylo. Analysis of the size of Tylo and its gravity indicate that a minimum of 6.5km/s of delta-v plus significant thrust would be required to do this with a reusable vehicle. Such a vehicle could in theory get to orbit from Kerbin in all one stage, something that\u0027s never been done with rocket based vehicles to date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 2 is still subject to change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EOther MASEC Business\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a look at what else MASEC has its eyes on for the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMore RAMSES\u003C/strong\u003E: The next interplanetary transfer window is to Dres, and there will be a RAMSES probe sent there. Not long after that, another window to Eve will open, and a pair of RAMSES probes will be sent that way as well, one to retire the IKSS in orbit around Eve, and the other to orbit Gilly after the failure of IKSS Gilly to get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProject Anubis\u003C/strong\u003E: This project isn\u0027t over. It will remain in existence at a low level. There are long term plans for a permanent outpost at Duna, which fall under the jurisdiction of this project. Current ideas include a \u0022base on wheels\u0022 to avoid being tied to a specific location, coupled with an orbital base and a rocket-based crew transfer vehicle. This will also include kethane extraction from Ike, but that will require a redesigned Amphion KERV since Ike is a large moon. Mobile base testing may occur on Mun, but this remains to be seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExploration of Moho\u003C/strong\u003E: After the discovery of the hole in Moho\u0027s north pole, interest has been expressed in sending probes there. Manned exploration is also possible, probably in a mission intended to return, since there is not yet any desire to establish a permanent outpost at Moho due to high delta-V requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExploration of Eve\u003C/strong\u003E: There\u0027s a rover on the surface of Eve. It\u0027s still active, though we\u0027ve not heard from it here in a while. Eve is a difficult place to explore owing to the thick atmosphere and high gravity, and this has thus far discouraged any plans for manned exploration there. A manned landing on Gilly would be easy, but at present isn\u0027t interesting enough to warrant serious attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStay tuned.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-13T03:49:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2014 03:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cashen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"macdjord","CreatedById":5630,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-10T20:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA couple other things you might want to consider:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESome sort of boat or seaplane for Laythe, both for oceanic research and as a rescue option in case a misplaced rocket landing landing or an aircraft accident lands a kerbal in the drink\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERather than make a monster 6.5km/s reusable Tylo lander, build one with half that delta-v and give it a small Kethane converter and drill.

Anubis relied on two huge main parachutes to descend, but Osiris\u0027 original design is three smaller radial ones, plus four drogues. It turns out that\u0027s not enough, and the descent only slows to about 20 m/s, forcing the engines to fire to try to save the landing. But this starts to go wrong, as Osirus starts to move sideways (as can be seen with the angle of the parachutes), and comes down too hard and with too much sideways velocity. It crashes.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://howling-coyote.org/ksp/UKSMASEC/Osirus01/10.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe aftermath. Osiris landed hard and moving sideways and was not totally vertical. The engines were still firing. One of the outboard pylons broke away and with no ability to shut that engine off after it broke free, that booster took off, and crashed and exploded some distance away. One of the other engines, visible laying on the ground nearby, broke loose. The asymmetric thrust tipped the whole vehicle over (at this point the engines were turned off). One of the other pylons then broke loose and rolled off to the side. Surprisingly, Fennec is undamaged and the crew compartment is fine. The crash would have been survivable for any crew on board but Osiris itself is a writeoff.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission is a failure, but the solution is simple. More parachutes. Anubis only needed two drogue chutes, so there\u0027s no reason Osiris needs four - two of them will be replaced with main chutes. More radial chutes will be added as well. Osiris is supposed to land unpowered to save fuel, using Laythe\u0027s thicker atmosphere and parachutes to land with. The next flight of Osiris is scheduled to be a manned landing test, and MASEC is confident it will be ready and the parachute issue will be resolved by then.

The current plans would require it to land on Laythe with all the fuel and oxidizer it needs to return with, which will limit its effectiveness as a rover due to weight, and consume more fuel in the air for the same reason. Once kethane production starts on the surface this isn\u0027t an issue, but during Phase 1, I suggested they design a simple unmaned rocked-based refueling vehicle, that can carry extra fuel and oxidizer for the Foxes to make them more effective on the surface.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a good idea.

Let\u0027s have a look:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://howling-coyote.org/ksp/UKSMASEC/Osirus03/01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002201.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESubtle changes. First, the forward canards were moved back slightly to make more room for the co-pilot/passenger to climb down his ladder. Second, smaller RCS quads were used, and while they have less power, they save a little weight. Their smaller size increases the clearance. The biggest change is switching to landing gear provided by B9 Aerospace, instead of the in-house designs, which reduces weight. Also, a receiver module was added to allow the Fox to integrate into the topographical mapping data. A forward facing light was added just behind the camera, as well. The changes shed about 1,200kg of weight from the Fox in all, a fairly substantial weight savings.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the real reason we\u0027re here is to test a brand new vehicle, the Osiris Unmanned Refueling Vehicle, or URV. This vehicle will be a temporary stop-gap to supplying the Flying Foxes with fuel during Phase 1 on Laythe, when the surface infrastructure isn\u0027t in place yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://howling-coyote.org/ksp/UKSMASEC/Osirus03/02.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002202.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis is what the vehicle looks like. The outboard tanks carry cargo fuel. The two white tanks carry fuel and oxidizer, with enough capacity to totally refuel a Flying Fox from empty and allow it to get back into orbit. The four grey tanks carry only jet fuel, and each can fully refuel the Fox\u0027s jet fuel tanks. Normal procedure will be for this vehicle to drop onto Laythe from orbit full on liquid fuel but with the cargo oxidizer tanks empty. The Flying Fox will then come in either fully tanked, or with a small amount of fuel and full oxidizer. It\u0027ll then store its oxidizer temporarily in the URV, and explore Laythe using the available jet fuel. When time comes to return to orbit, the Fox will pick up its oxidizer and fly away. The main core tank of the URV is its own internal fuel supply that it needs to get back into orbit with. However, with its cargo tanks full, the URV cannot get back into orbit, nor does it even have a thrust to weight ratio above 1. Only when its cargo of fuel is used up, will it then be able to ascend into Laythe orbit to pick up more fuel. Until Phase 2, this vehicle MUST be on the surface, for safety reasons, if the Flying Foxes are doing expeditions.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Outline \u0026amp; Objectives\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFirst flight of the Osiris Unmanned Refueling Vehicle (URV)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELaunch into low Kerbin orbit and dock to UKS Kerbin Station to take on a full load of fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDe-orbit, re-enter, and perform a precision landing on KSC property.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDrive an un-fueled Flying Fox to the URV\u0027s landing site and test fuel transfer abilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://howling-coyote.org/ksp/UKSMASEC/Osirus03/03.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002203.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe URV launches just like the lander did, atop a large SRB.

It then undocks and turns around 180 degrees to orient itself properly for Amphion to dock to it. The two craft are weight optimized for their specific roles. The tug for example has no batteries, or many solar panels. Since the lander requires a lot of power for the drills, it contains the solar panels and batteries, and will provide the electrical power for the tug when combined. However, the lander has no RCS fuel, since the tug is envisioned as being the active participant in docking. This means the weight of the monopropellant doesn\u0027t need to be carried down to Minmus and back up.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://howling-coyote.org/ksp/UKSMASEC/Osirus04/05.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002205.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe next morning, we see the unmanned launch of Amphion MKII.

To replace that would require 26,786 L of Kethane, leaving 93,214L or 77.7% of the batch for use. This is a kind of efficiency rating or \u0022profit margin\u0022 so to speak, and is considered quite good. No figure exists for the existing Amphion/Zethus combination from Minmus to Kerbin, but you can bet eventually one will be determined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the vessel return to Kerbin Station with about 500 m/s of delta-V remaining. The ejection to Minmus takes about 900 m/s or so, and the return about 300 m/s. A transfer to Bop or Pol would probably consumed between 1100 and 1300 m/s and the return about 500 m/s. Long story short, a margin of 500 m/s in this case is not enough. So, this tug is not good enough. There were some other issues with it as well, including the engine pods flexing during engine firing, and the lack of tug battery capacity, which makes docking at \u0022night\u0022 effectively impossible. So, this tug will not go to Jool in this capacity. The fix is easy though - a battery, some more solar panels, and slightly larger outboard fuel tanks will be more than enough to do the job. Another test flight shouldn\u0027t be necessary. The existing tug of course has nuclear engines and can\u0027t just be de-orbited. It\u0027s also an expensive piece of hardware. It can be put to good use, though - as a normal tug, it will probably ferry some pieces of UKS Laythe Station, alongside one of the larger Hercules MkIIs still in orbit left over from Mun Station\u0027s construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeweny Kerman: \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://howling-coyote.org/ksp/UKSMASEC/Ribbons/016.png\u0022 alt=\u0022016.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://howling-coyote.org/ksp/UKSMASEC/Ribbons/022.png\u0022 alt=\u0022022.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelgard Kerman: \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://howling-coyote.org/ksp/UKSMASEC/Ribbons/017.png\u0022 alt=\u0022017.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-13T03:43:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2014 03:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cashen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
