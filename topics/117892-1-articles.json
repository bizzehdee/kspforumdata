It isn\u0027t in a useable state!** ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\nFor that reason I\u0027d like to ask for help.\n\nThe behavior of the boots are very glitchy. The Kerbal sometimes gets stuck in the walk animation. On parts with complex shapes he\u0027ll tumble all over the place and can\u0027t get out of the ragdoll state if you don\u0027t toggle the boots off for a moment. Also he rotates foot-to-planet instead of foot-to-part.\n\nI\u0027ll greatly appreciate it if someone can help me fix this. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nYou can grab the sources from here: [https://github.com/Aqua-KSP/MagneticEVA](https://github.com/Aqua-KSP/MagneticEVA)\n\nEdit: Compiled dll is now also available in the /bin/debug directory for quick tests.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T13:57:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 01:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by \\*Aqua\\***"},{"CreatedByName":"skykooler","CreatedById":60459,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T00:20:25Z","Content":"Cool!

My suggestion would be to at least get the first part of the features working (that is, reproducing the effects of the sea-sickness cure mod which isn\u0027t actually available anymore from what I can tell) and work on the rest later."},{"CreatedByName":"Mrprawnstar","CreatedById":151521,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T09:06:39Z","Content":"Aqua if you get this to work I will name a kid after you.
