I don\u0027t see the problem with having to unlock empty nodes - it\u0027s just intermediate R\u0026amp;D needed before something can be viable - the capacitance multitouch screen pretty much only existed in R\u0026amp;D form until it was combined with a bunch of other technology to make the modern smartphone viable. Happens all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the right solution might be #4: changes to MM that can parse the parts list after first pass, and attach a parts list to each node and put that in the techtree cache. That way you could have (admittedly often huge and convoluted) selectors that could check for parts in a given node, as well as any subsequent nodes in the tree, and then hide or unhide as appropriate.
