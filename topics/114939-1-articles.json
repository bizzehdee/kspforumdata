When I reached the Mun, transferred my 2nd pilot to the lander, and undocked it from my main ship, I found I could not switch to the ship from orbital view, when I went back to the tracking station, the lander did not appear. Tried re-docking, and undocking again, still nothing. Of course, now the lander is spinning, and I can\u0027t stop it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorked perfectly fine yesterday.
