Top speed in atmosphere exceeded Mach 6 thanks to experimental Houdinis on loan from Instell Inc.\n\n![gGeXk5k.png](http://i.imgur.com/gGeXk5k.png)\n\nHey, look! Solar eclipse!\n\n![9NqfbJy.png](http://i.imgur.com/9NqfbJy.png)\n\nCollecting science in low Minmus orbit, the original mission for this spaceplane. Not shown was a bonus Mun flyby which garnered some additional science. \n\n![49SkWvn.png](http://i.imgur.com/49SkWvn.png)\n\n\u0022Oh, THERE\u0027s the KSC. That\u0027s the last time I\u0027m letting you plan the deorbit burn, Bill.\u0022 - Jebediah Kerman after almost an hour having no idea where he was\n\n![3vYFJCs.png](http://i.imgur.com/3vYFJCs.png)\n\nBoth kerbonauts had the tar scared out of them by this landing. 200 plus meters per second, crossing the runway, high vertical speed... nonetheless, Jeb somehow stuck the landing. Funds recovery: 100% sans fuel burned. Science recovery: 349.7, much more than expected. \n\nNext: To Duna, also by nuclear spaceplane.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T01:15:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 01:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kagame**\n  \nCame up with a better name."},{"CreatedByName":"GehringGame","CreatedById":145675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T19:13:33Z","Content":"It looks awesome!

There was a variant of the design that used canards, but I scrubbed it in favor of this cleaner look. Also, I use FAR, so that may have something to do with it."},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T01:11:29Z","Content":"![hYZEf2M.png](http://i.imgur.com/hYZEf2M.png)\n\nSneak peek of what\u0027s to come. I\u0027ve spent an entire day on this design (featuring not one but FOUR revisions, two of which were a complete rebuild of everything except payload!) but it still has some... *odd* tendencies. Such as the tendency to yaw left as soon as it breaks through Mach 4. Designed for a Duna science pillaging expedition, hence semi-STOL status.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n![8eyb9xO.png](http://i.imgur.com/8eyb9xO.png)\n\nFixed the yaw problem. NX-02D is fully certified and ready to go! Now I just need to build the launch that will go alongside it filled to the brim with SCANsats, IRSU setups, and backup fuel.\n\nUPDATE THE SECOND:\n\nTossed the \u0022companion craft\u0022 with SCANsats and extra fuel up into orbit. No IRSU needed because I\u0027m using pure nukes, which are just silly efficient. It\u0027s hideous, so no pics. But tomorrow... Tomorrow, we FLY!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T01:55:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 01:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kagame**\n  \nWow, that\u0027s like the fastest design I\u0027ve ever done."},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T19:53:04Z","Content":"\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
