Panels can be mounted flat on a surface, or standing on one edge, and anything in between. Most of the time, they don\u0027t have to be placed dead center (though that is a property of the part you\u0027re attaching TO; in your picture, that would be the bottom).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E however, every part is always connected to exactly one other part. If you try to make a ring of panels, the last panel will can not connect to the first; furthermore, only one panel in that ring will connect to whatever comes below. Struts can stand in for connections-that-should-be, but, well. I suggest you attach each panel to the bottom (8x symmetry should work) and use struts to connect them near the top.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T12:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot to mention, if this is for a two stage lander (Which I am guessing it is) don\u0027t forget the decoupler in the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T14:50:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP craft is basically a tree: there is root and branches.

What\u0027s not entirely clear by your question, though, it exactly what kind of structure you want that thing to have. Most everyone jumped into creating a loop, but if you\u0027re trying to build a shroud, you should connect the panels to the object below instead of trying to connect them to each other. You will need struts depending on how long you make it. If it\u0027s just 1 panel high, you probably don\u0027t need them at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/N2d0m\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Struts and fuel pipes to not \u0022close\u0022 the structure. In other words, they do not somehow cheat the tree structure of the craft. They do provide a means for it to act as if it\u0027s closed, but the second end that gets connected isn\u0027t actually attached in the same manner as all of the other components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich leads me to docking ports. You can use docking ports to \u0022close\u0022 off loops (or connect branches), but they are also not connected in the same manner. Docking ports that have been multi docked store their information in a different manner than docking ports that are attached (via surface or node attachment). The only exception to this is when you pre-attach a docking port (when you connect something to the docking side of a port in the VAB/SPH). In this case, the part that is pre-attached to the port becomes part of the tree structure. This still can\u0027t be used to circumvent the tree structure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
