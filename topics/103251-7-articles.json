Another odd thing is that, thats the almost exact same code from Kerbquake and Kerbquake works just fine with real fuels. \n\nWhat happened next has been baffling me all morning\n\nNow my SoundFX Method is throwing null exceptions which is odd because I just reverted the thing back to when I first disabled the engine thrust and it worked just fine back then:\n\n                    void SoundFX (FXGroup fx, float volume, float volCtrl, float spread, bool play)        {            if (!gamePaused \u0026\u0026 !fx.audio.isPlaying \u0026\u0026 play == true) {                fx.audio.Play ();                fx.audio.volume = (Mathf.Clamp(volume,0,1f) * volCtrl) * masterVolume;            }else{                fx.audio.volume = Mathf.Clamp(volume,0,1f);            }            if (play == false ) {                fx.audio.Stop();            }            fx.audio.spread = spread;        }        void SoundFX(FXGroup fx, bool play)        {            SoundFX (fx, 0, 0, 0, play);        }-------------example of How it is used inside Update()--------------        if (vResist \u003E 0.5) {            SoundFX (smallRattlesGroup, (vResist - 0.5f) / 4f,rVolCtrl, 90f,true);        } else {            SoundFX (smallRattlesGroup,false);        }\n\nIm really out of ideas so dont play this mod with Realfuels or anything that changes engine functionality. Not until I come up with a solution for this. Right now im thinking of rewriting the mod entirely and come up with a better system\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T00:09:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 12:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ensou04**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xenro66","CreatedById":123894,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T00:36:00Z","Content":"Just thought I\u0027d drop by to see how the development is going.
