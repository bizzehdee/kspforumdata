For example, an area of their jetpack has an impact tolerance of infinite, while some other parts can only withstand 6 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Procyon","CreatedById":57510,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T01:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere heads are very hard....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T01:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the game is still in development, not every aspect of physics is completely implemented.
