Last night the president of the kerbal population, who also is president of the largest snack factory in existence, received a death threat written on a cake wrapper. It was signed by the leader of this group. The president has authorized the invitation of these kerbals to live on a remote world. They have accepted. You are to construct a small colony on a remote world for these kerbals to live.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERules\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo kerbals must be killed during this project.

At least 1k of electric charge, power generation, at least 20 fuel storage, a way to refuel this storage, and a communication system. this is per Hitchhiker container or anything else that will contain between 1-4 Kerbals(except for the communication system. thats only one ever).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtra equipment will include. 1 Rover per 10 Kerbals. One jumbo fuel tank full of fuel(does not need to be filled when landing, but must be so when kerbals start to arrive) or the equivalent capacity with 1 extra at 50 and 100 Kerbals. There must be a way to refuel this from the ground and 1 rover per tank must be provided to haul fuel around. one greenhouse to provide food and oxygen and one extra at 50 and 100 kerbals. A communication base that is located on a nearby hill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere must be a way for kerbals to be transported from Kerbin to the colony and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll mods are allowed accept those that give you an unfair advantage.
