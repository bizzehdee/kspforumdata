It\u0027s the obvious choice for interplanetary in terms of efficiency, but with the burn times so stupidly long, I can\u0027t make a craft work in a single burn.

That will reduce the amount of playtime that you need for such a burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother comment: my personal rule is to not have a craft with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E less than 0.2 (i.e. a craft with less than 0.2 g acceleration). That is just too painful. (And too long burns become inefficient.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-10T18:20:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIf it doesn\u0027t work in a single burn, then split the burn. This is sometimes also referred to as \u0022periapsis kicking\u0022. First, start with a partial burn of a reasonable length - no more than a fifth of a full orbit, ideally more like an eigth. Now you have a periapsis in the place where you executed your burn. Loop around the orbit once. As you pass periapsis, make a second burn. Loop around. Make a third burn. And so on. How many you need entirely depends on your spacecraft, its current location, and where you want to go.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThere are various ways to improve that strategy, for example \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/98843-precomputed-low-twr-interplanetary-transfer-burns/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eusing maneuver nodes of fixed, pre-set magnitudes\u003C/a\u003E, or precalculating the alignment your apoapsis (unfortunately \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/98843-precomputed-low-twr-interplanetary-transfer-burns/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethe guide for that\u003C/a\u003E lost all of its images).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EOf course, if you really don\u0027t like long burns, you can fly with high-powered bipropellant engines instead. All planets in stock KSP can be reached effortlessly with normal chemical rocket engines. The nuclear motors and ion engines are just options which lower the launch mass, and thus likely the price, of the spacecraft. If you are playing Science or Sandbox modes, or if your Career game has no problems with paying for and launching gigantic things, then you could go to Moho or Eeloo entirely on solid rocket boosters.
