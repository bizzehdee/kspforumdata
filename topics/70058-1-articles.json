Your SRB\u0027s are too close and above your main sail engine which means the exhaust from the SRB,s is over heating your Main Sails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The fuel tank your using is not designed to be directly attached to a mainsail, for example, the orange tank causes the engine attached to it to overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T23:17:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s his NASA engines overheating, not the Mainsail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo fixes for the liquid fueled engines;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. use the Mainsail trick of placing a pancake fuel can between the engine and big fuel can. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

It seems to be related to the heat distribution issue that Mainsails had when attached to the Jumbo64 tanks before they fixed that in an earlier version.
