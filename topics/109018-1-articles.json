But something I am slightly annoyed by is that you can do all the science, collect it, and hope to the next location. It really gives you no incentive to remain on the surface of a place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I think would be a cool mod is if you have to give the science experiments time to complete. And if you spend less time conducting the experiment, you\u0027ll get less science. Also, it would also be nice if during the experiments electricity was consumed. And if you run out of charge, you have to redo all the science that wasnt logged and saved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example: Goo Canister\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to complete: 1.5 hours\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpent time: 1.4 hours\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReceived science: 93%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example: 2hot thermometer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to complete: 30 minutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpent time: 15 minutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReceived science: 50%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd again: Crew Report\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to complete: 2 hours\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpent time: 3 hours\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReceived Science: 100%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I want from this mod, if someone is kind enough to make it, is to have more realistic missions, that are harder and need much more consideration and diligence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope I can inspire someone to make something like it. I would if I could (and even had time to do so).
