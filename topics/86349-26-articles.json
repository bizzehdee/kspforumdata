I run a lot of mods, I mean a LOT of mods, maybe not the most ever, but certainly way more than the average player, probably. Anyway, under 0.24.2, my game was running just fine as long as I used the Active Texture Management mod to keep my memory use down to a reasonable level. Well, whatever got \u0022improved\u0022 in 0.25 may be great for some folks who play mostly stock, or have some monster gaming rig with near-supercomputer capabilities, but KSP is now totally broken for me, because ATM now doesn\u0027t work at all, and therefore I can\u0027t even load the game without an out-of-memory lockup/crash! As far as I know, the author(s) of ATM are working on fixing the problem, but the last I checked on the relevant forum thread, he was saying that it doesn\u0027t appear as though there\u0027s any way to get it working again. Or words to that effect, anyway. Bottom line, I may not be able to play KSP with any of the mods that I consider utterly essential for this game to be remotely playable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway, thank you, Squad, for \u0022fixing\u0022 your game until it broke, dammit! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not using any of the large parts mods like B9 or KW rocketry, but I\u0027m using a fair bit of them and, using OpenGL, memory usage is below 2GB now - and that includes the Astronomer\u0027s pack. Depending on your rig, the 64 bits mode might work - except that some modders chose to disable their mods in that version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any event, I think your complain should be addressed to the modders. Let\u0027s be honest here: if you\u0027ve purchased, let\u0027s say Skyrim, and you download an 8K texture pack which includes high resolution meshes and that makes the game unplayable because it requires to top of the line GPUs working together to process all that, you wouldn\u0027t be blaming Betheseda for that. Any software has minimum software requirements. In the case of some mods, that requires 64 bit Linux KSP and 8GB of ram, minimum.
