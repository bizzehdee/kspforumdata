Only if I use it on the stock LF then I get higher dV vs use on LH2. The dry mass adds up to fast for the little nuke to become efficient with LH2 (big tanks needed).\n\u003E \n\nWell, the nuke is listed as a sub-section for the SC InterPlanetary series of ships, and not in the list of engines.  Would be a ways out if at all; need to determine what that series of parts is all about / what form factor it would all come in.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On Saturday, February 27, 2016 at 0:11 PM, stratochief66 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) if it wouldn\u0027t be much more work, that would be great!

Having them as distinct parts might make it easier for us to give them more precise, historical masses; but users could always get around that by creating it using your new system and avoid our heavier mass anyway.

Without your help we would probably have to instruct RO users to download an older version of SSTU from back when we had most parts configured, like 0.3.28-pre5 .\n\u003E \n\nI included a couple examples of single-part clusters in the PR, should give enough setup info to do any others that were wanted.  I also may have forgotten to re-add some of the variants and clusters (M-1, large F-1 clusters); I\u0027ll look into updating the PR or submitting another one when I have time.\n\nYah, the only reason I\u0027m submitting the updates is because of the popularity with RO.  I don\u0027t personally use it, but can see the appeal, so am trying to keep it as accessible as possible.

Honestly, again this is just from my experience craft files really do help people. In terms of people attaching themselves to mod particularly ones with alot of parts like this one or Tantares. People are impressed with the parts but when they get them in game they lose interest because they just don\u0027t know what to do with them. So you either have the super creative people who can do fantastic things with packs like this and people who want to do things like that and then get overwhelmed with the amount of parts and don\u0027t know what to do. So craft files are helpful to get the most people to download even if they just help inspire creativity. Also pictures of what the pack can do help too. However I agree with you 100% don\u0027t make craft files until the pack is close to or fully complete compatibility issues with craft files suck."}]}
