For example, take the command pod, and attach a X200-32 fuel tank below it. Then add four more X200-32 fuel tanks radially, and attach a LV-T30 engine below each of the five fuel tanks. You\u0027ll get almost 5800 m/s of vacuum delta-v, with TWR 1.09 at launch. Some fine tuning will be needed, but that\u0027s probably quite close to the right engines-to-fuel ratio.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help. I was using the FTmn 280 nuclear engine to get the Mk1 into orbit, but it is just too large and heavy for much else. Your help was just the bit I needed. I used X200-16\u0027s for two of the tanks and that worked well.
