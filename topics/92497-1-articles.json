When I play and then shut the game, my PC is like super laggy for a while. It also makes this strange bug with google chrome. I can\u0027t type anything to the address bar and I can\u0027t switch between tabs. Almost all of the people experiencing this bug were playing KSP just before this occoured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERead the comments bellow this thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/20yvdf/cant_click_different_tabs_change_the_address_bar/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/20yvdf/cant_click_different_tabs_change_the_address_bar/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomebody should take a look on it.

And it only happens with the x64 version of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor whatever reason, Unity fails to let go of the mouse handler when it closes in a lot of cases, and Windows either stops registering left-click properly, or it registers left-click as a right-click instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fix is just to right click somewhere deliberately. It\u0027s not a major glitch, but it\u0027s not something Squad can fix, as far as I\u0027m aware. Just one of the frankly many glitches surrounding x64 builds of Unity applications at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
