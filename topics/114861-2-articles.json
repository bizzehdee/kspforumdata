I\u0027ve been using this [ugly looking thing](https://github.com/DMagic1/CapCom/blob/master/Source/CapComContract.cs#L278-L367) to assign celestial body targets to each contract. When it fails, and with all addon contracts, the only real option is to check the contract title for the body\u0027s name. Most of the time it works well enough, but there aren\u0027t clear ways of determining the target planet for some contract types."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T04:34:17Z","Content":"This is a cool idea, but I just had a total gamebreaking lockup.
