I have not upgraded any of the buildings at KSC yet except the VAB, Launchpad and Mission Control to level 2. However, I seem to have accidentally unlocked patched conics just by loading a quicksave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I did was quicksave, launch one of the probes (by decoupling a stack separator), did a short timewarp, saw I\u0027d missed Mun\u0027s SOI and reloaded the quicksave. Now I can see my flight trajectory in blue/orange, I can see my Mun encounter, place manoeuvre nodes, etc, just as tho I\u0027d unlocked patched conics... except I haven\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a known issue, or might it be something to do with my modset? If it\u0027s new, can anybody replicate it in a stock career so I know it\u0027s not just me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: in case it seems odd that I can see an encounter I missed, it\u0027s because the probe is accelerated into a flyby by a Flea SRB and consequently missed the encounter.
