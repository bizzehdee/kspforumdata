A jet (or any type of reaction engine) is most efficient when operating at the velocity equal to that of its exhaust; this is because if the exhaust is traveling at zero velocity in the vehicle\u0027s frame of reference, then the vehicle gains all the kinetic energy from the propellant and the exhaust is left with no kinetic energy. If a rocket were to be\u00A0traveling faster than its exhaust velocity, however, then the exhaust would still have some of the kinetic energy that the rocket\u0027s propellant originally had, which would result in lower propulsive efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy then does the Oberth Effect still increase the available kinetic energy\u00A0when rocket velocity exceeds exhaust velocity?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-17T04:50:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2016 04:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Silavite\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T05:28:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nW=F*d\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwork = force *\u00A0distance over which that force is applied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the spacecraft is traveling fast it covers more distance in the same period than if it traveled slowly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silavite","CreatedById":156204,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T06:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222634545\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141955\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466141281\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002245577\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, Shpaget said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nW=F*d\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwork = force *\u00A0distance over which that force is applied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the spacecraft is traveling fast it covers more distance in the same period than if it traveled slowly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd by corollary, the exhaust travels a short distance (within the rocket\u0027s frame of reference), doing little work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if the rocket was moving at such a great speed that exhaust velocity was insignificant in comparison, then the exhaust and rocket would be doing a similar amount of work, as the exhaust and rocket would be moving at roughly the same speed and thus cover a similar distance.

Relative to that natural satellite though its energy is 1/2mv\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. So from the space crafts point of view it just gaining energy just as occurs as any object accelerates, BUT it only has to pay back the integral of MGH as it leaves, so that the difference it gets to keep as kinetic energy, it gets big really fast.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeres an example you enter a system with a speed of say 100\u00A0and a potential of 1000000. That 5000 \u002B 1000000 or 1005000, means you are traveling at 1417.6, you increase speed by 1 meter per second to 1418.6. you ke assuming you did this right a perigee, the resulting ke then is 1006411.6.44. As you leave that system you have to give back the kinetic energy borrowed that leaves 6411.6. This leaves you with a velocity of 113.2, by adding 1 m/s at perigee you gained 13.2 upon exit the hill sphere (there are alot of assumptions here about how you entered and exited relative to the parent to natural satellites, but lets just say relative to systems center you entered and left the hillsphere at the same altitude). If you were going much faster, say 4000 when entering the system you would still gain energy, but not proportionally as great as if you reached so trick point where you basically fall but miss the atmosphere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the other part here is that in doing Oberths you really want dense rocky targets far away from the star so you can get really close to the point mass with most of you energy in integrated MGH obtained kinetic energy, you want to accelerate as much as you can at pe, and you might want an entry angle that throws you into another Oberth later on. Of course this is not always possible, and so the large hill sphere around Jupiter sufficiently compensates\u00A0for the fact that you will not be able to do a very close approach because its a gas giant of lower density than say earth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is another trick point in the system, if you can manage a course change doing Oberths in mid system, you can use the combined gravitational well of the star and its first planet at its perigee to increase the kinetic energy leaving that planets system to gain a high eccentric orbit that leaves the system, potentially using the Oberth effect of large Jovian planet as it leaves. This type of approach might be suitable for ion driven systems because they rely on the sun for exhaust energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-17T13:17:03Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2016 01:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMajor math correction, IPAD math is all sucky.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lukaszenko","CreatedById":95776,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T13:50:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically when the rocket exceeds the exhaust\u0027s velocity, the rocket gains MORE energy than the total chemical energy in the propellant.
