But I believe that defeats the point of KSP. Not that there is anything wrong with that at all. I applaud it. There is nothing wrong with using Umbra or Home like packages. I use many of the parts. I did this to be myself and while using MANY custom and add-on parts; do it in my own way.\n\nAnywho despite my manifesto I did in fact cheat a lot. Modified parts, teleportation, etc, etc. Kinda had too. At 560 somethin parts it lagged me bad. And for patients sake I just teleported to the planet I wanted to go. The pictures explain more.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Incognita has 5 main bodies as you will see. \n\n1. The Bus the main housing that holds the engines and the other compartments together.\n\n2. A shuttle that can split and carry the other Modules.\n\n3. A rover that can split and carry the other modules.\n\n4. A outpost to house kerbals so they can survive in comfort. (tests went ok but in the end it failed me and not bothering to fix it)\n\n5. A Emergency like or fuel module. This one has a nuke reactor, extra food, and cryo cabin.\n\nIn the end I just wanted someone else to see it. Feel like I kinda owe it to myself to show it off a little after working on it forever. There is actually a lot missing from the pics like the rest of the base that can be slowly built form the containers and the other two HOME fold out tabs that weren\u0027t cooperating. Its actually on a old install KSP 0.21 or something lol. lots of setbacks. steam auto updated and I lost all the work once. That design was crap tho. And at some point I flat out walked away from KSP after burning out I guess. Left it alone for some months even as the project was ready to go ahead. \n\nBig props to the add-on devs. couldn\u0027t have done it without you. Had like 70 separate add-ons with lots of individual parts slapped into one.\n\nThanks for viewing. Now to get on with my life and into 1.0.2!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
