The crew spent time studying Duna and Ike (discovered in 2017 KD, named after Dwight D. Kerman), then returned. At that same time Jebediah (commander of the Duna mission) received a letter from a 10-year-old girl (name undisclosed) and was simply surprised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5002 (2027 KD): A jubilant Duna crew returns to Kerbin with the much-needed studies.
