It had a large number of shaders that could be combined and tweaked in realtime to make the texture you wanted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance you might be making a piece of industrial equipment and decide you needed a row of fasteners. You could select hexbolts and it would place a row of bolt heads along a line you define. In the bolt shaders window you could adjust the size and spacing as well as the surface height. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen maybe you decide that it\u0027s an old machine so you overlay a rust shader onto the bolts. This roughens up the surface of the boltheads and adds a rusty color to them. While you\u0027re playing with the shaders there was a preview of just that shader and the entire combined texture. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were shaders for noise, pipe arrays, wiring systems, circuts, various water effects, and all sorts of other stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you had a look you were happy with by combining all of these shaders the program could generate imagemaps for color, specularity, luminosity, bump, and pretty much any other type of image you\u0027d use in a 3D program. The idea being you could quickly get complex textures without having to hand paint every detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found a few programs that are similar, but all that I\u0027ve found seem to have a very narrow focus. They might do brick textures, or wood textures or ground textures or convert a picture into a set of texture maps, but so far I haven\u0027t found anything that would be useful for making textures for KSP models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone got any suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T05:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eadobe cs2 even if it\u0027s now a bit old it\u0027s still a very powerfull suit and it\u0027s now \u0022free downloadable\u0022 (google it for detail around the little mess with this \u0022free\u0022 release) from adobe site.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T01:48:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used MapZone before and it\u0027s pretty decent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.mapzoneeditor.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.mapzoneeditor.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T04:38:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.
