My resulting craft is fairly long, with the front half being the crew/control areas and the back half being a huge fuel tank and a 2.5 m NERV engine, not to mention some large solar panels to provide plenty of power. It\u0027s about 2.5 m pretty uniformly up and down the ship(except the Mk3 liquid fuel tank that bulges out somewhat near the end), and looks like a large tower in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I built it, somehow managed to get each big piece into orbit(the aft and forward sections had to be launched separately and mated in orbit), then designed all of the landers for a Duna landing and docked them to the main craft. I finally selected my crew, got them up there and was ready to go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I got up to the window for the best Kerbin-Duna transfer, I started notcing something. One, the burns take a very long time. I kind of expected that using such a large craft and NERV engine(but it\u0027s annoying) The problem I hadn\u0027t anticipated was that it works fine at low thrust, but once I got above 1/3 power I start drifting off target(up on the navball), even with SAS set to hold on target. If I use RCS, this isn\u0027t a problem at higher thrusts but the act of holding on target burns through monoprop like crazy and I know I\u0027m gonna need it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI purposefully built the craft with reaction wheels that are the same diameter as the main ship and it gives me a decent ability to rotate in orbit without using RCS, so I didn\u0027t think this would be a problem. I\u0027ve been able to get up to about 90% thrust but only if I raise thrust very slowly and incrementally after the 33% mark, and it\u0027s annoying. Too much and I start drifting off course(and always up)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy craft is roughly 90K tons(including lander weight) with a dV of about 6500 m/s(most of the landers are not coming back on the return trip, which should make it a little easier). It\u0027s currently in a 100 km parking orbit above Kerbin and I have a save before I start burning out of that orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I can think of is that my landers are not balanced around the axis of my craft, though the idea that I need a second NERV engine has also come to mind.

This is more true when you have radial payloads, especially when they are mounted near the opposite end of the craft to the source of thrust. If your craft is being piloted from a pod at one end and propelled by an engine at the other, it\u0027s likely that even a small amount of bending will cause you to drift steadily off course. The heavier this end of the rocket is and the higher the rate of acceleration (read thrust/throttle setting), the worse it will be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue that arises is that any reaction wheels in your radial-mounted landers/payloads will cause a positive feedback issue by trying to steer the craft to correct the bend. This puts strange torsions through the craft at various places which are often counter-productive and actually increase the bending. However, having totally inert payloads can be worse, as they begin to sway back and forward causing a torsion-oscillation that is not corrected by the reaction wheels at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo help with this, design your ship so that any detachable crafts or payloads dock/mount to in-line/parallel docking ports and not radial/perpendicular ports. There are obviously many ways to do this, and strange torsion forces can still occur, but this arrangement helps reduce the unwanted effects acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, adding another NERV will not help with your problem at all, if anything it will probably make the problem worse because the acceleration force will be greater.
