Very early WIP with only three tanks managed (Stratus-V, Oscar-B and PB-X50R).\n\nWHY ? because it allow a lot more combination of shapes and resources\u0027 amounts.\n\nFor example, I use quite a lot Xenon Gas, but using 10 to 50 small tanks is a huge pain somewhere, especially with the very poor stock resources trasnfert between vessels.\n\nMy aim is to ONLY play with stock resources and tanks plus some precise parts sets which add really new tank shapes (I think of the set by Nazari1382, with half spherical tanks, or RLA stockalike parts).\n\nI saw in Firespitter release thread that some people tried this and failed, so it may help them.\n\nExample here with some tanks:\n\n![40V5iXT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/40V5iXT.jpg)\n\nIf you want to try yourself, you can get it here:\n\n[github project page](https://github.com/JustinKerbice/FSFuSw4ALL) (where you can also download the file as it is for now)\n\nRequired: Module Manager and Firespitter (only the plug-in)\n\nInstallation: download the file then copy it to your GameData folder (read the FS doc also can be helpful)\n\nYou can also contribute by create pull requests, adding more tanks, improve balance, etc"},{"CreatedByName":"Drakoflame","CreatedById":125253,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T17:42:00Z","Content":"I wanna ask, whats that engine from?
