You can put parachutes on your boosters and trigger them in the same stage as the decouplers, and then if the booster stays within physics range the parachute will function normally. The \u0022old\u0022 physics range was 2.5 km; I believe it\u0027s been increased by quite a bit, but I don\u0027t know by how much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the booster lands before your ship leaves physics range, then it will remain landed when your ship leaves, thus allowing it to be recovered. If the booster is lofted into a suborbital trajectory (\u0026gt; 22 km altitude before leaving physics range), then it won\u0027t be considered \u0022crashed\u0022 until it returns to the 22 km border; this means that if you put your ship in orbit before this happens, you can then switch the view back to the booster and watch it land, preventing the system from crashing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-cite=\u0022n3310\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022n3310\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nn3310 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nso, I have some questions:\n\u003Cp\u003E\nam I wrong about anyone of these points?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndoes someone know anything else?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nare there any suggestions on how to recover debris?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nare there any mods which allow debris to be tracked futher than the default distance (and be considered with their parachute opened)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find that boosters tend to be cheap anyways - if they\u0027re not, you\u0027re overbuilding your spaceships.
