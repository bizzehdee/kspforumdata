However, the cones are capable of cross-feed fueling and end up causing their engines to drain the higher tanks meant for the interior stage before feeding from the ones below the cones. I know I could set it up differently so there is no cross-feeding going on with those decouplers, but I wanted to try using them. I have the staging set up so that the above fuel tanks are grouped with their intended engine (and I know they will still feed from them even if they\\\u0027re staged separately if there is a cross-feed), but that\\\u0027s mostly just for ease of knowing when the tanks intended to be used are empty if there is cross-feeding going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas on what I could do to rectify this while keeping the same parts and setup?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T00:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour using mods anyways, so why not go into the config file, find the line that allows the cones to cross feed, and delete it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T00:11:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConnect fuel pipes from the bottom tank of each radial stack to the bottom tank of the core stack. That should override the crossfeed in the aero-decouplers. This has the side-effect that when the radial stacks are jettisoned the main stack will have 100% fuel, which is actually quite advantageous in some designs!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you find it isn\\\u0027t an advantage then you can copy the aero-decouplers, give them a new name in the part.cfg file and set crossfeed=FALSE and use the new decouplers instead. That\\\u0027s how I use those decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I see no reason decouplers have automatic crossfeed in circumstances when the stack they connect has an engine attached - they should only crossfeed *if* the stack is tanks only! (At a pinch I would be happy if decouplers never crossfed, but we were forced to remember to use fuel pipes instead.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
