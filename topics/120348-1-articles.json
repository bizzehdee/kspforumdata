That way, even if all pods are filled with Kerbals, the game would know which one to control from, and multiple-pod ships (Say, WWII bombers) won\u0027t get out of control when multiple pods are used pointing at different directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T11:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETotes agreed.
