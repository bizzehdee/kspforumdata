Bigger wings have a higher lift rating and more drag, smaller wings a smaller lift rating and less drag, but lift induces drag, so having excess drag decreases the performance of an aircraft. Aircrafts with smaller wings need a bigger runway, which is less than ideal in some situations. My solution: being able to change the lift of an airplane wing in flight.\n\n**High lift devices**\n\nHigh lift devices increase lift when you want them to. There are 2 settings, one when the lift is higher and one where the lift is lower. Here are my suggestions for high lift devices:\n\nFlaps: Placed behind the wing, expands to increase lift;\n\nSlats: placed in front of the wings, expands;\n\nFlaps and Sats expand and increase drag enough to use as brakes.\n\nTelescopic wings: This gives you the option to increase your small wings to big wings at wil.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T02:20:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 02:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jappards**"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T03:31:42Z","Content":"Are flaps not already present in 1.X?"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T05:24:22Z","Content":"Yup.
