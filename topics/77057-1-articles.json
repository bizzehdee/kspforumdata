Aside from the difficulties of disassembling the station, none of the modules are designed to survive reentry, and don\u0027t have attitude control systems, parachutes, etc. You\u0027d need to send up a complete spacecraft, with heat shield, landing system, deorbit thrusters, etc that could carry a 15\u0027 diameter module. The only spacecraft with any chance of doing that was the Shuttle (it flew Spacelab modules up and down, and those were comparable to an ISS module), but it\u0027s retired.

As mentioned, they\u0027d be worn-out, obsolete technology. Most of the expensive stuff would have far cheaper alternatives for anything you might want to do on Earth, and refurbishing a 25-year-old module for spaceflight would probably be more expensive than building a shiny new inflatable module, and give you a lower-quality, less-safe vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at the prices for used (a couple hundred thousand miles) cars and RVs from the early 90s.
