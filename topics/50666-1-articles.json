I already experienced it several times, last time it was today when I prepared a mission to Moho with single burn from Kerbin\u0027s 100 km orbit. The burn was 12 minutes long. I started it six minutes ahead of the node and finished it to within 1 m/s. After that I was well over 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 off the planned trajectory and definitely not going to intercept Moho. To fix it I needed to execute correction burn which was over 250 m/s, about 15% on top of the total planned maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it would be best if no corrections were necessary, if the burn accounted for the burn length and corrected for changing conditions during the burn (like direction and strength of nearby body\u0027s gravity). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I understand that might be very complicated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the only thing I am asking for is to allow pausing the game while setting up a maneuver. Because fixing a maneuver node aiming to the other side of the system while the ship is speeding at over 3000 m/s low above Kerbin is next to impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shepard","CreatedById":67913,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T15:32:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd for every times I accidently close the node because I had to plan it fast, the only thing I can do is to agree with that idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roderik","CreatedById":85776,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T16:32:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree totally\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yourself","CreatedById":4465,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T16:44:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOf course it would be best if no corrections were necessary, if the burn accounted for the burn length and corrected for changing conditions during the burn (like direction and strength of nearby body\u0027s gravity). \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would certainly be more computationally expensive, but not necessarily that much more difficult. The solution wouldn\u0027t have to be perfect, just closer to what you\u0027d actually get. The game could make several simplifying assumptions, such as the rocket being a point mass, no staging in the middle of the burn, and the rocket remains pointed in a fixed direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d kind of like to see this as an unlockable guidance computer part.
