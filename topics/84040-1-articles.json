My suggestion is to make your truss tanks unique; high drag rating, fragile, but very light weight dry value. I personally use Real Fuels, and the math for the \u0027balloon\u0027 and \u0027CryoBalloon\u0027 seems most appropriate for dry mass. The trusses themselves should be durable, but still have high drag, and less mass than most structural elements like fuselage and adapters, as they don\u0027t have any covering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also suggest trusses with nodes on the outside, and trusses with nodes/attachment on the inside. Mostly the latter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, you might consider using the same technique B9 did in their recent release to combine models of similar shape together; for example, you have variants on the stock 6-node hub; you could combine all of them into a single part, and each variant has a different mesh \u0026amp; node config, but the overall shape is the same. Part bloat is always a consideration when I add any mod, and I know it is for others as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone the less, the reactor and trusses look like a neat idea.

But noticed a few problems with three of the models. The command pod is grotesquely too large. Looks fine in Unity and on paper, but when building something, it\u0027s a giant eye sore. Need to scale it down. Plus, two of my other parts are.... strangely laggy in the VAB and have slow load times. Not sure what the problem is, polycount isn\u0027t \u0022that\u0022 high and both are using custom colliders. In fact, the command pod has more polyies and it doesn\u0027t lag. So something isn\u0027t kosher about those two parts. Also, while assemblying a few test ships/stations, I immediately recognized the need for two other parts.
