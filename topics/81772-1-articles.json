Re texturing could potentially be done with Texture Replacer but not modifying the topology. There is a mod somewhere that does allow for changing heightmaps, however (I think it\u0027s Kittopia\u0027s Terraforming).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout mods there is no known way to add static meshes like the Mun arches or monoliths to planets. The one mod that adds that functionality, Kerbtown, received its most recent unofficial hotfix a few weeks after 0.23.0 was released, so it\u0027s basically running on code from the days of 0.22.x and is severely outdated. It works, but only if it\u0027s one of the only plugins installed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T06:23:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOrbitusII: not quite.

These do not change unless you (a) tell the game to recreate the mesh and (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E load new textures.
