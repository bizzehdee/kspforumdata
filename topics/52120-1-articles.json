This would not only result into a more linear progression in career mode but also help relatively new players that might not feel comfortable with openness of the game right from the start, helpin them to progress at small steps at a time. Obviously, all the veterans that somehow manage to orbit eve with basic rocketry will be free to do so and doing it would unlock more advanced missions, regardless of the fact that they have or have not completed more basic ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese missions could be also non-science related, such as orbit a planet for the first time, and there could be also a variety of sarcastic/easter egg missions that could involve leaving kerbals in a crew hatch for a couple years in the test center to simulate a voyage to mars, keeping jebediah kerman alive for more than 10 missions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E or whatever the devs/modders can think of. There could also be series of missions to do in a certain order such as a simulation of the Apollo program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be awesome if also modders could implement these missions in their mods (i don\u0027t know how easy/complicated it would be technically speaking to do so). I do realize that this could easily create missions with OP rewards such as 9000 science just for orbiting earth, but i don\u0027t really see this as a problem coz most players would simply avoid those \u0022OP Mods\u0022 as they would just take out the fun that there is in progressing in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, missions completed by a player could be kept in a \u0022Mission room\u0022 (or a screen with a little more imaginative name) and act as achievements that you can visit or share with whoever. Just imagine, after colonizing every planet and creating all sorts of space stations around the solar system you go look your early achievements and remember the good ol\u0027times in which you could hardly manage to make your rocket decouple without it transforming into a flying ball of flames and kerbals. :\u0027) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esorry for my english, please give feedback and new/improved ideas. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T19:39:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis discussion is already in progress here: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56453-Money-in-Career-Mode-Contracts-Office\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56453-Money-in-Career-Mode-Contracts-Office\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
