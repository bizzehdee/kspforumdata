There are numerous cases based on what the game is and how it works under the hood. There may even be third or first-party tools that are needed to mod the game or make modding easier. For example, I remember that installing mods in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was as easy as dropping a folder in the game files. However, to install Minecraft mods you must open up the java file and drop in the mods in a specific location. Furthermore, installing Just Cause 2 mods requires that a folder with a specific name be created in the game files and then a mod dropped in that folder. Once again, I\u0027d recommend finding a forum/ mod website with a forum for the game that you\u0027d like to mod and asking the people there, there are cases for every game and every game is different.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Special Agent Sigvan","CreatedById":92033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T06:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t get into the specifics because I don\u0027t know the specifics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to install mods it varies depending on the game, many forums for said games (Steam forums even) have sections for the mod and mod development, you can ask there to get your answer for how to do it for that specific game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownloads vary, ModDB, Nexus are two great websites dedicated for mods, Mediafire works for free for folders, some mods (Some Mount \u0026amp; Blade: Warband mods had this system) have installers that will find your directory (Such as mod folder or [in KSP\u0027s case Game Data Folder] other folder), some games have in game systems to activate mods (DEFCON, Mount and Blade, Atom Zombie Smasher and some others).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome games (Gratuitous Space Battles for examples) require you to add folders into other folders for new things, many games have things in place to prevent this (In GSB the player has to add races into the races folder, ships into the ships folder, bitmaps into the bitmaps folder, modules into the modules file, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make or develop mods is daunting, but if you can code (Or read it) you can handle modding, Atom Zombie Smasher is a good place to start if you\u0027re new to coding (As I am) as it\u0027s just JavaScript with comments that will brief you on what each value will do, it\u0027s just a matter of changing values.
