But when I reenter at 5000m/s, it certainly does not. As you can see in the screenshots, the drill is beyond the heatshield, but still it\u0027s the only part of the ship that is shining red, apart from the heatshield itself, and a brief look with the debug tool confirms it. The landing strut near it is cool, just as any fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe debug info also mentions \u0022exposed skin\u0022 for the drill,\u00A0while the other parts have no exposed skin. Does this mean that the drill is considered sticking through the heatshield?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s still not fixed, then we\u0027re probably still in need of tricks to land a ship with this drill.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220Uwj9ma.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0Uwj9ma.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022K1Rtv6m.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K1Rtv6m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-17T10:21:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/80231-kulebron/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002280231\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/80231-kulebron/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Kulebron\u003C/a\u003E, can you please report this on the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP bug tracker\u003C/a\u003E, thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kulebron","CreatedById":80231,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-01T13:21:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReported, still no reaction there \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHad to play with Shift\u002BF12 cheats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
