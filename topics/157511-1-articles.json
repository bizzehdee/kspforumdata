Unfortunately BTSM was in its infancy as far as colonization goals go, and it eventually stopped updating. But I\u0027ve never given up on my idea for that campaign, so I am restarting it, not with one mod, but with a whole collection of them! Without further ado... Reaching for Stars!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrologue: The Story So Far and First Contact\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur story begins with the foundation of the Kerbal Federation at the end of the Period of Anarchy, when the sixteen Nations of Kerbin united peacefully under one banner to avoid a war when nuclear fission was discovered. Kerbin was a peaceful planet, but it had known war before; with the invention of nukes, the leaders of the world all agreed that a war simply must not happen. The Federation, in the interest of advancing all of Kerbalkind, funded the creation of the Federation Space Program. Project Airborne was funded to explore the boundaries of Kerbin, and over the next year or so various probes and kerbals were shot into the sky. Project Airborne culminated with Airborne 6, which carried Valentina Kerman straight up to High Space, past the radiation belt, and back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the expertise gained through Project Airborne, Wernher von Kerman designed the Believer series of probes. Believer 1 was the first craft to enter orbit and do a flyby of both Mun and Minmus, but its antenna did not have sufficient range to transmit science back. Believer 2 landed on the Mun and remains there to this day, while Believer 3 landed on the surface of Minmus, then escaped into Kerbol\u0027s\u00A0orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a proof of concept, Carouser 1 was built to carry a pilot and two to four tourists into orbit. Meanwhile, back on the surface, the Destiny project had begun. Our story begins with Jebediah \u00A0Kerman piloting the Destiny 1 -- a light airplane powered by three engines -- towards a magnetic anomaly detected near the launch site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot2.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/4guij8t0l/screenshot2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah Kerman flipped a switch and with a roar -- or more accurately, a soft growl. A trio of engines -- none of them very big, but with three, capable of producing significant force -- came to life as the stubby little Destiny 1 airplane came to life and started bumping down the patch of dirt prepared for this purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ground control, this is Captain Jeb, requesting permission for takeoff, over\u0022 crackled Jeb over the intercom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You aren\u0027t a captain of anything, Jebediah, and you\u0027re supposed to roll the plane to the target, not fly it. It\u0027s only a few hundred meters away.\u0022 Gene Kerman, head of Mission Control, replied irritably. After a short pause, he added, \u0022And you don\u0027t need to say over. This is a constant communication two-way radio, and --\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Too late!\u0022 he was cut off by Jeb. \u0022I\u0027m already in the air!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot6.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/5a74buz1h/screenshot6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter just a few moments of flying, Jeb landed his plane near the strange black obelisk. It seemed completely and utterly black, darker than anything Jeb had ever seen, as if it absorbed every last bit of light that hit it. Awestruck, he approached. \u0022What do you see, Jeb?\u0022 buzzed Gene in his ear. Jeb just stared. \u0022Jeb? Are you alright?\u0022 the radio snapped him back to attention. \u0022Er, yeah. I\u0027m fine. There\u0027s something carved in here -- a star map, it looks like. Lots of dots connected by lines. I think it\u0027s pointing us somewhere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot18.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/5od1p78ir/screenshot18.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterest in the monument led to additional funding for the Kerbal Space Program, and over the next few weeks Jeb and Valentina were sent to a number of other obelisks around the world. The project led to the development of a number of more efficient and faster planes, culminating with the Destiny 2.5:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot128.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/j98f22dph/screenshot128.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, Wernher analyzed the star maps, as they indeed were, which were discovered by Jeb on his first mission. They appeared to show the constellations normally seen from Kerbin, but at a strange angle, one which Wernher did not recognize. A few weeks went by until he figured it out: this was a view of the sky from near the North Pole.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot180.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/tm3wfmm05/screenshot180.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher announced his discovery before a joint Kongress committee that night and asked for the funding necessary to send a Destiny 2.5 mission to the Pole, including upgrading the communication network to reach that far, smoothing the runway to allow the plane to take off with a full load of fuel, and preparing emergency recovery contingencies. After a few hours of heated debate -- this mission, after all, would not be cheap -- Kongress agreed to fund the mission. Jebediah was ecstatic to take the Destiny 2.5 to its limits. He set off just before dawn the next morning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot183.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/o0hhbklb9/screenshot183.png\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot191.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/i0tq7x0it/screenshot191.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot194.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/5ngw10aud/screenshot194.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot200.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/4nv6j1l2d/screenshot200.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot208.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/y5kqevt9h/screenshot208.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah stood on the icecap, staring at the little black dot in the distance. \u0022Is this another one of those monuments?\u0022 he asked Mission Control through his helmet radio. \u0022Don\u0027t think so -- the profile is all wrong. We\u0027re not detecting any unusual readings from here -- why don\u0027t you move the plane closer? Should be safe to approach.\u0022 Before he was even done speaking, Jeb was back in the plane and taxiing towards the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot211.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/q1cma56ud/screenshot211.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs he got closer, Jeb realized that the object -- whatever it was -- seemed irregular in shape, unlike the obelisks, which stood square and symmetric. \u0022I\u0027ve never seen anything like it\u0022 muttered Wernher von Kerman through the radio, staring at the video feed. \u0022Is it some sort of arch?\u0022 he asked. \u0022No, I don\u0027t think so\u0022 replied Jeb, squinting. \u0022It looks like something round that\u0027s half-buried in snow.\u0022 \u0022By Jool, you\u0027re right!\u0022 replied Gene. \u0022Get closer, Jeb. Let\u0027s see what it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot213.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/9swe0ny05/screenshot213.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That... Thing... Doesn\u0027t look like it came from Kerbin\u0022 muttered Wernher von Kerman as Jebediah climbed out of the plane. \u0022No metal or compound I know of absorbs light quite like that.\u0022 Jebediah took a step forward. \u0022Jeb, wait! We haven\u0027t scanned that thing yet. It could be dangerous!\u0022 called Gene. \u0022I didn\u0027t come all this way to turn back, Gene. I\u0027m going in\u0022 replied Jeb as he started walking forward across the ice. Snow had drifted higher on the ice here, forming gentle waves that the plane couldn\u0027t navigate, so Jeb continued on foot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, he reached the object that was embedded in the ice. Jeb gasped as he came around the side. \u0022It\u0027s... a flying saucer. A real life flying saucer, crashed on Kerbin!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot215.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/wwwut91b9/screenshot215.png\u0022\u003E \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot216.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/lyllb2cpx/screenshot216.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-15T19:51:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2017 07:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by babale\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"babale","CreatedById":108874,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-09T05:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 1: Kerbin ECHO Station\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ll come get you when Jeb lands\u0022 said Gene as he stood up. Wernher was going to spend all night studying the readings from the crash site, but Gene had work to do in the morning; he needed to go to bed. He left and shut the door behind him, leaving Wernher alone in the control room. That didn\u0027t bother Wernher; he liked the solitude. As Director of the Kerbal Space Program, he found himself doing far too many administrative tasks and far too little real scientific work. He lost himself in his work for a while, so when there was a knock on the door, he wasn\u0027t sure how long it had been. \u0022Jeb must be back early\u0022 he muttered as he stood and walked to the door. But when he opened it, the kerbal on the other side wasn\u0027t Gene; it was a tall kerbal with close-cropped hair in a well-fitted suit. \u0022Can I help you?\u0022 demanded Wernher, glaring at the kerbal. \u0022Smedley Kerman, adviser to the Prime Minister\u0022 responded the newcomer, putting out a hand. Wernher just stared for a moment before taking Smedley\u0027s hand. \u0022And what can I do for you, sir?\u0022 he asked. Smedley smiled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Director Wernher, the Prime Minister takes the possibility of intelligent extra-terrestrial life -- and the possible threat implicit with their existence -- very seriously. We want to keep any eye on the sky, so to speak, now that we know that other beings could arrive at any time. That\u0027s why we have approved your project... Project ECHO.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher\u0027s mouth dropped. Project ECHO was a plan that Wernher floated a few years back to build habitable orbital stations around Kerbin. He called them ECHO Stations, ECHO standing for\u00A0Extraplanetary Contained Habitation Outpost. His proposal nearly cost him his job -- Kongress wanted a kerbal in charge who\u0027d amuse the public with simple experiments that didn\u0027t cost to much, but none of them saw the need for long-term habitation off-planet. Suddenly, the Prime Minister approved his project... It seemed too good to be true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s the catch?\u0022 demanded Wernher. Smedley nodded. \u0022No catch; we just want you to modify your designs a bit. We need you to add some high-gain antennas to the station, to let it serve as a listening outpost out in space.\u0022 Wernher needed only a moment to consider. He stuck his hand out again. \u0022You\u0027ve got a deal!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFrom the Journal of Wernher von Kerman\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this grant from the Federation, I have finally been able to design the necessary equipment necessary to create an ECHO station in orbit of Kerbin.

The lift vehicle for this station was a relatively simple eight-engine configuration, but to cut costs I am considering designing a dedicated lift vehicle. In the meantime, the station was assembled and launched flawlessly.

Kerbals cheered, clapped, and hugged each other as Director Wernher von Kerman watched with a satisfied grin. His moment of celebration was cut short after just a few moments by Smedley Kerman, adviser to the Prime Minister. \u0022So when will Kerbin Station ECHO be operational, Director?\u0022 he asked. \u0022The Federation poured a lot of money into this pet project of yours -- we want kerbals up there with their eyes on their monitors as soon as possible.\u0022 Wernher reached into his coat and produced a small notebook, which he began flipping through. \u0022Assuming all the systems test positive, we can launch the first crew in three weeks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot250.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/7ajk7142n/screenshot250.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmedley coughed. \u0022Three weeks?

He had no patience for these bureaucratic types. \u0022These safety tests are essential. You wouldn\u0027t want a system failure up there when kerbal lives are at stakes. Besides -- three weeks is how long it will take us to finish the ascent vehicle.\u0022 Noticing that Smedley seemed quite annoyed with him, Wernher decided to placate Smedley by giving in elsewhere. That was how you dealt with these money men -- distract them from the impossible by showing them new alternatives that they hadn\u0027t even imagined. \u0022Let us move on to another matter. I have considered your proposal for the growing of crops in orbit to produce both food and oxygen, and have discussed it with an expert in the field of Hydroponics.

The new station would require frequent trips to orbit -- to resupply, maneuver kerbals, or return scientific results from orbit. For this purpose, Wernher debuted the new Freighter series, beginning with the Freighter 1. The Freighter 1 consisted of four command pods, two of which were capable of detaching and returning from orbit with a load of experimental results, as well as enough supplies to keep up to four kerbals happy for nearly a year (when combined with the station\u0027s more advanced recycling capabilities). Perhaps more important than the Freighter series was the debut of the new Goliath 1, the first of the Goliath-class light lifters. The Goliath 1 is capable of lifting around 20 tons to orbit using a seven engine configuration. Three engines detach after reaching the upper atmosphere, three more detach upon arrival in space, and the last is used for circularization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot266.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/byzk27t9d/screenshot266.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoon enough, the three weeks that Wernher had spoken off passed, and Freighter 1 was ready for launch. Bill, Bob, Jebediah, and Valentina Kerman were loaded into the none-too-roomy command pods and shipped off to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot268.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/7eddna9k1/screenshot268.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot269.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/8563t2bxd/screenshot269.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot279.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/z4ek1yns1/screenshot279.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFar above Kerbin, Bill, Bob, Val, and Jeb soared through space. The Goliath 1 lifter didn\u0027t have enough power to lift a heavier, roomier habitation pod like the Mk III. Instead, the Freighter 1 was designed with three separate habitation pods, each small but easily insulated. The drawback to this setup was that the four astronauts couldn\u0027t actually see each other -- the only way for each of them to see his comrades was a trio of rather grainy monitors. Jebediah and Valentina piloted the craft together while Bill crunched numbers and Bob kept in touch with Mission Control and sent radio commands to the nearby Kerbin Station ECHO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot281.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/75keb3m5d/screenshot281.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Separation dropping...

He didn\u0027t take his eyes off the monitor below. \u0022Erm... Guys? We have a problem. It looks like the station\u0027s probe core had an extra zero in the code for sun-tracking.

We don\u0027t need the station to be powered to dock with it, do we?\u0022 \u0022Don\u0027t think so,\u0022 replied Jeb, \u0022But it\u0027s gonna make things that much harder if the station can\u0027t turn to face us. You sure you can handle it, Val?\u0022 They grinned at each other through the monitors -- now that Jeb had challenged her, she wouldn\u0027t back down even if she were inclined to in the first place. Bill and Bob rolled their eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot286.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/6u2xyc5pd/screenshot286.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot288.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/w1dtyl8td/screenshot288.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven with the station unable to turn, the approach went well. Soon enough, Freighter 1 was just a few meters from the station, and hardly moving in relation to it. Valentina killed the last of the movement with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters and said, \u0022I think we have a problem after all, guys. The station\u0027s engines were designed to stay attached until the last possible moment in case the Freighter couldn\u0027t reach the ECHO and the station had to maneuver for an emergency rendezvous, but we can\u0027t actually dock with the engines attached.

Finally, Jeb said, \u0022Hey Bill, is there a decouple switch inside the station?\u0022 Bill spent a few seconds flipping through his engineer\u0027s manual of the ECHO station\u0027s specifications. \u0022Should be, yes, but\u00A0how are you planning on --\u0022 before he could finish his sentence, Jeb had strapped on his helmet and popped out through his capsule\u0027s airlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot289.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/5ucn2mqjl/screenshot289.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing his spacesuit\u0027s built-in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, Jebediah made his way to the ECHO Station\u0027s own EVA airlock. Ever since an incident on the testing floor where a corrupt file caused a probe core to lock the engineers out of the ECHO station for over three days, the station had been designed with an emergency access hatch to the airlock, so Jebediah was able to get in with no incident. \u0022I better back us up\u0022 muttered Valentina.

Val and Jeb, however, had little to do. Technically, they were supposed to monitor the ECHO\u0027s readings, but in the small station, they could hear those alerts from anywhere.

Not so much as a blip had been heard by Val and Jeb, who were bored to tears \u0022piloting\u0022 the stationary station. But there was some good news -- Bob\u0027s plant growth experiment was progressing well enough that Wernher decided to send up a Life Support Module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/9oaopix9d/screenshot301.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot301.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/d96k8r1sx/screenshot333.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot333.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to a large helping of additional batteries and an eighteen panel solar array, the new module added two important features to the ECHO station. First, it added the greenhouse itself, which would help make the oxygen last longer and lower the demand on the carbon dioxide scrubbers. Second, it would add six new docking ports in a radial circuit, allowing many crafts to dock to the station at once -- an important feature if ECHO station would one day become a central hub of interplanetary travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new module would be carried up by a Goliath class lifter -- it fell well within acceptable weight parameters, but its height would be quite challenging for the lifter to cope with. As such, the flight plan for this mission did not involve a classing gravity turn ascent profile -- instead, it called for near vertical rise into space, followed by near horizontal circularization burns. This would be rather inefficient, but would allow the cheap Goliath 1 to carry the module up to space easily enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/m6ra63u8x/screenshot336.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot336.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/ocll0lxpd/screenshot341.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot341.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/xzp3abqox/screenshot345.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot345.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/y4xwh44bl/screenshot364.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot364.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission went off without a hitch, and the module was easily docked to ECHO station by its probe core. Bob drafted the rather bored Val and Jeb to help him plant and fertilize the greenhouse, a chore that neither of them enjoyed very much. While the greenhouse did offer a brilliant panoramic view of space, it was uncomfortably warm due to the amount of sunlight it required. Soon enough, Jeb and Val began to silently argue over who would get to head home when it was time to return the results of Bob\u0027s plant growth experiment. Neither one wanted to offend Bob or Bill, who were enjoying themselves in the station, but neither wanted to stay in ECHO station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoon enough, one of them would get the opportunity to head home...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne morning, Bob contacted ground control with an urgent message. \u0022I need to speak to the Director\u0022 he told the radio operator. Ironically, it seemed easier to get a hold of Wernher from orbit than it was from a few doors down -- the very busy Director rarely had time for one on one meetings, but he could always make time for astronauts who were operating in space. \u0022What is it, Bob?\u0022 he asked after a few moments, tersely but quite warmly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, Sir...\u0022 began Bob. \u0022The thing is... And I\u0027m quite embarrassed to say it, but...\u0022 He hesitated, but Wernher\u0027s impatient expression spurred him to continue. \u0022I think that one of your calculations was wrong.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher blinked. He wasn\u0027t questioned often, but he was a scientist; if he was wrong, he wanted to know it. He knew that as director, he could be intimidating, but he didn\u0027t want that to get in the way of his underlings correcting any mistakes he may have made! He explained all of this to Bob, who seemed relieved. \u0022Now, what is it that you think I\u0027m wrong about?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, sir... It\u0027s the amount of oxygen you expected us to go through. We\u0027re running under your prediction, even with the greenhouse pumping in more. It\u0027s not enough to be a problem, but we should handle it before it becomes one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded. \u0022Totally understandable, Bob. Thank you for bringing this to my attention early enough. This is, of course, why we put a station around Kerbin first -- imagine if you were on your way to Duna or Jool! We\u0027d never resupply you in time. In any case -- I\u0027ll put together a mission. I understand that your plant experiment is nearly finished, yes? Why don\u0027t you send one of the pilots down next week? We\u0027ll send up a replacement, along with resupplies, at that time -- as soon as they arrive, either Valentina or Jebediah can return.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNews spread fast aboard the tiny space station, and a short game of struts-probe-boosters later, Valentina had won the right to return with the cargo.

The Prime Minister\u0027s Kerbin Address, as his orbital speech came to be known, rapidly became the most played video across dozens of websites and public support for the space program soared -- as did funding. Soon enough, Wernher had a mission for Jebediah that would make up for missing out on the Mun trip -- Jebediah would be the first Kerbal to go to Minmus. He would travel in a modified Hopper, the Hopper 1.5. Aside from slightly more supplies to reach the more distant Minmus, there weren\u0027t many differences between the Hopper 1 and its successor. Once again, the mission was extremely simple -- head directly there, then straight back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/jxcwthjwh/screenshot159.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot159.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Hopper 1.5 was carried by another Goliath lifter as it fit well within its carrying capacity. In all, this was a fairly routine mission -- the only reason that a manned trip to Minmus hadn\u0027t occured before was that Minmus, which was too small to see unless you were specifically looking for it, didn\u0027t capture the public\u0027s imagination nearly as much as its larger neighbor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/rrdievrpd/screenshot160.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot160.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/wraymtxc1/screenshot163.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot163.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/miihh09a9/screenshot166.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot166.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter making the transfer burn, Jebediah settled back into his capsule. It would be a long trip to Minmus -- over a week, in fact -- but Jebediah didn\u0027t mind. Thanks to Minmus\u0027 lighter gravity, there was enough leeway in the delta-V budget for a few extraneous luxuries, such as a couple of paperbacks. But what really kept Jebediah entertained throughout his journey was the special project Wernher had entrusted him with. Wernher had been working on a few secret designs for a special project that he hoped to use the enthusiasm from the Minmus landing to back, and he had requested that Jebediah give a pilot\u0027s perspective on a few of the ideas for this project, titled Operation JOLT. So Jebediah had plenty to do as he sailed through open space further and further from Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/j06hkm8e9/screenshot167.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot167.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause Minmus was so small, the Hopper 1.5 was placed on a direct collision trajectory.

When you were Director of the Kerbin Space Program, there was always somewhere you needed to be, preferably a few hours ago, so Wernher rarely wasted time sniffing flowers. In this case, his stride carried him through the halls of the Ministry to the office of Prime Minister Harmin. The secretary saw him approach and waved him straight into the office, whose door was already open. Wernher slowed his stride by half a step to nod at her, then continued at his brisk pace. He stepped into the Prime Minister\u0027s office and closed the door behind him. Harmin Kerman was seated at his heavy wood desk, and an air of authority hung about him. To his side stood Smedley Kerman, his trusted adviser.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You have the readings with you?\u0022 demanded Harmin with little preamble.

Smedley leaned in eagerly. Reading from a piece of paper that he pulled out of his lab coat, Wernher began:\u00A0\u0022Approximately eighteen hours ago, Kerbin Station ECHO detected an unusual heat signature in a highly inclined orbit near the Mun. It began tracking the object, which immediately reacted, seeming to instantly sense that it was being tracked. It changed its trajectory by approximately twenty two hundred meters per second in a very short period of time -- three point four seconds, in fact -- transitioning into a polar orbit of the Mun. It passed behind the Mun\u0027s north pole, at which point we lost contact with it. Less than an hour later, Kerbin-based telescopes pointed at the Mun\u0027s south pole detected moderate amounts of ejecta, consistent with rapid lithobraking of an object approximately one hundred tons in weight slamming into the surface of the Mun.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher removed his glasses. \u0022Needless to say, we had no operations in any of the regions involved in these observations. Additionally, no technology currently known on Kerbin is capable of accelerating an object that heavy to that high of a speed that quickly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Prime Minister looked up. \u0022We need to extend our vision, Wernher. How soon can you have plans for a Munar station drawn up?\u0022 Wernher von Kerman smiled. \u0022If you turn to the next page in your package, you\u0027ll see that this is not a question you need to be asking, sir.

As the name implied, it would mostly serve as a staging zone for Munar landers -- modified Hoppers would be capable of landing on the Munar surface and returning to the surface, allowing multiple surveys of the Mun. The Federation was hesitant to spend the money on these landers when all they really wanted was a radar station to track any additional contacts. Wernher was able to convince them of the importance of scouting out the Mun, however, by pointing out that -- with sufficient practice -- the Hopper landers would be capable of reaching the poles, not just areas under the equator. This would allow a manned mission to the possible crash site that was detected, which would obviously be highly desirable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJOLT\u0027s core module was just a cupola, a science lab, and a few antenna, and it was carried to the Mun\u0027s orbit remotely. The launch went smoothly and soon enough the station was in an equatorial low orbit of the Mun. The most notable thing about this launch was the use of the new Incredible 1 Launcher System, which is capable of putting upwards of 75 tons into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s not much else to say about this fairly routine mission -- the station was lifted into space and taken to the Mun\u0027s orbit rather easily. The Incredible 1 was easily able to make a controlled gravity turn, even with its 61 ton payload, and had enough fuel left over in the center stage for a Mun injection burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/ll309jsz9/screenshot209.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot209.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/mbvqfbvcl/screenshot210.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot210.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/j568sth85/screenshot212.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot212.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/fmu8wfgc5/screenshot216.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot216.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/cu11cefzp/screenshot220.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot220.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/6vn825x11/screenshot222.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot222.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/rh1zu2elx/screenshot224.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot224.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/tmwaoki2d/screenshot225.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot225.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/85pmuyg6t/screenshot230.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot230.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/v4hr04mt1/screenshot228.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot228.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the station complete, Wernher had his new task: To man the station.

Now!\u0022 called Jeb across the radio installed in both of their suits. In space, with no atmosphere to spread light around, the darkness came suddenly and with great intensity. Only faint starlight and what little light was reflected from Kerbin\u0027s lit half illuminated Ticella\u0027s readings. She pushed a button and the interface lit up. Radiation readings hadn\u0027t gone down. \u0022We have to tell them, Jeb\u0022 she stated. \u0022If we don\u0027t, we\u0027ll die out here.\u0022 Jeb sighed. \u0022You\u0027re right, Ticella. I was hoping that the instruments were just off from the high radiation levels during the transfer, but no... The Mun doesn\u0027t seem to have a magnetosphere significant enough to protect us in orbit.\u0022 He sighed again as he turned on the long-range radio. \u0022Kerbin Command, this is Mun Station JOLT...

Well, we can harden the additional space, and the astronauts can spend most of their time within the shielded space. That should greatly reduce their radiation exposure. The main issue is that the Mun Station currently does not generate enough power to keep the gravity ring running -- but so long as we simply don\u0027t turn it on, we should be fine.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s10.postimg.org/jj8rryua1/screenshot104.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot104.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter some debate and blame flinging, it was decided to send the Habitation Module into orbit, along with the equipment necessary for the plant growth experiment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s10.postimg.org/6gd58p421/screenshot106.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot106.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s10.postimg.org/mjpm8i5l5/screenshot110.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot110.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s10.postimg.org/vvbo5gi4p/screenshot119.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot119.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s10.postimg.org/4r8neddqh/screenshot132.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot132.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoon enough, the Mun Station had its additional module, and the gravity ring was temporarily inflated to ensure that it was working properly.
