I like building satellites and rover and attach new parts to them and then read the science log etc.\n\nLong story short, what i got already:\n\n**Science mods so far**  **(****tested with 0.9****)**:\n\n- [DMagic Orbital Science](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php?t=64972)\n\n- [LTech](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53813-0-24-0-L-Tech-Scientific-Industries-V2-20) (Stripped for science parts only ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n- [ScanSat](https://github.com/S-C-A-N/SCANsat/releases)\n\n- [Nehemiah Engineering](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/629/Nehemiah%20Engineering%20Research%20Program) (all of them, includes Orbital Science)\n\n- [Solar science](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/611/Solar%20Science)\n\n- [Kdex](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54656-0-23-5-KDEX-Kerbal-Dust-Experiment-v1-02)\n\n- [Tarsier Space Technology](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/608/Tarsier%20Space%20Technology%20with%20Galaxies)\n\n- [Station science](http://Station)\n\n- [PEST](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112259-P-E-S-T-Probe-Expansion-and-Science-Things) (removed some probe cores as i got enough)\n\n- [Karbonite](https://bobpalmer.github.io/UmbraSpaceIndustries/)/K\u002B Stuff from Umbrella Space\n\n- [Banana for Scale](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89570-Banana-for-Scale-Analyse-bananas-in-space!)\n\n- [Nano Kube](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/579/NanoKube:%20Ultra-Small%20Probes)\n\n- [Lionhead Rover pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/12106-0-25-Lionhead-Aerospace-Inc-Icarus-v0-4-updated) (for the robotic arm ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )\n\n#Added from various posts beneath, for more easier find (many Thanks for your help guys im impressed from the helfulness in this forum):\n\n- [Impact](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114087-0-90-Impact%21-impact-science-an-contracts-v1-0-0-27-mar-15) mod (made the parts scaleable)\n\n- [Bargain Parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/58639-0-24-Bargain-Rocket-Parts-v1-1-Bust-out-the-duct-tape-we-re-going-to-space%21?highlight=pizza) (striped only for 4 cool science projects ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )\n\n- [Fuel Science](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67359) (not for me as it adds again even more space labs with nearly the same experiments as station science)\n\n- [Munar Surface Experiment Package](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86247-0-90-Munar-Surfaces-Experiment-package-%28Phase-3-update-now-available!%29) (Perfect!)\n\n- [Real Simple Science](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77555) (another GREAT mod to monitor the viatal signs of your kerbals) **NOT WORKING IN 0.90**\n\n- [Torus](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/221761-stanford-torus-0-6-1?cookieTest=1) (adds 4 new experiments)\n\nMy goal is to get new existing science, so please don\u0027t report mods with another thermometer etc as they will not yield more science. Or make one :-)\n\nAlso if possible not more mods with science labs as i already got a few and its gets crowded in space..... Simple parts preferred.\n\nPS: You can see me and my mun rover adventures here: [MKerb Space Agency](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114195-MKerb-Mun-Rover-MR1) (soon with more science parts ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWhat I would like/Ideas:\n\n- Karbonite Research tool: splits karbonite in its components and you get science from it, gets different science when karbonite percentage differs more than 0,5 percent, so its not just one experiment. To gain the most science karbonite should be mined first and then transfered to the science tool, but crust mining is also ok for lower science value.\n\n- Storm research: Research the weather storms from Orbit of Kerbin or Duna or any other atmospheric planet. (Is this possible ?)\n\n- Test animal exposure to other atmospheres than Kerbin (smaller version of the station science project)\n\n-- Cruel version: expose animals to no athomsphere\n\n-- Expose animals to mun dust, duna dust etc... Do they eat it ?\n\n- Mix Rocketfuel and monopropellant with different binome material ans see what happens: gives science but could also explode. (challange to put this on a rover whithout making it explode....)\n\n- Melt material: Melt surface material and see how it behaves, needs a loot of energy :-) But still suitable for rovers and probes, could also need a scoop arm as a part ?\n\n- Radioactive research: Make Karbonite radioactive and see what happens with that mysterious material.\n\n- Ion research: detect the ion field in space on planets etc...\n\n- Deep Core Drill, drill really deep into the surface of planets, asteroids etc, needs a lot of energy and is a big part like the soil moisture sensor :-)\n\nThanks a whole lot for feedback!\n\nManux\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T17:52:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ManuxKerb**\n  \nnew science"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T18:10:35Z","Content":"Have you got the [Impact](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114087-0-90-Impact!-impact-science-an-contracts-v1-0-0-27-mar-15) mod?
