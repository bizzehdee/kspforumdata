The Turbojet also uses a higher proportion of air to fuel (15:1 vs 12:1), which leads to even better efficiency than the Isp would indicate (I calculate that as using 60% of the fuel a Rapier would use). Both jets are still very fuel efficient however.\n\nGreat analysis, but I think you made an error here. You might note that 8000/15 is the same as 6400/12, the way airbreathers calculate effective Isp has been corrected in 1.0.x to only account for LF used. So the RAPIER consumes 125% of the fuel of the turbojet for the same thrust; or put another way the turbojet consumes 80% of the fuel of the RAPIER for the same thrust level."},{"CreatedByName":"PHO3NIX_F1RE","CreatedById":131024,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T02:21:55Z","Content":"After a \u0027can I actually complete this\u0027 flight, I have found that my craft is capable of flying around Kerbin.

I threw together a little plane and threw it into the sky. I don\u0027t like flying with Kerbals at all, so I threw together a probe plane to circumnavigate Kerbin, powered by the J-33 alternator. All went well, flew around the world, keeping the engine in continuous operation for four straight hours, and approached the runway from the West with a little over 110 fuel left. I disengaged the engine to descend for an unpowered landing.\n\nYou should see the problem now. The batteries gave out right before setdown, but to my engineering credit, this little beauty basically flies itself and landed no issue. The problem? I didn\u0027t engage the brakes before the core stopped responding.

Surprisingly, got a lot better fuel efficiency, circumnavigated the world only to encounter the biggest problem with the K series: The wheels are positioned in a way that even the slightest imbalance in landing terrain causes it to flip and explode on landing.

I happened to have built a craft a few days ago I call the Longhaul mk II. It bears a superficial resemblance to the SR-71 but it wasn\u0027t meant as a clone or tribute or anything. It just happens to be an efficient shape for high speed. The mk I looked a little more traditional and kinda like a B-1. But it had some serious technical issues I guess also like the B-1. So I scrapped the traditional wing/elevator format for the exotic Big S Deltas used here. \n\nIts intended purpose was to survey the mountains on the far side of Kerbin. It managed to do so quite effictively and on its maiden flight, no less. It took only 20 minutes to get to the ranges north of the desert and I was able to fly low over 5 or 6 major ranges before turning back home and landing safely. \n\nThis challenge looked like fun but I wanted to build something new for it. I tried a variety of craft, opting for the large chassis parts and up to 15 or 20 thousand kilos of fuel. Needless to say, they didn\u0027t exactly take to the skies. With traditional wing formats, I was having trouble getting airborne at all. I even tried strapping a kickback to the bellies to try to brute force it skyward. The strongest contender was a flying canard design with the airplane wings on the back and the low level swept wings as canards. It could climb and it handled quite well for such a behemoth but it just didn\u0027t have the guts to get up to speed. Bottom line is, they were all just too heavy and too draggy unless I was willing to strap so many motors to them that the huge amounts of fuel would burn out sooner than the modest 3400 or so in my Longhaul. So, mildly defeated but unashamed, I wheeled it out to the strip last night, took to the skies and turned north. It was smooth sailing. Made it to the ice shelf in like 10 minutes. Then started getting dizzy at the awkward motion below me. I saw the navball spinning but chalked it up to being not quite centered over the pole. Kept flying, checked my map a few minutes later, and saw I was headed southbound maybe 15-20 degrees west of of the KSC. No dice. Called it a night.\n\nFinally, I got back home from work tonight and sat myself down after dinner and got ready to go. I decided on a 270 heading to avoid last night\u0027s problems. Everything went smooth until I reached the west coast. I had chosen a poor climb profile, started overheating, and melted my shock cones as I tried to brute force it over 20 km with not enough speed. I reverted to take off, spooled up my engines, let off the brakes, let myself get up to about 120 m/s then yanked back about a 140 degree rotation from the runway. I never strayed more than a degree north of the 270 heading and kept the nose below 40 degree on the horizon. Got myself up to speed and altitude (900-1100 m/s, 18-23 km) and rode parabolas as needed to keep airspeed and altitude where I found the best running. I flew into the most epic sunrise I\u0027ve seen in KSP and just kept on going through the day and back into the black night. Almost an hour later, I almost missed the Space Center. I had to take a radically steep path down to get myself lined up for arrival and while it wasn\u0027t my most graceful decent or landing, I got to the ground with all people and parts intact. Final time, just under 68 minutes. I would bet that I could improve it by a few minutes and that a good pilot could get this thing back in under an hour. But if I run another, it will be in a new craft. (I would try to limit myself to just enough fuel and a tighter cross section to allow higher/faster flight.)\n\nHere\u0027s the mission gallery:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/YXxr3)\n\nThe craft is a very basic setup with not very many parts. What you see is what you get. Well, with some fuel lines to connect the supplies. But otherwise, nothing extraneous and all as little clipping as possible (done really for asthetics and not for cheesing) Funny side note, When I disembarked the pilots for the final pictures, I completely forgot that I had installed a ladder. And Jeb\u0027s departure sent the female up in the air on a double somersault which she landed gracefully while his own clumsiness left him plummeting straight down from the hatch and onto his head. Anyway, enjoy.

My next one will be single engine and with a little luck, should be under an hour. A quick test flight turned into a full blown attempt earlier tonight but I ran out of gas about 300 km short and had veered 6 or 7 degrees south by the time I was over the last ocean. \n\nI also started looking at gigantic planes again, to see if I get one around twice. I had a 195.5 ton behemoth packing over 27000 fuel on a pretty solid run but I messed up the fuel distribution then hit some turbulence that pulled my nose too far off course to correct and it broke spectacularly over the big desert. And my fuel consumption rate would have only given me about 80-90 minutes. Turns out a dozen ramjets running wide open at mach 3 get a bit thirsty. =D\n\n![7Rqg2Vi.png](http://i.imgur.com/7Rqg2Vi.png)\n\n![4VunTui.png](http://i.imgur.com/4VunTui.png)![HFMOEpr.png](http://i.imgur.com/HFMOEpr.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T14:21:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I didnt see anything about requiring a pilot anywhere :3\n\u003E I guess I\u0027ll have to try again and bring Jeb along for the ride.\n\u003E \n\u003E Ohh well.\n\nI could have sworn I had that in the rules.
