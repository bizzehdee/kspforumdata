I am working on that Jool 500 Challenge, and my first wave contained a 25 kerbal ship with 27 years of hab. It was 300ish tons of dry mass, but with on orbit refuelling, scaling up is pretty reasonable. There is very little drawback to stacking Kerbitats and Hab rings since they weigh so little. Even my little Duna science mission had 2 of each, and that was lots of time. I think my colonization ship with 25 crew had 12 Kerbitats, but whats 36 tons if you are dooming them to a lifetime in a tin can?\n\nI noticed that was a design shift with using USI, in stock there is very little difference between a Mun mission and a Duna Mission. With Hab requirements and supplies requirements, I find my Duna mission is about 3x the mass now, and Jool missions 5x the mass.

My understanding is that the *only* things kerbals need are 1) electricity 2) supplies 3) hab stuff. I have hab time\u0027s effects turned off, my kerbals have access to supplies and power via a supply ship I just docked (and transferred supplies from), but they will not stop being tourists. The only thing I can figure is that running out of replacement parts is somehow affecting the kerbals, but I thought replacement parts were non-functional? They appear in parts\u0027 resources lists in VAB mouseovers (I think), but are invisible in flight. What gives?\n\nVery modded install, I acknowledge it could be a conflict but wonder what that conflict might be if that\u0027s the case... Imagine it is probable \\*I\\* am missing something, though.\n\nReplicate problem:\n\n1. Send kerbals to a station, leave them a very long time (oops). Hab effects are turned on, so are supply effects. They all get grouchy; they\u0027re tourists now.  \n\n2. Turn off hab effects in settings from space center screen.  \n\n3. Send ship with supplies/fertilizer to RDV with station, transfer fertilizer and supplies into the station (in my case, into the insufficient greenhouse that was pitifully attempting to prevent them from starving).  \n\n4. Shouldn\u0027t they spring back to life? Nothing happens now that they have access to supplies, though the control panel says they\u0027re up to 23 days\u0027 worth and hab became \u0022indefinite\u0022 after turning that off.\n\nLog: [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/output_logUSILS.txt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/output_logUSILS.txt)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-19T06:17:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2016 06:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AccidentalDisassembly**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T06:51:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 33 minutes ago, AccidentalDisassembly said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The only thing I can figure is that running out of replacement parts is somehow affecting the kerbals, but I thought replacement parts were non-functional?
