I\u0027d love to see this functionality extended to the B9 aircraft parts (wings, fuselage, cockpits etc) not to mention the stock SP parts. Of course, B9 plane parts already have ablative shielding permanently, but being able to toggle this on or off both visually and functionally in the VAB/SPH would be shweeeeet!!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpanx then\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER x\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T02:18:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it, KSP doesn\u0027t truly mirror symmetric parts even in mirror mode \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 it flips them, so you\u0027d end up with the heat shield on top of the wing on one side.
