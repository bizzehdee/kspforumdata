I think Harvester might\u0027ve mentioned something to do with that when he was talking about the procedural craters we\u0027ve got on the Mun right now. I don\u0027t really recall the specifics, but I think he was considering some type of 3D decal type thing that pops up at a crash site because actually cratering the surface would be too complicated and kill peoples\u0027 PCs. Or something.
