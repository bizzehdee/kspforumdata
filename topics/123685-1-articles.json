I can delete debris, however, I cannot terminate any manned flight (the dialogue box about killing the crew comes up, but when I click \u0022terminate\u0022 the box stays there, and I will be unable to exit the tracking station because of it). I also cannot switch to any flight or debris - if I try either nothing happens, or the game will say \u0022Focus - (nearest celestial body)\u0022 and then zoom out at light speed. At this point if I exit and reenter the tracking station, no tracked objects appear and the UI is messed up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis started happening suddenly, no recent changes as far as mods or anything, and it\u0027s destroyed 2 save games on me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T19:47:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat mods are you using?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xuixien","CreatedById":149208,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T23:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust part mods - SpaceY, station parts, FASA, KW Rocketry \u002B community fixes, USI, tantares, ship manifest.
