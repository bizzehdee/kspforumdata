For example, when your car is parked; your speedometer reads 0 kph/mph. But actually because the earth is rotating, technically you\u0027re not stationary. Even the earth isin\u0027t stationary since it rotates and it also revolves around the sun. And if the big bang theory is true, the sun isin\u0027t stationary either since the force from the big bang is propelling \u003Cstrong\u003Eall of existence\u003C/strong\u003E outwards from the original point where the big bang occurred.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich also leads me to another point, the only fixed point in space is the center of the universe, since everything else is moving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it lead me again to another point. If all of existence is moving away from each other gradually, that would mean in the FAR future you will not be able to determine if time is actually passing. Since you can determine time when events are happening. And because everything is moving outwards, all the matter in existence will be extremely spread apart that you won\u0027t be able to see anything but the black sea of space. You can\u0027t see any stars because they would be SO far that the number of lightyears to determine how far they are from you will be incomprehensible by any type of artificial or living intelligence.

But as far as I know, the current theories are even worse: In 100 trillion years star formation ceases - the is just no enough hydrogen and helium to form any new stars, so some time after that the last star burns out. Most Sunsytems will fall into the black hole in the center of their galaxies or will be flung out, so at this point there are no beatiful structures like our milky way left in the universe. In something like 10^34 (a one with 34 zeros behind it) years the nucleons (protons, neutrons) will start to decay, so that soon black holes are the only thing left in the universe.

Relative to the ground , the person moves at 125kmh. but the train moves at 120kmh so he actually walks at 5kmh relative to the train. (taking into account he moves in the direction of the train). If he dropped a ball inside the train, the ball would fall just like it would while stationary, it wouldn\u0027t move in relation to the train, but it would move at 120kmh in relation to the ground. So everithing inside the train is an isolated system uninfluenced from the outside (ideally), and the train is a member in the Earth isolated system.

Everywhere and nowhere. Think of the Universe like the surface of an expanding balloon. From the perspective of a point on the surface of the balloon (\u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E point on the surface), everything else is seen to be moving away. Where is the center of the balloon? Inside the balloon, so no point on the surface can lay claim to being \u0022the center.\u0022 However, here is where the analogy breaks down; while the Universe is \u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E the surface of the balloon, in that all points move equally away from all other points as the Universe expands, there is no \u0022inside.\u0022 The Universe is all that exists (nitpickers - save the multiverse debates for another time). Thus, at any given point in the Universe we can look in any direction and see that things are moving in all directions equally away from us - in other words, every single point in the Universe will observe itself to be \u0022the center.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, now that we know where the center is, how do we define \u0022stationary.\u0022 The case is similar here. Up to certain constraints, we can say that stationary observers are \u0022everyone and no one.\u0022 I use the word \u0022observers\u0022 here because velocity - and thus the concept of \u0022stationary\u0022 - depends on whom is doing the measuring. Velocity is not an intrinsic property of the Universe, but rather can only be measured between two objects. For instance, Alice and Bob are both out in spaceships far enough away from everything else that they have no reference points. Alice turns her radar gun on Bob and measures Bob to be moving at 1000 mph. Likewise, Bob turns his radar gun on Alice and measures Alice to be moving at 1000 mph. At this point, a cop pulls both of them over for speeding. When the officer starts to write Bob a ticket, Bob tells him \u0022no sir, I was stationary. Alice was the one that was moving.\u0022 Likewise, Alice claims that \u003Cem\u003Eshe\u003C/em\u003E was stationary, and Bob was the one who was speeding. The officer throws up his hands and turns to Einstein, saying \u0022\u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E figure this one out.\u0022 Fortunately, Einstein knows the answer - they are both right. Everyone will always measuring themselves to be stationary, and others to be moving around them. Here on Earth, we have a consensus reference point to use that we like to call \u0022the ground\u0022 - but that\u0027s only because we happen to be living next to something that\u0027s large enough and unforgiving enough that it hurts if we smack into it too hard, and thus it makes sense to give the ground pride of place. In space, that\u0027s not the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I say that everyone will always measure their own velocity to be zero - and this is true - but there is a case where one can, in a sense, measure oneself to be moving. This case is called \u0022acceleration.\u0022 While velocity is not an intrinsic property of the Universe, acceleration (change in velocity over time) is - and you can always measure your own acceleration. So, that constraint I mention above is exactly this - \u0022stationary\u0022 observers (in the sense you mean the term - there is another physics sense, but we won\u0027t get into that) are all observers which are undergoing no acceleration - \u0022inertial observers\u0022 in the parlance of physics, or \u0022observers in free fall\u0022 to use a layman\u0027s term.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Christian365","CreatedById":57859,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T14:26:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the clarifications!

For example, when your car is parked; your speedometer reads 0 kph/mph. But actually because the earth is rotating, technically you\u0027re not stationary. Even the earth isin\u0027t stationary since it rotates and it also revolves around the sun. And if the big bang theory is true, the sun isin\u0027t stationary either since the force from the big bang is propelling \u003Cstrong\u003Eall of existence\u003C/strong\u003E outwards from the original point where the big bang occurred.\u003Cp\u003EWhich also leads me to another point, the only fixed point in space is the center of the universe, since everything else is moving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it lead me again to another point. If all of existence is moving away from each other gradually, that would mean in the FAR future you will not be able to determine if time is actually passing. Since you can determine time when events are happening. And because everything is moving outwards, all the matter in existence will be extremely spread apart that you won\u0027t be able to see anything but the black sea of space. You can\u0027t see any stars because they would be SO far that the number of lightyears to determine how far they are from you will be incomprehensible by any type of artificial or living intelligence.
