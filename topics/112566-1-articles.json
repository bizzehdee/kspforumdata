It seems that it\u0027s not as simple as copying some code from the Procedural Parts, since fairings are obviously shaped differently, but it also doesn\u0027t seem like it should be too hard for someone who knows what they\u0027re doing (i.e., not me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am aware of some additional fairings beyond the cone and egg that come with PF, but in each case each has a single shape and a single texture. Ideally, both shape and texture could be tweakable, necessitating only a single part in the VAB menu; however, just the ability to tweak textures on the available fairing shapes would be sufficient and probably a lot easier to code.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T16:20:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook here and see what you like \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68892-0-23-StretchySRB-Texture-Pack-KW-Procedural-Fairings-March18\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68892-0-23-StretchySRB-Texture-Pack-KW-Procedural-Fairings-March18\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"woot","CreatedById":102873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T16:51:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MeCripp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MeCripp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELook here and see what you like \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68892-0-23-StretchySRB-Texture-Pack-KW-Procedural-Fairings-March18\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68892-0-23-StretchySRB-Texture-Pack-KW-Procedural-Fairings-March18\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used that mod back in .23 or so, but it as I recall it only added a couple additional fairings rather than allowing the regular PF textures to be tweakable.
