It seems that it\u0027s not as simple as copying some code from the Procedural Parts, since fairings are obviously shaped differently, but it also doesn\u0027t seem like it should be too hard for someone who knows what they\u0027re doing (i.e., not me).\n\nI am aware of some additional fairings beyond the cone and egg that come with PF, but in each case each has a single shape and a single texture. Ideally, both shape and texture could be tweakable, necessitating only a single part in the VAB menu; however, just the ability to tweak textures on the available fairing shapes would be sufficient and probably a lot easier to code."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T16:20:27Z","Content":"Look here and see what you like ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68892-0-23-StretchySRB-Texture-Pack-KW-Procedural-Fairings-March18](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68892-0-23-StretchySRB-Texture-Pack-KW-Procedural-Fairings-March18)"},{"CreatedByName":"woot","CreatedById":102873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T16:51:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Look here and see what you like ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68892-0-23-StretchySRB-Texture-Pack-KW-Procedural-Fairings-March18](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68892-0-23-StretchySRB-Texture-Pack-KW-Procedural-Fairings-March18)\n\nI used that mod back in .23 or so, but it as I recall it only added a couple additional fairings rather than allowing the regular PF textures to be tweakable. It also seems that only one fairing has been updated for 1.0. Am I misunderstanding the OP and he\u0027s added tweakable textures?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:50:14Z","Content":"There are 4 different downloads and choices and have you looked at PF cfg and the old ? the old still work and what textures are you wanting where on PF or tanks ?"},{"CreatedByName":"woot","CreatedById":102873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T22:03:11Z","Content":"Ok I took a look at all the downloads on that page, and the last one does include a fairing with a texture switching module, although at the moment it only allows a couple different logos to be added.

Once I get the kinks worked out I\u0027ll probably do it as a MM patch so I can keep it all in one place."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T22:35:33Z","Content":"Here is some more if you want MainSailor Gamma Textures [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103761-MainSailor-s-Gamma-Textures-%28for-Procedural-Parts%29-DDS-Edition!-UPDATED-19-May!-%28v1-11%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103761-MainSailor-s-Gamma-Textures-%28for-Procedural-Parts%29-DDS-Edition!-UPDATED-19-May!-%28v1-11%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"WalkingShadow89","CreatedById":108181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T20:42:32Z","Content":"How do I switch the textures, it doesn\u0027t have the option to do it"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T20:55:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How do I switch the textures, it doesn\u0027t have the option to do it\n\nDid you install the Firespitter plugin ?"},{"CreatedByName":"WalkingShadow89","CreatedById":108181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T01:21:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Did you install the Firespitter plugin ?\n\nyes but it still doesn\u0027t work"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T03:30:21Z","Content":"You must have a old Firespitter plugin or you installed Gryphon Corp. textures for Procedural Fairings wrong if anything is using Texture switcher you have to watch the file path."}]}
