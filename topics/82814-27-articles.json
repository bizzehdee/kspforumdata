The F-16 was more of a pure fighter... at least until General Dynamics (now LockMart) saw how the F/A-18 was eating the foreign market and added laser designators and electronics to turn it into a multirole fighter, which is what fighter-bomber aircraft are these days. I will remind you that the term was coined before there were electronics, BTW, so assigning your quite arbitrary characteristics (which the hornet still complies with, BTW) is a bit meaningless.

The \u0022Multirole\u0022 moniker has started being applied very recently, when new missions like ECM cover and SAM site neutralization came up, development cost of a new plane platform also came up sharply, and the missions were fulfilled with existing fighter platforms suitably modified. As missions became more varied over time, the mission platforms became less specialized, until right now there haven\u0027t really been new bomber designs since the stealth generation, everything is multirole fighters with as much payload as possible and the main difference between them is size and the access to weapon systems of the owner. It is like the arguable distinction between interceptors and fighters, that was based mostly on range and makes less sense with each passing day, as the main difference is the weapon system of choice and whether or not it is BVR. F-15s, for example, could count as everything from recon craft to bombers, inlcuding both heavy and light fighters and interceptor, it all depends in what\u0027s in the pylons and behind the radome, hence the ascendancy of the \u0022multirole\u0022 classification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

The time of specialized munition platforms married to a specific weapon system is over, and wars being what they are nowadays, and the rise of the drone and AESA radars, manned warplanes are going to be as multirole as they get. I expect them to increase in weight and favour twin seaters too as drones become more of a standard as munition platforms, they are going to like having big manned fighters as a short of Mini-AWACS support.

Drones will have a big part in the air to ground wars but very little parts in the air to air wars. I think that we will be having fighters like the T-50 in the future. Official statements include information about 5 radar arrays, one 1526 TR module X-band AESA, two sidelooking X-band300 TR AESA, and two L-band AESAs in the wings for counter-stealth and jamming L-band radars along with a most likely rear facing X-band AESA. Not only that but with a 360 degree IRST system along with a independent MAWS system and DIIRCM jamming systems. Combined with high speed supercruise \u0026gt;M1.8 thanks to the T-50s just plain silly huge fuel reserve, extremely high altitude operations thanks to the new life support systems, and high maneuverability to boot. My bet is that the T-50 will use it\u0027s sensors at a standoff range while passing that off to cheaper drones to attack ground targets, for air contacts I imagine the T-50 will engage those by itself. My assumption is that the drones that will attack the targets the T-50 designates will be extremely simple, engine, RWR/MAWS,stealthy shape, and a low IR engine with high efficiency to give it a large range, preferably to keep up with the T-50s. Anyway, I will stop derailing this thread, this will be my last message on this topic.
