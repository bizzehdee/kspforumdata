At this point I was only losing around 1.5m/s in altitude and I believe I could\\\u0027ve reached the next continent, but I stopped after another minute or so of flying. Occasionally I would even gain a few (appx. 5m) meters of height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome info about the MD Flying Squirrel MK II\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vehicle is all stock parts except for the bits which connect the booster LFEs to the glider\\\u0027s wings. I used the packaging jigs here from the Kosmos pack because they are easier to place and more aesthetically pleasing. Stock radial decouplers should suffice just fine if trying to convert this to pure stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original design did not have the set of delta wings towards the rear. The canards below the wings were originally there, but my first design didn\\\u0027t have enough lift so I moved them down (wanted to keep them to aide steering) and added the delta wings. The delta wings and swept wings are slightly rotated so they run parallel with the ground though they are not in the center of the main fuselage, they are both also slightly pitched upwards to aide in lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boosters last for just over 2 minutes. They\\\u0027re not perfectly parallel with the glider\\\u0027s fuselage, so it can be a bit of a pain to control on the runway. Honestly, I just couldn\\\u0027t be bothered to rotate them because I knew it wasn\\\u0027t going to be that important once I took off, and it gets air at full throttle a few seconds after ignition. You can even retract the gear at around 100m/s (gained quickly because of the little weight) and it will take off near vertical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI flew up to appx. 10km up and ejected the boosters. I originally doubted the new design because I was losing altitude fairly fast. However, after the atmosphere began to thicken, descent declined to around 10m/s loss around 5.5/6km, and when I reached appx. 3km, it had diminished to appx. 1.5m/s loss in altitude. I imagine as I continued to approach sea level, this declination in loss would continue to less than 1m/s. The efficiency of the craft could probably be improved simply by toying with the height and angle at which I decouple the boosters. I\\\u0027m certain I could reach the continent to the east of KSC, and, with a bit of tweaking, possibly get this glider to one of the poles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boosters on the glider will get it to orbital height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"scratch","CreatedById":228,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T18:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\\\u0027t we just use this thread for the society?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-01T00:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds good....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVERYONE DROP EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone should use this glider!!!!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E you say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, Here it is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust try it and you\\\u0027ll love it....flies forever on SAS Control!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroPelican","CreatedById":28509,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-01T18:13:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, just wow, I am horrible with spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-02T01:03:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made a glider named: \u0027Polar Express\u0027.
