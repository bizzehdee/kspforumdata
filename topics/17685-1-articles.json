To create something that\u0027s capable of everything space ships do in sci-fi! That means a single stage, verticle take off and landing vehicle. Something that\u0027s either a VTOL spaceplane or a rocket. It has to have enough fuel to perform orbital operations (possibly a planet vist, landing or fly by later on in developement) and be able to return to Kerbin on a powered landing. To give you an idea, I\u0027m basically seeking the Millenium Falcon, USS Enterprise, Tardis, Jupiter 2, Bebop/ Swordfish etc. Not exact replicas or anything, just giving you all some inspiration \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Not a vehicle designed for one purpose, but several!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the challenge is to build the ultimate sci-fi space craft! There are no real rules, but stock parts and physics would be preffered. (unless you want to take the liberty of adding lasers or something). There are no rankings beyond bragging rights. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost pictures/ video of any craft you might make. Make sure your hud is enabled so we can see the mission timer and fuel levels. The closer you get to completing the challenge the better, but obviously it\u0027s totally cool to post your nearly successful attempts/ failures. Electronic brownie points for anyone able to complete this!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBONUS POINTS: Can your ship make a landing and take off again? (Kerbin or other bodies) Can you make a water take-off/ landing?
