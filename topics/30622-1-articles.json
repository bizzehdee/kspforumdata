The way I like to do it is to fly very low (again it depends on the body, but for Mun I usually use about 5km) over where I want to land and then burn retrograde until I\u0027m falling straight down. From there, it\u0027s not too hard to adjust your trajectory and land where you want to. This is by no means the most efficient way to do it, you can use epic maths skills to make it so that you only need to pass over your landing site by 1 or 2km, but that\u0027s less reliable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is an atmosphere, it\u0027s a bit harder.

You can either burn on the opposite side of the Mun to your landing spot, expending the least amount of fuel possible, or you could burn directly over your site, killing all horizontal velocity. Ideally, you want a mixture of the two, as the former requires you to kill a lot of velocity on your final approach, and the latter eats up a lot of fuel. I find a good balance is to burn retrograde when your lander is approximately 45 degrees away from your landing site, but feel free to experiment. In the end, you want your orbit to be intersecting the ground a little further out from your landing zone.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECoast down towards your landing site. This part requires you to be on the ball. You don\u0027t want to start braking too high up, but neither do you want to try to burn when you\u0027re 500 metres above the ground. Remember, quicksave is your friend in this case.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPut down landing legs.

Your aim here is to kill all of your velocity, both the velocity you have accumulated while falling towards the Mun, and also the velocity you started out with in orbit. Try to get a feel for your lander, and figure out how quickly it accelerates; landers with higher Thrust to Weight Ratios are a lot easier to handle at this point, as they can kill their speed a lot quicker. Ideally you want to reach zero exactly when you reach ground level, but this is not always the case. If you stop before your landing site, no worries, take a look at the next step. Again, feel free to hold F9 if you screw up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDescend the final few metres. Unless you are a cyborg, you likely did not reach zero velocity exactly at ground level. As such, your lander will be stationary in the air above your landing site. To rectify this problem, simply cut the throttle and let yourself fall. However, it is not recommended to fall too far, and possibly throttle up a bit so that your velocity doesn\u0027t get out of hand. Keep your velocity below 10 m/s when you reach ground level, and you will land safely! Note that you also will be dealing with horizontal velocity, so keep your nose pointed at your yellow retrograde marker the whole way.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESettle onto your landing legs, extend your ladder, deploy your solar panels, activate lights and scientific instruments, and finally EVA your kerbal and plant a flag detailing your remarkable achievement.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ETips: \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe altitude numbers at the top of the screen display your current height above sea level, not the ground.
