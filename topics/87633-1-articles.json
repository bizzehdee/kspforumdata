The extremely hostile aerospace environment demands the lowering of launch costs, and thus the cost of sending fuel to orbit. One of the main aspects in which we can theoretically lower cost with present day technology is in the more fuel efficient launch of fuel to orbit, which we can use to extend our reach into the kerbol system and beyond. It is your goal to improve fuel economy or be left biting the dust.
