I attempted to validate game files, which caused severe computer lag until Steam was forcibly closed. Afterwards, any time Steam tried to access KSP in any way (validating files, launching, attempted uninstall), the whole system would lag until steam was force-closed. Since Steam wants to update any time it starts, even with the action paused, there will be at least some lag. I ended up trying to delete the game manually, but found that the lag returned when attempting to delete it manually as well, requiring a force-closing of Windows Explorer. At this point I\u0027ll mention that the task manager shows no difference in CPU or RAM usage while this lag is occurring. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started deleting bits and pieces of KSP, until only Gamedata \u0026gt; Squad remained, so I don\u0027t think this could have resulted from a mod, since they should all be uninstalled at this point. Attempting to access the Squad folder causes the lag to start again, requiring a force-quit of Explorer. That\u0027s as close as I can get before the whole thing totally locks up. However, I believe whatever the problem is may originate in the Agencies folder, as it\u0027s the only subfolder to have been modified today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d really appreciate some help with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Right-clicking the remaining folder and selecting Properties causes explorer to freeze, but shows that it has a filesize of 0 bytes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit Edit: Solution for Googlers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Click the windows button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Select My Computer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Right click the drive on which the problems are located.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Select Properties, and click the Tools tab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Under the option that says error-checking, click Check Now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: The box that says \u0022Automatically fix file system errors should already be checked.

Once it starts finding the bad sectors, progress will become much slower. It should look something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/13OvxNG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213OvxNG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo not shut off your computer, or you may risk data loss. In my case, there were 20 bad sectors, and the whole process took about half an hour. I can\u0027t stress enough that while it may seem to have stopped working, just give it time. If you like, keep an eye out for any files you recognize. You may find that there were bad sectors in places you didn\u0027t expect. For example, below you see an error called \u0022Partlist\u0022, which is most likely the KSP location that this thread was made for. However, I also recognize \u0022pcsx2\u0022, a Playstation 2 emulator. Had I attempted to use that program, I probably would have experienced the same lag that accessing KSP caused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mtbjbhA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mtbjbhA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter CheckDisk finishes, your computer will automatically restart. You should now be lag-free, as I was, but be warned. All of this is likely a sign of a failing drive, so I\u0027d recommend backing up your files elsewhere now. Actually, do that anyway. My drive may last another day or 5 years, but I always recommend getting an external drive to keep things backed up on. External drives are like, so, so great you guys.
