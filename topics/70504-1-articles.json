I\u0027ve got the core up there and ready. I built some pretty awesome habitat modules that can house 20 kerbals. They\u0027re big. It took me 5 redesigns of the rocket to figure out how to to get it into orbit, but I finally can. But now I have a problem. Usually, I run out of fuel. In the case of these habitat modules, I still have half the fuel of the final stage of rockets left...but I\u0027m out of power. I can decouple the rockets from the habitat, but the RCS thrusters aren\u0027t nearly enough to intercept the station core. I tried sending up a tug, but it ran out of gas. Then I tried sending up a fuel ship, but it ran out of gas too. So now I have 5 pieces floating around with no movement ability. Great start. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, my question is, how can I increase the electric capability of the rocket engines? Do I need to mount batters or solar panels to the rockets themselves? Any ideas?
