But is it for EVA only? In 1.11 I kinda remember that what you set it, it became the suit both for EVA and IVA... it was the case, wasn\u0027t it? Now I am using a brand new 1.12 install (and yes, texture replacer and kerbalized suits) and suddenly I became very aware that the \u0022new\u0022 stock function of \u0022design your own suit\u0022 (so nevermind if it is modded or not) is meant only for EVAs. As far as aI remember it affected both! Now, I pick a suit and it only applies on EVA. So they \u0022change clothes\u0022 everytime they go through an airlock. Weird.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, to make things short, is there a way I can force my selectable EVA suit into IVA as well? So the chosen suit remeins the same all the time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
