The process of a meteorite impact is simple: meteor hit ground, dirt flew everywhere, round-ish crater rim (and perhaps rebound peak) was left behind (In many cases u can extend this with \u0027weathering/tectonic motion occured resulting in distortion/destruction of crater rim\u0027, even in cases where the area looks very unlike a crater, using the justification of further changes over time). The process of anything else may be just as simple or it could be much more complicated, but if you\u0027re not offering processes then you\u0027re not really offering anything except discouragement.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEverything here is reading between the lines, there isn\u0027t anything concrete, so denouncing a weak theory on the basis that the evidence is weak (when you haven\u0027t got stronger evidence of anything else to offer) isn\u0027t very sporting. I\u0027m quite happy to modify the overview in light of superior evidence arising later, but I choose not to dismiss or discourage theories on the basis that they don\u0027t seem very likely.

theories on Kerbin:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin, as well as all the other planets in the system, have cores made of an ultradense element (164),\u00A0one that is only created in intense atomic collisions, such as those in cyclotrons or supernovae. This element sits at the hypothetical \u0022Island of Stability,\u0022 where, despite having a massive number of protons, its atomic structure is such that it has a half-life of millions of years. This accounts for the\u00A0absurd density of the planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy other theory is that the material is a form of Quark Matter, which some theories suggest would be extremely stable--maybe even more so than atomic matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause it is so small, it lacks much in the way of tectonic motion,\u00A0but maintains a fairly stable magnetic field due to its rapid rotation and molten core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin is so small and rotates so quickly that it lacks the uneven surface heating responsible for global wind patterns. The same goes for the water. Due to its lack of axial tilt relative to Kerbol, it lacks seasons. Because of the lack of convection and wind, there is no movement of water or heat,\u00A0and thus no large weather patterns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craters on the surface are from the impact of a massive icy comet, which formed the Mun. The remnants of the impactor later recoalesced into Minmus. The debris from the impact form the asteroid belt near Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane. The spurt of volcanic activity resulting from such a large impact formed Kerbin\u0027s giant mountains, as well as the Booster Islands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-22T18:07:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2016 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kmMango\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T23:33:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe massive Ice comet theory has some holes. \u00A0One, it should sublimate off into space at kerbins orbital height. \u00A0This means the minmus must be very new, and not completely gone yet (If it is Ice). \u00A0If this impact occurred that recently, all of kerbalkind would be dead, even if they where underground. \u00A0The surface would be entirely swept clean of all life, and evoloution would be set back far enough for the re-evouloution of trees to take enough time for mimnimus to melt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snikersnee","CreatedById":145105,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-23T01:24:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo is the\u00A0Kerbin Geographic Society gonna have exploration ships, patches and stuff, or are we going to just discuss things?
