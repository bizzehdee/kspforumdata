The faster an object with rest mass moves through space, the slower it moves through time. It turns out that with some relatively simple derivations you can Demonstrate that adding an object\u0027s movement through time and movement through space always yields a constant. This is also true for particles with zero rest mass which experience infinite time dilation and move at precisely c.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe connection I made while pondering was that dark energy may have a similar relationship to another quantity that is assumed to be unrelated.

That post does not do the topic justice at all, the basic problem is the effect needs to be defined in context and no context is given. I now have the science editorial and primary review literature, even the editorial is pretty heavy, the paper, well its physics on steroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetween 60 to 80% of \u003Cem\u003Ee = mc\u003C/em\u003E\u003Csup\u003E\u003Cem\u003E2\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/sup\u003E in our visible universe is described as DE. The current opinion is that this energy is distributed in one or more fields that are spread uniformly about space. The field is entirely different from Higgs field, which is in the GeV to TeV range, the Dark Energy Field (DEF) is punitively in the meV range, a trillionth to quadrillionth the intensity of the Higgs field.

A clever defeatist attitude that actually follows the mathematical definition of the squeeze (remember limits in calculus and how we eventually ended up with derivatives, \u003Cem\u003Ethese\u003C/em\u003E limits are not that well defined, and statistically are referred to as exclusive confidence limits as opposed to inclusive confidence limits such as height ranges of students). But here we are working in multiple dimensions and so we need to squeeze theoretical planes, spaces, hyperspaces, . . ., and \u003Cem\u003Ehysterically-insane- space\u003C/em\u003E (If you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re a computer programmer you probably have no problem with this since you can play with as many dimensions as your memory permits and not really concern yourself with physical reality). All of these dimensions are different ways of characterizing space-time, if you think about it there are 3-dimensions to space (probably the least relevant), time, energy density, mass density, em density (or magnetic field or electric field density), . . . . . , and - hiding in the corner - DEF density. Scientist are smart enough to know their limitations, they want to play with dark energy in such a way as to define how it can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be played with, therefore leaving open other ways (potentially impossible ways) that it might be played. If this all doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t make sense, don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worry I haven\u0027t added quantum mechanics yet . . . . . . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically if DEF has a density of meV and you are say sitting on Earth you immediately have a problem, the space that surrounds you is literally filled with obvious things that have e = mc\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E ; well above DEF. And so of course DE is not going to be detectable. So step one is to remove the biggest source of energy, that being matter, so you create a vacuum, and put it in a chamber the shields the vacuum from all other matter (is this beginning to sound like the experiment for the Cannae drive?). Next thing you do is you put 1 atom in that vacuum and you begin teasing it to see how they behave. This particular group created a laser with an interior separated by a chamber in which Cesium atoms were dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen they observed the fate of Cesium. Why did they do this, ok, so read the paper and it get more confused. Here is my impression.

It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a collection of theories. So you have to take a stance and test against that stance, which could be a fault in the papers approach (i.e. seed a critique). Many of the physicist here would already note that inertia is created by specific other fields and so if interaction is specific to matter it means it must be defined by exclusivity of specific other fields and not all other fields.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027arial narrow\u0027;\u0022\u003ESo in the lab, we have to detect with e*, which of course interact with the Cosmon and affects DEF, presumably in a modulatory manner, so the more matter you use in the detection the less signal you are eventually able to detect, and then you have a rapidly decreasing signal:noise ratio. Never a good thing unless you are studying fractals or chaos theory statistics. In any case e* for the editorial is defined as matter.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Partial summary Quintessence theories are a group of theories in which: DEF changes intensity depending on how non-DEF energy (mostly matter) interacts with Cosmon. Cosmological Constant DEF does has no negative correlation with this energy at any scale. So basically if any Quintessence theory is correct, then there should be a delta-intensity dependency (statistical-r) \u003Cem\u003Eat some scale\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy the partial summary, OK, one of the dimensions that is Beta, the delta-intensity, is measured as the matter coupling parameter. Previously this has been measured with neutrons in a vacuum bouncing off of a surface (under gravity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis study has looked at the residual acceleration imparted on Cesium atoms in a spherical vacuum chamber, and found that the acceleration is below 5.5 microns/sec\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E of course the cesium atoms are very small (2.2 E-22 * 5.5 E-6 = 1.21E-27 N) so that level of acceleration is rather small. And as a matter of fact it appears to have been accelerating in the wrong direction. So that while Beta might have a value of 10E14, this study places beta at less than 10E5 and further refinements of the current study place Beta at less than 1 and therefore cannot explain DEF in most Quintessence theories (see above for critique).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reality is that 5.5E-6 is the upper bound for single tail confidence limit, the actual value was a = -0.7 u, and thus it is easy to believe that acceleration is zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E There are a set of figures in the paper, Figures 3a-c which they define are the \u003Cem\u003Elimits \u003C/em\u003Eof the DEF according to their and other works, these are expressed in different dimensions that include two types of Beta. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are critiques of this paper, the work had to be done before 6:30 AM (presumably because of human traffic) and it was very dependent on the measure of gravity, which was given as 9.780. The paper claims that reversing the polarity on the laser takes care of systemic issues and thus allow a more refined estimation of acceleration. The problem is that we are looking at micro-level acceleration, and acceleration experiments simply stated do not produce gravity to that level of accuracy (although very careful measurements of a\u003Csub\u003Eg\u003C/sub\u003E are good beyond 7 decimal places it requires a special environment to achieve this), and in fact, we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know what the gravitational constant is at that level of precision. So there is a basic assumption that quantum gravity is not at play within their apparatus. In fact the confidence interval is about 10 times the difference from the calculated beta. The other problem is mass, if DEF is roughly 4 atoms in a cubic meter, the cesium 133 is a lot more massive than that, and, according to the authors there were some residual hydrogen atoms in the chamber. So we are assuming here that the e* can be similar or higher than DEF for Quintessence to work, it could easily need to be smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, we can draw a conclusion that if the DEF needs to be in the 10E4 range to support Quintessence based on matter, then there is inadequate acceleration in this experiment to support matter as a Cosmon/DEF effector. Which leaves non-material energy or combinations of EM and matter at a much lower scale. But I offer a different caveat, what if DEF is not negative linear correlation with matter, what if the scale is power negative linear, and only linear at very low masses per unit space, say the mass of an neutron or lower (or as they say the DEF would stretch repelling neutrons that are separated by spaces on the order of meters apart. What if the DEF intensity increase markedly when two elementary particles are separated by distances of meter of open space, then the devise they have created would not produce this result. Therefore it looks as if either DEF does not exist within our galaxy or is so weakly interacting with matter that it cannot be detected. What if DEF power increases with the realization of matter separation that it initiates and that these events are sporadic in intergalactic space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current finding creates more problems than it explains, because if the Universe accelerated expansion 5 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 10 billion years ago, the Quintessence model is tolerant of energy shift whereas the Constant model is not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERefs: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtom-interferometry constraints on dark-energy.
