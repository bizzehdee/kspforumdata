I know it\u0027s not *quite* dropped yet, but what I mean is, SQUAD came in for a lot of criticism from the community for the way they previously had handled updates (cf. Resources debacle, etc), and how the information wasn\u0027t getting out to the community, and it was making people frustrated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I want to say is that the amount of information, the way it was presented, the connectivity and interactivity, and just the general anticipation that has personally been built in me for this update has been handled really well by the team. This includes, but isn\u0027t limited to, all the dev blogs, PD\u0027s KSP weekly, the early preview videos (such as PD\u0027s with C7, Scott Manley, etc), and just generally a lot more openness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s made me really excited for the update, we\u0027re pretty confident about what\u0027s in and what\u0027s not, the features that are visible are great, and the ones that aren\u0027t have been explained as to why they\u0027re there (eg: game-breaking saves).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in summary, Bravo Harv et al.!

Ever since he arrived, things have been going way smoother, the communication with the devs has been boosted by 100000x, he\u0027s making everything to give us the most he can. From what I heard, he is the one who organized and added the developer updates to the KSP weeklies, he is the one who managed to give the media group an experimental build of the new update and the right to make videos showing it. If I\u0027m not wrong, he\u0027s also the one who managed to get the Steam cards. He also has been commenting on controversial topics giving the developer\u0027s input on the subject many times. Really, Maxmaps has been working his ass off for us all and I think he deserves a big thanks for all the efforts he has been putting with the community ever since he was hired.
