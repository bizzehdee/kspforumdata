I prefer it to be on for the larger / higher mass side of the docking, as the other side is the one that will most easily be pulled into alignment by the magnetism. E.g. docking to a complex station, I\u0027ll use a brief blip of time warp to ensure that all rotation really is zeroed out and then leave SAS on for the station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"benzman","CreatedById":82512,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T21:21:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESAS is intended to keep you ship in the same orientation. I find that if I want to rotate a large, heavy, wobbly object like a space station then the best thing to do is to turn off the SAS and give a quick puff of RCS to start the craft slowly turning. When the ship has turned to where you want it another quick puff of RCS to stop it, then engage the SAS. Saves on electricity and RCS fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
