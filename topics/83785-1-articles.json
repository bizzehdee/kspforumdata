What kind of engine do you have on that lander? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral rules are 7200 delta-V total for a Mun landing mission and about 6800 for Minmus.

A lander with \u003Cstrong\u003Eat least \u003C/strong\u003E2700 m/s of delta-V should be able to make it to either destination, land and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour craft description is inadequate for me to make a 100% accurate assessment. I\u0027m assuming \u0022some batteries and panels\u0022 is two Z-100s and 2 OX-STATS. I\u0027ll also assume a quad of LT-1 Lander Legs is part of the design. I figure if you\u0027re using a 48-7S engine you should have 3332 m/s of delta-V; with an LV-909 you\u0027ve got 4321 m/s. Munar surface TWR with the 48-7S should be around 5.7, and with the LV-909 it should be 8.47. So you should be okay either way, though I would certainly consider adding a chute and a decoupler in there somewhere for when the whole thing has to come back home...neither of which will affect the capabilities of the craft all that much (3090 m/s of delta-V with the 48-7S).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m assuming the \u0022landing failed\u0022 because of how the craft was piloted. If you\u0027re a beginner, a Mun landing is one of the early milestones and it takes practice practice practice. Folks here have given you good tutorials to follow, but basically you want to make sure you\u0027re going slow enough that when you hit the deck you\u0027re not exceeding the impact tolerance of the parts you\u0027re using (roughly 12 m/s, and ideally you don\u0027t want to be going much more than 5 m/s on impact if you don\u0027t want to risk parts breaking off). My advice - quicksave before you make the attempt (that way you can quickload and try again if need be), and make use of IVA; one of the gauges there is a radar altimeter, which will give you your true altitude above ground level. When it starts twitching, you\u0027ll have a rough estimate of the ground elevation (i.e. what your altimeter will say when you\u0027ve reached the deck) and can use that to figure out when you need to be going slow.
