For an INTJ, the Auxiliary Function is Extraverted Thinking. So Thinking is how the outside world is engaged, and it is very practical for many things. However it does not lend itself to the touchy-feely kind of behaviour. Furthermore, the Tertiary Function is Introverted Feeling (yes - INTJs have feelings, but they are on the inside!).

I feel like it is difficult to talk about the MBTI in any depth without considering the functions as described by Carl Jung. Really, I feel like the MBTI is more useful as a means to an end rather than an end to itself. In other words, it tells you things about your personality in broad strokes but shouldn\u0027t be used for deep analysis. The Functions, however, can get a bit more in depth and I find they can be more descriptive and nuanced. Ex. For me, I find Ti,Ne,Si,Fe to be much more descriptive of WHY I tend to approach the world in a certain way than just \u0022INTP\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the functions allow us to see the very clear differences between INTJ and INTP, I think the most often confused personality types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EINTP: Ti,Ne,Si,Fe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EINTJ: Ni,Te,Fi,Se\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, according to the MBTI you would think the personalities are super similar.

I haven\u0027t watched daytime soaps in a long long time, but I do watch and get emotionally involved with things like Glee and Teen Wolf, they\u0027re pretty close but not true serials. And Babylon 5 fits every definition of soap opera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Flymetothemun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Flymetothemun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI might be an exception to the rule, but I\u0027m INTJ (As far as I know) and I absolutely love hugs as long as they\u0027re from somebody I trust and am comfortable with.

In the \u0022Career Choices\u0022 segment it lists that psychology, writing, music, and humanitarian qualities are among the things I take interest in, with a strong tendency towards design. Since all of those are key elements in video game development, it\u0027s not surprising that I want to do game design. Also, all of those traits are themes for the Persona JRPG series, which are my absolute favorite eastern RPG games.
