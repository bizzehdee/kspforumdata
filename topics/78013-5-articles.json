I wanted to give this some thought and do some research first, however. I\u0027ve decided not to cover landing guidance, as that\u0027s even more tricky than ascent. So here goes the trick to Ascent Guidance with MechJeb/NEAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off. MechJeb uses the stock physics model to do it\u0027s calculations and knows NOTHING about what NEAR is doing, so certain features in the ascent guidance module DO NOT FUNCTION with NEAR installed. The important one is \u0022limit to terminal velocity.\u0022 If you\u0027re in the habit of checking this box, uncheck it. Instead, check \u0022Limit acceleration to\u0022 and enter the value \u002223 m/s.\u0022 This will reduce your acceleration to terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity turn: What MechJeb does ISN\u0027T one, and with NEAR a gravity turn is what you MUST do, or you will tumble out of control. So... We\u0027re going to use MechJeb to closely approximate a gravity turn as near as we can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at your TWR. If your TWR is 1.2, set your gravity turn to begin at 1.5km. Set your turn percentage to 90%. Set your end of turn to 70km. You will need to play with the end of turn angle to find something which works, but the value will be \u002B- 5 degrees. If your TWR is higher, set your turn lower. For my rocket with a TWR of 1.7, I begin my gravity turn at 700m. The reason for this is that you need to begin your turn at a speed of 100m/s, and the math will tell you at what altitude that is. If your TWR is \u0026gt;2, your turn will begin at ground level. No gravity turn will ever begin higher than 2km. Turn percentage needs to be high, because you are only turning VERY gradually. Turn on the navball guidance and watch as the target point and your velocity vector track together. The better they track, the better your turn. Too far outside this and you will tumble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will get you safely into space every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-20T03:08:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2014 03:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by BrianMcNett\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T03:09:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETerminal velocity in NEAR is not terminal velocity in stock.
