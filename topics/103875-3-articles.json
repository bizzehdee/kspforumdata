It\u0027s not the first time they said that either. First time I remember it was over two years ago, so this wasn\u0027t a matter of not making the deadline. It looks like they have a vision for reentry that doesn\u0027t quite line up with your vision. Or maybe they plan on using something that\u0027s already in the (v1.0) game, like fairings. There\u0027s quite a lot of wiggle room in what has actually been said, and we don\u0027t have enough info to really evaluate this.\n\nAs for complete, they said that the game would have everything that they originally envisioned would be in the game. They also said that development of the game would continue. Yeah, I expect some fan reviews to be upset by a non-final 1.0, but to be honest, anyone looking at the game from the outside probably wouldn\u0027t realize that there\u0027s some minor stuff missing.\n\nI\u0027m I saying that 1.0 is going to be close to perfect? Nope, too soon to tell. I\u0027ve always been sceptical of devs that say they\u0027re going to fix everything in a single patch, but at least it sounds like the game will be less buggy (especially memory leaks, which are a major issue with 0.90). The major functionality is going to be there. We won\u0027t know how well it hits the target until we get our hands on it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T10:42:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 10:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Eric S**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T11:07:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E One thing I forgot to point out before: There\u0027s no such thing as rounded fairings in KSP at all.

It\u0027s perfectly straightforward to make things that look quite round enough. Ie 90% of parts in the game.\n\nYeah, but using the point-by-point drawing system, you can ALSO draw round-LOOKING fairings. They won\u0027t be actually round, but then again, the other, third party fairings, aren\u0027t actually round either.\n\nIt will just be click-ier, that\u0027s all.\n\nThe no-round-fairings bit is the pedantic and irrelevant thing (actually more like wrong and irrelevant), as you can draw them as close to round as you like~ I seem to recall reading somewhere that the fuel tanks have a very small number of sides (relatively speaking) of something like... [24](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Part_Modelling_Guidelines#Standards) or 32 or such. Making a payload fairing by hand that\u0027s rounded would be about half that in terms of clicks, and that\u0027s probably overkill unless you routinely zoom *all the way in* during launches.\n\nHere\u0027s an example of a 5-click profile, with the clicks highlighted:\n\n![Stock-FairingProfile.png](http://alpha.renegrade.net/images/Stock-FairingProfile.png)\n\nWould take like nine clicks total to make it like that at both ends.\n\nThe discussions of aero from Squad before implied fairly heavily that the shielding effects will be available to modders and parts and such, so it should be easy to adapt fixed and procedural fairings to the system.\n\nThe only real problem with them (barring bugs and shortcomings in the actual implementation, and the bit where Maxmaps said that the fairing \u0022forgot\u0022 the definition when removed, which could suck if he didn\u0027t actually delete the part) is that they are the same profile all around - ie. you couldn\u0027t fairing a flat shape without wasting a lot of space (and thereby cross-sectional area and thereby drag). However, ALL of the fairings I\u0027ve seen from mods have this same problem too."},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T11:44:04Z","Content":"As cool as having fairings is, I will be super honest when I say that the moment I saw the model for the fairing I was disappointed.

What i REALLY whish for is having a BIG mission flag painted on the fairing, and maybe give it the \u0022style\u0022 of the flag : if you choose a gray-blue one, it would appear on the fairing and the rest of the fairing would also be mostly gray-blue.
