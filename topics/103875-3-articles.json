It\u0027s not the first time they said that either. First time I remember it was over two years ago, so this wasn\u0027t a matter of not making the deadline. It looks like they have a vision for reentry that doesn\u0027t quite line up with your vision. Or maybe they plan on using something that\u0027s already in the (v1.0) game, like fairings.

They also said that development of the game would continue.
