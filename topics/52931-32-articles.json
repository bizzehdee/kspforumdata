Also does the number of chutes refer to the number of chute parts used or the number actually deployed? For example the main chute part will deploy 3 chutes while the radial will only deploy 1. So if I\u0027m calculating the diameter needed for a main chute do I plug 3 into the chute count?\u003Cp\u003EJust saw your post in the development thread - I get now that parachute count refers to part count used (duh, since there are two separate calculation modes in the app) and I understand a bit more what the drag coefficient is for but still not quite sure...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThre drag coefficient comes from the material.
