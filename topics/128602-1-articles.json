I found myself laughing at how much more realistic it is then most of what we see here today despite the visuals. Which for the Moons surface actually really surprised me. They were ahead of their time, but in 1955...\u00A0we didn\u0027t have a clue, lol. What\u00A0learned in the next decade alone is another reason why I found this so interesting. Enough to feel as if I should share it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo\u00A0Walt Disney played a part in the success of our space program. That would explain why it was done so well for the time. There was only six channels or so on television back then and Disney had one of them for his cartoons. So if your watching TV back in 1955 chances are your watching this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-25T04:18:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2015 04:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T06:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I saw this a while back.
