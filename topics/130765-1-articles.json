This is because effectively your Pe is below the surface of Kerbin. If your Ap remains the same for either trajectory, that means a lower-energy orbit compared to launching from LKO. The trouble is that unless KSC is in exactly the right location, you end up almost going to LKO anyway. It\u0027s usually simpler to make a parking orbit first, then you can fine-tune your TMI burn without having to be overly-precise about your launch time.

Depending on your\u00A0design and how you fly it, it may very well be the case that your craft spends less delta-V by doing a direct ascent. However, by changing both your design and your piloting, you can probably improve on the overall cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember that someone here has done a pretty detailed analysis with mechjeb and multiple designs (I can look for the original post if you\u0027re interested). The most efficient (in terms of cost) were crafts that had low TWR (~1.3 on launch, meaning fewer expensive and heavy engines) but lots of fuel. You fly it by doing a gravity turn, but completing the transfer to the Mun while you\u0027re still inside the atmosphere. You\u0027re essentially going into \u0022orbit\u0022 at an altitude of 50km, taking as much\u00A0advantage of the Oberth Effect as possible while balancing that against\u00A0gravity drag and atmospheric drag losses. However, at the end of the day, the saving is pretty minimal compared to just going into a stable orbit of 80km, which is why most people just do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-27T03:43:16Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2016 03:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Empiro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T04:35:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to add on to the comment that others have made, i.e. that \u0022theoretically a direct burn could be more efficient, but in practice the savings would be minimal\u0022:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA direct burn would actually be \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eworse\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, by a lot, if you do it wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou said\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222380241\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130765\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453823631\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157637\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ksa222\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Ksa222 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\njust straight for the Mun\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...what exactly do you mean by that?\u00A0 Do you mean \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eliterally\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E straight for the Mun, i.e. you launch up and keep going up?\u00A0 That would be bad wrong wasteful.\u00A0 Reason:\u00A0 you\u0027ll be paying a heavy penalty due to gravity loss.\u00A0 Every second your engines are directly fighting against gravity, you\u0027re throwing several m/s of dV down the toilet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, you want as much of your burn as possible to be \u003Cem\u003Ehorizontal\u003C/em\u003E, or at least not steeply above it, in order to minimize gravity losses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Kerbin didn\u0027t have all that pesky atmosphere getting in the way, then you\u0027d launch from Kerbin the same way you launch from the Mun or other vacuum worlds:\u00A0 hit max throttle and keep it there, then crank it over to only slightly above horizontal immediately upon liftoff so that you\u0027re thrusting mostly sideways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince there\u0027s all that annoying air on Kerbin, you can\u0027t do that-- you have to start out by going up.\u00A0 But you want it to get over to a more horizontal path as early as practical-- thus the gravity turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn efficient direct-to-Mun launch would look essentially identical to a launch to LKO... it\u0027s just that where you\u0027d ordinarily stop burning as soon as your Ap gets up to 80 km or whatever, you\u0027d just keep burning until it goes all the way to the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PLAD","CreatedById":104158,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T16:33:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a challenge a while back to get from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/124123-lowest-delta-v-sstm/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2256967\u0022\u003EKerbin\u0027s surface to Minmus\u0027 surface\u003C/a\u003E for the minimum dV expended. At first I tried the standard method of launching into the lowest possible Kerbin orbit and setting up a burn to Minmus from there that used a Mun flyby. Then I tried a straight-up launch that flew straight to Mun for the flyby. Conclusions: For a minimum dV flight to Minmus straight up is better, but for just to a Mun landing it is worse. Note that the ship is much larger than the \u003Cem\u003Elightest\u003C/em\u003E possible ship to Minmus or Mun, the challenge just cared about dV expended. The key is a very high TWR. If you accelerate hard enough the gravity losses are reduced to less than you lose from a standard ascent, and the shorter time in the atmosphere reduces the drag losses a bit too. If you go too high with TWR though (like a Jules-Verne-style explosive launch)\u00A0 the drag destroys your ship. Here are the numbers:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbit first- 3010m/s surface to 72x72km orbit, then 845m/s LKO to Mun encounter = 3855m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStraight up- 3780m/s surface to Mun encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSavings to get from Kerbin surface to a Mun encounter: 75m/s.\u00A0\u00A0 From my experiments the break-even point was with a TWR of about 5. Less than that and the gravity losses dominate. Note that a simple LKO to Mun trajectory requires 856m/s but you can reduce it to the 845m/s I give by using a complicated multi-flyby of Mun that isn\u0027t possible with a straight-up path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut now the part 2- if you use a straight-up path to Mun you will arrive at Mun with a higher relative speed to it. This completely eliminates the advantage of the straight-up launch. For a standard LKO to Mun path you will need about a 271m/s capture burn to get into low Munar orbit, but with the straight-up path you will require about a 371m/s to brake into the same orbit (and it\u0027s the same difference if you go straight to a landing). The reason for this is that you have less prograde velocity when you arrive at Mun\u0027s orbit after a straight-up launch, so Mun overtakes your ship at a higher relative speed. You do have a little bit of prograde velocity since the KSC is moving sideways thanks to Kerbin\u0027s rotation, but it\u0027s a lot less. Your speed relative to Mun at the moment you enter Mun\u0027s SOI is about 340 m/s for a standard launch and about 538m/s for a straight-up. (Note that Mun\u0027s orbital speed is 542.5m/s.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do wonder if there is a hybrid path that goes almost straight-to-Mun but with a little \u0027sideways\u0027 during ascent that would do better, but the aiming would be a nightmare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T17:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222380719\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130765\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453841383\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110959\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Alshain said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOberth Effect\u003C/a\u003E says that any maneuver will be less expensive closer to the parent body\u0027s center of gravity.\u00A0 This means that the effect of thrust is always greater the closer you are to Periapsis.\u00A0 At launch you are closest to your periapsis while sitting on the launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo as FlyingPete says, theoretically it\u0027s cheaper to make the straight shot.\u00A0 However, in practice the savings are minimal and the procedure is exponentially more difficult to accomplish over a parking orbit.
