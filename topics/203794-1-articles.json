Perhaps a toolbar could still have a place for the most crucial of tools or maybe have it be more customizable with pinning tools such as is the case with many of our operating systems. In short though I think I am not alone in seeing the tool bar getting overly cluttered. That said, I understand that including a dropdown menu might not be aesthetically pleasing or fitting to the silly aspects of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-13T18:22:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s really hard to say.

I do so banking on the belief that KSP 2 will have multi window support so more room for minor clutter will be available.
