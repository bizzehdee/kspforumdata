Currently this really only effects transmission times. With the changes to science and data coming up in 0.23, I\u0027d like to see data size used in data management. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would add a new dimension to craft design: players would have to determine how much data will be gathered by a craft (or stage) so they can include enough data capacity to effectively store and transport that data. Data would no longer be stored in the instrument which is was collected (this has already pretty much been confirmed anyway), which means collection could only take place when there was sufficient storage, and the instrument used to collect the data wouldn\u0027t have to come back with the ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also means unlimited amount of data couldn\u0027t be stored for one mission, which would somewhat blunt the problem of maxing out the tech tree in two or three missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommand modules and probes should have substantial data storage capacities, but heavy science missions should require additional data parts. Data banks would be similar to battery banks in size. They may or may not require power to maintain data, based on gameplay intended by the devs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, like I said, I think this would add an interesting new dimension to craft design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S4qFBxkFFg","CreatedById":83727,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T11:50:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think data/experiment storage is changing significantly in the next version anyway - we wait and hope, as always.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T05:56:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, it is planned next version and sfdtgreyh3hger said\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T15:24:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheCanadianVendingMachine\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheCanadianVendingMachine\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIIRC, it is planned next version and sfdtgreyh3hger said\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that data storage and the ability to move reports/data between modules is planned for the next release, but I haven\u0027t read anything about limitations on the \u003Cem\u003Eamount\u003C/em\u003E of data that can be stored in a module, which was the main thrust of this post.
