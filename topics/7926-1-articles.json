I first got to know about Kerbal Space Program through kurtjmac\\\u0027s YouTube videos on his wacky side-adventures into Kerbin orbit and what not (For those who don\\\u0027t know, Kurt has taken upon himself the quest to venture to the Farlands in Minecraft 1.7 - a highly arduous journey for Kurt with much in-game trekking to reach the literal end of the world). It also intrigues me that this is a game developed by a fairly new gaming company, based in Mexico, I believe. So that\\\u0027s interesting too. Well done to you, Squad!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also a senior high school student in San Diego, with responses from college application processes all over, including ones in California (Stanford, UCSD, UCLA, UC Berkeley) and on the U.S. east coast (including Harvard and Princeton, yikes!). I seek to major in international relations or political science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from that, I am also a TF2 server admin, forum moderator, and Steam group admin for the Weekdayz Community, currently the second largest group on Steam (Although not really a proud status, considering the number of our regulars hardly numbers 2% of our total population of 500,000).
