But what I \u003Cem\u003Eactually did\u003C/em\u003E was attempt to complete the deorbit burn anyway, which just made everything spin more and more rapidly until eventually, the CRAST\u0027s main engine got torn off. So at this point, it 1) was spinning uncontrollably, 2) was in a partly subatmospheric and rapidly decaying orbit, and 3) had no engines apart from a few RCS thrusters. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, I was in a bit of a panic, so I scrambled and launched my Crew Transporter, which I used for transporting astronauts to my space station, and which I knew was relatively well-balanced and easy to manoeuvre with.
