Any mesh part with the second material on it does not render at all and the first material has the wrong textures.\n\nThe FBX exported from max is a single object with 6 elements and 2 materials (one for the endcaps and one for the skin).\n\n![MsxPic_01_zpsjiiw4jv0.png](http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm13/mskinner2008/MsxPic_01_zpsjiiw4jv0.png)\n\nIn unity, the mesh has two materials applied that are using KSP shaders\n\n![UnityPic_03_zpszcpnaskq.png](http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm13/mskinner2008/UnityPic_03_zpszcpnaskq.png)\n\nIn the KSP Part Tools, the mesh only lists one material.\n\n![UnityPic_02_zpsddsyys4h.png](http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm13/mskinner2008/UnityPic_02_zpsddsyys4h.png)\n\nAnd finally what it looks like in-game. The endcaps dont render at all, and the skin has the wrong material and texture on it. Does anybody know how to fix this? Help is always appreciated, thanks.\n\n![GamePic_01_zpsvm6iqewq.png](http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm13/mskinner2008/GamePic_01_zpsvm6iqewq.png)\n\nHere is my part cfg\n\n    PART{    // --- general parameters ---    name = StationQuarter_375x125    module = Part    author = Michael    // --- asset parameters ---    mesh = StationQuarter_375x125.mu    scale = 1.0    rescaleFactor = 1    // --- node definitions ---    node_stack_top = 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1    node_stack_bottom = 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0,3    // --- editor parameters ---    TechRequired = metaMaterials    entryCost = 25850    cost = 7250    category = Pods    subcategory = 0    title = Testpart    manufacturer = asdf    description = asdf    // attachment rules: stack, srfAttach, allowStack, allowSrfAttach, allowCollision    attachRules = 1,0,1,1,0    // --- standard part parameters ---    mass = 3.75    dragModelType = default    maximum_drag = 0.2    minimum_drag = 0.2    angularDrag = 2    crashTolerance = 15    breakingForce = 50    breakingTorque = 50    maxTemp = 2000    fuelCrossFeed = True}\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T02:38:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 02:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkLord**"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T09:30:27Z","Content":"I\u0027m afraid KSP just doesn\u0027t support multiple materials on one mesh - sorry to be the bearer of bad news!"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T14:52:06Z","Content":"Yep, you\u0027ll need to separate the end caps into their own mesh objects, so that each \u0022mesh object\u0022 has one material.
