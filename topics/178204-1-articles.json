Its diameter has been measured to be about 740-760 km, around half the size of Makemake, and its albedo was found to be quite low, around 0.15-0.17. It also has its own moon with a diameter of about 190 km, around a quarter the size of its parent object and indicating it formed through a giant impact event.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02184\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02184\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Adstri","CreatedById":174024,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-13T23:10:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAren\u0027t most KBOs around the size of half the size of Makemake?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ProtoJeb21","CreatedById":153551,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-14T14:20:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223450785\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178204\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221536880253\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174024\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Adstriduum\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Adstriduum said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAren\u0027t most KBOs around the size of half the size of Makemake?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost large ones, yes.
