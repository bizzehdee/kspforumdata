A lot has changed and we have some surprising new \u0022best\u0022 engines.\n\n They are placed in a standard situation with a given DV budget, and evaluated by their payload fraction. The lighter an entire stage is in comparison to it\u0027s payload, the less mass the preceding stages will have to lift. Generally, this results in small and inexpensive rockets on the pad and maximizes your capabilities.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  I start with the values in the config files for the engine\u0027s mass, thrust, and Isp. Based on the desired Isp and payload, I calculate how much fuel and tankage is required. I then adjust the payload and reiterate until it shows that one engine is required to accelerate the total mass at the desired G. Finally, I record the payload and total mass, and divide the payload into the mass to give payload fraction.\n\n\u0022Best\u0022 engines exhibit payload fractions of \u003E95% of the single best performer.\n\n\u0022Good\u0022 are 90-95%\n\n\u0022Fair\u0022 are 85-90%. \n\n All are shown with their payload per engine in tonnes and payload fraction in percent.\n\n **Scenario #1: Single main

That\u0027s an easy enough relationship to grasp... ceteris paribus (all else being constant)... twice the ISP = twice the dV. If we solve for mass ratio we get e^(dV/(isp\\*g))=mass ratio. This tells us that for decent values of ISP, changing mass ratio by even a tiny amount can result in increasing dV by an order of magnitude. When you put these two things together, you have a basic understanding of the tradeoff between ISP and mass. For example, if engine A has an ISP of 400 and a mass of 1, and engine B has an ISP of 800 and a mass of 1.2 then you\u0027ll likely get better results (at least in terms of dV) with engine B.

On the other hand, sticking a nuke on a 2t lander won\u0027t do you any favors since it\u0027s mass will easily more than make up any savings you get from higher ISP... it weighs more than the craft itself!

That statement is self-contradictory. \u0022The one that delivers the most dV depends on how much dV and acceleration you need.\u0022 is the essence of the statement. This is contradictory and circular... further, there is no part of the rocket equation that makes any consideration for thrust or acceleration (though we have to consider those things when \\*spending\\* our dV to get the most out of it... which is where my \u0022utility\u0022 function comes into play). Given these two engines... which have given ISP\u0027s and masses, the engine that will give the most possible dV for a given fuel/payload configuration depends solely on the fraction of mass that said engine contributes to the overall mass. Larger payload/fuel configurations will likely benefit more from ISP than weight savings while smaller payload/fuel configurations will likely benefit more from reduced weight than ISP. Of course this is all relative to the disparity in ISP and mass between the two engines... and it is this disparity which will set the dividing line along the equipotential surface that separates the region where one engine dominates from the region where the other dominates. Of course this also depends on how you define \u0022efficient\u0022, I assume for this discussion when referencing an engine\u0027s \u0022efficiency\u0022 you are in fact talking about ISP.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113476-ISP-Weight-tradeoff-on-engines-(graph)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113476-ISP-Weight-tradeoff-on-engines-%28graph%29)\n\nAbove is a post I made previously for any arbitrary combination of dV, ISP, and engine mass (as percentage of total vessel mass). The upper graph shows the relationship for a given payload mass, while the lower graph is animated to show the effect of reducing the payload mass (and displays engine mass in units instead of percentage)... this shows how the upper graph changes shape as payload size changes. As you can see, as payload size becomes smaller... engine weight becomes more important. I considered placing several of KSP\u0027s engines on this graph to show how they relate to each other, but it\u0027s redundant information if you understand the basic relationships.\n\nEDIT: also, I\u0027m not trying to hijack your thread.
