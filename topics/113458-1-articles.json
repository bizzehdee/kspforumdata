Has nearly all science (no Science Jr) and 4km/s Edit: If you are using the latest version of the mod (which it turns out I wasn\u0027t... You\u0027ll only have around 3.2km/s due to the increased thrust and fuel use of the pluto engine) Delta-V. Because of the single Nuke engine it will not quite do all the moons, but enough that it can make itself useful.\n\nLoad it up fling it off somewhere and float around like a fish... in space. Or take the wings off and have some less Delta-V without affecting CoM.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t really do atmospheric flight... But does come complete with a launcher, albeit a crap one. Launchers aren\u0027t really my thing. But I also feel bad handing this out and not providing a proven launch platform to get it into orbit. It does not like large AoA... But if you keep it close to prograde it will behave itself quite well enough. Best to keep it in orbit and er do science with it. The Nuke\u0027s attachment node will be inaccessible due to fairings - if you attach to the Nuke the craft will explode when you stage.\n\nRCS is darn close to perfectly balanced, and CoM doesn\u0027t move (well not more than a few centimetres), and is more or less at the docking port - so if you decided to tug it somewhere it\u0027s not going to affect weight distribution too much.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Toggling the Gear will also toggle the Vernor thrusters with these (and the other RCS ports the Gear toggles) you will be able to right the craft again so that you can point the pointier end at space and go again. If you\u0027re not on a flat, it can be a bit finicky to get back to vertical, so just get it to 45 degrees and leave some nuke dust in your wake.\n\nAction Groups\n\n1 - Science!\n\n5 - Docking (toggles docking port, toggles solar panels, toggles docking light\n\n9 - Toggles ladder\n\n0 - Toggles solar panel\n\nParts 71 (with launcher)\n\nComments and feedback welcomed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T08:05:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 08:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlipNascar**"}]}
