Apollo missions are an example. Actually stock fairings aren\u0027t able to be used as interstage but just on the top of a rocket. You can try to close in other way but the result is a very wobbly and instable rocket.\n\nPlease Squad! You can do it!"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T14:16:53Z","Content":"You actually can make interstage fairings. You mouse over the part above your fairing base and it should give you an option to close the fairing.\n\nThey currently don\u0027t work right though: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117109-Engine-cannot-activate-while-stowed](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117109-Engine-cannot-activate-while-stowed)\n\nWhat would be nice is the ability to make fairings open ended."}]}
