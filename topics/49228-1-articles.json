And you can get hell lot of science that way, my probe to Duna got 2600 science points just on transmitted data and it even didn\u0027t have all science tools possible. My guess is it actually outweighs what you can bring with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be better - instead of mission log to get a science log once you enter the research center.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DarthJazno","CreatedById":57464,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T16:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.
