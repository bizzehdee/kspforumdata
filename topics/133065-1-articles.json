Well first,\u00A0you don\u0027t need RCS to dock with klaws.\u00A0You have a huge leeway for docking - anything flat will do, so you don\u0027t have to aim for a specific spot. Docking time is just order of magnitude easier than with docking ports.\u00A0I put at least two klaws on every station; or more on\u00A0every\u00A0harvester and tanker that\u00A0I have. The only use for docking ports is if the klaw is simply not practical (mini landers due to weight, and planes due to drag/heat tolerance, or if I need some piece on both top and bottom of the rocket) and in cases where I want to be able to potentially expand the ship/rover in the future (though I still put a klaw on them, and even put klaws on some docking ports so I can \u0022pop it\u0022 if I end up needing the port)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKlaws are actually great landing gear replacement for tipover tankers because of\u00A0their good impact tolerance. My minmus tanker looks like a plane with landing gears and can deorbit to 90 km apo / 25km peri in one single aerobrake from Minmus. It weighs 250T or so wet, and delivers most of that weight to LKO station. That tanker has the klaw on the rear, and uses it for docking, but also\u00A0to bounce off the ground when landing at minmus, in order to tip\u00A0over to land on the landing gears. Having the klaw also adds the potential for emergency refueling for missions that would fail otherwise.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou can use klaws on your harvesters to dock refuel pretty much any possibe ship you can think of. I can dock with a 1-by-1\u00A0meter mini lander or 500T ore tanker.\u00A0Use more than 2 sets of (landing) gears to raise elevation or \u0022kneel\u0022 down to grab on. Use more than one klaw at different elevations to dock with small or tall ships.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-03T21:17:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2016 09:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kamenjar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-04T02:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKIS/KAS is fine. \u00A0There aren\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ethat \u003C/em\u003Emany extra parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I would do, though, is hook the ships up though one of the ground pylons instead of hooking them up directly. \u00A0Things tend to be more stable, and if you put out a grid of pylons you don\u0027t have to worry about ground handling with the tanker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-04T02:41:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2016 02:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tsotha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
