A screenshot or a craft file would be helpful in diagnosing potential problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting it right is one of those things that takes practice. I will say that the shorter and wider your stack is, the less likely it is to tip over when you crash. Try this: put an FL-T200 under your command pod. Put three more radially around the center tank (set it so that there\u0027s no tank directly below the hatch to the command pod). Connect the outer tanks to the inner tanks with fuel lines. You\u0027ll have as much fuel there as an FL-T800, but without nearly as much height involved. Good for early landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock, you need to go IVA while you\u0027re landing and look for your radar altimeter gauge. When it starts to twitch, you\u0027re 2500 meters above the deck and can plan accordingly. What you want to do when you\u0027re ready to land is burn retrograde until your surface velocity is near zero; the retrograde marker should start pointing at least very close to straight up (all blue on the nav ball). Stop your burn and start falling. Watch your radar altimeter; when it starts twitching, start slowing down. Right above the surface you don\u0027t want to be going much faster than 5-10 m/s vertically (use the gauge right beside the altimeter for this purpose) but if you\u0027re higher up you can afford to go a little faster than that (indeed, you want to be going down a little faster so you don\u0027t waste too much fuel). Make sure your gear is deployed. Your radar altimeter will really start to dial down fast once you\u0027re less than 1000 meters to the deck; use that to gauge when to really slow down and estimate the elevation of the deck. If you have landing lights, turn them on and use your shadow to gauge the final deck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s really all I can suggest.
