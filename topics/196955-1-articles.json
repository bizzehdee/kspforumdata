Tiny wings will make it hard to fly slowly, some of the control surfaces look unnecessary and it seems very twitchy on the controls. What is it for, and why the narrow wingspan but excessive control surfaces?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, you\u2019re flying far too fast when landing- over 130m/s at touchdown. Stepping through it as slowly as I can, it looks like the landing gear compresses\u00A0as it touches down before ripping away along with the main wings. The left gear touches down first so the left wing comes off, bouncing the plane to the right which then takes out the right wing and causes the left roll immediately after the wings come off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving the wheel brakes on is probably the culprit, but without seeing the F3 report it\u2019s hard to say for sure. Set your airbrakes\u00A0to the abort (backspace) key instead of brake to use them independently of the wheel brakes, try to fly slower at touchdown- use a higher angle of attack if you have to to maintain lift- and don\u2019t use wheel brakes until all your wheels are on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
