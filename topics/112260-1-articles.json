The last one aired last night.\n\nHere are some guidelines for the saveg game:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **To participate, it\u0027s simple,** start a new sandbox game, send a rocket to space, big or small and with however many Kerbins aboard, and lose them in space or on a planet!\n\u003E  **Once a month, I will pick a random save game and will attempt to rescue the crew from your \u0022failed\u0022 mission.** \n\u003E \n\u003E  As I will have no idea of what\u0027s to rescue it will be a fun succession of scouting, then sending rescue ship(s) to bring the crew back home.\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E **Here are some guidelines for you to follow:**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - try to make it fun to discover and have fun doing it!\n\u003E - A little made up background story on the failed mission is a nice way to start the stream\n\u003E - must be a manned ship (1 or more crew members and must all fit aboard the ship)\n\u003E - must be on a stable orbit or be landed on a planet/moon/asteroid\n\u003E - Let\u0027s keep it in Kerbin\u0027s influence for now. (minimus or mun is fine too) I am limiting this for now to keep stream length under 3 hours. I will organize special events with further destinations\n\u003E - must be in sandbox mode\n\u003E - must be only one lost ship in the save game\n\u003E - no mods! Cause I wont play with any!\n\u003E - send your save game to:\n\u003E \n\u003E **[\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **It can be one of 3 scenario:**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - **A rescue mission:**\n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbals lost in space, in a broken ship.

The ship will be refueled and will be returned to Kerbin with it\u0027s crew.
