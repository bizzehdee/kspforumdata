There are a few different keys that affect the lock and the logon screen, though they\u0027re not very well documented. The results on Google can explain it better than me, but most of the customization settings are in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Personalization or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System. Example: You can completely disable the image background of the logon screen by setting HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System\\DisableLogonBackgroundImage to a non-zero value, which forces it to a flat color. That color can be changed by setting another key in the same place that I forget the exact name of. The programs that allow you to customize the lock screen background are really just changing registry values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit: There\u0027s no space between win and dows in the key name....
