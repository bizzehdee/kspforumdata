When you dock to another vessel KSP has to make a single new tree that covers both of the crafts. This often results in the attachment direction of parts getting reversed and IR really doesn\u0027t like that. This means that if you try to do a robot arm with a docking port on the end of it, chances are you\u0027ll get this issue as soon as you dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you have docking ports on your craft that don\u0027t have robotics parts between them and the root, chances are you\u0027ll be able to dock and undock and have things work just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T11:43:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome real life Infernal Robotics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_luhn7TLfWU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we just need to wait until someone recreate this in KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bartekkru99","CreatedById":76625,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T18:43:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you add mouse tracking? would be useful for turrets and robotic arms.
