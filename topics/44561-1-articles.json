It actually pretty much negates a big part of the game and as we all know people tend to use the tools they have at their disposal as efficient as possible so chances are most people would use it all the time. Which woul lead to the game beeing boring within a short amount of time. At least thats how i play games - i dont create random restrictions myself. From my point of view using an autopilot in KSP and arguing with the random arguments ppl use is like saying \u0022Yeah i play Call of Duty in SP with an aimbot because im more into the walking arround part of the game\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real reason is probably that most people think its too difficult to pilote their rockets and give up. And i have to admit i have played a lot of games and \u0022learning\u0022 KSP actually consumes a lot of time. KSP doenst need to get easier - its actually not that hard - but there have to be way better tutorials to teach people the basics and functions in a motivating way that wont overwhelm them. There are some good youtube-tutorials etc. but its hard to find them amongst all the other KSP videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOn the other hand\u003C/strong\u003E as i said in a nother thread i would have no problems with an \u0022autopilot\u0022 that has to be \u0022programmed\u0022 in KSP by the user specifically for each built rocket. That would actually be realistic. An Autopilot that is made by a third person and can do anything even launches that shouldnt be possible is not realistic (just to counter the but NASA does it - no they dont have an autopilot programmed by one random person that works for every single rocket etc.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMods i would add:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- most of the mods for new parts that are balanced\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- procedural parts mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- im not sure about the better aerodynamics mod (Ferram Aerospace Research)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- lights mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThings that need to be in the game:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Chatter Mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbal Engineering Data things\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Alarm Clock mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part organizing mod\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-01T08:13:23Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2013 08:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceHole\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T11:51:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking I think not *entire* mods are needed in the stock game but rather some subsets of things mods do are needed. Most mods do more than just one thing such that including the entire mod in the stock game might be overkill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, the entire detailed readouts and scientific analyses of something like Mechjeb or Kerbal Engineering data is probably a bit much, but at least being able to see the really BASIC stats about a sub-assembly (the sum of all parts in this stage is this many tonnes, and the sum of all thrust in this stage is this much.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong similar lines, and this isn\u0027t a mod but just a pet peeve... SHOW THE UNITS in the stats for things. The game will tell you, for example, that a Mainsail engine has a thrust of 1500, but it doesn\u0027t say 1500 *whats*, making it necessary to get Kerbal Engineering to tell my the TWR NOT because I\u0027m incapable of calculating it myself, but because I wasn\u0027t given the information needed to do so. 100 Newtons isn\u0027t the same thing as 100 Tons of weight-force, or 100 pounds of force, etc. PUT units on things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, the \u003Cstrong\u003EAlarm Clock\u003C/strong\u003E mod. Not necessarily automated alarms on manuever nodes are needed in stock, to preserve the manual feel of the stock game, but the ability to simply pick any arbitrary time you like by clicking on a calendar timeline and set an alarm for it that will drop you out of timewarp if you happen to be in timewarp, and will give a chime would be good. As it is, in the stock game it\u0027s very hard to simulate a space program\u0027s realistic parallel operations. You tend to launch a years-long mission, timewarp to the destination, do a thing, and timewarp back home. A real space program would be doing other things in that intervening year but it\u0027s hard to do that in this game in stock because you\u0027ll miss your narrow window for important burns while doing something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to transfer crew between parts of a vessel without EVA\u0027ing them because they can tunnel INSIDE the craft. This is one of the things \u003Cstrong\u003ECrew Manifest\u003C/strong\u003E had but it was too arbitrarily easy - allowing any kerbal to go to any part on the vessel, even moving through intervening fuel tanks and engines. What I have in mind is a more limited version of that that only allows transfer if there\u0027s a path to follow between the parts that goes entirely through \u0027crewfeed\u0027 capable sections. (It would work just like the crossfeed-capable flag but it would be a flag for the ability to transfer crew instead of fuel. Things like habitats and capsules and fuselages would be crewfeed-capable but engines, tanks, etc would not be.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd again I have a similar response for \u003Cstrong\u003ETAC fuel balancer\u003C/strong\u003E. The stock game was meant to have a lot of manual player involvement so implementing a perfect balancer may be a bit too much but at least give us a better system than there is now. Right now it\u0027s impossible to transfer anything precisely because you have to click the mouse on one button, then move it to a new button that only appears after clicking on the first, a centimeter away, and click it again in order to do fine movements and this just isn\u0027t precise enough The act of going click-move-click in the shortest humanly possible time still moves something like 15-30 units of fuel at once making it impossible to move just a BIT of fuel. Something allowing direct control in little bits would be better. Like instead of turning the flow on, moving to a new button, and turning it off give a method by which it\u0027s possible to click, hold-button-while-transfering, let-go to transfer, or open up a slider for the two tanks where you can move fuel with left/right cursor arrow keys. That\u0027s a lot easier to transfer precisely that way as you can \u0022tap\u0022 a little fuel over with single quick clicks or key presses. So this is SORT of like TAC fuel balancer but not quite as automated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there are a few mods that have some sort of programmable autopilot (No I don\u0027t mean an autopilot someone else programmed, like Mechjeb, but a scripting language and API that provide the framework for a player to make their own autopilot programs), and while I really want to get into doing that (waiting for the next RemoteTech for this), I can see the argument against having it in the stock game. The number of players who enjoy programming will be small. The game needs to remain accessible to a larger audience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ouion","CreatedById":38531,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T13:14:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would really like to see P fairings and Kw rocketry Pack in vanilla Ksp,because the Stock parts look generic and bland.

In my mind, at least, the OP is asking us to list mods we think belong in the stock game. Not just mods that we like. Then again this is an opinion question and other peoples\u0027 opinions are merely differing from my own which is not the same thing. Nevertheless, it is a mistake I would like to avoid, so I want to just be clear that I am listing mods I think should be in the stock game. Even if they are mods I use and like, they may not necessarily fit the utility or aesthetics of the stock game, so I do not list them here. A good example in my mind is the B9 and Firespitter packs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, now that I have that disclaimer out of the way, I think the mod I would like to see most in the stock game is procedural fairings. It is such a deceptively simple mod, but makes rockets seem so realistic and clean-looking. On their own, however, that\u0027s about all they add. There are some tweaks I would make: I would like to be able to customize how many fairing segments can be placed, and I would like to see the fairings reduce physics load in some way. I know there was a massive debate recently about whether fairings should disable part physics entirely for payloads inside the fairing. I\u0027m not so sure about that, but I do think a partiall implementation or compromise is possible. Finally, I would like to see fairings improve the aerodynamics of the rocket, a la FAR, which helps me segue into my next choice of mod...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Ferram Aerospace Research (FAR) would be cool to see at least a partial implementation. I don\u0027t think the myriad readouts and ability to select specific control surfaces for secific tasks are really necessary for the stock game, and would be better served as a mod in and of itself. I\u0027m sure this is on the way, as the devs are well aware of the limitations of their current aerodynamic model. I also figure that the implementation of this will either accompany or shortly precede the implementation of deadly reentry, which I would also like to see implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know Mechjeb is a point of contention among people so please do not take this next paragraph to be an entry in the ongoing Mechjeb debate one way or the other. I use, and enjoy Mechjeb, but like FAR I feel that some of the features it offers are outside the scope of the stock game. We don\u0027t really need all of the readouts or preprogrammed routines that it offers, but I think some capacity to select crew members to automatically execute certain tasks based on their skill level is not only consistent with the theme and premise of the game, but has been specifically mentioned by HarvesteR to be at the very least a considered feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane and Extraplanetary Launchpads provide a lot of options for players to design their own missions, and incentive to colonize and occupy other worlds. Because of this, I think they are some of the most important mods in the game, and absolutely would have a place in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISA Mapsat similarly provides some things for players to do. I think the ability to generally glean information about a planet by sending probes there is also an important part of spaceflight, and therefore KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not listed all of the mods I think should be stock, because others have already listed some of the obvious ones like docking cam or engineer redux. These were the biggest ones I could think of, and the ones I wanted to most provide my input about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T20:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Beeman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Beeman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe fustek station parts expansion.
