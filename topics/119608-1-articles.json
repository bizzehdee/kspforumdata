I personally hate tourism because it takes so darn long to fly that far. We need contracts which require and reward good plane design. Not lengthy flights. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo. Ideas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Speed. Not a speed record like you can set with a rocket, but a maintained speed at a certain altitude range. Like \u0022maintain a speed of between 300m/s and 350m/s between the altitudes of 1km and 4km for 30 seconds\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. G forces! I\u0027ve personally always wanted to ride in a fighter jet. Not to get somewhere, but to feel the G\u0027s! So we should have tourism contracts like \u0022take Sally Kerbette above 10km and experience 4\u002B G\u0027s, then return to kerbin safely\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Lift numbers. To build big planes, they could say \u0022maintain a lift of x units between altitudes of 5km and 8km for 30 seconds and return safely to kerbin\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Thrust. Same as above but with an amount of thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Size. Require any of the above requirements but using a certain weight/part limit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea how to mod ksp, but I think these contracts wouldn\u0027t be too hard to make, and it would be pretty popular because lots of people want to make planes and actually have some direction to what they\u0027re doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
