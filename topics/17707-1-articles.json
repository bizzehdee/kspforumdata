Delay time was 55sec. there.

The ships start to turn without delay if you put in command in the mechjeb Smart A.S.S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you fire the engines it will take the whole delay time. Otherwise RCS thrusters will start instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou even can affect engine burn tim by activating time warp. Engines will only start to burn after delay time passed AND time warp is deactivated. If you start engines, activating time warp and let it so, engines will never start. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seemed to me helpful to calculate command delay with tools like this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.online-stopwatch.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.online-stopwatch.com\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest Target 2: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will not need powerfull engines out there. Never used more then 5% of the thrust . Even the weakest engine can move you \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 so it is better to take more fuel and less engine weight with you in order to maximise your ability to alter your course. Therefore my upper and center stage where large overpowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to go a long way with more then 7% of launch weight - and it can be even better with a better fuel/engine combination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost critical seems to be the weight you want to move - playing around in the Kerbin system is fun - if you want to go far out its thinking about every part or puting together big ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
