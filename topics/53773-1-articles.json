When placing other parts however the vessel stays the same with only the part you are going to place turning transparent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a reason for this? Because when I build this is simply an annoying hindrance when placing parts that the Symmetry Mode can\u0027t handle or handles \u0022wrong\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd speaking of annoying when placing; Why do the radial decouplers have three snap-on points, or the big flat one having five? When not in Angle Snap Mode I sort of get it but in what situation do you need to place something at the edge of a radial decoupler?
