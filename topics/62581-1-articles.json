The problem is that you\u0027re messing up reference frames in the bolded step. You indeed increase the velocity by 1m/s. But you can\u0027t plug it into the formula like that due to reference frames. If you look at it from the outside you see a rocket that goes 1m/s and thus has 0.5J of kinetic energy. After the burn you see a rocket that moves 2m/s and thus has 2J of energy. So the energy difference you see as an outside observer is 1.5J. This is why reference frames are so important, someone stationary will measure 1.5J while someone on a train moving alongside the rocket only measures 0.5J.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is in fact, the whole reason of the oberth effect. From the point of view of the rocket it takes just 0.5J to accelerate by 1m/s while it takes 1.5J from the PoV of the earth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T01:02:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACKE \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A0 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BDm \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2.
