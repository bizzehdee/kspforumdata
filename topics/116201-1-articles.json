There\u0027s an advantage to not having lift surface across the entire plane so that you wont encounter uncontrolled lift at certain angles. It\u0027s nice, having a little opening in-between the fuselage for air to flow through (So you wont be pushed around by wind as much), plus there\u0027s the extra weight in the front resulting in a more stable and well-rounded spaceplane. (Crash tolerance should be too much of a problem since the MK2 cockpit and fuselage are lower to the ground unless you really crash)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T21:34:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edax**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T21:49:17Z","Content":"Pft, who the heck crashes their planes? just fly 1kM above the ground as slow as possible, pitch up and stall out to kill your horizontal speed then hit the parachutes. perfect landings every time."},{"CreatedByName":"X-SR71","CreatedById":108775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T21:54:13Z","Content":"It\u0027s all about the lift the mk2 parts provide.
