I\u0027d rather have a fully fictional set of engines that don\u0027t have any gaps in capability/thrust range that just behave realistically. They are also odd sizes, are extremely, extremely lightweight, and almost all have fixed throttles. That last part can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be realistic, can it?! I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m pretty sure I remember while watching space shuttle launches Mission Control mentioning the space shuttle adjusting its throttle. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d throttle down, for example, when passing max-Q. The inability to throttle any large engines combined with extremely lightweight empty fuel tanks means the rockets that I am launch start at a TWR of like 1.3 and end with a TWR of like 3, 4, or even more in some cases. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m getting such a huge thrust I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m having a hard time doing a gravity turn, because gravity never really gets a change to pull my flight path down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what am I doing wrong? Is all this stuff- super lightweight fuel tanks, extremely high thrust, lightweight engines, fix-throttle engines actually realistic? I\u0027m going to look some stuff up when I get the chance (like, the masses of various engines and their thrusts IRL, and the fueled vs. unfueled weights of some rockets). Also, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think there is a single throttleable rocket engine intended for atmospheric use by default. I do understand that the stock rocket parts can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t possibly be as good as real life rocket parts, because it takes a lot of effort to make a launcher with like 10 km/s\u002B dV in stock, but are things really this good (and bad, in the case of no throttleable engines) IRL?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, based off of my comments above, are there any specific additional mods or configs I should be using/setting?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, how do we get the nice, immersive clouds?

I just was never able to figure out where the unrealism was creeping in from. So stock KSP\u0027s unrealism, in terms of rocket delta-V, creeps in through how heavy the rocket engines and empty fuel tanks are, and real rockets have very large rises in acceleration (due to decreasing mass but constant engine thrust) just before they stage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, thanks for the tip on turning off engines- I had thought of that, but I hadn\u0027t tried to make use of it yet, partly because it just felt inefficient. I\u0027ve only built a handful of rockets so far in this realism overhaul install.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T23:54:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 11:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
