However no such luck, the thrusters seem to refuse to fire, and there is no use of NOx shown in the resource panel. Initially I thought it might be a problem with the avionics package I am using for the upper stage (the early 0.813m package) so I tested the whole thing sitting on the pad with the big A4 Guidance Unit, which provides full control for my first stage, but the thrusters still refuse to fire :/\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help/pointers would be greatly appreciated \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T23:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI went around and around with thrusters when I started with RO. \u00A0Usually the problem is the thruster isn\u0027t configured for the fuel you\u0027re using. \u00A0You seem to have checked that, though, so another thing you might check is that the parts between the thrusters and the tank allow cross-feed. \u00A0When I mounted my thrusters on a capsule it didn\u0027t work until I configured the capsule to allow cross-feed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T00:16:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre the thrusters inside another part?
