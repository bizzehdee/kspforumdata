You could also try stacking two of those on one another, though it would look horrible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like you\u0027re using Skippers, 909s, and 48-7Ss. Skippers are amazing for everything, and the 909s are good where TWR isn\u0027t the limiting factor; the 48-7Ss have only the benefit of being very, very light and have fairly low isp. A Materials Bay and a Mk1 command pod are heavy enough that the 48-7S won\u0027t offer much benefit, so I\u0027d recommend a 909 on the final stage. (I\u0027m not 100% sure about this, though.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to use something like your cockpits and science with a relatively small tank and a 909 underneath them, with 3-4 radially attached larger tanks with 909s. Decouple the outer tanks before activating the center engine; with decent piloting, this should make a nice Munar lander. Put a transfer stage beneath it to get it to the Mun after getting into orbit, and some sort of launch stage (the Skippers you\u0027re using, with Asparagus staging, should be enough, or you can activate the outer engines first and then decouple them and activate the inner engine.) The \u0022activate the inner engine first\u0022 philosophy is equivalent to onion staging with a bit less thrust; it lets you burn off and decouple the outer tanks so the inner engine doesn\u0027t have to haul them around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it\u0027s a matter of personal preference, I generally use a mod such as Mechjeb, Kerbal Engineer, or VOID for ship design, as you\u0027ll get delta-v readouts from them. A Mun landing takes about 5.5 km/s on the launchpad, whereas a Mun landing-and-return takes about 7-8 km/s, with good piloting. (These numbers could be off, and as a suggestion, most people who aren\u0027t named Scott Manley would give themselves a bit of extra delta-v in case of imperfect piloting.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget power. Either use solar panels or plenty of batteries. Also have a parachute if you\u0027re planning a return mission. (It seems like something one wouldn\u0027t forget, but believe me, it is.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, that\u0027s the end of the design bit; now for the piloting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractice with the Navball controls in test flights; you\u0027ll want to get the hang of them first. Turn on stability assist and you should be able to turn whichever way you like without resorting to the Pilot\u0027s abilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to get into an initially equatorial orbit by turning East; this can \u003Cem\u003Eusually\u003C/em\u003E be accomplished by using primarily D to turn. Switch the Navball to \u0022Orbit\u0022 mode temporarily and turn towards the prograde if you\u0027re not sure which way to turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn to put your apoapsis on roughly the same orbit as the Mun without raising your periapsis. If you don\u0027t have maneuver nodes or patched conics yet, burn just as the moon\u0027s showing up on the horizon from your ship\u0027s point of view; this should get you a Mun encounter, and then you can get into Mun orbit just fine. If you miss, don\u0027t worry; keep time warping until you get an encounter. The mun has a decently large sphere of influence, so the chances of a chance encounter are decent. Make sure to slow down the time warp near apoapsis so that if you do and you end up on a collision course, you have time to react.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the landing, be fairly reckless high up and start being more cautious lower down (that is, start being more careful to slow down lower down; be really conservative with fuel high up.) Use the Navball\u0027s retrograde marker to touch down with next to no horizontal velocity and maybe a recommended 3 m/s of vertical. Try not to tip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis paragraph is if you want to do a return mission; if you have no problem stranding Kerbals on Mun, don\u0027t read this. During liftoff, you can start your gravity turn immediately as there\u0027s no atmosphere; just remember to burn up enough to keep from crashing into any mountains. Burn prograde until you\u0027re on an escape trajectory, and then, when you\u0027re in Kerbin orbit, bring your periapsis into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere (I\u0027d recommend 20 km.) You should be able to aerobrake without using any more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, quicksave liberally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Don\u0027t forget to somehow get science back from orbit and the surface, as per the contract requirements.
