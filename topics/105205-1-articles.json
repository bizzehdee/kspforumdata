Ok so I\u0027ve just managed to put my lander on Duna yesterday so now my head is asking questions. Having watched many videos all about KSP, my knowledge base is growing (its still very small though lol). Heres my question.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy lander on Duna has no fuel left to get me into orbit, never mind get back home. So, if I was to repeat this mission, and send 2 parts of a rocket into orbit around Kerbin, dock them and get ready to return to Duna, is it possible for me to control the 2 parts of my rocket as 1? Can I stage the 2 of them just from the Space Bar or do I need to control each of them separately from an individual command pod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this question makes sense \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T06:29:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 06:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maceemiller\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jake9039","CreatedById":122602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T18:04:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyes, you can stage with 2 rockets docket, just some notes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: docking ports are wobly.
