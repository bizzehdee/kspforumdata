The white spot on Ceres is a flashlight. All comets are actually giant sprinkles. Earth is a space turtle that curled up in it\u0027s shell to form a round shape 100 million years ago, causing Pangaea to break up. It\u0027s impossible to land on Venus because it\u0027s secretly just Jool with a different color. Mercury is where dragons come from. If you try to land on Uranus, the crocodiles try to convince you to come closer, but they just want to distract you from the dragon that tries to eat you. The K-PG impactor was actually a spaceship that came to save the dinosaurs from the actual extinction event, which was the turtle sneezing.
