It\u0027s frustrating because it\u0027s the smallest, lightest, and earliest to unlock tech wise.....which makes it easiest to get to the Mun or Minmus early in your career.\n\nThat being said, I learned the hard way by leaving the next size up lab on the Mun (which does have a hatch), that the lab\u0027s right click menu disappears when you remove the lab from the command pod. If it is no longer attached to a command pod, or at least have a probe core with command functions attached as well as an atenna with sufficient range to phone home and receive commands....then the lab becomes pretty useless. \n\nSo now I have a lab on the Mun with solar panels, batteries, experiments, an experiment data holder, direct and relay antennas, and a hatch with a kerbal inside and no way to use the lab because I\u0027m a noob.\n\nI\u0027m about to launch a new mission with a mechanic and the hopes of welding a probe core to the lab (using the kerbal attachment and inventory mods), hoping that doing so will restore the right click menu options. With my luck it won\u0027t though....lol.\n\nSo basically what I\u0027m saying is, it\u0027s almost worth leaving a MK1 command pod with a hatch attached to the smallest lab for the sake of it functioning....\n\nIf you want to go REALLY small and light, the Umbra Space Industries \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Exploration Pack\u0022 adds the smallest command pods with hatches I have seen in the game (so far). Both the AES and HERP pods weigh 0.15 kilos and have a hatch and command functions included with them. They are basically considered emergency rescue or escape pods....but whatever works right? So I\u0027d slap one of those on the lab and drop it off and that may solve the issue. I\u0027d add the \u0022Connected Living Space\u0022 mod just to be on the safe side.....\n\nGLHF!\n\nJoE Smash"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-01T12:32:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, Sidereus said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yes, please.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I just had a mission to go rescue a Kerbal in low Minmus Orbit.

I will say with the process times being exponential, to turn 45 data around in over 100k years seems... excessive.
