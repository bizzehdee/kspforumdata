Instead they rely on offensive electronic warfare measures like ECM pods, and of course chaffe and flares, which is more traditional but has the advantage of being proven.\n\nAlso it\u0027s hard to make KSP aircraft stealthy in stock, and we have no way of measuring stealth in KSP"},{"CreatedByName":"Darren9","CreatedById":58062,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T16:44:16Z","Content":"Thanks, FAR does pretty well with IR and B9 Pwing, moving an IR joint causes FAR to recalculate the voxels, it\u0027s counted as a sealed box when it\u0027s closed and if I open it at too high speed the change in area and drag cause the last third of the craft to detach ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027m not finished yet but I just want to check I\u0027ve got this correct.
