Star Theory won\u0027t be able to get everything right from day one\u2014that\u0027s just programming\u2014so it falls on us, the community. Duplication of effort is silly and causes problems later down the line. For this reason I propose we coordinate the development of core dependency mods (coredeps). Below are some of my suggestions for coredeps which can establish long-term standards from the get-go:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2022 A general resource library similar to the Community Resource Pack. Never again should we face the anarchy which preceded the CRP. LiquidHydrogen competing with LH2, FSCoolant versus B9CompressedAir versus IntakeAtmosphere versus IntakeAtm\u2026 It\u0027s a mess so easily avoided, but we need to take the initiative. The earlier the burn the less the \u0394V, yes?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2022 A part category base similar to the Community Category Kit. Standardized ideas of where parts belong improve the user experience massively.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2022 ModuleManager. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E forms the foundation of essentially every part-affecting plugin. The health of the future KSP2 modding community is contingent upon the ability of mods to, well, modify\u2014both the game and one another. Masterpieces like Tweakscale could not practically exist without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2022 A part switcher. Today we have the Firespitter one, the B9 one, Configurable Containers from Allista, and the stock one. There\u0027s a high probability that KSP2 will implement this feature, given that KSP1 already has, but we still need to account for the possibility. A standardized part switcher will streamline a lot of model, config, and compatibility work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, a consortium of coredep maintainers and potential KSP2 modders would be useful in coordinating the development path taken by such dependencies, especially concerning the CRP- and CCK-like coredeps. If sufficient interest is demonstrated, a Discord server could be set up to facilitate such coordination.
