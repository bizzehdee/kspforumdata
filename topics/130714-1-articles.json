I\u0027m still pretty astonished that things like that, even though they might sound as little, have so much impact on my way of thinking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs some of you probably know, I work as an internal surgeon\u00A0in a small regional hospital in the heart of Europe. I usually work long shifts, since there is a terrible lack of internists (or any doctors for that matter). As such, I often find myself taking night supervision? shifts at the hospital. It usually doesn\u0027t involve much real work, everyone is sleeping, only sometimes things go bad with some patients or someone gets sick in the dead of night. I usually spend that time either chatting with other people unfortunate enough to have a night supervision shift (the rules require at least one doctor per ward in the hospital at any given moment) or - you guessed it - playing KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd just as I am finishing my latest SSTO, I get that strange feeling one has when someone is watching him from behind. I turned around and saw a little boy, about six years old, standing right behind the ready room armchair I was sitting on with my laptop. He was watching my screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI put the laptop on the coffee table and stood up to maintain at least some dignity, since I\u0027ve just been caught playing games at work. But it doesn\u0027t seem to concern the little guy. He still keeps looking at the screen with his mouth slightly open. He didn\u0027t look terribly good, he was pale and his eyes were watery, he was coughing and\u00A0likely had fever at that time, but that didn\u0027t stop him from asking:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Is this a plane?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Yes\u0022, I said, double surprised with his sudden appearance and his apparent interest in SSTO Spaceplanes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And will it fly?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nI pressed the \u0022Launch\u0022 button, took off, and rocketed towards the sky. I looked at him, and he was positively delighted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t go all the way to the orbit. Instead, I reverted to SPH and showed him the basics of building planes. The first plane he has built flew nicely, and I found myself teaching him rocket science and basic physics for the following half an hour. Then I realised that the paediatric ward was going to miss him, and took him back there. The nurse was my good friend, so things went quite smoothly, even though she probably had a word with that kid. I thought the story was over there, but it wasn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe following day I had the afternoon shift. It was quite a mess, a lot of people decided to have appendicitis operated\u00A0that day. After three routine operations, I was ready to go home, only to have the doctor of the paediatric ward come to me and tell me that her patient was asking for\u00A0me. So I went there, and he had me playing \u0022The plane game\u0022 with him for another hour (where he successfully learned that rockets don\u0027t go straight up to space).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis more or less happened again three more times. I\u0027d always come to the paediatric after shift, play KSP for about an hour, and then go home. I didn\u0027t think much about it at that time, for me it was just a sick kid wanting to play a computer game. I didn\u0027t ask for his diagnosis or anything; I was just trying to make him happy. I know how much it helps to be entertained when you\u0027re ill. Over these days, he was recovering.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday, I went there again, played some more KSP (We launched a space station core together), then went back to my car. The nurse from the first night has stopped me on the way. She thanked me for coming to the kid and playing games with him. She said that he was an orphan with a case of bronchitis, quite a severe one, and\u00A0he was alone in the hospital for three days before his adventure. She also told me that he was sad, and his sickness was getting worse at first and then rapidly recovering, the turning point being that night when he came over to the internal ward.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI said the usual \u0022That was nothing\u0022, as the social conventions require me to, but inside I was thinking about what happened. How a little game can help a sick kid to get better. I know about the effects of the state of mind on the human body, and I think this might just be one of those cases, since he is recovering now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe\u0027s still there, in the hospital, and he probably will be there for about two more days before they release him. I think I might be coming again tomorrow, docking some more modules to the station. He should be interested...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T22:03:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood job!
