You need to burn retrograde to Kerbin into an elliptical orbit with a Pe \u0026lt; 1,000,000m to get that. That\u0027s the easy part. The hard part is getting back home again. It will typically be about 5 orbits later before Kerbin is there when the ship comes around. This trip takes loads of d-V. A much better pilot that me, who took the time to calculate and then execute a perfectly synched Kerbin rendezvous 5 orbits later, did it with 5000m/s. I just went for it without any planning and it required 8000m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2.

As soon as your orbit exits Kerbins SOI, cut throttle and wait. You should only be a few m/s over escape velocity. Once you\u0027re in solar orbit, do stuff. When you\u0027re done, turn your vessel so it\u0027s pointing straight at Kerbin and throttle up. Ideally, you won\u0027t be in the Sun\u0027s SOI for more than a few minutes so Kerbin won\u0027t be too far away. Either way, point and shoot. When your map says you\u0027re going to re-enter, throttle down and wait until you\u0027re back into Kerbins SOI. Then, make any orbital changes necessary to put your perikee at around 30km for aerocapture. Your craft doesn\u0027t need to be anything special - anything capable of landing on Minmus will be able to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2, I\u0027d say Eve because of the thick atmosphere and larger gravity well, but it really does depends on whether you\u0027re planning on coming back. If you are, aim for Duna - an aerobrake is easier (don\u0027t forget F5 though!) and you can lift off pretty easily too. If it\u0027s a one-way trip, head for Eve. Gilly can provide some pretty good Science and it\u0027s **** easy to land on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn inclination change in Solar orbit will cost you about 300m/s dV which, if you\u0027re piloting interplanetary vessels, isn\u0027t that much really.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T01:25:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NERVAfan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NERVAfan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2.
