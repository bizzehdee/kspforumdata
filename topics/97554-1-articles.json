I am playing around with antenna range, and RT, and i haven\u0027t got to the point of setting up keosynchronous satellites yet. Does Antenna range require these if you tick the line of sight box? basically i am looking at a way of easing myself into these things before i go full on with it so i don\u0027t melt my brain. Also using snacks before i start using TAC, again to just get used to a life support mod without taxing myself too much until i want more of a challenge.
