I played about 100 hours pure stock, and now would like to experience a bit more challenging with some mods. \u003Cstrong\u003EMy question though, for addons that add new parts, (Such as Karbonite, Station Science, \u0026amp; Kerbal Attachment System), would they all work together in career mode?\u003C/strong\u003E My original thought was that they have their own tech trees, so a tech tree designed for Karbonite wouldn\u0027t show the parts for Station Science or Kerbal Attachment System adds to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had this question because I was looking at the addon Better Than Starting Manned, and it appeared that it had it\u0027s own tech tree, so would that mean that I wouldn\u0027t be able to use parts that are unlocked in career mode that other addons add in (such as the ones listed above)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the list of mods I planned on using:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tF8vdSH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tF8vdSH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of them are realism-based, others are for enhancement of existing features. \u003Cstrong\u003EI don\u0027t believe any of them have a custom tech tree, so wouldn\u0027t that mean they should all work together in career mode?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched KSP with most of these mods (I added and removed a few since then), and KSP was launched fine, although I did experienced two crashes with 10 minutes of each other.
