I\u0027m attaching a picture of my performance metrics in game.

The system is using 32gb of the fastest timing ddr4 ram available @ 3966mhz. My GPU is a 6950xt liquid devil,\u00A0 undervolted and overclocked.\u00A0 This system was built to run flight and racing sims in 4k, and runs MSFS 2020 on ultra settings at 75-110 fps. MSFS runs in VR on ultra settings @ 55-90 fps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe picture was taken with a large interplanetary ship in orbit.\u00A0\u00A0I made a fresh career and launched a small rocket to 50km as an experiment. The GPU usage did get up to 98% @ 55-60 fps during launch, but the CPU never get above 3% and stayed around 2.8ghz. A lot of people on Reddit and the steam forums have tried to tell me my CPU is bottlenecking the game, but its barely being utilized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs anyone else experiencing this issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GizmoMagui","CreatedById":226842,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-22T04:35:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyep i get about\u003Cbr\u003E\nCPU AMD 5950x 5.0hrz: 4% to 7%\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nRam Gskill 64g 3200hrz \u003Cspan\u003E:\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E2.7%\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\npegged Rog strix TI/OC/WE 3090ti: 100%\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis is not optimized yet and CPU as well as RAM and M.2/HDD/SSD drive is no joke Null.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSide note:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNetwork from KSP2 has sent out 17.5gb of data over the NET (odd) more then discord and i stream and chat on it none stop haha and also more then Steam\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nout of all the years of playing and making videogames i have NEVER see a game\u00A0 just run pure GPU only.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:valwink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/val_head_happywink.png\u0022 title=\u0022:valwink:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:valjoy:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/val_head_laughcry.png\u0022 title=\u0022:valjoy:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-22T04:37:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2023 04:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by GizmoMagui\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
