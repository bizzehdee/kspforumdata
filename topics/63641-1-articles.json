Consider the fact that an Aerospike engine gets 390 Isp, provides 175 kN, and weighs 1.5 tonnes, that means in order to get an Eve TWR of 1.0, you need an Aerospike for every 9 tonnes of fuel tanks. This leaves a maximum delta-V of 5.5 km/s, 8.0 are required for escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about using ions or nukes? Well, I have a hard time imagining that your gonna get either into space where it becomes useful as a conventional rocket, and even so, you won\u0027t be in space long enough for it to do a burn unless you burn even more from your lifter engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about a plane?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith jets: no O2, no thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith RAPIERS: This isn\u0027t saving you anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith high-thrust rockets of some sort: you now need to go through more atmosphere, sure, you may have more delta-v, up to 8.4 km/s or so, but you will need even more because of the atmosphere you have to push through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith nukes: takeoff is nearly impossible and highly inefficient, no fuel left to burn efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith ions: this might work. The trouble is getting a plane with an Eve-TWR probably in the neighborhood of 0.05-0.1 to fly with stock aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith SAS-powered or wheel-powered flight (heliopters, true ornithopters): plausible if and only if you can get a high enough fuel fraction up high enough to burn to orbit with the lifter stuck to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Infiniglide: Easy. You\u0027ll do it by accident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a K-drive: you must find a way to reach 750 m/s orbital speed first, doable. That or you can let it creep up to a suitable altitude and then use normal rockets, or drop it and let it fall to at least 750 m/s before activating propulsion mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a Kerbal on a ladder that propels a plane: ... And lots of patience, yes, it is definitely doable, however payload is limited to a few hundred kg at most and actually reaching orbit could take several hours. On the plus side, you spend literally no energy getting there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
