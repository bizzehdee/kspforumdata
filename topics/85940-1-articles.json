Second, I would like ask for specific suggestions of additional experiments that other community members would like to see added to the game as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science system is currently a little bland and uninteresting, and I think adding a wider variety of real world-inspired science experiments to the game would make it more interesting. This could be used to make the game easier (by not reducing the value of other experiments)- which I would prefer- or could be coupled to a decrease in the value of other experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the science system should be made easier with more experiments (and no decrease in value of existing experiments) so as to give players more freedom in their play-style, and the game made harder in *OTHER* ways (such as the addition of re-entry heat, and a difficulty option to upscale the Kerbin/Kerbol system 2-3x from its current 1/11th scale compared to Earth/Sol). Players who think this makes science too \u0022easy\u0022 can always set the science rewards higher through the difficulty sliders in 0.25, which it was just revealed are going to include a science rewards multiplier slider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that these experiments are heavily inspired by the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64972\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDMagic Orbital Science mod\u003C/a\u003E- which adds more science experiments to the game. without further adieu:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESolar (Kerbolar) Particle Collector\u003C/strong\u003E- A science experiment which would only be usable in orbit. Allows players to sample the solar (Kerbolar) wind for !SCIENCE! Adds to the currently measly number of experiments (gravity and temperature scans) which can be performed in orbit. Should give the highest Science yields when in orbit of the Sun or Jool, due to the lack of interfering planets or the strong magnetic/gravitational fields which trap solar particles around Jool, respectively; slightly higher yields at Moho, due to proximity to the Sun; and MUCH higher yields in \u0022Near\u0022 Sun orbits...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGamma Ray Spectrometer\u003C/strong\u003E- A science experiment which would only be usable in orbit. Like the real-world GRS experiments, allows the player to scan for the elements indicative of water (Hydrogen\u002BOxygen), even in the form of subsurface ice (this is one experiment that was used to prove there is ice on Mars and the Moon). Could possibly give snarky text bits about how \u0022Snacks\u0022 is not an element, and *maybe* even provide a part for locating deposits/concentrations (of numerous different elements) for an ISRU system if the devs ever change their minds about Resources...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EScience Note\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E- Some players will, \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Eincorrectly\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E, argue that GRS cannot be used to find water. I would like to respectfully inform them that they are wrong. Gamma Ray Spectrometers can be, and in fact have been, used to find high concentrations of Hydrogen and Oxygen (as well as over 20 other elements)- which can be indicative of water/ice when found together in large amounts.

Personally, I think the discovery of a monolith or an ancient spacecraft should be of scientific interest to the Kerbals. An \u0022anomaly scanner\u0022 part could give large science yields when used in proximity to any of the anomalies.
