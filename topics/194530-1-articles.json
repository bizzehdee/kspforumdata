I put it on the launch pad, 2 details are not connected with each other and one half of the rocket falls into the other, while there are no logs of destruction. Ok, I recreate the floor of the ship tied to these details, put it on the table, the rocket does not break, but now I can not start it - the red light on the steps - the spacebar does not respond .... I restart the game, load the rocket, the glass onto the table, flew ! when the capsule returns to the planet, the heat shield o_O .... flies off with the compartment (it does not have the \u201Cstep\u201D setting). alt \u002B f4. And this happens very often.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRecently, the Kraken has reached a new level. I wanted to make a mobile launcher for an existing and normally working rocket. I made sketches, I decided to check the lifting mechanics, before bringing beauty. I save, load on the runway, the structure breaks due to the fragility of the structure. OK. \u0022return to the hangar.\u0022 What I see:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- the root part is changed\u003Cbr\u003E\n- 3-4 rotated\u003Cbr\u003E\n- 5 parts are offset from their position\u003Cbr\u003E\n- restore the geometry by turns and offsets is not possible ...\u003Cbr\u003E\nI load the file with the rocket, but all these changes are already in the save file ...\u003Cimg alt=\u002225bc0520444b.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002270.42\u0022 height=\u0022676\u0022 width=\u0022960\u0022 src=\u0022https://d.radikal.ru/d33/2006/19/25bc0520444b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy I DO NOT need help with this problem:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1 - I do not speak English, and communicating through translators is not an option.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2 - I do not want to try \u0022reinstalling the game / windows / pc / dusting the speakers, etc.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n3 - I believe that if the game solves some problems by rebooting, then the problem is in the game, and not in the player\u2019s equipment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4 - the game has been around for many years, and if the developers wanted / could solve these problems, they would have done it already, but I don\u2019t want to build a bike out of crutches on a game that itself is one big crutch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd all this against the background of the FPS drop from the number of parts, the central fastening of the pipes and, as a result, the \u201Csausage\u201D of the entire structure.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI really hope that the future game will not inherit all this ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
