To be precise (according to Mechjeb):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion........total vacuum dV............total weight on launchpad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E22..............6832 m/s......................131.67 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E23.5...........6818............................131.44\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E24.2...........7333............................131.24\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe differences between 22 and 23.5 are due to the small parts that became weightless (ladders, solar panels) and the addition of monopropellant to the capsule. The huge difference in 24.2 is due to the Mainsail\u0027s higher Isp and the lower weight of the Poodle (2.0 versus 2.5 tons earlier).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What does this matter? It means the Kerbal X can now easily do a Mun land-and-return mission! I recall an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64071-Kerbal-X-to-the-Mun-and-back?highlight=kerbal\u002BMun\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eold challenge\u003C/a\u003E where the goal was to land the Kerbal X on Mun with the most fuel still in the tanks, or even try to get back to Kerbin. No one made it back. Recently I\u0027ve been trying to do a Kerbin-Mun land-Kerbin mission for as little dV as possible and was down to 6863 m/s and decided to give the X a try in 24.2. Piece of cake! Even with the reduced T/W of the X over my test craft I did the mission with 6869m/s and so had plenty of fuel left over. I\u0027d been thinking of another challenge but it would have to be with version 22 or 23.5 and so would not be very inclusive. Maybe a challenge could be done that requires 24.2 and is just to try to have the lowest total dV or the most fuel left over after returning to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtra note: my take on the theoretical minimums for a Mun landing mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E75x75km Kerbin orbit to Mun surface pass: 840m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun pass to landing (in an instant explosion of thrust on the 5500m mountain) : 762m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun surface to Munar escape: 762m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd in 4350 for Kerbin surface to 75x75 orbit and the mission total is about 6720m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T15:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm.

Your VSOI would be 1m/s, which is, need I say, less than what will get you back to Kerbin directly. But using repeated Munar flybys and small deep space maneuvers you could theoretically build up enough dV to get back to Kerbin. In practice I can make it back to Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere from a 5.5x5.5km orbit with a 207m/s thrust, it gives 125m/s at the SOI, then a 16m/s deep space manuever and another Munar flyby gets you home.Since circular V at 5500m is about 563m/s that means 786m/s is already practical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Enough being mysterious, here\u0027s how I did 6869m/s with the 24.2 Kerbal X.
