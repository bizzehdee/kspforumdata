Through sheer brute force, I\u0027ve managed to get a test base running. \n\nAnd I have to point something out. The iron works is a perpetual metal machine once you get even the smallest amount of ore into it. \n\nSmelt the ore, then convert it to rocket parts. Scrap metal is left over, then you recycle scrap metal back into metal. However, the returned metal from recycling is higher than the original metal you started with.\n\nAnyway, here\u0027s an image of my test structure, Manticor Mobile Field Base.\n\n![MFB_Manticor_zps4esaev1f.jpg](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v430/admiraltigerclaw/MFB_Manticor_zps4esaev1f.jpg)\n\nEverything came off that truck except starter rocket parts. I\u0027m ignoring those for now. It\u0027s amazing what you can operate with a molten salt nuclear reactor.\n\nAnyway, my opinion is that things need a little streamlining. I love it, but the whole configuration seems a little too cross dependent and it\u0027s quite counter intuitive (even with the popups) to realize that the geology lab needs the research kits made from the doc lab (in chemistry mode), but the doc lab needs ore from the drill, but the drill has an extraction efficiency of a grain of sand per cubic mile when you first start up until the geology lab can get into gear. Which is frustrating when you\u0027re not even sure if/how anything works beyond \u0027connect and inflate\u0027.\n\nI also noticed that your selection of the resource \u0027metal ore\u0027 does not show up on scansat\u0027s resources. Not knocking you or scan sat, but it might be prudent to change the ore type to \u0027metallic ore\u0027 since another mod seems to use that and it\u0027s already built into scansat.\n\nAnd finally... The core drill seems lonely. Make it a drill mount part specifically for it to match this mod\u0027s flavor. A surface mount block and a girder work but... Heck, I\u0027m sure it mounts to any old wall or parked truck, but still. \n\nSo yeah, my suggestions in a nutshell.\n\n- Streamline operation or improve the instructions.\n\n- Fix the ratios in the iron works... And probably double-check the other converter units.\n\n- Suggest changing your \u0027metal ore\u0027 to \u0027metallic ore\u0027 so scan-sat can work with it (or at least be cross compatible with other mods)\n\n- Add something to mount the mini core drill on that\u0027s looks the part. Because it\u0027s wronery.\n\nAnd I apologize in advance if I seem curt or presumptuous (or really behind since I\u0027m writing this at the end). It\u0027s four in the morning and I\u0027m trying to dump my thoughts before I crash.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAnd I\u0027m awake now and took a look in the cfg files. The iron works output values for the metals is actually completely messed up. Placeholder values of 1 in output ratios for recycle it seems.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-26T20:19:43Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2015 08:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AdmiralTigerclaw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ciaran","CreatedById":137646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T16:46:24Z","Content":"Sorry for being a bit of an idiot, But how do i get metallic ore? is there a recommended mod to use to get a metallic ore drill?"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T12:39:48Z","Content":"Would you consider packaging this up as a supplimental mod?

I based the metal ratios on Extraplanetary Launchpads. I\u0027ll take a look and make sure they match those from EL. I thought they did...\n\nMetaOre also comes from EL; when I integrate another mod, such as EL or OSE Workshop, I adopt the resources it uses. If I created my own resources, you\u0027d have to do some mental flips to figure out the production chain depending upon which mod you\u0027re using, and the integrated mod\u0027s storage tanks would no longer be helpful. Pathfinder does revert to MetallicOre-\u003EMetals-\u003ERocketParts when EL isn\u0027t installed. Maybe what\u0027s needed is for EL to patch ScanSat so it will show up.\n\nThanks for the suggestion on the Gold Digger.
