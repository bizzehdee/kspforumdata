They then went through training including basic flight training, weightless flight training, parachute jumping, sea survival training, EVA training and sitting in the back seat of a MiG 25 to critical altitude.

But the longer I\u0027ve allowed the question to stew between the ears, the more I realize the necessity to respond to it. I will admit I am a historian by trade; I currently teach a nice combination of World Civilization and American Foreign Policy; both my M.A. and Ph.D. degrees are focused on U.S. history/U.S. policy history and because of the nature of the beast, there\u0027s considerable amount of European background within both degrees because of the colonial/Early Republic fields of research. It is well-established that in nearly every ancient culture extending into the early modern age, minors were in every part of every day life (I\u0027d love to say more about this but it could run afoul of 2.2b since it does discuss cultural views that tend to become political) . Children were not seen as getting in the way, being a bother, being a liability, or sent off to go play. In some cultures, children as young as five had some sort of domestic duties, and at times, they even served in battle as soldiers, sailors, or even monarchs - a trend that still continues today although it was abandoned in the West by the end of the 19th Century, C.E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease keep in mind I have a pretty bad migraine headache today.

We do not understand how long duration exposure to radiation might affect the development of a minor.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil we understand the risks of radiation outside of Earth\u0027s magnetic\u00A0 safety zone, the damage that form of radiation causes to the human body, how it affects growth and development, and how to mitigate or overcome it with technology, we do not need to callously expose minors to the harshness of space. This is one of the many reasons we have yet to develop permanent colonies on the Moon or have sent humans to explore the surface of Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, once we begin to actively colonize the Moon and Mars, we will have to allow minors into space and onto both bodies. I say this because we already have a model of how colonization of other worlds will look like within human history: the colonization of North and South America and Australia. We know there will be a high human cost to putting a permanent human presence on both. Right now, with our level of technology, and with what we don\u0027t know, I think we are probably - and this is a very optimistic estimate - at least fifty years before we see any real effort being made to colonize either place. Sadly, I do no think I will see colonization of either body within my lifetime - I\u0027m already 52.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith what we are doing in LEO currently, there\u0027s no pressing need to send minors into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs it possible and feasible to send minors into space\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#16a085;\u0022\u003Ewithin the outer planets of our Solar System?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENo, it is currently not possible or feasible to send any minor into space \u003C/strong\u003E(for all the reasons listed above).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, once we have established, functioning colonies on the Moon and Mars, I do think it makes sense to have teenagers on outer Solar System missions for a variety of reasons. But this is all under the theory that the issues with radiation have been overcome, or at the very least, mitigated. As we know, FTL travel will probably remain the food of science fiction for a few more decades, so this means any missions to the outer planets will use traditional propulsion/engines technologies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ETravel between Earth and Jupiter could take from two to six years - one way\u003C/u\u003E. One of the things many of our favorite science fiction television shows and movies leave out is there is a lot of dead time in spaceflight. This would give an experienced crew a perfect opportunity to train a younger crew (think teenagers) while on such a mission.
