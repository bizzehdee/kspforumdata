Essentially you download the file in one shot (like most smaller downloads from sites) or as you can in increments (connection permitting). My issue is with downloading the file through the browser when it is interrupted, you lose all that accumulated file (such as in the 90% territory). With a torrent, you simply pick up where you left off when you reconnect. We\u0027ll keep the seeders/leachers aspect for later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T21:08:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad use torrents for the demos, but are not going to do so for the release, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClosing this before it turns to another subject related to torrents.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
