I\u0027ve been having a lot of fun playing KSP, and have probably pressed F5 and F9 so many times due to getting into KSP that I\u0027m surprised they\u0027re still in one piece \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s my Space Station, the KIOS (Kerbin International Orbital Station) It\u0027s main purpose is to A: Be awesome, B: Repair and\u00A0Resupply ships departing LKO, and C: Repair and analyze the Science from ships returning to LKO. Bercine Kerman, the Station\u0027s Engineer, is also in the picture, while Barger and Maglyn Kerman, the Station\u0027s Scientist and Pilot/Commander, remain inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222W8iUgT.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2W8iUgT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe station is fully finished for now, although I may decide to add a Hitchhiker Module\u00A0aswell as a Life Support Module if I decide to get USI Life Support, I also intend to dock a Spacecraft of some kind to serve as a Escape Vehicle, It did have one at one time but it was used to fulfill a rescue contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKIAA (The Kerbal International Aerospace Administration) has also successfully landed\u00A0Kerbbed missions on Mun and Minmus and put a Kerbbed Semi-Permanent base on the latter, I\u0027ve also landed a unkerbbed rover on Duna (which has since crashed)\u00A0and in a past save which I think I deleted accidentally I landed a unkerbbed\u00A0lander without a rover or any way to move, I also currently have a lander inbound for Ike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur other acomplishments are: Making a SSTO Spaceplane after many failed attempts (although one proved to be a good atmospheric Jet), making a rocket with over 9km/s of Delta-V which I learned the hard way was massive overkill for performing a Kerbbed Mun Mission \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E, Making a working and fully reusable Spaaaaace Shuttle (although it involved putting on a lot of those liquid fuelled RCS thrusters to control Pitch),\u00A0Discovering Duna is green with our first Kerbbed Mission there,\u00A0(Either that or somebody forgot to tell Jeb\u00A0it was just a in-atmosphere test of the lander on\u00A0Kerbin)\u00A0performing a EVA from the surface of Minmus, down to LKO to rendezvous with the KIOS, dumping off all the Science there to be processed, and then going helmet first down to the surface of Kerbin, and then performing a Kerouz mission to pick up the science, if I remember correctly the Kerbal who did this BadS feat which put Jeb (who is now looking for revenge) to shame was Gregbald Kerman, the reason I did this was to fulfill a contract to rescue him from Minmus Orbit, so rescue contract, complete! (I later went into the files and set BadS to true for Gregbald, as it\u0027s previous reading of false surely couldn\u0027t be true when he had just EVA\u0027d across tens of thousands of Kilometers)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree Questions though: When I installed RPM it seems to have broken Porkjet\u0027s habitat pack, or atleast the Soyuz Capsule, which I was using for my Kerouz Spacecraft and would really like to have working, is there a patch or some edit I can make in the files to correct it? Also what\u0027s the best Delta-V to have for landing on Kerbin\u0027s Moons? as the 8 KM/S I originally heard was the best seems to be massive overkill. Finally what\u0027s a good way to ensure\u00A0massive rockets stay on course and in one piece? As even with fins and strut spam they still seem to flip out and turn into ICBM\u0027s, and with EVE\u00A0the KSC is not that far away from a massive city which some of my larger out of control rockets like to go to, and raining rocket debris down on Civilians is something that I\u0027d like to avoid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll add more pictures of my Contributions to Kessler Syndrome...
