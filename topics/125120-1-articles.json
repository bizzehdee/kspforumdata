So I\u0027ve updated to 1.0.5 build 1028 and at first everything seemed ok. Took an old simple rocket into LKO, no worries there. I attempted to lower my landing legs and the game jerked terribly every couple of seconds whilst lowering. After that it kept doing it, jerky pauses?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the same graphics settings etc as 1.0.4. Anyone else had this issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe legs im using are the LT-2 and they work fine on a really small rocket, but the one im flying now has only 76 parts and worked perfectly before updating? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT - just tried a 133 part rocket I built and the legs work fine?
