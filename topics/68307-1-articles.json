I really want to get back into it and learn more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem i am faced with is the overwhelming number of add-ons and mods out there and i would love it if you guys could suggest a list of Mods/add-ons for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am most interested in Information displaying add-ons that give me specific data on my environment and my active vessel. I used to use Mechjeb a TON and really found it useful, is that still the mainstay for getting all that wonderful data i crave?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys feel are absolutely necessary add-ons that enhance the game without changing it completely? I am not a fan of automatic things but I don\u0027t mind having them as i can just turn them off or not use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you much!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T00:09:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux is good for providing a bunch of nice stats if you don\u0027t want Mechjeb\u0027s autopilot features. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also a fan of the FAR and Deadly Reentry combo, but its up to you if you think that would change the game too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mods I like the most though are aesthetic ones.

I also have become dependent on Kerbal Alarm Clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve played stock until very recently, but I\u0027ve just now added Kethane and Kerbal Attachment System to the mix. These provide a great amount of extra gameplay. I\u0027ve spent the last couple of days getting a fuel base set up on the Mun--I landed an empty half-size SLS tank and a mining rig to keep it full of fuel/ox. I\u0027ve got an orbiting station with an orange tank, and a fuel ferry that hauls up about 500 units of fuel at a time (on my to-do list is to make a big ferry that can handle full orange tanks). KAS lets my EVA Kerbals set up pipelines between the base and landed ships to make refueling easier. And I can even do retrofits on my ships like adding lights or moving around the RCS blocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think pretty soon I\u0027ll try out RemoteTech, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my Munar fuel mining operation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1189614/web-images/screenshot4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s my orbital refueling station with the fuel ferry docked at the bottom:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1189614/web-images/screenshot2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-11T22:40:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2014 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tinyboss\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
