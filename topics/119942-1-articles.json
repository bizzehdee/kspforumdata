That means that a technologically-advanced civilization would have to be (or their ships would have to fly) within one-hundred light-years of Earth to even spot us. That\u0027s a pretty tiny needle in a colossally gigantic haystack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn further reflection, I think I can safely throw this in: for aliens to contact us based on the above, is assuming those aliens are searching for RADIO signals.

In order to communicate over astronomical distances, we\u0027re likely to develop something based on wormholes, entanglement, etc. (Yes I do know why entanglement doesn\u0027t already work. But the basic idea at least.) - because light-based signals would be like snail mail. If I want a live feed from Jupiter, radio signals won\u0027t work, let alone a live feed from Proxima Centauri.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t currently have this technology, so we have no way to pick up the kinds of signals our future selves will be using. If the extraterrestrials dropped by (as in landed on our Moon or something), we might be able to pick up their walkie-talkies, but their long-range stuff may well be passing us by completely undetected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay they use a system where they build a small wormhole, put one end on a ship and the other at their base, and run a wire through it. Effectively, the distance to the ship through the wormhole is only a few yards at most, even if outside it\u0027s light-years. Thus it\u0027d be easy to communicate with a distant spacecraft with negligible delay - and as a completely unintended side effect, the signal doesn\u0027t go dispersing all over space. Since the signal is inside the wormhole - inside the wire in fact - no amount of radio telescopy is going to reveal it out here, and it\u0027s not because anyone put any effort into hiding it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a related note, imagine in the far future we want to land a rover on an exoplanet, but we suspect that planet has something living on it. Even today, we make painstaking effort to sterilize our rovers and not harm the Martian environment more than is necessary to land the thing (it\u0027s solar powered rather than gas powered, to put it bluntly). Mars isn\u0027t even inhabited, except mayyybe by a few microbes. If we knew there were a good chance of something like, say, a coral reef or a rainforest (equivalent - we obviously won\u0027t find a literal rainforest), we\u0027d be all the more careful, to the point where, ideally, they\u0027d never know we were there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if we turn it around, if anything\u0027s been probing Earth, even if they\u0027re the careless, warlike sort of people we are, their scientists are entirely liable to have sent something so stealthy we\u0027d never notice. The probability is small, of course (in fact my bet is it hasn\u0027t actually happened), but it\u0027s entirely plausible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T03:23:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe they do not believe in aliens - and thus do not search for any contact.

The thing to remember is that these reactions have to produce something that is self-replicating. The problem is that at low temperatures, these reactions generally don\u0027t occur -- atoms happily sit around with other atoms in stable molecules, never bothering to move around and find new buddies for new molecules (which means no self-replication and no life). When temperatures get too hot, the molecules tend to break down in to smaller molecules which are too stable to react with anything else (again, no self-replication and no life). The key thing is finding a temperature range where you can have a big enough variety of molecules to form self-replicating structures and reactions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut finding the right temperature range isn\u0027t enough.

I can see where they\u0027d come from too:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: We know that in at least one instance, life forms made of liquid water and carbon-based polymers can arise, which is better than we can say for any other situation, so it makes sense to look where we \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E life might be, and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB: If we have any plans to make contact and establish some kind of galactic federation, it\u0027ll be a lot easier if they live in a vaguely Earth-like climate and we can identify with them in some sense. For example, in the Mass Effect series we found it much easier to ally with the Asari than the Rachni. So, again, might as well focus the search on those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept I disagree with \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E looking at Earth-like watery worlds around 300K with 1 atmosphere of surface pressure, etc. I feel like it\u0027d be wiser to consider any object that exhibits anomalous chemistry or emissions (e.g. Earth is green despite being made of gray rocks, and its atmosphere is full of O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JedTech","CreatedById":104003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T16:49:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it is very simple.

Even if a shockingly high percentage of stars do in fact harbor life at some point in their existence (say, 1 in 1000, even 1 in 100 would make only so much difference here), consider the fraction of a microcosm of time in which our own planet has harbored life capable of generating signals. Now take a nice, generous (but finite) guess as to how long we\u0027ll survive. You\u0027ll find that the odds do not favor two such civilizations existing anywhere near each other with most even halfway reasonable numbers - it takes something really, really extraordinary, like a multi-million year starfaring civilization, to improve probabilities of overlap. I, personally, don\u0027t think such civilizations are likely to be common, if they exist anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it has led me to an interesting thought in the past. The wonderful thing about astronomical numbers is that even conservative Drake estimates suggest there are/were millions, billions, or more, planets harboring life throughout the universe. However improbable, the universe is vast enough that the improbable becomes practically inevitable. This suggests to me that somewhere, in a galaxy far, far away (and maybe even long, long ago \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ), there very possibly are two planets, both harboring some kind of advanced life, maybe both orbiting one star, maybe closely neighboring stars, but close enough that contact became probable - and reality. For those two planets, our fanciful sci fi is a reality.
