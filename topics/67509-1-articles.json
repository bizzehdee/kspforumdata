I\u0027ve noticed that (at least in 0.23) flags are assigned on a part-by-part basis. So if you\u0027ve launched your orbiter and lander separately, they will keep different flags even after they\u0027ve docked. Or you can edit the save file to change the flag on just your lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume that the flag planted by kerbals is set by the flag of the part they last came out of, though, so I doubt you can have separate flags for the lander and the... well, flag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
