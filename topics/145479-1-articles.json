the idea of having xp is probably good, but both the current method of earning it and the rewards for doing so are bad.\u00A0 I\u0027m not sure what would be a good system for earning xp, but it should be something different for each type of crew and somehow tied in to them actually doing their job rather than merely sitting in a rocket while it goes to different places,\u00A0 And the bonus for leveling up needs to make more sense as well.\u00A0 Why should a trained pilot be able to point the ship at one navball marker just fine but need to fly to a different planet before he figures out how to keep it pointing at a different marker instead?\u00A0 Engineers need to go to Mars before they can figure out how to fix a broken landing gear?\u00A0 Having scientists be able to research faster and engineers better at running ISRU\u0027s does at least make some sense.\u00A0 The amount by which it speeds up is completely unrealistic, but that could at least be excused as being necessary for gameplay in order to make it meaningful...except that it really isn\u0027t important since you can just timewarp through it anyway.\u00A0 Until in-game time as some actual meaning, it\u0027s completely irrelevant how long it takes, so even that part of the current system becomes pointless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-07T17:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI (like everyone else, it seems) like\u00A0the
