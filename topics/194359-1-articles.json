I was creating a backup before I patch to 1.9.1, and I noticed that my game does not match up with the files in windows file explorer. The one mod that I have (Luna Multiplayer 0.25.0) and some of the ships in my most recently played save are not present in my file explorer. I have the checkbox to display hidden files enabled, so they aren\u0027t hidden, and I can still fly the missing ships just fine in game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a photo of the menu screen, showing that Luna Multiplayer is running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/BNI9fzp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/BNI9fzp\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a photo of my GameData folder, showing that no Luna Multiplayer folder is in there (there should be a folder titled LunaMultiplayer with the data for the mod)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/xaLiHxM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/xaLiHxM\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a photo of my ship list in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E showing my Dragonfly \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E, which is missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/yst53fJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/yst53fJ\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a photo of my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E ships folder, showing that the file is not there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/zWhOYCC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/zWhOYCC\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would just run the patcher and hope that it works, but when I run the patcher on my Kerbal Space Program folder it says that it is not a valid folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/4VahEJi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/4VahEJi\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not totally sure what to do here, and I wanted to check here before I just delete and reinstall. I have a backup made with my most recent saves folder and my most recent screenshots folder, but I\u0027m not entirely sure if they would even work due to this issue, and I didn\u0027t notice the issue before I made the backup so I have no earlier backups unfortunately.\u00A0 I would try uninstalling Luna Multiplayer, but since the GameData file is not there I\u0027m not entirely sure how to do that. Does anyone have a fix for this? If I do uninstall and reinstall, do you think the backup would work?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-01T05:28:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2020 05:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by boBylliB\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
