I do remember that the writer had also included an expansion to the paper that demonstrated sustained gravity based fusion in a star like process on something as small as earth, but it was getting into some \u0027weird\u0027 science at that scale.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whistlehead","CreatedById":79926,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T19:32:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the task brief (It\u0027s 2000 words, BTW), it\u0027s looking like it might also be a good idea to compare propulsion in the game vs real life - would a Mainsail work the same in our world?
