I had just gotten the module, with 16 brave kerbals onboard, to LMO, and (yes, I use mechjeb to rendevous) I set mechjeb to rendevous with the Station Core. It was on auto-warp, but was still doing nothing. I thought that maybe the engine was turned off, so I staged it. Which separated the booster from the module itself. 16 brave kerbals are now stranded in Minmus orbit. I had a plan to rescue them with an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, but then I thought \u0027Well, we\u0027re so close to the end of the mission, maybe I can just bring another booster.
