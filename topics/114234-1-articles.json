Here\u0027s how to do it:\n\nGo to \\GameData\\Squad\\Parts\\Utility\\decouplerSeparatorTR-XL. Inside you\u0027ll find \u0022decouplerSeparatorTR-XL.cfg\u0022. Copy-paste it in the same folder.\n\nChange the copy\u0027s name to whatever you want, then open it. First, look for a line \u0022name = stackSeparatorBig\u0022. It should be the third line. Edit the name to whatever you want (although it must be unique - no other part may have the same name. Also I think it can\u0027t contain spaces).\n\nNow, find the \u0022moduleDecouple\u0022 module. Remove the \u0022isOmniDecoupler = true\u0022 line and in its place add \u0022explosiveNodeID = top\u0022\n\nIf you want, edit the part title, manufacturers, description and whatever else you want to edit, then save it and you\u0027re done.\n\nIf you ever want to revert to completely stock, all you need to do is to delete that cfg.\n\nThere probably is a way to do it with nothing but MM, but I think it\u0027s much easier to do it this way.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T13:19:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 01:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xrayfishx**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cuky","CreatedById":111755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T14:07:03Z","Content":"thanks.
