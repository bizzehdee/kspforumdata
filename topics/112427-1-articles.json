This mission involved a series of experiments that would be reset and repeated, so I loaded the spacecraft with a fair set of batteries and two SP 3x2 shielded solar panels to keep the whole thing charged. Up until this mission I have used either the OX-STAT solar panels or the OX 1x6 nonshielded solar panels with no issues. \n\nI put the spacecraft into orbit, set up my Mun transfer burn, and after completing the burn, deployed the SP 3x2 panels. (Around this time, I had to do a quickload as I found my Mun transfer stage was not going to impact Kerbin as the mission called for). Time warp to the Mun\u0027s SOI and jettison the Mun transfer stage (it swung past the Mun and burned up in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere as planned). I set up my orbital insertion burn, executed the burn without incident, everything working as intended. \n\nThen I opened the service bay to get at my science instruments and rolled the spacecraft 90 degrees - and watched the panels break off and fly away, leaving my craft with battery power only. \n\nAt first I thought the craft\u0027s insertion burn must have weakened them, so I quickloaded to just after the Mun transfer burn and repeated everything, this time making sure to retract the panels back into their shields before executing the orbital insertion burn. The panels folded up, and the burn went off without trouble, but after that the panels registered as \u0022broken\u0022. Bwuh?\n\nI was able to complete the mission and retrieve my Kerbal by truncating the science end of things and juggling power between the capsule and the service module batteries, but this has made me wary of using the folding solar panels again. I don\u0027t understand what went wrong. Both SP and OX panels show the same panel strength, and the OX-series are working just fine on my probes. However, any probe with OX-series panels make the ascent safe inside payload fairings, and although they go through the same maneuvers I put my ill-fated spacecraft through, they use smaller engines (either the 48-7s or the LV-1, as opposed to the LV-909 on my Mun mission). \n\nPossible theories:\n\n1) The casings on the SP series solar panels are not working as they should, and the panels are being exposed to drag forces on ascent.\n\n2) The greater thrust from the LV-909 engine is breaking the panels.\n\n3) Quickload is breaking the panels. Not sure how or why.\n\n4) The roll broke the panels. Again, not sure how or why.\n\n5) I am running one mod - DMagic Orbital Sciences. Somehow it is interacting with my 1.0.2 save to break the panels.\n\nI\u0027m at a loss on this one. Thoughts?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T22:36:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AndrewBCrisp**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T03:07:27Z","Content":"Are the service bay doors crushing the panels?"},{"CreatedByName":"AndrewBCrisp","CreatedById":57119,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T03:14:39Z","Content":"I don\u0027t believe so.

It may even be crushing them indirectly though some other parts that are clipped into the bay or near the doors. I don\u0027t use DMagic so I can\u0027t help there, but the other 4 reasons seem much less likely. Quickload or switching to a craft can sometimes summon the Kraken, but its usually been primed by the claw, the service bay, or tons of close together or clipped light weight parts (or ...)."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T04:50:21Z","Content":"Can\u0027t say what your problem is, but have a few observations on what it isn\u0027t.\n\nIt\u0027s not the panels getting \u0022weakened\u0022 by anything; I don\u0027t think KSP tracks degradation of physical strength. Any physical trauma they encounter either destroys them immediately, or leaves them unaffected.\n\nIt\u0027s not a problem of having passed through atmosphere during launch. I put unshielded OX-series panels on my craft all the time (not even inside fairings), and never have a problem.\n\nIt\u0027s not a problem with the engine being too strong. G-shock doesn\u0027t hurt deployed panels, as long as they don\u0027t collide with anything. I\u0027ve made crash landings that destroyed the bottom part of the craft but left the deployed panels intact (at least until the craft flipped and they hit the ground). I\u0027ve played around with the Karbonite\u002B mod, which has some engines that let me pull over 20 G\u0027s... no problem for panels.\n\nIf I had to guess, it would be what the other folks here have suggested, some sort of clipping issue."},{"CreatedByName":"Two","CreatedById":144535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T07:55:43Z","Content":"If it involves a service bay, it is usually a clipping issue.

If any part of the spacecraft is anywhere near the doors when they open, kaboom. Goes double for parts that also move. If a part is attached to the outside of a service bay, or really anywhere near the bay, the game may treat it as being \\*inside\\*, rendering it unusable at best, kaboom at worst. And objects attached inside the bay but in the wrong place may rattle continuously, causing control difficulties at best, kaboom at worst.\n\n![ytrLDr4l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ytrLDr4l.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T10:26:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 10:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Agate**"},{"CreatedByName":"AndrewBCrisp","CreatedById":57119,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T22:20:19Z","Content":"Thanks for the responses, everyone. The consensus appears to be the open service bay clipped with the panels. \n\nI conducted some experiments this afternoon to check this. First up was bringing the Mun 4 spacecraft (sans launch vehicle) onto the launch pad and opening first the solar panels and then the service bay. Nothing broke, but then, the spacecraft was neither in motion nor were the panels actively tracking the sun. \n\nNext up was putting the spacecraft in orbit and rerunning the tests there. I renamed the spacecraft Orbiter 13 and put it into a low equatorial orbit. Once there, I opened up the solar panels and performed slow, careful, maneuvers along the roll, pitch, and yaw axes. The panels remained intact and tracked the sun. I performed each maneuver after the panels had locked onto the sun and finished moving.\n\nI then opened up the service bay, and repeated my maneuvers, again keeping things careful and no movements until the panels had finished lining up with the sun once more. Once again, no problems, the panels survived the experience. \n\nOne last test was to put the spacecraft into a 90 degree roll *while the panels were still tracking the sun from a previous maneuver.* That did it - both panels shattered. \n\nSo, taking all this into account with what everyone said about clipping, I would venture to conclude that a nearby open service bay, plus actively tracking panels, plus a maneuver, combined to break the panels during my Mun 4 mission. I suspect opening the bay while the panels are actively tracking might also have the same result. Going forward I will have to be more careful with panel placement - shifting the panels further back might do the trick. Failing that, limiting my maneuvers seems to be the safest course. \n\nThanks again for your advice, everyone. This has been a real learning experience."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T23:57:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In addition to the aforementioned clipping, the OX 3-2 has a much wider profile than the 1-6.
