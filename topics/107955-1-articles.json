The memory usage of a stock game \u002B 1 mod is dependent of the graphics settings (texture quality, resolution, ...) and hardware. If you run on OpenGL the memory KSP use is lower with GPU that have more memory (hint : play KSP on a Titan X). And where do you check the memory ? Menu, space center, in flight (and where ?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo getting useful numbers would require fixed settings, hardware and testing procedure.
