The memory usage of a stock game \u002B 1 mod is dependent of the graphics settings (texture quality, resolution, ...) and hardware. If you run on OpenGL the memory KSP use is lower with GPU that have more memory (hint : play KSP on a Titan X). And where do you check the memory ? Menu, space center, in flight (and where ?).\n\nSo getting useful numbers would require fixed settings, hardware and testing procedure. Someone would have to do it for everyone. Any volunteer ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mighty1","CreatedById":95750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T05:25:04Z","Content":"@sarbian - I think the more reasonable option would be that the author posts the RAM footprint on the default settings of the game. I would be like a guideline, not a rule at the amount of RAM it takes. For the rest of the data like when using OpenGL, ATM, or an uber graphics card there would be a separate entry. \n\nI have a spreadsheet in mind. Maybe I will try to make one but it may take some time.
