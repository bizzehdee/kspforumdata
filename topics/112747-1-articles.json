You may ask, how is it possibly? And I have simple answer: ISRU converter and ore drills on board that marvel of engineering. This craft can ascent from sweet Kerbin to dark and harsh space with no left behind and reach any body in Kerbol system, then land on it for researching and refueling (except Tylo and Eve only). And later repeat it so many times as you wish. Ship has on board perfectly equipped mobile lab with full set of science instruments and comfortable crew apartments for 6 brave kerbals (2 pilots, 2 engineers and, of course, 2 scientists).\n\n**Brief tech stats:**\n\nFully fueled mass (on launchpad) - **142t** (**140** parts)\n\nmaximum dV after refueling - ~**5400** m/s (with 440 units of oxidizer on board and ore conversion to fuel in flight)\n\n**Horizontal** landing on atmospheric planets and **vertical** landing on atmospheric less bodies. **Horizontal** takeoff.\n\nEngines: **4 turbojets, 4 RAPIERs and 4 LV-N \u0022Nerva\u0022**\n\nFull set of science equipment\n\nFull set of ISRU equipment\n\n![WBzXF5Wh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WBzXF5Wh.jpg)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

But I like out sleek it turned out, and how I managed to tuck all the sensor stuff inside the bay. The sat may seem a bit of a tight fit, but thankfully that big dish appears to have a very small collision mesh, docking it back is really easy. \n\nBTW, @Mesklin, I imagine the longest leg of the trip was the Gilly-Moho leg... how much dV did that take you?

And in rocketry, fuel fraction is king (as long as you have enough oomph to lift up, of course). You will *never* match the efficiency on low TWR designs with high TWR designs, no matter how many engines you slap on.\n\u003E Rune. Because physics and math.\n\nIdk my high twr craft seem to out perform my low twr craft constantly, Cronus is a good example of that, i was unable to get 80 tons into orbit without a TWR of 1.8:1, Maybe its just the way i build things... im terrible at being conservative. \n\n![ksPICP9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ksPICP9.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"trash0551","CreatedById":88568,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T12:52:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Idk my high twr craft seem to out perform my low twr craft constantly, Cronus is a good example of that, i was unable to get 80 tons into orbit without a TWR of 1.8:1, Maybe its just the way i build things... im terrible at being conservative. \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/ksPICP9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ksPICP9.jpg)\n\nI might be wrong here but I think the idea with spaceplanes is you don\u0027t need a TWR over 1 necessarily.

The Mach barrier puts a lower bound on that (grrr), but with about 0.9-1.0 on the runway, you can break it at ~10kms going a bit shallower than usual, as long as your plane is not too draggy. And then all the weight you save in engines can be fuel to increase you vacuum dV and payload. \n\nRune. TWR does marginally increase the atmospheric cutoff speed, but then again, it\u0027s not really worth it."}]}
