You may ask, how is it possibly? And I have simple answer: ISRU converter and ore drills on board that marvel of engineering. This craft can ascent from sweet Kerbin to dark and harsh space with no left behind and reach any body in Kerbol system, then land on it for researching and refueling (except Tylo and Eve only). And later repeat it so many times as you wish.
