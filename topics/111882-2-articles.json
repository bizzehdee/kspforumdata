Before the test, experimental designer Dr. Brownlee had estimated that the nuclear explosion, combined with the specific design of the shaft, would accelerate the plate to approximately six times escape velocity. The plate was never found, but Dr. Brownlee believes that the plate never left the atmosphere, as it may even have been vaporized by compression heating of the atmosphere due to its high speed. The calculated velocity was sufficiently interesting that the crew trained a high-speed camera on the plate, which unfortunately only appeared in one frame, but this nevertheless gave a very high lower bound for the speed. After the event, Dr. Robert R. Brownlee described the best estimate of the cover\u0027s speed from the photographic evidence as \u0022going like a bat out of hell!\u0022 The use of a subterranean shaft and nuclear device to propel an object to escape velocity has since been termed a \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022thunder well\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003Cp\u003EThis incident was reputedly used as part of the technical justification for the Orion project for possible use of nuclear blasts for outer-space propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Plumbbob\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Plumbbob\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel of Life","CreatedById":45646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T16:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E*snip*\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, that\u0027s exactly what I was thinking of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T16:49:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kibble\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kibble\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOnce I conjectured an invasion by intelligent extraterrestrial aliens who were like those extreme deep sea fish with huge gaping mouths that hang motionless waiting for prey - not a good body plan for \u003Cem\u003Emaking \u003C/em\u003Eanything!
