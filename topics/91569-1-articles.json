This favors a low Munar periapsis, so you can do your braking burn at a higher Munar orbit velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*The Oberth effect comes out of the fact that kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity. Thus, braking from 100 to 0 m/s eliminates 5,000 J/kg of kinetic energy (KE = 1/2 m*v^2), while braking from 1100 m/s to 1000 m/s eliminates 105,000 J/kg of kinetic energy. Same expenditure of delta-V, but the second changed your kinetic energy much more. This also works in the reverse direction, and explains why Kerbin escapes are more efficient with low periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2: you want to spend the absolute minimum amount of dV necessary to get into the Mun\u0027s SOI. At periapsis, your orbital velocity will be, at absolute minimum, escape velocity (as your trajectory in is, at best, Munar escape in reverse). The less velocity you have remaining at Munar capture, the less you will have to cancel when you hit periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe conclusion from this is that you want a transfer which just barely puts you in the Mun\u0027s SOI long enough for its gravity to pull you in, and gives you a projected periapsis as close to the surface as you dare. The only exception I can think of is if you are planning a Munar flyby only: for that, you want to do a free-return trajectory, which is a different story.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T17:16:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you can do is set a second node at the lunar periapsis, and have it burn retrograde until you have an orbit. Then you add up the deltaV from both maneuvers. My gut says that whichever has the lowest periapsis will win, because of the Oberth effect -- you want to do your orbit injection burn as low as possible on Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re implicitly saying that you\u0027re doing a Hohmann transfer and are expecting to do exactly two burns to set up an orbit. This is not the cheapest overall option for getting to the Mun, but it\u0027s close enough that most of us don\u0027t care to optimize much more than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is cheapest without gravity assist is a bi-elliptic transfer. That makes you start at Kerbin 70km, fly all the way out past Mun and Minmus to the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SoI, then raise periapsis there. You burn more overall to get to that point, but the savings come when you enter Mun\u0027s SoI: instead of entering at 366 m/s with a Hohmann, you enter with 175 m/s. Overall you save about 40 m/s by doing the bi-elliptic. But it\u0027s more complicated, and it\u0027s just 40 m/s, so most people don\u0027t bother (I don\u0027t). When you\u0027re really big into optimizing, you can use multiple gravity assists off Mun to raise your Kerbin periapsis and get close to matching Mun\u0027s orbit. The closer you are to Mun\u0027s orbit, the less excess speed you have to burn off in order to establish an orbit. IIRC you can save a total of about 80 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T17:32:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope you have used \u0027\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHohmann Transfers\u003C/a\u003E\u0027 to raise and lower your orbit around Kerbin (or anywhere else) already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen consider raising your orbit to the same as Mun\u0027s (without worrying about an encounter): your \u0027transfer\u0027 burn should raise the apoapsis to the required altitude, then you drift there and \u0027circularise\u0027. Note that you are not \u0027escaping\u0027 Kerbin\u0027s orbit, you and Mun are simply orbiting it at the same altitude. You might like to try this to see how much deltaV the circularisation burn requires without Mun\u0027s gravity to influence it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntroducing the requirement for an encounter and orbit, you obviously need to do the transfer burn at the right point around your (comparatively low) Kerbin orbit. When you orbit around Mun it, and therefore you, are still orbiting Kerbin. You will, in fact, be orbiting Kerbin with the exact same position and altitude as Mun \u003Cem\u003Eon average\u003C/em\u003E (your Mun-orbit representing only insignificant wobbles relative to Kerbin-orbit). After the transfer burn and transfer drift to apoapsis, however, before you do the \u0027injection\u0027 burn, you are orbiting slower than Mun (even if your Ap is higher), which is why you fall back to Kerbin. The injection burn therefore \u0027circularises\u0027 your Kerbin-orbit and, if Mun were a massless-point you\u0027d therefore just want to time and scale the transfer burn to get you as close to it as possible. In practice, of course, Mun represents a bloody great rock \u003Cem\u003Ewith gravity\u003C/em\u003E and the more obvious purpose of the injection burn is to establish an orbit around it - so miss, but only just.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat all this means is that the \u0027ideal\u0027 transfer burn would put you on a direct collision-course with Mun except that actually hitting it would be what aerospace professionals call \u0022a bad thing\u0022. Missing by a little bit - smallest divergence from Mun\u0027s own orbit - gives you the lowest periapsis and hence the greatest benefit from Mun\u0027s gravity. It also means you take the greatest advantage of the Oberth effect, but as you\u0027ve seen that\u0027s a bit arcane. Missing by more just means you get less help from those \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E you have a greater difference between your orbital velocity and Mun\u0027s to make up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(A prograde orbit around Mun is generally best so you probably want to miss behind it, rather than in front.
