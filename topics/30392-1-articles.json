For ease of reference, we\u0027ll name them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbinia was waging valiant war against its closest neighbor, Bul. Apparently the aggressor, but a very capable one, Kerbinia was making great land grabs as the satellite passed. Life being life, and the tech level of the locals seemingly being insufficient to detect its presence, a probe was deployed. This probe would be the window into a sordid history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the seventh year, the probe arrived, to find Kerbinia at war with Ze, Na, and Rygg. These other neighbors were reclaiming the lands of Bul whom they were also still at war with. A great statue had been erected in Kerbinia that was easily visible from space. The Kerbol people were clearly both great and quick craftsmen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the year 8, Vid entered the battle to create peace, and despite Kerbinia crushing them soundly in the one battle they participated in, their diplomats managed to instill peace between the kingdoms, just before Vid fell into disarray and was absolved into the other kingdoms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy year 11, Kerbol science had become the new craze. Scientists were hard at work mapping the planet above and below to the best of their rudimentary ability, and seemed to be asking for the first time, \u0027How does this whole existing thing work?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFast-forward to the year 22, and you\u0027d see the Kerbol nations being shaken up by a great quake, implying a degree of tectonics not previously observed on their planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch loss of life required many technological breakthroughs to understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy 25 the kerbols developed the ability to look to the stars \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 at least rudimentarily.

Four thousand kerbals are burned to death in celebration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 82, the combustion engine is created. It is immediately laughed out, and Kerbals everywhere are once more reminded that science for any purpose but destruction is a waste of energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 84, another warp flash incites all out war. Every kerbal on the planet is now a soldier or support for the war effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn both 93 and 94 huge strides are made in the fields of modern aviation.

It begins to decay from neglect. The planet, on the other hand, flourishes naturally. The Kerbinians made up the lion\u0027s share of those who sought shelter underground, and as such, the otherwise frightened masses below ground were driven to return to the surface... When they did, they found that their guardian angel, Jebediah, had only gotten closer as time went on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrawing from this that their deitic entity would only come to them when they alone stood vigilante over Kerbol\u0027s landscape, they eradicated the last of their kin... This order was given by the first Kerbol president: Bob Kermin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is then that the cult of Kermin decided to wait for their god, while rebuilding civilization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the year 250, Jebediah\u0027s orbit finally decayed. Its landing created a tsunami which washed away the Kerbal\u0027s burgeoning society, but gave them something greater. Now so deeply buried in myth and legend, Jebediah, Bill, and Bob were popular names for the ridiculously short-lived Kerbol race. For this reason, the three leaders who stepped forward to meet their god for the first time were thus named.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen they arrived, after a year\u0027s trek (A tenth of their lifetimes, don\u0027t you know?), their disappointment was palpable. The enormous construct before them held no god. Just a constant beep...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Terran, however, took great notice... The probe kept transmitting on the four year long trek back to the civilization project, and for another year still as the Kerbals reverse-engineered each instrument in turn. The Terrans watched these tiny green men devour this technology a piece at a time. Their curiosity spurred a kindred bond with the researchers that made it easy to forget that the probe had just violated this planet\u0027s GP3, and thus, the planet would have to be culled...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo much so, that a crazy plan was hatched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027d give these kerbals more technology.

I kind of shot myself in the foot trying to make Kerbol be the system/planet from a Terran perspective, Kerbal mean the little greenbros, and still keep the kingdom in order... So, that\u0027s confusing and doesn\u0027t conform to any unified standard. Bear with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHello boys and girls. I was thinking about doing a custom campaign mode in KSP. The basic premise being that I\u0027ll be running pretty open-book about what mods are in use, and I\u0027d be writing a story alongside.

I\u0027ll present goals set forth by the groups on the planet, as well as outline Terran involvement. For the most-part, direct Terran intervention will be extremely limited. It will explain new mods, or updates changing things, when something else can\u0027t explain it better. It may also be used as a way to explain when I draw influence from another person\u0027s ships... I can just crash one of their ship make into mun or something and go from there... This is just kind of a \u0027I have no capable of sleep, but I must rest\u0027 interest nudge. I\u0027m going to do it anyway to keep myself amused, it\u0027s just a question of whether people think it\u0027s worth broadcasting to the public.
