Going to the grocery store will not help. You accidentally (or purposefully) hit a trim button and need to cancel your trim. The default key combination for this is Alt-X. Some functions of MechJeb can also interfere with this because they exert force on your vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your feedback.
