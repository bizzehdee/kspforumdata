Dogs and cats make great companion pets on Earth, but their muscles would be way overpowered in free fall. My 15-kilo Border Collie would become a deadly missile, innocently killing astronauts and destroying equipment. Free fall-adapted cats would obviously use their claws to decelerate, leaving bleeding parallel lines across everyone they encounter. How about a pet rat, like in The Abyss? Or a gecko? Geckos with adhesive feet sound like they\u0027d do great in free fall. Set up a basking lamp in a safe corner, and the gecko can wander all over without having the mass or strength to affect knobs, switches and such.
