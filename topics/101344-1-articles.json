If animals end up dying constantly, those that are more resilient will end up populating the gene pool.

Those are the ones who\u0027ll survive to reproduce in free fall, so will determine the types of pets available. And they\u0027ll evolve like domestic animals always do; selective breeding under human control.\n\nBirds and smaller primates might be the ones I\u0027d try first. But that\u0027s just a guess. We won\u0027t know until we try them. Much depends on whether you want a \u0022companion pet\u0022 or \u0022working pet\u0022. Dogs and cats make great companion pets on Earth, but their muscles would be way overpowered in free fall. My 15-kilo Border Collie would become a deadly missile, innocently killing astronauts and destroying equipment. Free fall-adapted cats would obviously use their claws to decelerate, leaving bleeding parallel lines across everyone they encounter. How about a pet rat, like in The Abyss? Or a gecko? Geckos with adhesive feet sound like they\u0027d do great in free fall. Set up a basking lamp in a safe corner, and the gecko can wander all over without having the mass or strength to affect knobs, switches and such. OTOH space stations are filled with nice warm electrical equipment, so maybe he wouldn\u0027t return to his basking lamp after all.\n\nAs for working pets, several types of service animal duties might be adaptable to, and useful in, free fall. Flying helper monkeys in that environment scare me, though. Can one be so reliably trained that you can trust her not to open both airlock doors while you\u0027re on the toilet?

Killing everyone in Sector B is another."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T03:44:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, if the animals are allowed to mate freely.

We can fiddle with them all we want, that is not going to happen. Them being sick would cause some impairment too, though that would leave some artificial options. Plus, of course, that animals that are not well will probably be less fertile.\n\nAlso, people would tend to select animals based on how well they cope with microgravity.
