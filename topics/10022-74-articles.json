It wouldn\u0027t make sense if they couldn\u0027t, because our universe-bodies are each 90 billion light years across at their narrowest. \n\nMeanwhile, we allow the space marines to take us to their hills, whereupon we anchor ourselves to the ground and turn our gravitational constants deeply negative for a moment, blasting the space marines away. My sister and I do a reference frame-pinch, bringing our two hills directly adjacent to each other to the north and south despite being miles away.

In an unorthodox move, I instantly force every last drop of my universe\u0027s zero-point vacuum energy through the wormholes leading to the megaverse. The massive increase in vacuum energy density causes the megaverse to destabilize and collapse instantly into nothing, taking everything related to Bionicles, space marines, Toa, hype-constructs, and ponies with it.\n\nThe GreeningUniverse, now devoid of all vacuum energy, ceases to exist. The stars visible through my semitransparent skin wink out, and my body suddenly goes back to being a normal, biological body composed of tissues instead of galactic superstructures. \n\nIn an unlikely event, a spiral galaxy somehow survives the death of the GreeningUniverse and becomes locked in a tiny, down-scaled bubble of space inside my ribcage. A small fraction of the energy output of the stars within it is fed directly into my bloodstream, giving me access to a smaller-but-still-considerable array of spatial manipulation powers.\n\nGreeningUniverse becomes GreeningGalaxy!\n\nFortunately, I managed to expel myself from Jool\u0027s atmosphere before I did that. I may be floating unprotected in open space now, but I\u0027ve always been able to do that without much trouble. Fiery reentry over a gas giant planet is an entirely different matter.\n\nAs a physical being, I once again have to actually interact with the universe around me at all times rather than simply ghosting through it whenever I pleased the way I did when I was a universe. I create a bubble of polarized space surrounding myself, altering my velocity from a Jool escape trajectory to an encounter with Laythe. I try to reify myself a glass of water, but a large sphere of ice materializes above the palm of my hand instead. Quantum vacuum manipulation is harder than it used to be, I guess. I try to melt the ice by directing a diffuse beam of high-power infrared into it, but I end up vaporizing it instead. Guess I\u0027ll have to wait until splashdown at Laythe for a drink.\n\nMy projected landing site on Laythe.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-02T18:32:46Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2014 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GreeningGalaxy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T19:27:04Z","Content":"I used a targeted advertising (laser?) beam on GreeningGalaxy and scam her out of her free will.\n\nMy landing site."},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T19:50:50Z","Content":"I build a base on Putto, the first-discovered dwarf planet of the Kerbol system.
