Kerbals may be aliens, but humans are still humans, and WE are the ones playing the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudy after study shows that implicit biases strongly impact people\u0027s behavior. Explicit biases are ones you know you have, implicit biases are ones that you have, but that you don\u0027t think you have (or actually think you have the opposite). These implicit biases are affected, with no conscious control, by images that you see around you, and these changed biases measurably change your behavior. You don\u0027t realize that it is happening, which is why they are so insidious. Spend some time playing with the tools at Project Implicit, a Harvard research project that has been running for many years exploring this phenomenon: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is that by showing only male characters, you aren\u0027t making people think \u0022Oh, only boys can do space\u0022, because that is an explicit bias. You ARE changing their implicit biases, which impacts their future behavior. By adding different kinds of characters you aren\u0027t being \u0022PC\u0022 (which means being nice just to make people feel better, but without actually doing anything useful), you are making sure that everyone who plays the game gets the same feeling of personal satisfaction.

As far as I can tell, the best guesses are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Kerbals are not native to Kerbin or anywhere else in the Kerbol system because they have to wear spacesuits when they go outside on all planets and moons, including Kerbin. Therefore, we have no idea at all about their native habitat, so can make no assumptions regarding their metabolisms and life support needs, and gender is part of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Kerbals obviously have very little life support needs, because they\u0027ve routinely been in space for decades of game time in 1-man pods and yet come out just fine. This raises the possibility that they go dormant/hibernate/whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Kerbals have no noses and (when not screaming) generally keep their mouths shut all the time. So either they don\u0027t breathe at all (and thus their spacesuits are merely to maintain the desired pressure using any available gas) or they breathe through their skin or some other organ we\u0027re not aware of. In any case, it\u0027s certain they don\u0027t breath oxygen because they have to wear spacesuits on Kerbin and Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Kerbals survive falls, G forces, and exposure to rocket exhaust and explosions that would annihilate all known human-like lifeforms. This definitely suggests that Kerbals are made of entirely different materials than humans and so require entirely different inputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When Kerbals do somehow die, they appear to release a cloud of spores like when you stomp on a puffball. This definitely lends support to them being some type of fungi. Given that there has never been an official sighting of anything resembling gender amongst Kerbals, this could indeed be how they reproduce. And note that Kerbals all have the same last name, which could be their own recognition that they\u0027re all scions from the spores of the 1st Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I think it\u0027s simply our own humanocentric conceit that causes us to use gender-specific pronouns for Kerbals. We really should call them \u0022it\u0022 instead of \u0022he\u0022. That would solve the problem some people have with seeing a need for genders.
