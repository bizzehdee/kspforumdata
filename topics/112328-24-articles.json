When you switch back to a previously unloaded vessel DeepFreeze WILL attempt to consume all of the EC that would have been used during the period of time it was unloaded. If it can\u0027t get that EC it will immediately consume 95% of the EC on-board and then start the warning countdown.  \n\nThis is why:\n\n1) There is a display in the DeepFreeze GUI that shows you this information for unloaded vessels with frozen kerbals on-board.  \n\n2) DeepFreeze should give you warning pop-up windows when calculated EC is low or critical to switch to the vessel.  \n\n3) This is why I integrated DeepFreeze with the BackgroundProcessing Mod so that it actually consumes EC when vessel are unloaded and you don\u0027t get the above behaviour. But at this time, the BackgroundProcessing Mod has not been updated for KSP 1.2\u002B so I cannot recommend you to use it.  \n\nCan you confirm that the above is in fact what happened in your game.

Under the old behavior, as long as you had generating capacity you didn\u0027t really need much in the way of EC storage capacity - it\u0027d get gobbled up as it was generated.  Currently, generating capacity is mostly irrelevant - all you need is storage capacity.\n\nI was bringing it up in the context of REKT, because they are still trying to tweak a cryofreeze escape pod, and the current design works under 1.1.3, but not under 1.2.x - and it would really unbalance the pod to include 2000\u002B EC: It\u0027s not supposed to be able to \\*unfreeze\\* a Kerbal on it\u0027s own, and the rest of the pods only have ~50 EC.  What was being looked at was some various one-time storage options or one-time generator options.  So if the old behavior could be restored, it can have the pattern of \u0027one-time high-flow generator, minimal storage and a trickle maintenance generator\u0027.  So consider this a request for that.  (I can put the request someplace else if you\u0027d like.)"}]}
