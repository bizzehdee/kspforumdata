As requirements and technology change I produce variants on the craft which may be boosted.

I\u0027ve found this to be the easiest layout to design (just copypasta the core \u2014 that\u0027s alt\u002Bclick if you didn\u0027t know!) and fly (good rear-end body lift ratio to counteract the added rear-end mass). If I did a 4xCCB rocket I would actually put the boosters on the outside of the original 2, rather than using 4-way symmetry, giving it a \u0027middle finger\u0027 appearance. This is to avoid separation issues with the \u0027top\u0027 booster as the rocket turns over, and maintain the lifitng body effect for stability. Over the past year, my design philosophy has been increasingly based on \u003Cstrong\u003Erows\u003C/strong\u003E of engines rather than \u003Cstrong\u003Erings\u003C/strong\u003E, as I really find that \u0027aircraft mimicry\u0027 has a positive effect on reliability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also like to use solid rocket \u0027boosters\u0027 as cores instead, like the Ares I and Saturn INT-05.
