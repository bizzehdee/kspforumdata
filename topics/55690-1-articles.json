Whenever a new update would come out, I usually would transfer my save and delete the core game in exchange for the updated version. This means I don\u0027t have any of the old updates. I remember those being really fun with Moho having an atmosphere. I know the website has the previous download before the current one. Do you think it would be possible for all the old updates to be put up on the download page? Before the forum crash I saw a thread with all the really old builds like .8-.13.3 but I can\u0027t seem to find it, anyways I was just wondering if this was possible.

Another cool thing would be wiki entries with attributes and change lists for each update, so that people wanting to experience them again could adjust their game with an addon or by altering the game files - for instance putting an atmosphere on Moho to simulate the old atmosphere it used to have, but allowing modern ships to fly in it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T03:23:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI belive you can already download all versions using the launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T03:24:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022andrew32198\u0022 data-cite=\u0022andrew32198\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[...]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Before the forum crash I saw a thread with all the really old builds like .8-.13.3 but I can\u0027t seem to find it, anyways I was just wondering if this was possible.
