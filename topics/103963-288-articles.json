This probe part above from BDB causes this issue with scatterer. But if I were to remove that and load up another probe part or any other part from the mod, nothing\u0027s wrong. Everything loads as normal. I\u0027m not entirely sure which parts from BDB might be doing this (and I don\u0027t think its really necessary to go through each one), but there\u0027s no consistency to it at all. Probes Plus (coatl aerospace) parts almost all do this, but some don\u0027t. The KEAM from Kerbalow aerospace does it, but the KA330 doesn\u0027t. Etc.  \n\nI keep going through the logs and removing stuff but no matter what I cannot figure out what is doing this. Right now I\u0027ve got my install to literally just BDB and its dependencies and scatterer, and this is still happening for certain parts.  I\u0027ve got the ksp.log and output log below.  KSP log should list the load of the part above (labeled test) and then another of the LEO command pod (untitled). Scatterer breaks with test, is just fine with untitled.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/i3r9q0yojfaymz5/KSP.log?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i3r9q0yojfaymz5/KSP.log?dl=0)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/urlvyjq13veahef/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/urlvyjq13veahef/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\nI can also confirm that this is **NOT being caused by B9 Part switch as that has been removed from this install.**  For the life of me I can\u0027t figure out what could possibly be causing this. As I said above theres no consistency to the parts that trigger this, and its not just BDB or Coatl.   \n\nLooking at the logs it almost seems like scatterer is trying to call on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E for something even though eve isn\u0027t present, but that doesn\u0027t explain why its only when certain parts are loaded into a flight that this happens.\n\nEDIT:\n\nHas to be something to do with the parts themselves. The only BDB parts I could find that did this were the probes that had solar panels on the part itself. Which leads me to believe whatever is responsible for those is whats breaking scatterer. \n\nSECOND EDIT:\n\nThanks to [@DjPreside](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/181294-djpreside/), I\u0027ve been clued in to the fact that if the root part of the vessel is a part thats causing this bug, it will cause the bug. But if you re-root the vessel to a part that doesn\u0027t, then all is fine.
