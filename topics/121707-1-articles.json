I was trying to build a really early stage SSTO that would land on it\u0027s broad side (cause I don\u0027t have legs) and found it incredibly difficult to balance the parachutes. We need a mod that would show an Arrow off the CoM (or DCoM) pointing to where \u0022down\u0022 would be when parachutes are fully deployed. So in my case, a tall cylindrical rocket with 4 radial parachutes. If the line were perpendicular to the rocket, that means I would have it correct and the craft should land evenly on it\u0027s side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively you could show rotational direction based on the chutes as well and when the rotation disappeared (similar to RCS Build Aid) it would be even.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would help bringing odd sized/massed craft back to Kerbin while landing in one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T04:37:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Erotational direction\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETorque. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an excellent idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T04:42:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FleshJeb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FleshJeb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETorque. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an excellent idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E My words aren\u0027t working tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T04:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf only I knew how to mod...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T04:59:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree this would be really cool.
