These two axes can be swapped, and it makes a world of difference (even if it is not the NASA way). And if you are perfectly OK with flight style controls, and don\u0027t want to mess with the axes, the rest of the post can pretty much be skipped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure to create a profile for the ksp.exe (easiest while the game is running [Alt-Tab out, obviously]) and then set the X axis to Spin and the twist axis to Roll.

The settings seem to stick a bit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, set both Spin and Roll to Reverse and you should be set. Make sure to test it out on a capsule in a prograde facing with blue up and brown down on the navball. I was testing on a landercan in retrograde orientation and got extremely confused for a bit. So don\u0027t do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I found it helpful to set one button to Rotations On/Off and the other to Dominant On/Off.

Just a matter of getting accustomed to the device and tweaking the speed and threshold settings.
