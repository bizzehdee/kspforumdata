I think I have at least a partially working rover now, I just need to get it to the Mun. So I built a lifter....with lots of RCS tanks so I don\\\u0027t run out....but then I needed stuff to lift those tanks, and this was the final result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ttR4z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ttR4z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose 8 huge boosters get off the ground, then the Omnipotent Bertha and 8 more large boosters take over. After the 8 boosters are ejected, four gimballing liquids kick in until Bertha is out of fuel. 4 more gimballing liquids fire once Bertha is dropped, hopefully it is nearly in orbit by then, but I don\\\u0027t really have a flight plan yet, I haven\\\u0027t been able to get very far yet because I keep trying to drop boosters at the wrong time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-02T00:17:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt may not be efficient, but it definatley is kerbal!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"closette","CreatedById":11773,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-02T00:20:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose parts don\\\u0027t look stock.
