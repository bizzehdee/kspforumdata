Each pod consists of a Materials Lab, a Mystery Goo Container, a probe core and two radial parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only problem is that, After detachment and get 2km away from the host craft, the pods have a tendency to disappear from existence all together. After I\u0027ve landed the craft, the tracking centre does not show them, neither as debris or probes. Doubling back over the drop point returns nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tested them by setting the probe core as the control point and watch it float its way down to the surface, leaving the plane to crash. The pod makes its way down without error, and with the addition of some batteries it has well enough charge to stay active past the duration of the host plane flight. I\u0027ve tested this at altitudes of 20 000m and 5 000m and both are fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why are my probes vanishing into thin air? Does the game hate them because they\u0027re in atmospheric flight? Is it a bug? Is it the Kraken? I dunno.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your replies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T05:12:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Kerbin, any objects below ~20km that are further than 2.5km from the actively controlled craft will be deleted. Simulating physics on objects further than 2.5km from the focus centre is simply too inaccurate and crippling for most people\u0027s machines, so KSP puts all objects further away \u0022on rails\u0022 and simulates them in a much simpler manner. KSP basically assumes \u0022on rails\u0022 objects burn up on reentry or simply crashed into the ground when their altitude on kerbin is lower than around 20km or so (I forget the exact altitude, sorry).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cerberus738","CreatedById":100744,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T05:20:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you have to circle around until the probe is safely on the ground?

Do a low speed circle to ensure it is down, then fly away.
