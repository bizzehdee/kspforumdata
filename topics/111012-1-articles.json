It\u0027s also not balanced very well for KSP in particular.\n\nOn the other hand, I seriously couldn\u0027t build a rig that I would consider *good* within \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3300. If your budget isn\u0027t flexible, then that may well be the best you\u0027ll get. It will of course *play* KSP, but you may find that your maximum part count before lag is somewhat lower than you\u0027d like.\n\nIf you *can* find some more monetary headroom, then consider that for KSP, the primary bottleneck tends to be single-threaded CPU performance; AMD\u0027s per-core performance is poor, and there\u0027s no point in having four of them since only one will do any work. On a tight budget, I\u0027d seriously be considering an Intel Pentium Anniversary Edition and overclock the nuts off it. I suspect a reasonable rig aimed at KSP could be built around that for maybe \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3400-450.\n\n\\*Disclaimer: my pretty-beefy PC also can\u0027t run KSP smoothly in many situations. Spaceplanes over 150 parts at high speed in atmosphere are laggy. Large stations are laggy. Large anything is laggy.

With the transition to Unity 5, things may change a bit, but right now it is single threaded performance that means a bit more for KSP and AMD\u0027s single thread performance is abysmal in comparison to Intel. On multithreaded, well, things may be somewhat closer there. I can\u0027t really speak to whether KSP leverages a lot of integer or floating point calculations, but generally in most gaming comparisons, Intel has quite a lead when you include any discrete graphics card in to the mix.\n\nHonestly, KSP is pretty graphics light. I have a $100 Nvidia GTX750 and it runs KSP smoothly at 1080p and all of the nits turned up. Where I can get stumbling is truely massive ships. My i5-3570 running at 4GHz however can lift most of what is KSP pretty easily however. I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve run a spaceplane with 150 parts in any circumstance, but multi hundred part rockets and space stations don\u0027t really cause issues for it.\n\nFrankly if on a budget, I\u0027d look for something like an Intel i3-4330 processor with 8GB of RAM and something like an Nvidia GTX750 or 750ti to drive it (frankly AMD\u0027s current GPUs are also energy thristy without great performance and prices aren\u0027t super attractive either). Assembling it yourself you could probably put it all together for $550-650 depending on exact choices in case, SSD/HDD, power supply, etc.\n\nAt a price point of $300, you aren\u0027t going to be able to assemble anything decent. Really $500 is the starting point for a \u0022decent\u0022 gaming system. Obviously an uber awesome one is more like $2,000 but you can make a pretty respectably good one for $500-600."},{"CreatedByName":"Volix","CreatedById":144192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T15:12:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s not a lot better...

I have A LOT of dealing with Microsoft when at work. When you have installed several thousand copies of an operating system and had plenty of issues that needed MS input you get to know little quirks in the way they do business.\n\nWhat makes you think that running an i3 quad will outperform an AMD quad by such a noticeable amount on a game that is quite frankly hardly a CPU hog? It may have a higher cache, maybe a higher FSB. But the difference is seriously tiny when you are running the game.\n\nEdit: Just noticed that you limited the threads on your desktop to make sure the cores were not an issue. In that case if there is really such a large performance hit, then I apologise.\n\nEdit2: Microsoft have withdrawn the ability to install on primary desktop and a laptop. I have been out of the lower end of the support field for longer than I thought it would seem a lot has changed in the past couple of years.

But we were not talkin about an i5. We were talking about an i3 its little brother. The i3 has smaller cache and a cut down command set. Yet lazarus has pointed out that he has tested the two, so I am willing to concede the point.\n\nAn I3 will still be faster than any quad/octo AMD cpu as well, I know from personal experience/have tried various cpu\u0027s in the game myself.\n\nA dual core I3 will wipe the floor with whatever AMD cpu you compare it to, especially in this game. IPC is king for physics calc\u0027s, and those calc\u0027s are the biggest bottleneck of the game."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceChipmunk","CreatedById":142023,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T16:20:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E An I3 will still be faster than any quad/octo AMD cpu as well, I know from personal experience/have tried various cpu\u0027s in the game myself.\n\u003E A dual core I3 will wipe the floor with whatever AMD cpu you compare it to, especially in this game.

Some levels of AMD, normally their hex and octo cores are far superior to the i3, but then they are more expensive and really get destroyed by the Intel equivalents. I was running a 7 year old i7 and it completely wiped the floor with my brothers year old octo core AMD. I now use an OC\u0027d i5 and it still outperforms his machine.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T16:28:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 04:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T16:51:20Z","Content":"...and somewhere, the threadstarter sits and wonders what the heck he kicked loose ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
