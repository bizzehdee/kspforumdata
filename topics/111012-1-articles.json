With the transition to Unity 5, things may change a bit, but right now it is single threaded performance that means a bit more for KSP and AMD\u0027s single thread performance is abysmal in comparison to Intel. On multithreaded, well, things may be somewhat closer there. I can\u0027t really speak to whether KSP leverages a lot of integer or floating point calculations, but generally in most gaming comparisons, Intel has quite a lead when you include any discrete graphics card in to the mix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, KSP is pretty graphics light. I have a $100 Nvidia GTX750 and it runs KSP smoothly at 1080p and all of the nits turned up. Where I can get stumbling is truely massive ships. My i5-3570 running at 4GHz however can lift most of what is KSP pretty easily however.
