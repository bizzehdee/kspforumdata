I am not just talking about resizing the window (beacuse i have a mod to do it, but its not what Im trying to do. an example of what I want is, in the minecraft launcher, you can lock or unlock the window (which allows you to see the windows border and the taskbar) and a locked mode, witch is what ksp has ( it makes it so that the window is can not be resized, other than fullscreening it)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy question may be confusing, but I have no other way to ask it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T08:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only stock way you can do it (afaik) is to de-select full screen in graphics options and run KSP as a maximised window. \u00A0This will effectively be full screen (apart from a small window line at the very top of your screen)\u00A0but also you can move the mouse down to the start bar\u00A0no problems at all -\u00A0I just tried it and it works fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can Alt-Tab from full screen mode\u00A0also so try that, but I\u0027m not sure if that will be any better for you. \u00A0I have an insanely fast computer so either way I do it it\u0027s totally instantaneous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also some information \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/19645-ksp-in-full-screen-windowed-mode-quick-n-simple-windows-only/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ein this thread\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0which may help you creating a border-less windowed full screen version of KSP so you can browse \u0022without switching\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso worth googling a google on it as there\u0027s some other threads out there discussing the same issues for single and multi monitor borderless windowed KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if there is a specific mod for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pap1723 greatest fan","CreatedById":165811,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T19:40:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlol, what i want is a bordered window lel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
