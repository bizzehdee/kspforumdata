But the Eucl3d site is confusing, as it doesn\u0027t list a price anywhere...is this because of the varying size of craft? If so, what\u0027s an average price I could expect?\n\nAlso, does it work with part clipping, or is that a definite no-go? Like if a wing is made up of many wing components clipped in a way that makes a certain wing shape, will that work with the 3d printing, or no?\n\nThanks. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T04:19:30Z","Content":"planets you want from here: [http://www.shapeways.com/shops/kerbalspaceprogram](http://www.shapeways.com/shops/kerbalspaceprogram)"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T04:20:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E planets you want from here: [http://www.shapeways.com/shops/kerbalspaceprogram](http://www.shapeways.com/shops/kerbalspaceprogram)\n\nOh I know, I only mentioned them cause I found them first. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hunter3081","CreatedById":61490,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T11:09:08Z","Content":"AFAIK The prices of the craft are (US) 99$ for a small, 149$ for a medium, and 199$ for a large.
