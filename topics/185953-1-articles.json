It was hot and muggy every single morning here on the peninsula, and he had started working in the brand new building Monday - five days ago. Five days of sweat soaked slacks and shirts to be dry cleaned tomorrow. He had spent the last week plodding through financial and legal paperwork in preparation for the agency\u0027s first launch, RR-1, and he needed to be finished with it by this evening around 4pm in order to get home in time to wash up for the celebration dinner. It was a special company dinner twice over, first because the newly formed Kerbal Space Agency\u0027s launch facility was now operational, but also because this was the 16th of July, Victory day, marking the 10 year anniversary of the kerbals victory in the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003Esecond\u003C/span\u003E Big War\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:16px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\u2122. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#222222\u0022\u003ERR-1 was scheduled to lift off Monday morning at 0900 and it absolutely had to go as planned. Way too much money and influence had been invested in pulling the company together for the very first launch to go south. It was the epitome\u00A0of a demonstration mission - an inexpensive unballed rocket with no payload and only half the normal propellant would fly up, and then be recovered after descending under a parachute. Still, it will be the organization\u0027s first launch, and confidence\u00A0is no substitute\u00A0for proper planning. Excrements!

A pretty big gamble considering that at the time no one had ever actually launched anything into orbit, and the only reason for high altitude rockets at all was either military related, or for weather research. But his gamble started to make him look like a visionary five weeks ago, when the Kermmunists launched the first satellite into orbit on board a rocket big enough to... big enough for exactly one purpose - to carry a nuclear bomb up through the stratosphere, into space, and drop it on our side of the West Kerbin Sea. That event had the government ringing the telephones of every aerospace company in the nation with cash in hand. It looks like old Magnus was on to something. But bureaucracies move slowly, and for now the mission was just to conduct this demonstration and christen the brand new concrete launch pad. The launch was entirely nominal, but still put a big smile\u00A0on everyone\u0027s face in the observation hut. The rocket leaped off the pad and a half second later the sound washed over the observers, half shriek and half thunder. It shot up quickly for four seconds, riding on a thin stalk of grey smoke that connected it to the ground before the stalk of smoke ended and the rocket continued on, invisible now. But no one managed to keep their eyes on it because the observation hut had been placed 1000 feet to the west of the pad, and the morning sun was far too bright to look at. The sensors reported that it had ascended to an altitude of just over 20,000 feet and had broken the sound barrier. The fairing was supposed to blow itself apart to reveal the electronics package inside when the air speed dipped below 50 feet per second, and 10 seconds later separate the electronics package from the rocket to parachute to a safe landing. And one assumes that this happened, since the probe was retrieved as planned from the featureless grassy lowlands between the launch facilities and\u00A0the sea.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-04T23:30:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2019 11:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Nnimrod\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fulgur","CreatedById":195204,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-30T19:22:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks cool!

He had been doing his least favorite task, paperwork, since returning to the office after the launch earlier in the day, and he was not close to being done. And he had just been told that KSA had agreed to a second launch before the end of the week. Not only was this mission less than four days out, but it was actually a mission with non-trivial objectives! RR-2 was to carry a tiny probe to the upper atmosphere, and send back temperature information. That means the rocket would have to ascend to more than four times the altitude of RR-1, and the thermometer would have to be read somehow, and the information would have to be converted to a radio signal, and then transmitted by the telemetry antenna. But at least this time there was no parachute to worry about. Parachutes are tricky, and there was\u00A0significant uncertainty about whether RR-1\u0027s probe would hit the ground at 10 feet per second or 150.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news was that very little needed to be changed for this mission. Bill Kerman assured him of as much as they walked through the hallway leading to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s main assembly floor. \u0022It worked last time didn\u0027t it? It\u0027ll make the altitude easy, it\u0027s 435 pounds lighter with this dinky gadget and no \u0027chute. And remember?\u00A0last time we only had half the propellant loaded.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFriday, 22 July, 430\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe had a bit of a headache. \u0022I need water, not coffee...\u0022 he thought as he sat an empty mug on the cluttered table next to him in the observation hut. The bright morning sun did nothing for his headache. He hadn\u0027t slept very much since the call Monday evening, but he had somehow pulled it all together, and RR-2 sat on the pad 1000 feet away. The siren started to wail and kept bellowing for 10 seconds, signalling that anyone that was somehow still hanging around the launch pad had better duck behind something fast and cover their ears. Just as he noticed that his ears were still ringing after the siren stopped, RR-2 jumped into the air like it\u0027s predecessor had four days earlier. This time the smoke trail kept going for about 7 seconds, and then... turned into a white puff... BANG Before Gabnas comprehended what the white puff meant the crisp bang of an explosion hit the hut. All telemetry had stopped. Magnus was in attendance, and Gabnas turned around to look at him despite his better judgement. His lips had virtually disappeared into a tight line across his mouth. RR-2 was over after just seven seconds and nothing was left but the limp stalk of smoke that hung in the air below the now slowly drifting white cloud.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater that day Bill had his preliminary report ready. He said that the high speed cameras showed the rocket starting to turn ever so slightly immediately prior to the explosion. It started to turn, and then there\u00A0was one single frame of the rocket tipped about 45 degrees off course, and the fairing seemed to be deformed. and then it exploded. But telemetry didn\u0027t show that the rocket had steered itself off course. Bill hypothesized that the rocket must have suffered an aerodynamic failure which caused it to tumble, and that the tumbling had resulted in a crack in the rocket\u0027s solid propellant grain. Solid rockets can\u0027t tolerate cracks, because the propellant burns at the surface, and a crack means more surface area. More surface area means more total burning propellant, and the throat of the rocket is only so big. So with too much gas being generated inside the rocket and not being able to escape through the throat of the rocket fast enough, it will explode. The rocket\u0027s airframe wasn\u0027t stiff enough to survive tumbling at almost mach 2, and that allowed it to flex, causing the propellant grain to crack. But what caused it to tumble in the first place? Bill pointed to the deformed fairing in the last frame of video. \u0022These rockets had big warheads. 750 pounds of TNT. They never got going as fast as RR-2. And that\u0027s part of it, but it aint all of it. The other part is our fairing. I thought welded sheet steel would be plenty strong, but it looks like I was wrong. When the army used these rockets there was no fairing, they just bolted the 750 pound bomb to the rocket and it worked out ok for them. I have to take full responsibility for this one Gabnas. The fairing was fine for RR-1 because it only went just past mach 1, but RR-2 hit almost mach 2 and still had another second left if\u00A0the damn thing didn\u0027t blow up.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESaturday, 23 July, 430\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe government was somehow only mildly put out over the explosion, and a couple hours after the reports had been submitted, Gabnas got the go ahead for RR-3, which was the same mission, and had a scheduled launch date of 0900 on the 29th. So\u00A0he and the engineering team would be spending a lot of time together over the coming week. They had to come\u00A0up with a stronger or more aerodynamic fairing that could stand up to the\u00A0brutal acceleration from the artillery rocket that was accelerating a 5 pound probe instead of a 750 pound bomb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022w2hV2e2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/w2hV2e2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ERR-2 with payload fairing removed\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ETo be continued\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-04T23:26:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2019 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Nnimrod\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nnimrod","CreatedById":152586,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-03T04:43:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESaturday, 30 July, 430\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGabnas\u0027 stomach was in a knot as he walked down the poorly lit hallway in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s small office section. The hall was on the outside of the building and the last bits of orange sunlight fell on the wall opposite\u00A0the windows. It was after eight and everyone had gone home and the lights were off. He was anything but sure about what he was doing, but he \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E to do something. He opened Bill\u0027s office door. It was a small office with a metal swivel chair and a desk, and remarkably cluttered for having been occupied a grand total of 3 weeks. He leaned over the drafting table and pushed a thumbtack through a photograph and into the sheetrock. Bill couldn\u0027t miss it when he sat down in his chair Monday morning. He knew this was cruel, and that\u0027s why he did it. But that\u0027s management, right? There were half a dozen aerospace companies all trying to\u00A0launch rockets over the last couple of weeks, to varying degrees of success, and Kerbal Space Agency had to be the standout, the successful rookie.

Long range bombers had played a pivotal role in the Western Alliance\u0027s victory in the second Big War\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:16px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\u2122, \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(34,34,34);text-align:left;\u0022\u003Eand with the development of nuclear bombs in the years since, it seemed that the importance of the massive aircraft could only grow. He waited a month for a reply, and finally sent them another letter reminding them of his resume. They responded, telling him that he was not currently being considered, but that they would keep his resume on file and inform him if the situation changed. He wasted no time in applying to C7 Aerospace, Floyd\u0027s leading competitor, and unlike Floyd, they wasted no time in telling him that they had no need for more aerospace engineers at the moment. He had been in university for six years, his entire adult life preparing for his role as a bomber designer, and now that he was ready there were no more seats at the table? The recruiters had told him he was definitely going to be accepted. \u0022For sure kid, you get that Master\u0027s and they\u0027ll pay you 5,000 kerbits just for showing up. Demand couldn\u0027t be higher.\u0022\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#222222\u0022\u003EThe next weekend after he got the letter back from C7, he went to a local job fair and met Magnus Kerman, a stern kerbal who was starting his own aerospace company right here on the peninsula. The pay he offered was generous, probably more than Floyd would have offered. \u0022You\u0027ll earn it.\u0022 Magnus said. At the time he wasn\u0027t sure why Magnus was building a company around launching rockets, he just needed a job.\u00A0But the importance of it had fully sunk in now, especially when the Kermunnists had put that satellite in orbit.\u00A0He was pretty sure that he had chosen the right career, but he still lacked any actual accomplishments. And the choice to work with space rockets instead of the strategic bomber program had hardly been his choice at any rate. And then there was vengeance. He had plenty of reason to crave success - it\u0027s pretty normal for a young professional. But success would also represent an outmaneuvering\u00A0of the HR department\u00A0at Floyd Dynamics on his part. They had barred the gate when he was marching towards success as a fresh graduate, and\u00A0he couldn\u0027t think of many ways to even the score. C7 Aerospace was the lesser of the two companies - but they had denied him as well. That meant that his professional success had to be waiting for him somewhere other than the strategic bomber program. There was one way. If he were to be on the forefront of the field that made strategic bombers obsolete... that would allow him to transcend Floyd\u0027s rejection and emerge more successful without riding on the back of an already extremely successful aerospace giant. If space rockets really were the future, then he stood a good chance at writing his name in history as one of the driving forces behind the early development of orbital space rockets. That would be an acceptable future.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe newspaper this morning had something to say about the likelihood of that future tho. The article didn\u0027t go into specifics because the reporters didn\u0027t know anything yet, but it did have a big picture in the middle of the front page of the crooked, corkscrewed\u00A0smoke trail left by RR-3 yesterday morning. The mission had been only a slight alteration of RR-2, albeit a little less of a failure. For starters there was no explosion this time. Bill\u0027s revised fairing was stronger, but still not aerodynamic enough. About six seconds into the rocket\u0027s powered flight, which was to last eight seconds, it tipped over westwards about 30 degrees and started spinning. It completed two corkscrews before the motor mercifully burned out, ending the smoke trail. Telemetry continued however - the electronics were still working. But the rocket was not going nearly fast enough to make it to it\u0027s target of 85,000 feet. They sent the signal for the thermometer to record and transmit data early, since the rocket would fall out of the sky much sooner than anticipated, but it still didn\u0027t have time. It only made it to 50,800 feet before tipping over and coming back down. The electronics didn\u0027t have time to complete the transmission, so that objective was also failed. The engineering team had failed with RR-2, their fairing was not aerodynamic or strong enough, and it proved a fatal flaw. The engineering team had failed again with RR-3, again the problem was thought to be the fairing. Bill kerman led the engineering team. Bill was the one standing, whether he knew it or not, between Gabnas and that acceptable future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow much blame was appropriate tho? Supersonic flight and aerodynamics was a field as new as the paint on the office walls, and the\u00A0smell had not yet faded. Bill had worked on helicopter development at Steadler Engineering before coming to the KSA, another new field, but not related to supersonic aerodynamics in the least. Not that it mattered, there wasn\u0027t anyone else who actually had experience\u00A0with space rockets. Magnus had chosen Bill because of his team\u0027s resilience and perseverance when faced with the constant problems they encountered trying to build an aircraft that hangs from a single propeller. He knew making rockets that go to space wouldn\u0027t be any easier. There was no book to go by. But responsibility is a terrible thing. It doesn\u0027t care about how hard your job is. It wouldn\u0027t hesitate for a moment to consign Gabnas to the cubicle of a failed engineer, designing cost optimized washing machines for the rest of his career if he failed here at KSA. And so despite the knot in his stomach he pushed the thumbtack through the picture cut from the newspaper of RR-3\u0027s crooked, failed smoke trail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-04T23:24:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2019 11:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Nnimrod\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nnimrod","CreatedById":152586,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-04T05:54:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThursday, 4 August, 430\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHole spacing was good.

Bill was watching over his shoulder as he was finishing up with riveting the new fins to the fin flanges on the rocket body. Big sucker. The new rockets had arrived here earlier in the week, and this one was almost completely assembled and ready for tomorrow\u0027s launch. It lacked only the last fin, and Cambo would be finished with the riveting in time to get home for dinner. Bill would be staying later tho, he wanted to inspect all of Cambo\u0027s riveting, but didn\u0027t want to make it look like he didn\u0027t trust his work, so he would just hang around and inspect it after he left for the day. He also had to measure again, for the fifth or sixth time to make sure the fins were completely identical. Asymmetrical fins would make an asymmetrical flight, and there was to be no more of that. And these fins were hand made by Bill himself, so consistency absolutely could not be assumed. The old fins used on RR-1, 2, and 3 were the fins that came on the rocket, mass produced stamped sheet steel, welded to the rocket body. Conveniently, the new longer rocket\u00A0that would be used for RR-4 didn\u0027t have any fins yet - if it had, they would have had to cut them off and replace them. Bill didn\u0027t have time or a wind tunnel for the kind of analysis that should have been done to reveal whether the fins were really part of the problem that caused RR-3 to veer off course, but he had a strong hunch that they were. They were sufficient to keep the rocket pointed straight for the RR-1 mission, and all the times they were fired during the war, with heavy explosive warheads, but For RR-2 and 3 they had been a problem. The fairing was half the problem, but he thought his redesign had fixed it. At least, fixed it as good as he could given the 1 launch per week cadence that someone paid way more than him thought was a good idea. The other half of the supersonic aerodynamic instability problem was the fins. With only days to go from design to having them attached to the rocket, Bill was unable to purchase ready made fins, so he made these out of 3/8ths inch aluminum plate, with extra layers of 1/8th inch aluminum at the root for added rigidity. Even being aluminum, they were quite a bit heavier than the original steel fins because they were thick and had about twice the chord. But the new rocket should easily make up for the weight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGabnas\u00A0had contacted the defense contractor that they bought the lot of 20 artillery rockets from years ago, and asked if they had anything larger. No, that was the biggest rocket they made, and since then they had shifted to making mostly artillery shells. Well, sort of. There was that bunch of prototypes, but they were locked up at the R\u0026amp;D facility and no one seemed to know anything about them. Gabnas had called him and within 20 minutes they were on the road in his pickup truck driving to this R\u0026amp;D facility to hopefully look at some bigger rockets. \u0022Yeah, supposedly,\u00A0I haven\u0027t seen them myself. Richbee might know.\u0022 The facility manager walked with them to the grounds keeper\u0027s \u0022office\u0022 and found Richbee Kerman munching little canned sausages and not doing much else. He took them to a small warehouse with vines growing up the side and cut a rusted lock off the double doors. Inside were some dusty, tall artillery rockets that looked exactly like the ones they had back at the KSA launch facility - but twice as long. These were about 14 and a half feet long. There were eight of them. Gabnas leaned over to Bill - \u0022Why don\u0027t you have a look while I talk to him\u0022. So he set about inspecting the rockets while Gabnas was presumably asking for some sort of information about them. You can\u0027t just look at a rocket and decide to use it in a mission that\u0027s going to launch in 4 days without some sort of specifications or performance data. The rockets were fine, just stretched versions of the same thing they had already launched 3 of. And the rocket motors had not been an issue for RR-1, 2, or 3.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the inspection Richbee came up driving a big forklift and they took one of the rockets a quarter mile out to a small field with a big earth dam on one end and some concrete fixtures in the middle. They did a static test then and there - the manager had assured them they had permission for this sort of thing. Before they left Gabnas had worked out a purchase agreement and to have the remaining seven rockets loaded on\u00A0trucks and shipped to the launch facility this same evening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFriday, 5 August, 430\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pCJ8IRz.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pCJ8IRz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRR-4 lifted off the ground a lot slower than the previous, shorter rockets. It\u0027s fuel grain was configured to deliver 24,000lbs of thrust at launch, and to burn for 16 seconds. The shorter version delivered 22,000lbs of thrust, and burned for 8 seconds. Since it also weighed twice as much, this had the welcome effect of not forcing the rocket to go supersonic a mere mile above ground like RR-2 and 3 had. Aerodynamic drag that low in the atmosphere is immense. At T\u002B16 seconds the motor burned out and RR-4 was at 26,250 feet and sailing upwards at mach 3.5. It went up to 120,554 feet before tipping over, and Gabnas gave the word for the thermometer readings to be transmitted. Nothing. Telemetry continued as normal, but the scientific data transmitter was totally unresponsive. Harcan Kerman, the operator, tried again and again, but all he could do was press a button to send a signal to RR-4, and for whatever reason nothing was happening. The tension only lasted for another minute tho, as RR-4 reached the end of it\u0027s mission as it nose dived into the West Kerbin Sea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn truth, it was a somewhat trivial failure.

The goal was just to demonstrate that they were capable of recording data with a scientific instrument and transmitting it back. Incidentally, they were apparently not capable of doing that. \u0022Bill\u0022 Gabnas said, as the jeep bounced along the short drive back from the observation hut, \u0022The rocket ran hot straight and normal,\u00A0it looks like an electrical component failure.\u0022 \u0022Well we\u0027ve got the backup probe, I\u0027ll start with that.\u0022 Bill was referring to a second probe they had assembled identically to the one that had just malfunctioned aboard RR-4. The probes were actually quite inexpensive - the whole rocket was pretty inexpensive, relatively speaking. The duplicate probe was intended partly to serve as RR-5\u0027s probe in the event that RR-4 failed catastrophically and had to be flown again. As it happened, RR-4 did fail, but not catastrophically. The duplicate probe allowed them to find any design problems that may have led to the failure to transmit the thermometer data. And they did find something, and quickly. The first thing they did was to turn it on and send the \u0022Transmit science data\u0022 signal, and they got nothing. So, whatever was wrong with RR-4 was almost certainly also wrong with the duplicate, which meant they would probably find the culprit. That might be encouraging, Bill wasn\u0027t sure. He spliced in a relay and activated the data transmission circuit manually, and got a signal back telling him the assembly room\u0027s\u00A0temperature. Excellent! That narrowed it down further. Within an hour he had the problem isolated to the receiving antenna assembly, which they had purchased from Zaltonic Electronics. Of course finding a failure on the backup probe didn\u0027t mean that it was the same failure experienced by RR-4, so he unwrapped a few more of the antenna assemblies from their packaging, and tested them as well. Dead on arrival. Didn\u0027t matter too much what specifically about it was bad, just that the problem was in the antenna and not wiring that he had done. This meant that Gabnas and those above him had Zaltonic Electronics to direct their anger at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGabnas didn\u0027t seem that angry tho. \u0022Yes, it would be even better if it had all worked perfectly, like RR-1, but the bottom line is that we built a rocket that flew like it was supposed to.\u00A0Not our fault that Zaltonic sent us a batch of bad antennas. Although... we should have tested them.\u0022 \u0022We tested the thermometer, and the battery circuit, and everything about the telemetry package, just not the receiving antenna itself\u0022 continued Bill. \u0022Well now we know Bill,\u00A0test \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0And I won\u0027t source so much as a coffee machine from Zaltonic.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter Bill had finished with the diagnostics, he tested everything again and found no faults. So he installed a new antenna, and a new redundant backup antenna, and on the 12th of August, RR-5 flew to 120,000 feet, recorded temperature information, and transmitted it back.
