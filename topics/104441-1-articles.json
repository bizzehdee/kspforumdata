My entry was a boat that is capable of a max speed of 80 meters per second with over 1200 units of fuel. \n\nBE WARNED:\n\nThis journey will be extremely boring, with lots of water, boating, and some sad moments to go along with it.\n\nFollow at your own risk!\n\n(JK, but I am not kidding about the boring part)\n\nPost will be updated daily with new legs and developments.\n\nLeg I - The Adventure begins!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
