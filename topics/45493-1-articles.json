This time, its an idea for gaming that could be used for computers, consoles or neither. I pushed an idea out to Quirky. Quirky, for those not familiar, lets you post an idea and people vote on it to see if they should pay any mind to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is to create a platform that can be stood upon that will allow you to move in all directions sending that feedback to the connected system. The platform is planned to be robust enough to withstand jumping and leaning as well as walking and running in all directions. This would be an ideal exercise platform and gaming platform all in one portable chassis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome planned features I had in mind were\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Portability\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Variable tension via spring screws to allow the trackballs to be tightened \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Usable connected or not connected to a system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Wireless\\Bluetooth connectivity with mobile support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Ability to connect to Consoles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I am still at stage one and need people to look over the idea and give it the thumbs up or down. Jump over to the site and give it a once over and, if you like the idea, give it a quick vote. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.quirky.com/invent/643941/action/vote/query/sort=ending_soon\u0026amp;categories=all\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.quirky.com/invent/643941/action/vote/query/sort=ending_soon\u0026amp;categories=all\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always, let me know what you think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Genius Evil","CreatedById":72989,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T03:36:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe Nintendo has something like this for the wii console.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jatwaa","CreatedById":59627,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T03:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey do, but theirs is limited in direction. Whereas the Wii Fit can sense the Up and Down and register leans forward, back, left and right; this idea would make the movement natural. If you want to walk forward, you walk forward rather than lean forward. This would add the ability to walk/run/lean in any direction rather than just lean to move. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe method of movement is what differs between the two. My method would be to emulate the world moving beneath you.
