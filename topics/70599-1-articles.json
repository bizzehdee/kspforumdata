This was working absolutely fine a couple of days ago, but after a clean reinstall, they\u0027re not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I have HotRockets installed so I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s the reason why, but I have MP_Nazari installed in the right place (Kerbal Space Program (235)\\GameData\\MP_Nazari) and that contains kw_hotrockets.cfg and the FX for it. I also have Smokescreen installed correctly (GameData\\SmokeScreen\\SmokeScreen.dll) so that\u0027s not it. It could be a conflict between that and CoolRockets, but as I said, this was working absolutely fine before I reinstalled so I must\u0027ve done something wrong there. Also in the works is KSP Renaissance Compilation which has some of it\u0027s own effects, but again, it was working fine. But what\u0027s odd is that right now, the FX is working fine on stock engines, so I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
