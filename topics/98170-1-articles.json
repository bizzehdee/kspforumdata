I\u0027m on linux and get it with large part ships. I don\u0027t have antivirus because of linux. I\u0027ve been assuming it\u0027s the CPU limitation. It happens when I have large parts and my one CPU core is riding at 100% for a long time and gets worse as I rise up the parts count in VAB. Not sure if it\u0027s related to it jumping the 100% core from core to core or not. I have not watched enough. But it does that also. It may not be relevant though.
