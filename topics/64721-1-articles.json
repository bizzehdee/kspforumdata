The problem with such mounting is that the sepatron not only damages parts of the rocket (which can be often found in the F3 log), but also rotates the stage around its center of mass, meaning its lower half can still collide with bottom of the rocket and cause further damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I show here not only doesn\u0027t cause any damage because the sepatron points clear of any parts, but also both rotates the stage away from the rocket and pulls it down, away from the rocket where it might cause damage. I found this the most convenient way to mount sepatrons to avoid any problems and I highly recommend it to anybody else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/qMsJT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
