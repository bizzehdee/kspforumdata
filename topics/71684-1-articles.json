So if the whole ship is in circular orbit, the orange fuel tanks that are closer to the planet have a lower speed than it\u0027s required for a circular orbit so they try to fall, while the fuel tanks the are further away from the planet have a higher speed than it\u0027s required for a circular orbit so they are pulled higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in my video the ship gets accelerated towards a vertical attitude and when it reaches a vertical attitude it already have a high angular speed so it keeps rotating and as a result that oscillation happens.
