You don\u0027t actually have to take along props for deorbit, though. Set the gravity multiplier to 1%, teleport to a circular orbit around the target world, and then warp around until you are approximately right above your target. Then set the gravity multiplier back to 100%. Your earlier velocity will be maintained, so you will simply fall out of space and land where you want to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGotta get clever if you are at a higher latitude tho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
