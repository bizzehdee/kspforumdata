Unfortunately, when I try to apply the limits in the servo configuration, it appears to let me set separate limits for each rotatron, but once I open the position editor on one of them, it applies the same limits to both of them based on which servo I selected in the position editor (they go from -30 to 90 and 90 to -30).

I \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E figured out how to set each rotatron to respect limits in the first place (the [starboard] rotatron on the left in the picture has hit \u002B90, the [port] one on the right has hit -30), and I \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E figured out how to make the port rotatron rotate \u0022backwards\u0022 (that is, the \u0022right\u0022 movement button applies negative rotation, and the movement button moves both rotatrons in the correct direction at the same time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s the problem here is I\u0027m trying to set the starboard one to run from -30 to \u002B90, and the port one from \u002B30 to -90 (that is, they\u0027ll start above horizontal, then rotate together downwards to vertical). Unfortunately, when I try to apply the limits in the servo configuration, it appears to let me set separate limits for each rotatron, but once I open the position editor on one of them, it applies the same limits to both of them based on which servo I selected in the position editor (they go from -30 to 90 and 90 to -30). Since positive rotation (and therefore positive limits) is always right-hand rotation, one of my rotatrons is therefore off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I could make it work by placing the servos individually rather than using symmetry mode, but I\u0027ve got a bunch of wheels to place further down the struts and I\u0027d like to not have to place them all individually. I have these two to do, plus I have to do the same thing for gear at the aft end of the vessel. Lots of room for error, and symmetry would help immensely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think the real fix is in how the rotations are defined - it appears that \u0022invert axis\u0022 tells the part to invert the command rotation (so the \u0022right\u0022 command makes it move \u0022left\u0022), but if there were a way to say \u0022this is a \u003Cem\u003Eleft handed\u003C/em\u003E part\u0022 then both the rotation direction \u003Cem\u003Eand the applied limits\u003C/em\u003E could be set correctly in symmetric parts. A flag in the \u0022invert axis\u0022 selector to tell you which sense the servo is moving in would be helpful too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bit long-winded for a feature request, but there you go. Not having the same problems with the hinges, but I \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E see where you could have similar problems with certain hinges used a certain way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESymmetry has been an issue when trying to set individual ranges.
