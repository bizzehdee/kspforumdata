The most rational and simple explanation to your youtube conundrum is that the station core had gotten a port swap. If that wasn\u0027t explained in the video it either slipped the author\u0027s mind, you skipped over that part or it was explained in a previous video if it perhaps was a series.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
