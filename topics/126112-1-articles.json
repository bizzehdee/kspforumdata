Launched the STS Columbia (from the SSP by Mike-NZ) first, some unwanted yaw steering put it in a slightly inclined orbit 15 minutes after SSME start. Then I launched the Buran when Columbia was directly overhead a fraction of an orbit later. Yaw steering put the energia on the right azimuth. The circulization burn put us with an intercept of 20 km between Buran and Columbia. A 12.1 m/s burn at the ascending node refined that to 3.9 km. Time warped to closest approach, took pics, then my computer session ended (darn library). I\u0026#39;ll try again tomorrow, and upload pics of the first attempt. Not bad for eyeballing complex orbital rendezvous maneuvers with no practical experience.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaelumEtAstra","CreatedById":109360,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T23:48:50Z","Content":"\nGreat job! It makes me realize just how much we forget rendezvous are amazing. After it became a routine thing with the Salyut program nobody really seemed to care. Also, imagine a Shuttle-Buran mission where the two of them were docked together. What a sight that would be! (Even though it would be impossible with the incompatible docking ports, i.e. APAS-95 \u0026 -86)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T23:51:08Z","Content":"\nYou\u0026#39;re saying first MANUAL?

The first time you do rendezvous is hard, I had so much trouble with it when I started. I read instructions online, but it all seemed a bit counter intuitive, so I couldn\u0026#39;t quite get my head around it. You feel like a real rocket surgeon when you manage it the first time. For what its worth NASA had to overcome the same problem during Gemini. They made the same mistake everybody makes when they start out in that they tried just pointing at the target and propelling towards it. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nGood to learn to do without assistance first, after that use mechjeb all you like.\n"}]}
