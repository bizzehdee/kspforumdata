I am starting to understand the whole getting my satellites spaced out evenly around the equator.

Do they need to be pointing at each other?

RemoteTech 2, compatible with 0.21, is currently still in development and may suffer from significant bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn RemoteTech 1, satellite dish connections are two-way. The dish on ship A needs to point to the dish on ship B, and vice versa, for them to communicate. (This is not necessary for omnidirectional antennae.) Usually, this means each satellite needs at least two dishes to communicate with its two neighbors satellites, if they are not within range of an omnidirectional antenna. Use the RemoteTech window to target satellite dishes. Keep in mind that at least one of the satellites in your network will need to have a connection with Kerbal Space Center--KSC has an omnidirectional antenna with a range of 5000 km.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-28T17:05:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2013 05:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kimberly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T01:13:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI put up 4 relaysats in geosync, and I have several different antennas on them.

In a RT world, everything has to be controlled by a kerbal, whether it\u0027s one sitting in a command pod or at ground control at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe blue line only shows up when you\u0027re remote controlling a probe. It shouldn\u0027t show up at all for manned craft (though I think it might sometimes due to bugs, but it doesn\u0027t mean anything in that case). The blue line shows the path from the kerbal who is controlling the probe to the probe itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re in low Kerbin orbit and have clear line of sight, it\u0027ll probably be a straight line to KSC on the ground. If the signal has to be relayed through a satellite or two first, it will show the hops through the communications network that it\u0027s currently using. The control point isn\u0027t necessarily KSC -- if there\u0027s a RemoteCommend equipped ship closer, it will use that instead*. The reason for that is that the length of the path influences how much signal delay there is due to the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat are some of the cool things one can do with a full comms network.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the thing about RemoteTech is that it doesn\u0027t really add a bunch of cool stuff. It actually makes the game \u003Cem\u003Eharder\u003C/em\u003E (and a bit more realistic) by having it installed. Stock probe cores are significantly better \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E RemoteTech installed than with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does make the game more interesting, though, in my opinion, and gives you a real reason to send up manned missions rather than using probes for everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest thing that you can do with RemoteTech that you can\u0027t do with stock is controlling other craft without having to switch to them. A small example: I have some lifter designs that, depending on the payload and how good my ascent is, may sometimes end up in a stable orbit with a little bit of fuel left. Rather than just leaving them drifting as debris, I put an RTG, probe core, and antenna on them (or sometimes just the tiny little short-range antenna with remote control built in).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter decoupling from the lifter, I stay in control of my main vessel, click the remote control button, select the lifter from the list, and then hit \u0027Retrograde\u0027 on the flight computer window. The lifter slowly turns away. Then I tell it to perform a 15 second burn at max throttle, hit \u0027Send\u0027, and the booster stage fires up and zips away from me, deorbiting itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI want to send out interplanetary probes...will I need to have a local Kerbin comm network established first?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt depends how far out your probes are going. It\u0027s a good idea to, both as practice for using RT, and to avoid the headache of not being able to control your probes for half of the time when KSC is on the wrong side of the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo I have to have one particular satellite that is pointing toward my interplanetary probe that is also part of my Kerbin network?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, especially for long range links. Once your probe reaches orbit of the planet it\u0027s going to, you can set your Kerbin satellite to just target the planet instead of the probe, so that if you have more than one there, they can all talk to home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get far enough out, signal delay becomes a real thing. Performing something like a landing is extremely... challenging. If you\u0027re planning on landing things, it may be worthwhile to send a manned mission* with a RemoteCommand module (the 2.5m round probe body also has this and looks a lot spiffier than the regular RemoteCommand part) to orbit your target planet for the duration of the mission. The kerbals can chill out in orbit in relative safety while the probes descend (and maybe crash \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The default settings for RemoteCommand require 3 kerbals in a command pod to operate it. According to the README, the reasoning is that they\u0027re busy enough piloting their own ship and keeping it straight, so you need at least 3 to juggle that and also control other things remotely. I changed my settings to only require 1 because really, how hard is it to push a few buttons to deorbit a booster stage? Also, my space station with a command module and various satellite dishes uses a 2-man lander can as its bridge, but since they\u0027re not doing anything \u003Cem\u003Ebut\u003C/em\u003E remote piloting from there, I feel justified.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-12T18:48:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2013 06:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Blackstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
