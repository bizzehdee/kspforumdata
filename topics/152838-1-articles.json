I generally\u00A0agree with why the solar panels aren\u0027t retractable unless shrouded, but when using them only in a non-atmospheric environment they sometimes get in the way during docking and moon landings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also would like to overwrite anomaly detection percentages of probe cores. Warping aimlessly waiting for a \u0027?\u0027 to appear is not my idea of fun \u00A0(ok, I accept I am impatient and grumpy on this one).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I change the stock configs, I\u0027ll have to do it again on the next update.
