Seawater can be turned into fresh water via distillation. Distillation requires heat. Now, say we placed solar satellites with output masers tuned to water-heater wavelengths (as well as power transmission) in a high Earth orbit (meaning somewher not cluttered by Kessler). The masers point at a mirror in GEO, which then relays to the still. This heat augments the still\u0027s action, allowing for cheapened water. Let\u0027s use the American Southwest as an example. Cheaper water means more agriculture, without using the Colorado River. More water in the river means more force behind hydroelectrics (cheaper power) If carried far enough, the EPA might get interested because the Colorado reaches the sea again. Thus, perhaps subsidies are in order. Perhaps all the involved companies are in cahoots, and share profits gained via underselling competitors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, back to our little satellites. Perhaps radiation pressure plays a large enough part in the orbits of the collectors, and particularly the mirror. This encourages secondary industries, such as propellant production. Perhaps this brings value to ice harvesters, which would haul ice in-system on electrolysed H2-O2 or NERVAs running on pure H2. Where do they get the power to electrolyse? From existing beamed-power installations (the collector sats) tuned to transfer wavelengths. Or perhaps deployable light sails on the way out-system. An alternative is allowing ice to impact Luna, then recover it and not bother with the circ burns. Thus the haulers never have to do two burns. If sufficiently advanced, the haulers would simply use tethers to match velocities with promising roids and do half of the transfer that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce this infrastructure is in place, more exotic options such as hydrocarbon skimming from Titan\u0027s atmosphere and helium from Saturn\u0027s could become viable. Helium is already a confirmed motive, and hydrocarbons are always welcome. Hydroponics/aeroponics may benifit from null-gee or centrifugal installations, thus feeding the several spacer or lunar colonies. At this point, the colonies are food, water, and air sustainable, at least from Earth surface. From here, we could begin to look at greater expansion, as long-term habitation tech has been developed. Eventually, an attempt is made at a fully sustainable colony on planetary body capable of supplying all the necessary minerals, with supplemental beams if necessary. This colony may serve as an out-system restock point, cheapening these endeavors further. At this point, the outer bodies would become inhabited as a matter of course, the ice haulers and solar lasers would proliferate, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhew, that was a bit long-winded, wasn\u0027t it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar collecters require stationkeeping.

There is no logical reason to keep on expanding to a population of 50 billion or more, and I\u0027m not sure that expanding in space colonies does anything to improve quality of life. A far more clever way to sustain development is to reduce population levels to a couple of billion.

You, on the other hand, seem to be advocating for a future with no growth, where the human race stays stagnant for the indefinite future. Which is the complete opposite of what humans have been doing since there have been humans around to do things, I would point out.

It will not reach 50 billion, let alone 500 billion.\u003Cp\u003EThe one economic activity that can take place in space is tourism for billionaires. Maybe, if the sabre engine works, launch costs will drop for light payloads. But that\u0027s about it. Real life isn\u0027t Firefly - space is a terribly hostile environment, extremely expensive to reach and which isn\u0027t commercially viable. Even if someone could make the point of (somehow) manufacturing spaceships in space so they don\u0027t need to get out of the Earth\u0027s gravity well, that still begs the question of who\u0027s buying those ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd sorry, no, no NASA. Space agencies work as a way for the State to directly invest in strategic, highly valuable manufacturing which produces a lot of jobs and boosts the countries economies (as well as providing a front for military research and procurement - it\u0027s easier to tell the world that your country is developing a civilian, peaceful, rocket to put satellites in LEO than to announce an ICBM program). Take away the economy boosting effect of space programs by moving manufacturing to places where the country nationals won\u0027t be working, and that space agency has just lost a huge reason to invest that money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, you are using a trend of, at most 50 years, to predict the future history of humanity.

There is no way to predict how much genetic engineering and vertical agriculture might extend earth\u0027s capacities. Not to mention technologies like fusion energy that might or might not be a thing in 50 years.\u003Cp\u003EI doubt that technological advancement will stop anytime soon. So a definite qnd static maximum population doesn\u0027t sound too realistic to me if it\u0027s not enforced by goverments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack on topic. With current launch costs it\u0027s not likely to get a micro gravity production to break even or generate a profit. The logistical costs are too high for now. But if you go back a couple of centuries, that was also true for the global supply chains and trade that is common today. It\u0027s mostly a question of infrastructure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy best guess is that the next big business after space tourism for a rather small group of people will be in providing orbital infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProviding fuel in orbit looks like the first step here. If you can mine fuel on the moon or asteroids and bring it to LEO, odds are good that someone is going to buy it as long as you can beat the costs of launching it directly from earths. This might be possible with mostly reusable and unmaned vessels. It\u0027s a much simpler business compared to actually constructing stations or vessels in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course technology increases the population capacity of Earth. But Earth is, after all, a finite closed system, and the ecological cost of pushing it much farther is just too great IMO. Especially when a viable alternative, at least from the technical point of view, is already imaginable, and may not be more than a couple centuries away from being economically viable. I\u0027m taking the long view here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the whiskey idea: that is actually a funny plausible little thing. It\u0027s in the part of \u0022really short term future\u0022 that I didn\u0027t address much in my original reply. I just think that that part is unquestionable, there ARE markets in space already that support a launch industry, and they are getting bigger all the time. I say this as a statement of fact, because the fact is that be spend more and more every year building launchers and launching stuff. Now, how do those market grow form small robotic spacecraft assembled for hundreds of millions of dollars on Earth, to a space-based economy that actually returns to Earth more that it lifts? That\u0027s the murky mid-future that is very interesting to talk about. It is even murkier, because we don\u0027t know how the markets of today will go about dropping launch prices for the markets of tomorrow. Right now a bunch of reusable ideas are getting floated about, and of course really high productions runs like those in every other established big industry (say, the car industry) are still nowhere near, so who knows what the cost to orbit per kg, or total annual launched mass numbers will look like in 50 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo keep discussing it!
