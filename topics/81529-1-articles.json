Set it as target when you\u0027re flying the rendezvousing ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following assumes rendezvous with a ship in a higher orbit. Change appropriately if the target is in a lower orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet up a prograde burn that raises your apoapsis to just touch the target ship\u0027s orbit. Put this manouevre:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you have a big inclination difference, at the AN or DN, whichever is closer to the primary (Kerbin for you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif the target orbit is very eccentric (yours isn\u0027t), directly opposite its apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eotherwise, at your periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your inclination is more than a degree or so different to the target, set up a normal burn at the AN or DN, whichever is further from the primary if there\u0027s a big difference. You may need to add a retrograde component to keep the apoapsis in the same place. You should after doing this, if you didn\u0027t already, have a closest approach marker. If the AN/DN is at apoapsis, combine this burn with the next one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet up a prograde burn at apoapsis that gives you a closest approach on a future orbit as small as you can get. For typical rendezvous in Kerbin 2 km or less is what you want. Optionally, add further dummy manouvres around the orbit, each one just before the last (because actually that places it nearly a complete orbit after), to show the closest approach for more orbits in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have that set, set the navball into target mode by clicking the speed indicator. This measures the prograde and retrograde directions and speeds relative to the target ship rather than the planet. When you get close to the target, point retrograde and burn until the speed shows zero. Congratulations, you\u0027ve rendezvoused! Now carefully fly closer to dock or just EVA Kerbals over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T03:42:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell the target ship is not up to date so I shouldn\u0027t even try to dock because I won\u0027t be able to land it on duna (I\u0027m docking a ship to it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will launch another target ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T04:22:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LABHOUSE\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LABHOUSE\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell the target ship is not up to date so I shouldn\u0027t even try to dock because I won\u0027t be able to land it on duna (I\u0027m docking a ship to it).\u003Cp\u003EI will launch another target ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll find it a lot easier if you first build and launch a pair of small, manoeuvrable ships with docking ports and practice rendezvous and docking with them (which is what NASA did).
