I also recognize it\u0027s not really in the appropriate forum, but still, question!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s an interesting interaction caused by the boundsmultiplier field on the inflatable heat shield, which allows for sun stations to not absorb thermal radiation. Given this immunity, they can orbit the sun as close as you please and can even slightly enter the chromosphere so you can pick up an EVA from \u0027flying high at the sun\u0027. Anything put within ~7 meters of cage end (for preference) of the shield will not absorb thermal radiation, but the object will still block thermal radiation from passing through, so it protects the heatshield and whatever\u0027s behind it. As long as you\u0027re willing to keep the setup pointed at the sun within about 5-10 degrees, it\u0027ll protect you indefinitely. In any case, there\u0027s plenty of room to put in a little sun station, complete with a Cupola and command chairs from which you can view the beautifully hilled and valleyed surface of the sun, or the nostalgic v.1 sun within the sun in map mode. Solar panels have the solid angle of continents, and the Oberth effect is at its boggling extreme. It\u0027s great fun! A highly recommended trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I understand it, this is actually an unintended effect of the boundsmultiplier field. The inflatable heat shield apparently made mischief when trying to calculate its bounds through the renderer, so the boundsmultiplier field was introduced to provide a fudge factor. As NathanKell explained in an earlier post that I had a hard time quoting properly: \u0022 The bounds reported by the bounding method, prior to PartSizeModifier, are based on the renderer bounds of the given renderer. There used to be multiple calls because there are multiple renderers for some parts. I\u0027d like to say the renderer bounds are correct, but the inflatable heat shield has proved that that is not always the case with skinned meshrenderers. For this reason we support the new field Part.boundsMultiplier to correct for such problems. \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand this use of the boundsmultiplier is a glitch, but it\u0027s a very charming one which lends itself well to our ambitions. I hope it serves others well in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-17T00:53:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2016 12:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Cunjo Carl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
