Sadly it was a sub-orbital turd....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this challenge is a lot like one I posted a little while back about making sci-fi spaceships. Bebop/ Swordfish II were included in my examples lol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think we need to wait for some kind of docking implimentation and better spaceplane support before a Bebop can happen. I\u0027m assuming you want it to be capable of launching some kind of smaller swordfish style spaceplane n\u0027 such. For that you need only make a small cargo bay, although swordfish would need to orbit seperately, then dock to Bebop. That\u0027s just how the game currently works, I would love to be able to make something like this in the future. For now, check out the spacecraft exchange, the guys there are making some pretty sexy looking spaceplanes. You might ask one of them to make an approximation of what Bebop would look like. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you Space Cowboy...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UncleCorgi","CreatedById":120031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T02:21:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made a ksp cowboy bebop the bebop using hangar extender, b9 aerospace, lackluster labs, and many more mods. It currently cannot takeoff on its own so I have to use hyper edit to get it into orbit. I will post screenshots later. I once tried making a swordfish II but it turned out to be a back heavy poodle engine which 20% of it was. I have made a few bebops in ksp, my first was huge with the biggest of the b9 parts then I made the minibop which was much more friendly to my computer and then made the bebop II which is what stage it is currently. I added bd armory just in case an space battle happens. I put my own custom ships in there, I will Try doing one with a swordfish in it but my 1st swordfish as I said was a fail\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T02:38:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUncleCorgi, feel free to share that ship in the Spacecraft Exchange subforum, but this challenge is long past its expiration date. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
