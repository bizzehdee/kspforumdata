I\u0027m not very good at this whole rocket science thing but have finally taken my kerbals to another planet. Bob Kerman is currently orbiting Jool. He\u0027s not got enough fuel, or a lander for that matter, to make a landing on the surface or anything like that. I\u0027m just going to try and get him nice and close to the planet so he can EVA and take some pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain a huge thanks for this awesome game and I look forward to trying to rescue him with another craft! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext stop, trying to land on Eve/Duna!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFridgecake\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T17:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood choice on not trying to land on jool. Atmospheric surveys show that it is a gas giant and the pressure would crush the vessel before any sort of solid surface (in whatever existence it is) can be achieved! Anyways, watch out for it\u0027s atmosphere. With it\u0027s gravity well, if you start losing velocity might not be able to get it back. Good job though, you are doing better than I am with the new planetary exploration. I have acheived orbit/\u0022landing\u0022 on gilly is about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkthespy","CreatedById":7644,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T18:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can \u0022land\u0022 on Jool. You have to be INCREDIBLY careful doing so, small landers work well. The \u0022solid surface\u0022 is actually gas so dense, you just float.
