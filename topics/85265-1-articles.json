There is a point of lowest degradation somewhere a bit above the middle, and the further you move away from it, the worse the degradation rate gets - exponentially. Discharging below a certain limit is actually worse than overcharging: a single complete discharge can destroy most lithium-ion batteries instantly. This is not unusual for batteries as a whole, which is why there are so many non-rechargable battery types. If you want to get really technical, li-ion batteries aren\u0027t truly rechargable either, i.e. you cannot really recover once they drain completely empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo combat this, li-ion batteries are equipped with control electronics that keep them within tightly confined operating parameters. For example, the battery in your laptop might be set to only use half of its true capacity, operating in a 30%-80% range. Despite this, the control electronics reports to the laptop \u0022I am at 100%\u0022 when the battery is at 80%, and \u0022I am at 0%\u0022 when the battery is at 30%. With a setup like this, the upper 20% and the lower 30% of the capacity are never used. The battery stays close to its equilibrium point and thus minimizes its degradation through charging and discharging. When the upper bound is reached, the control electronics stops the energy flow from the charger into the battery, ensuring that no overcharging happens; when the lower bound is reached, the control electronics simply disconnects the battery feed to the consumer, ensuring that no deep discharge happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, the battery itself does not care in any way, shape or form if you leave your laptop plugged in 24/7. You cannot accidentally overcharge it, the battery controller will prevent it; and as long as the laptop is plugged in, no power will flow out of the battery into the consuming device either. Additionally, recommendations for extending battery life generally involve keeping the battery mostly charged and doing small, short charge cycles - i.e. five times from 80% to 100% degrades the battery less than one time from 0% to 100%. You can take out the battery safely and store it somewhere; this does not harm the battery (so long as it wasn\u0027t already empty, which invites further deep discharging through passive energy loss over an extended period of time), but it does not improve its lifetime noticably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking batteries out of devices when plugged in for long periods of time is a recommendation that was valid once, when lithium-ion batteries were in their infancy and the best way to control them hadn\u0027t been sussed out yet. Modern batteries (those produced in the last 6-8 years) do not have these issues anymore and you do not need to worry about them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnecdote: remember how the original iPhone had a reputation for a quickly degrading battery, which would start out very good but over the course of a year would degrade to a point where the battery had only a fraction of its original capacity and frequently shut down early, even when the phone reported it still had battery life left? Those were the signs of improperly configured control electronics. The controller reported wrong/imprecise information to the device and was set to use a fairly large range of the battery\u0027s true capacity in order to achieve any sort of usable battery life for that new, revolutionary but power hungry device. This, combined with the fact that people at the time were used to phones living more than five times as long, frequently let their phones hit 0% and thus required very large charging cycles constantly, led to rapid degradation of the battery cells.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENewer smartphones do this better, but due to the extreme form factor constraints and the tendency of users to \u0022buy and throw away\u0022, manufacturers still tend to err towards using large capacity ranges and accepting more rapid degradation than you find in for example laptops or electric cars.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-23T11:49:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2014 11:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T13:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI noticed on a Lenovo laptop I recently configured for someone that it had different charge optimization settings.
