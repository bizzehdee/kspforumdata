My mod is doing it while at a distance and herein lies the problem, floating point inaccuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo explain this here is a simplified example. Say the game world is made up of a 3d grid that everything snaps to. At 0 distance the snapping points of this grid is 1 micro meter. What floating point inaccuracy does is this: At 10 meter these points are 1 centimeter apart, at 100 meter they are 0.1 meter away and at thousand meters the distance is 1 meter. Of course this is a simplified example but the problem is essentially the same. The further away you get the more the parts in your vessel will shake, to the point where there is nothing that can keep them together. I solve this by progressively strengthening the vessel but it will only work within certain limits. UNLESS they make changes to the game engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively i could cheat the user by swapping vessels, so your actual active vessel is the one in the little window but the main camera is swapped =P But that means you cant move while you are remote-controlling.

And if it goes in a window, it probably will, but i have to figure out if all the \\\u0027lead lazor systems\\\u0027 should have its own tab like for example subsystems has. And finally since remote control requires an active linkup with the lead lazor, and to lock a target requires active lead lazor tracking as well, i somehow have to figure out a way to transfer the lead lazors job to a subsystem, hopefully in a way that is not too complicated =p\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: Lazor System already comes with the ultimate weapon against other vessels.
