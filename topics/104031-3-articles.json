Eg Oort cloud objects don\u0027t orbit very fast - 3m/s ish. You could divert a very large object into the inner solar system and it would arrive at earth at approx 42km/s or even faster if it were slingshotted around Jupiter.\n\nSomebody check my maths on this, but a high performance ion thruster (exhaust velocity 5km/s) could halt the oort orbital velocity of a 10,000 ton object with 600kg of propellant. The sun would them do almost all the rest.\n\nIf that could be brought in at 60km/s the kinetic yield would be 4 megatons, or 2 megatons without a slingshot.\n\nThe drawback would be a painfully long deployment time, but if you brought in many objects periodically on a near miss trajectory they could be altered to strike the earth at much shorter notice.\n\nWith the very small amounts of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E required and resource extraction, one spacecraft could potentially redirect many such objects.\n\nBut considering the launch costs for getting out there in the first place, it would be far cheaper to just nuke it.

Of course it\u0027s circumvented if you can make the rods in space.\n\nAnyway, as for what it might look like, well it\u0027s a hypervelocity impact and there are many small-scale tests of those.\n\nA railgun round striking thin metal targets results in fireballs. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2QqOvFMG_A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2QqOvFMG_A)\n\nA small projectile against a thicker metal target (an empty gas cylinder), again a fireball and a crater-like hole: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqjq-LQgGDk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqjq-LQgGDk)\n\nAn impact into sand gives a spectacularly large crater, but no fireball: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbkkMKkjx6k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbkkMKkjx6k)\n\nI don\u0027t know why the third result is. I might guess it\u0027s because the potential fireball is \u0022snuffed out\u0022 by the projectile penetrating too deep; in the previous two tests it was metal-on-metal which will mean less penetration than metal-into-sand. On the other hand I\u0027ve also read that it depends on speed.\n\nThe scaling for this sort of impacts is fairly well known from simulations and experiments like these, and there\u0027s a rather nice website: [http://impact.ese.ic.ac.uk/ImpactEffects/](http://impact.ese.ic.ac.uk/ImpactEffects/)\n\nPlugging some example numbers in: [http://impact.ese.ic.ac.uk/cgi-bin/crater.cgi?dist=1\u0026distanceUnits=1\u0026diam=3\u0026diameterUnits=1\u0026pdens=\u0026pdens_select=8000\u0026vel=7.8\u0026velocityUnits=1\u0026theta=45\u0026wdepth=\u0026wdepthUnits=1\u0026tdens=2500](http://impact.ese.ic.ac.uk/cgi-bin/crater.cgi?dist=1\u0026distanceUnits=1\u0026diam=3\u0026diameterUnits=1\u0026pdens=\u0026pdens_select=8000\u0026vel=7.8\u0026velocityUnits=1\u0026theta=45\u0026wdepth=\u0026wdepthUnits=1\u0026tdens=2500)\n\nThe suggestion is that we can\u0027t get a decent fireball by just \u0022dropping\u0022 something from LEO, it\u0027s actually not fast enough. And a fairly small object is only going to cause a fairly small crater. **Basically I would imagine that sand video, but scaled up to knock cars and buildings flying.** The impactor needs to pretty much bullseye it\u0027s target, and if it can do that then this is actually a relatively precise and restrained weapon. Though not covered by the calculator, I would speculate that the wider danger is of large pieces of debris - cars, chunks of buildings, body parts - creating secondary impacts.\n\nIf the speed is increased, there\u0027s another problem - a small object is likely to break up. The airblast is similar to a bomb going off. For the 3 metre iron ball example that makes it potentially a \\*less\\* effective weapon because the blast happens too high up! Although fragments may still hit the ground.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-28T01:56:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2016 01:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by cantab**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-28T02:16:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, Emperor of the Titan Squid said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The problem with Kinetic bombardment is air drag.
