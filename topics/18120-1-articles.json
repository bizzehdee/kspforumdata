I\u0027d like to practice this technique on Kerbin/Mun/Minmus so that I know how to do it when 0.17 comes out. I\u0027m more of a builder, so I generally just use MechJeb to get around. Could anyone tell me what to do in MechJeb to for example slingshot around the Mun to Minmus, then slingshot from Minmus to Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T17:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEfficiently\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuickly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPick one of the above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, mechjeb won\u0027t help you there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T17:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t you get a free speed boost (as in less fuel but still high speed due to the gravity assist).
