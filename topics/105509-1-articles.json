But they really clutter up my log-in window, where almost 50% of my current flights are just flags.\n\nI have a love/hate with RemoteTech, so my actual flight count spikes erratically, but I currently have 17 \u0022flights\u0022 active right now. Consisting of my HKO station, 4 stock RT-capable satellites, and 12 flags scattered around the Kerbin SOI.\n\nNow actually in my specific save, I can easily just unfilter flags from my Tracking Station and active vessel map view, so its just the log in screen that is irritating. It\u0027s a flag, it\u0027s been planted in the ground and it\u0027s impossible to make it take off again, so it should be counting as an active-flight ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:56:05Z","Content":"The short answer is no, as far as I\u0027m aware.
