It need so much technology to develop and nobody can estimate how long or how much money it takes. Only sure thing is that time is very long (compared to typical industrial investments) and costs are enormous. I think that mining industry become interested when there are large and reliable reusable lauchers. Maybe 200-1000 t to low orbit at one tenth or less of current costs per kg. But I do not believe that mining companies develop such launchers. It will probably be governments job because there are not much commercial use for such giants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will never have a UHLV that is reusable. SLS is most likely the closest thing to that we will get, and maybe only the engines and boosters will be reusable with significant modifications. And even then, you would still only have a max. capacity of 150T to LEO (the maximum listed for SLS with F-1B LRBs)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you wait for that, it will never happen.

I do not mean that. Fear and slavery driven systems can never product enough to make Mars colonies. But it is not true that humans never like working. In every country and culture people use huge amount of work, money, thinking etc. to polish their status in their society of to get entertainment. They buy clothes, status things, they go to expensive concerts and sport happenings, they pay and use significant part of their lifetime to watch TV. I did not mean dictator or religion lead forced ideology but such situation that significant part of people are interested in new kind of things. For example colonization of space. Exploring and science are probably too nerdy stuff for average Joe but expanding human being to other planets could be as interesting as other entertainments now and people accept that small part of their taxes is used to such activities. Entertainment and sport industry get now large support from states all around the world. I think much more than governments use to space exploration. Think for example olympic games. States and cities put billions to them and many taxpayers accept it even they know that they never get money back. They think that fame and joy are more valuable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd one part of it may well be competition between leaders of states. They could show their mighty and productivity of their ideologies by financing space activities. I think that there must be both, people and leaders have to be interesting in colonization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally, they don\u0027t. You may think I\u0027m being pessimistic, but we really have no idea how the brain works, even after all these years. People do what they want to do, but a lot of people are procrastinators who dislike working. Really, getting people to contribute to society, making new innovations and ideas in a world dominated by robots is something we know nothing about doing- the first few decades will ideally be spent with regulations on robot usage. Especially since nearly everything can be done automated, there is all of a sudden little left for humans to do- a precarious situation that usually never ends well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd people accept the Olympics because people historically like sports- partially since it is \u0022war for fun and without hurting (hopefully) others\u0022.\u00A0And that\u0027s something that is much more into the human psyche. Space is not like that. Few like watching people explore the moon, and even if humans had no work to do, they\u0027d likely rather browse Youtube.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, in many ways, this is like the Industrial Revolution all over again.
