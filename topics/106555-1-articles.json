I was in orbit of Minmus, closing in for a rendezvous of a pod to rescue a Kerbin on a rescue contract. My closest approach was about 1km, so I was time accelerating to get in close -move about 2m/s relative to the pod. Suddenly, the pod exploded, killing Jendi Kerman. I checked F3 and it was due to over heating. I wasn\u0027t firing any engines, so there was nothing that should have been heating the pod. Also the pod was the 3 man pod, at least it was the second time round.\n\nI quickly hit alt-F4, and reloaded the game. Unfortunately, I couldn\u0027t reproduce the problem when I rendezvoused again, so I have no idea how it happened.\n\nI\u0027m running on windows 8.1, completely unmodded."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T13:05:16Z","Content":"Known issue, there is a patch in development, please see the Announcements section ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T13:27:33Z","Content":"Great to hear, but can\u0027t seem to find the information you are referring to. I managed to reproduce it and now it wont go away. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) Is there any work around? It seems to happen specifically when time warping through the model load range (2.3 - 2.4km). I remember having a similar problem in earlier versions, where space stations would spontaneously explode in the same situation."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T13:35:04Z","Content":"[\u0022We\u0027re working on 1.0.1\u0022 announcement.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117365-We-re-working-on-1-0-1)\n\nThere is a way to get around it for the time being, open the debug menu with Alt\u002BF12 and click the \u0022Physics\u0022 tab.\n\nIn that tab you can reduce or disable conductive heating, which will prevent the pod from exploding."}]}
