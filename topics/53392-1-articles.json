I used the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP launch window planner\u003C/a\u003E to launch it on Day 147 of year 1, and for the first ten days of its trajectory everything seemed to be fine. I was on course to an 81,000 km close approach with Eve on day 198, and after an inclination burn and second correction burn, I thought I\u0027d shaved that close approach down to 670 km. The orbit looked good - almost textbook Hohmann, I would say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESatisfied, I went off to do other things - launching a probe to Moho (failed - the orbital trajectory went wide and I lacked the fuel to correct), and sending a Kerbal into orbit around the Mun and bringing him back. It should be noted I\u0027d closed KSP and opened it again for each of these missions, taking a nice, casual approach. I then decided to check in on my probe and make sure it was still on track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn\u0027t. Without any prompting on my part, the orbit had changed to a highly elliptical orbit coming in very close to the sun and going out almost to Duna orbit. I was able to salvage the mission with some additional burns, using up the last of my fuel and getting to within 28,000 km of Eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m at a loss on this one. There were no close approaches to other planets until the probe reached Eve. I\u0027d left the engine off when I finished my last burn while it was on its proper course.

The projected date of arrival was on 198 (which I confirmed by hovering my mouse over the Eve Periapsis marker, noting the time, and doing a little arithmetic) and I discovered it was on its new orbit on day 181. My inclination and secondary correction burns (bringing it to the projected 670 km periapsis) occured on Day 166 (T\u002B19 days according to my records). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetween the second burns on 166 and my discovery of the new orbit on 181 I\u0027d launched two seperate missions. Venturer 2 to Moho lifted off on 169. I sent it on its way, exited KSP. Then this Saturday I cycled the clock forward (done by focussing on a flag I planted near the KSC on Day 1 for just this purpose) to Day 181 and launched my Kerbal 5 mission to orbit the Mun and return. Mission completed, I shut the game down again. Then I thought \u0022well, why not bring Venturer 1 to its conclusion\u0022, rebooted KSC, went to Venturer 1 and did a spittake when I saw the orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe probe itself is very simple - a Stayputnik core with 2 Z200 batteries, 6 OX-STAT panels, an OSCAR-B fuel tank and an LV-1 engine.

Not sure about this one, though it\u0027s a possibility. I do know that after I finished the ejection burn and closed the game I was still in Kerbin\u0027s SOI, and that I was out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI (but still - mostly - on course) for the inclination and correction burns on Day 166 (this might account for the fact that I needed to perform a correction burn then, however).

The two probes were carbon copies of each other, so perhaps when the second probe made its SOI change the game somehow affected the first probe?
