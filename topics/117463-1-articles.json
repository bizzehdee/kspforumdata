Dropping down right on top of the RAPIERS is one option, but better would be some temporary retractable landing legs at the back of the plane.\n\nAnyone seen a trick to stow big landing legs in a service bay? My attempt below doesn\u0027t work (the legs still pick up aero drag).\n\n![6wt0NUH.png](http://i.imgur.com/6wt0NUH.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T13:39:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 01:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by antbin**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T17:36:41Z","Content":"Yeah, the legs are pretty big-- I generally just abandon any attempt to stow them aerodynamically, and just eat the drag. They\u0027re pretty small compared with the rest of the ship, so in my experience the drag isn\u0027t too bad. A bonus is that since they\u0027re at the rear of the ship, the drag that they add helps with aero stability.\n\nIIRC, components that are attached radially to something that\u0027s aerodynamically exposed (e.g. to the outside of a cylindrical fuel tank, that sort of thing) get drag added to them regardless of their actual physical positioning-- e.g. if you attach something to the outside of a tank, and use the editor\u0027s tweak-position tool to move them radially inwards so that they\u0027re physically inside the tank, they still get drag added; that is, moving them inside like that doesn\u0027t help. (Caveat: I\u0027m not basing this statement on personal experience, just reporting secondhand on something I seem to recall reading on this forum a month or two ago.)\n\nIf that\u0027s the case, then I\u0027d say what you\u0027re doing in the pic above wouldn\u0027t help-- it looks as though the legs are radially attached to the outside of the service bay, even if they\u0027ve been physically nudged inwards. One idea might be to have a stack-mounted object that\u0027s truly physically inside the bay (i.e. it\u0027s mounted to one of the bay\u0027s interior nodes), and radially attach your legs to that thing, instead of to the service bay itself? Just something to try-- the idea being that things that are truly \u0022inside\u0022 a service bay don\u0027t get drag, and things that are radially mounted to such an object ought not to get drag either. No idea if it actually would work in practice, but maybe worth a try.\n\nPersonally, I\u0027d say just put \u0027em on the outside of the ship and let the drag fall where it may. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfox","CreatedById":59958,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T17:44:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E One idea might be to have a stack-mounted object that\u0027s truly physically inside the bay (i.e. it\u0027s mounted to one of the bay\u0027s interior nodes), and radially attach your legs to that thing, instead of to the service bay itself?

If that logic is right, they should not cause the drag as their parent parts is occluded from drag by service bay."},{"CreatedByName":"antbin","CreatedById":22389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T02:23:15Z","Content":"Success... but only by turning the legs 90 degrees and landing on the sides of the feet. Ugly hack, but something for now.\n\nI think the drag was because the legs clipped into the aft fuselage. It would make sense for drag to be calculated based on if the part\u0027s DragCube sticks out of the bay, perhaps? I\u0027ve had some problems with Gigantor solar panels that appear (barely) stowed but still pick up heat and drag."},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfox","CreatedById":59958,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T02:32:36Z","Content":"\u003E I think the drag was because the legs clipped into the aft fuselage.

Only thing I know for sure, is that opened bay cause alot more drag than closed one. Problem is, I place into the bay mostly physics-less objects, like small experiments and batteries, which should not produce drag anyway (but get heated when exposed), so there is no real difference between closed and opened bay drag, except the drag caused by bay itself... \n\nI personally believe that parts placed inside bay act the same as if they would be placed outside. I doubt that game distinguishes between in/out radial placement and portion of exposed part, its simply radial and adds drag to parent part. Correct me if I am wrong please."},{"CreatedByName":"almagnus1","CreatedById":78068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T02:38:37Z","Content":"Why not use Infernal Robotics to create something that will move the legs into the bay when you\u0027re not using them, yet deploy them to a stable position when you want to?"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfox","CreatedById":59958,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T02:40:09Z","Content":"Found this: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Part occlusion is accomplished only through node connections. Parts that are connected to other parts via nodes have the size of that cube\u0027s face reduced by the size of the parent/child part. So surface mounted parts are not occluded from drag.

This displays accurate drag info.\n\nOT: From my experience it is harder to land a spaceplane on it\u0027s tail than it is to descend tail-first with your gear down and then just do a belly flop when you are a couple of metres off the deck. A vernor engine under the nose if needed to get it pointed upward when it\u0027s time to go and you\u0027re all set. Saves you the weight of a second set of landing gear as well.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T15:05:45Z","Content":"I just flop to the landing gear and drive up a mountain to get vertical"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T17:02:28Z","Content":"I think that\u0027s my quote. Something important to note though is that cargo/service bays act different than what that quote is referring to. Items inside a bay are checked for occlusion by the bay itself. If occluded, then it doesn\u0027t contribute drag. This id true even if some of it is sticking out of the bay due to clipping.\n\nHowever, I don\u0027t believe the trick of \u0022attach inside the bay and use gizmos to slide it out\u0022 works because the game is checking actual location of the part. So if you slide the part out of the bay using gizmos, it shouldn\u0027t be shielded anymore.\n\nThat being said, it\u0027s supposed to work that way, but I haven\u0027t verified. Sould be easy to verify with the aero overlay.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
