They\u0027re pretty small compared with the rest of the ship, so in my experience the drag isn\u0027t too bad. A bonus is that since they\u0027re at the rear of the ship, the drag that they add helps with aero stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, components that are attached radially to something that\u0027s aerodynamically exposed (e.g. to the outside of a cylindrical fuel tank, that sort of thing) get drag added to them regardless of their actual physical positioning-- e.g. if you attach something to the outside of a tank, and use the editor\u0027s tweak-position tool to move them radially inwards so that they\u0027re physically inside the tank, they still get drag added; that is, moving them inside like that doesn\u0027t help. (Caveat: I\u0027m not basing this statement on personal experience, just reporting secondhand on something I seem to recall reading on this forum a month or two ago.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s the case, then I\u0027d say what you\u0027re doing in the pic above wouldn\u0027t help-- it looks as though the legs are radially attached to the outside of the service bay, even if they\u0027ve been physically nudged inwards. One idea might be to have a stack-mounted object that\u0027s truly physically inside the bay (i.e. it\u0027s mounted to one of the bay\u0027s interior nodes), and radially attach your legs to that thing, instead of to the service bay itself? Just something to try-- the idea being that things that are truly \u0022inside\u0022 a service bay don\u0027t get drag, and things that are radially mounted to such an object ought not to get drag either. No idea if it actually would work in practice, but maybe worth a try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027d say just put \u0027em on the outside of the ship and let the drag fall where it may. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfox","CreatedById":59958,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T17:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E One idea might be to have a stack-mounted object that\u0027s truly physically inside the bay (i.e. it\u0027s mounted to one of the bay\u0027s interior nodes), and radially attach your legs to that thing, instead of to the service bay itself?

Only thing I know for sure, is that opened bay cause alot more drag than closed one. Problem is, I place into the bay mostly physics-less objects, like small experiments and batteries, which should not produce drag anyway (but get heated when exposed), so there is no real difference between closed and opened bay drag, except the drag caused by bay itself... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally believe that parts placed inside bay act the same as if they would be placed outside. I doubt that game distinguishes between in/out radial placement and portion of exposed part, its simply radial and adds drag to parent part.

Something important to note though is that cargo/service bays act different than what that quote is referring to. Items inside a bay are checked for occlusion by the bay itself.
