It occurred for me after loading a craft that was labeled \u0022locked due to missing or invalid parts\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI distilled the bug down to some simple steps in STOCK ksp .90 and a video of it occurring. This happens in stock or modded installs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) create new career\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) accept some contracts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) in VAB, build something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) save, quit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) move a part that you are using on that craft out of the gamedata folder (I moved the entire mk1 pod folder)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) reload KSP, go back to VAB, load that craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) UI lockout. Buttons highlight but nothing happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Task manager- end task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) reload KSP. The contracts are no longer active but the advances they gave you remain in your funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t discount this one. If you had a contract that was hard to come by, with ships in flight heading toward these objectives, you will now have to wait for the contract to respawn. It looks like file corruption and could be frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first ran into it after updating a mod. I was hoping I could load the ship and delete the part and if I could not then I could live with rebuilding it... but I didn\u0027t expect my career file to go bad on me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee it in action \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/E8absC9MK84?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-17T19:57:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2015 07:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bmyers831\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
