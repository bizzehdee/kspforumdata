And what should I say: Yep. You can still do the same workaround. Now, I haven\u0027t tested this much, and some bugs and crashes certainly are still very common with this (for instance the left mouse button works as right mouse button when leaving the game thingy), but the game launches in 64 bit just fine for me. I haven\u0027t had many problems with previous (official or non-official) 64 bit versions of KSP, so this still might crash on start up for you. Also, should you try this I do not take any responsibility on any of the results of you doing so. You should really only try it if you use a bajillion mods, and run out of memory otherwise. There is no real advantage of 64 bit, other than the increased memory capabilities, so think twice if you need it. Also, PLEASE do not report any bugs you find in this workaround as bugs with the game. Squad had good reasons not to release a 64 bit version with 1.0, and I\u0027d like to keep the win64 bit discussion in this thread only. Please don\u0027t confuse Squad or modders with bugs that have nothing to do with what they are giving you.\n\nOK, so how do you do it:\n\nTry this on a separate install of KSP, or back up the game files before doing anything.\n\nYou\u0027ll need Unity version 4.6.4, which is the version KSP 1.0 uses. Download it from [https://unity3d.com/](https://unity3d.com/) and install it, since I can\u0027t redistribute the 2 files you\u0027ll need alone. After you installed it, go to the installation folder and to the path \u0022Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/windowsstandalonesupport/Variations/win64\\_nondevelopment\u0022\n\nThere you copy the \u0022player\\_win.exe\u0022 to the KSP folder, and rename it \u0022KSP.exe\u0022. You should backup the already existing KSP.exe before that.\n\nThen you also need to open \u0022Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/windowsstandalonesupport/Variations/win64\\_nondevelopment/Data/Mono\u0022 in the Unity install, and copy the \u0022mono.dll\u0022 to your KSP folder under \u0022KSP\\_Data/Mono\u0022. The mono.dll there should also be backed up before overwriting it.\n\nAnd boom, if you open your new KSP.exe, KSP will start in 64bit mode.\n\nNow, again: This will most certainly be buggy as hell and prone to crashes, so don\u0027t come running to squad or any mod creators if anything doesn\u0027t work with this hack. Nothing is supposed to work with this. Anything that does work is just pure luck.\n\nNow, a small list of notable things:\n\n-The \u0022left click is right click\u0022 issue after leaving the game is still a thing. Fixable by just right clicking once.\n\n-The bug with buildings appearing fully upgraded, but not working as such in career mode isn\u0027t consistent now. You sometimes get fully upgraded buildings on the KSC screen, but they change back to the actual tier they\u0027re on if you leave the to the main menu and go back into the save. Also sometimes if you just go into a building and go back out.\n\n-Screen transitions still have the inside view of e.g. the astronaut complex pop up for a few seconds sometimes, but that is just a visual bug that has no effect on gameplay.\n\n-Mods that used to disable themselves on the official x64 experimental builds, still do so in this workaround. (e.g. FAR, the toolbar still gives you Nyancat on the loading screen and the warning about you using 64 bit on windows, etc)\n\n(more to be added as people test this out)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T05:47:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 05:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WWEdeadman**\n  \nAdded full path of mono.dll file, since some people seem to have gotten confused"},{"CreatedByName":"Eddie Rod","CreatedById":107414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T23:18:17Z","Content":"Going to test this on 1.0.2 right now because 64 bit never gave me any major issues.
