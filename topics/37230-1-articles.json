The title of this challenge is Project Epsilon. The idea is complete control of the solar system by the United States of Kerbmerica, admistered by the Kerbol Space Program in 4 stages. For each completed stage by a participant, a rank will be awarded and their names added to the list of stage completion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESTAGE 1 Establish scientific research in the solar system:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut a probe with all the scientific sensors in orbit around every planet or moon in the solar system (100 pts) *mandatory for stage 1 completion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoptional: Put a research rover on a planet or moon (25 pts/per rover) *only one rover per celestial body counts for points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESTAGE 2 Establish Kerbmerican military authority around the solar system:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a stock light battle cruiser or fighter (with atleast one functional weapon \u0026amp; manned) in orbit around Eve, Kerbin, Duna, and Laythe (100pts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoptional: add MOAR military! 25 points for each additional planet or moon with military presence\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoptional: BIGGAR military! 50 points for every large military vessel anywhere interplanetary! (e.g., a large battleship, a carrier, a command ship, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESTAGE 3 There are 3 privately owned space initiatives who would like to subcontract their engineering, piloting, and mission control to KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor each contract that you complete, 100 points will be awarded. At least 1 contract must be completed to complete stage 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract #1: Brickden Mining Corp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50 points per mining vessel mission and return, mission comprises of landing on a planet with the mining vessel, and returning to Kerbol Space Center with the (yes, imaginary) resources. Mining vessel must have a hitchhiker storage container for the resources, and be of a medium size (loose interpretation, just dont make this think ridiculously small, and give it enough delta v that it could transport the resources)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract #2: Space Journey Travel Inc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, take at least 1 hitchhiker storage container with 3 Kerbals on a tour of as much of the solar system as you can. All Kerbals must return to Kerbol Space Center alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor entering Mun or Minmus SOI, 10 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor entering the SOI of any interplanetary celestial body, 25 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor landing on any celestial body, 50 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract #3: ET Awareness Group Inc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking for signs of extra terrestial life, probes must have at least 3 Communotron 88-88\u0027s (5 points per additional 88-88\u0027s per probe), and one Communotron 16 for relaying information back to Kerbol Space Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor each probe orbiting Kerbin, 10 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor each probe orbiting the Sun, 25 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor each probe orbiting the Sun in an orbit with a apoapsis and periapsis past that of Eeloo\u0027s apoapsis, 50 points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESTAGE 4 Colonization of the Solar System (100 pts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor every grounded colony of 3 or more Kerbols on the Mun or Minmus, 10 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor every grounded colony or 3 or more Kerbols on any interplanetary celestial body, 50 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMust have at least 3 colonies on separate celestial bodies to complete this stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor completion of all four stages, and therefore completion of Project Epsilon, 500 points and ridiculous bragging rights shall be awarded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
