Would you know of any way I could do this?\n\u003E \n\nWe messed around with using the angled fairing to stash payload but we would need to model a petal adapter in order to make it easy to get the payload out. Doing so with procedural fairings is problematic with the angle as well. It also looks a bit silly on orbit ( subjective )\n\nAs a compromise, we have the well developed *Orion Plus* **TM**  series of vehicles which include a habitat module tucked between the ICPS and Orion. You could stash all kinds of neat items in there because the fairing is procedural. Just make sure it has substantial node strength top and bottom. Also with these types of craft the staging can get pretty complicated in the VAB when you start making adjustments, it\u0027s very easy to loose track of which decoupler goes where in the staging order because as you separate and re assemble the craft, it can move them around, and they all look the same in the tree. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)\n\nIf you can wait a few minutes I\u0027m gonna put up a beta zip for 1.0.5B here which has a much improved Orion Plus series of craft files as well as the latest Orion revision which greatly improves stability while docking and also has a lower parts count.\n\nFrom a mission planning perspective, Chaka\u0027s flight rules tend to favour sending up Orion on it\u0027s own with the least complicated rocket possible for mission requirements, docking with the target spacecraft at the objective orbit.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nThat said, it can be done this way:\n\n![FKAKQT.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img921/327/FKAKQT.jpg)![bLa597.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img923/4125/bLa597.jpg)![St5QYa.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img923/4633/St5QYa.jpg)![rXd1j8.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img924/9475/rXd1j8.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-13T15:52:04Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2016 03:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET**"},{"CreatedByName":"mcirish3","CreatedById":50775,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T01:23:42Z","Content":"I would just like to say, Dang been a while since I have checked out this mod, very much looking totally awesome.

Its not a parts pack, but a craft files pack with the parts to make those crafts viable. It has a pretty large memory footprint, but provides you with multiple versions of the SLS rocket, the Delta IV rocket (called the Evolved Monkey Launch Vehicle, EMLV) and the Falcon 9 rocket (called the Advanced Monkey Launch Vehicle), as well as a huge array of payloads for these rockets, including Orion, two kinds of landers (for airless and atmosphere bodies), a couple space stations, a rover and multiple surface bases).\n\nYou can definitely make your own crafts with these parts, but the parts aren\u0027t at the same diameters as stock, so be aware of this"},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T04:10:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2/16/2016 at 9:51 AM, Budgie said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hello all on the CMES thread, long time no see.
