Collecting data doesn\u0027t seem productive enough to me and some other people, so I decided to make a short list of things that should be movable/replaceable by Kerbals.\n\n-Fuel pipes\n\n-Replacing/welding science equipment, solar panels and other small parts.\n\n-Placing/removing/connecting tethers\n\n-Playing golf, throwing hammers and feathers at other crew members for science\n\n-Connecting/disconnecting trusses\n\n-Sample examing and gathering animations and statistical data as their result (suggested by sumghai)\n\n-More (Suggest!)\n\nIn my opinion it would greatly help with space station assemblies and crisis situations, because when in danger and with limited supplies it is always good to tape stuff together and try going home.\n\nAs it is past 0:00 where I live and can\u0027t think of anything else I leave this thread to you to discuss and suggest more things that you think should be doable using the toolbox showed above.\n\nPardon me if this have already been suggested and feel free to merge/lock this thread if it is your will.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T22:01:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 10:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"baggers","CreatedById":143067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T23:54:18Z","Content":"Taking camera shots and selfies, maybe with a special idle animation for Kerbals in champ."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T00:03:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Taking camera shots and selfies, maybe with a special idle animation for Kerbals in champ.\n\nYes!
