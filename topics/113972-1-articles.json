One bug in 1.0.3 is that funky weird stuff happens if you switch to a vessel that A) has a heat shield, and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) was already launched before 1.0.3 was installed. Fixing that bug was the main reason for 1.0.4.\n\nIf you have no heat shields involved, then I have no idea.\n\nOne interesting test: If you just go back to the VAB and launch a new copy of that same station, do the lights explode when it\u0027s sitting on the pad, or not?\n\nIf not, this may just be some issue about 1.0.3 not playing nice with a ship that was already in flight at the time the patch was added. I got bitten by the heat-shield bug (had one craft on its way back from Minmus, went kablooie when I switched to it), and solved it as follows:\n\n1. Revert to a save I made shortly before my craft went kaboom. The game is fine, as long as I don\u0027t actually switch to that craft.\n\n2. \u0022Launch\u0022 (as in \u0022go to the launchpad\u0022, didn\u0027t actually take off) a new copy of that craft, do a named quicksave, and revert to VAB.\n\n3. Exit KSP. Copy persistent.sfs to persistent\\_copy.sfs (in case I screw something up).\n\n4. Open persistent\\_copy.sfs and the temporary quicksave in a text editor (I use Notepad\u002B\u002B)\n\n5. Find my stricken craft in persistent\\_copy.sfs, and the fresh-copy-sitting-on-the-pad in the temporary quicksave.\n\n6. Do some copy-and-paste (copy the craft from temporary quicksave, paste to persistent\\_copy.sfs). This needs some care and attention for some of the minor fiddly bits of the craft: need to preserve the original craft\u0027s ID, crew roster, orbital characteristics, science data, flight history, resource levels. So it involves a few minutes of finicky editing.\n\n7. Start up KSP, load persistent\\_copy, and go to my craft on its way home from Minmus.\n\nNo idea if that will help you with whatever\u0027s causing your problem, but it may be worth a try."},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T18:26:58Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had Cubic Octagonal Struts explode randomly as well, I opened my fairings and *poof*, there it went. I\u0027ve seen reports about low-mass parts not handling the heating system very well, so it appears to be a bug. Very little you can do on your end unfortunately, except perhaps file a bug report.\n\nWhat does the F3 flight report say? If it says that your strut exploded from overheating, then it\u0027s most like the same bug."}]}
