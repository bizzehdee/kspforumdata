One bug in 1.0.3 is that funky weird stuff happens if you switch to a vessel that A) has a heat shield, and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E was already launched before 1.0.3 was installed. Fixing that bug was the main reason for 1.0.4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have no heat shields involved, then I have no idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne interesting test: If you just go back to the VAB and launch a new copy of that same station, do the lights explode when it\u0027s sitting on the pad, or not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not, this may just be some issue about 1.0.3 not playing nice with a ship that was already in flight at the time the patch was added. I got bitten by the heat-shield bug (had one craft on its way back from Minmus, went kablooie when I switched to it), and solved it as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Revert to a save I made shortly before my craft went kaboom. The game is fine, as long as I don\u0027t actually switch to that craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u0022Launch\u0022 (as in \u0022go to the launchpad\u0022, didn\u0027t actually take off) a new copy of that craft, do a named quicksave, and revert to VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

Open persistent_copy.sfs and the temporary quicksave in a text editor (I use Notepad\u002B\u002B)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Find my stricken craft in persistent_copy.sfs, and the fresh-copy-sitting-on-the-pad in the temporary quicksave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Do some copy-and-paste (copy the craft from temporary quicksave, paste to persistent_copy.sfs). This needs some care and attention for some of the minor fiddly bits of the craft: need to preserve the original craft\u0027s ID, crew roster, orbital characteristics, science data, flight history, resource levels. So it involves a few minutes of finicky editing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Start up KSP, load persistent_copy, and go to my craft on its way home from Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo idea if that will help you with whatever\u0027s causing your problem, but it may be worth a try.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T18:26:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had Cubic Octagonal Struts explode randomly as well, I opened my fairings and \u003Cem\u003Epoof\u003C/em\u003E, there it went.
