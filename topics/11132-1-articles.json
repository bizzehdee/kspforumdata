I recieved no reply, but I take the following sentance to mean that he followed my advice to amend what the rule banning RP outside the closed RP forum meant [iE, forms of RPing that do not include wars and politics stay banned, but projects involving nations and corps may continue]:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor those of you wishing to run projects and the like, the Spacecraft Exchange is excellent for that, there\\\u0027s plenty of alternatives because KSP has such broad use, as for those that still wish to wage war and be independent after it killed off this forum; There are fan-owned sites now for this, be wary of their much greater lack of rules, though.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe quote recommends the Spacecraft Exchange. However, for some topics this may not be the best forum. For instance, my \u003Cem\u003EIbis X2\u003C/em\u003E disaster thread was posted in General Discussion, as the topic was a disaster involving a spaceplane, not the spaceplane itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe definition of In Character Discussion is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A topic is set for the discussion. This may be a disaster, a project, or simply an informative text. Should be something that happened in KSP, or be about something you are doing/going to do in KSP. Should not be war/politics based.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Users proceed to discuss the topic In Character, hence the name. Characters straight from RP can be used, although the conflicts of RP should not be mentioned. This is to prevent competition between users - this is what I view to be the primary cause of RP\\\u0027s problems. That people couldn\\\u0027t make the distinction between IC and OOC was the issue, but that would have been much harder to solve. OOC should be kept to explanations about what you have said, or are not saying because, for instance your character doesn\\\u0027t know it. Again, should not be war/politics based.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-As Ascensiam\\\u0027s post says, \u0027the failure to unite and agree is the main cause,\u0027 so ICDs should be about altruism and working toward the common goal - the Kerbal Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be discussed in this thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether ICD is actually a better alternative to RP as we knew it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts potential effectiveness for providing RP that is flaming-free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether my interpretation of the rules is correct or misguided.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether, if my interpretation \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E misguided, ICD should go ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat should not be said/mentioned/reffered to in ICD in order to prevent competition between users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether ICD threads should be tagged with \\\u0027[iCD]\\\u0027 for easier reference, and to make it easier for the mods to locate these threads. RP has had trouble, and simply my saying \\\u0027don\\\u0027t do it\\\u0027 here won\\\u0027t stop people. Obviously this means ICD threads would be more prone to RP arguments, even if that is not my intention in putting the idea forward, and such arguments would need to be stopped before they develop into flame wars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe distinction between an argument and a debate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether, if seeing as topics regarding war are banned in ICDs, a Spacecraft Exchange thread about a warcraft your corp made would be ICD or just normal RP. It would be set out the same way, after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour general opinions on In Character Discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERedDwarfIV\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ping111","CreatedById":8679,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T18:33:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this.
