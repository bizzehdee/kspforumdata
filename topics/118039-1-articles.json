I was curious what is the ceiling of your white knight? I\u0027m having issues with scaled down engines getting above 1,500 - 2,000M which in turn limits Spaceship One\u0027s ceiling. Also I was able to get the tilt wing working on mine if you would like the craft I\u0027d be more than happy to share.\n\n(It\u0027s not finished but is very close)\n\n[![screenshot1_zpscjj87trs.png~original](http://i1077.photobucket.com/albums/w475/v8jester1/KSP%20Spaceship%20One/screenshot1_zpscjj87trs.png~original)](http://s1077.photobucket.com/user/v8jester1/media/KSP%20Spaceship%20One/screenshot1_zpscjj87trs.png.html)\n\nedit:\n\nWow, I just had a realization.... It\u0027s got to be air starvation. I only have two intakes on it and it very quickly looses power as I climb. That must be my issue. I\u0027ll ad more intakes when I get home and see if that\u0027s my issue. Guess the ceiling of the real plane was 16k meters, with a ceiling of 112K meters for SS1, so that\u0027s what I\u0027m aiming to replicate.\n\nAgain, Really great work on your replica. the wing design on your SS1 lead me in a whole new direction I hadn\u0027t thought of before. Thanks for the great ideas.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T20:57:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 08:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by V8jester**"},{"CreatedByName":"Angorek","CreatedById":98069,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T22:11:17Z","Content":"Thanks again ! \n\nVery nice craft !

It reached 7km over the mountains and it seemed to be maximum. \n\nAlso I used only a little fuel in SS1, i think something around 25-30%, and it reached 95km.

Thanks for all the inspiration. So I wound up using more mods in mine so props to you for needing less than I did. I also Think you used fewer parts so mine will be a bit of a memory hog at 150 compared to yours. I Also Cheated with the engines by clipping in a second set of engines so it can climb like crazy now.\n\nMods Used:\n\nAdjustable Landing Gear\n\nB9\n\nB9 Procedural Wings\n\nProcedural Parts\n\nTweakscale\n\nInfernal Robotics\n\nIR Rework\n\nKW Rocketry\n\nMechjeb\n\nQuantum Struts Continued\n\nDownload: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8xWfykJ5pY_Qjdzay14RzZLa2s/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8xWfykJ5pY_Qjdzay14RzZLa2s/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[![screenshot16_zpsbwimogzd.png~original](http://i1077.photobucket.com/albums/w475/v8jester1/KSP%20Spaceship%20One/screenshot16_zpsbwimogzd.png~original)](http://s1077.photobucket.com/user/v8jester1/media/KSP%20Spaceship%20One/screenshot16_zpsbwimogzd.png.html)\n\n[![screenshot7_zpsvdlimkaw.png~original](http://i1077.photobucket.com/albums/w475/v8jester1/KSP%20Spaceship%20One/screenshot7_zpsvdlimkaw.png~original)](http://s1077.photobucket.com/user/v8jester1/media/KSP%20Spaceship%20One/screenshot7_zpsvdlimkaw.png.html)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T19:27:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 07:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by V8jester**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T06:11:17Z","Content":"Very nice!
