However when I eventually got them both into the correct orbits only one was registered as being successful \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E, it seems to be because only one probe core was considered to be in \u0022command\u0022, even after I had decoupled them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo even though I had a probe in the second specific orbit, the one that had been in command when launched was in the first specific orbit. Maybe I\u0027ve just been stupid and there\u0027s a way to remedy this, if so, I\u0027d love some suggestions! If not I really think it should be programmed in that more than one command module can be launched.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T16:52:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can definitely send multiple sats up in one launch.
