Use MJ to warp until your plane matches the moon\u0027s, then launch East and make a slight dogleg during second stage burn to cut relative inclination below 0.5 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for FX, remove hotrockets and install RealPlume (which RO highly recommends).

I launch a satellite into a common parking orbit (400km is my usual) that matches the solar plane as close as possible, which I then use as a reference when launching (that is something you can use target inclination reference with). Admittedly it\u0027s pretty crude but I fly manually and I like that sort of thing. The timing sat can also be used for exploratory maneuver nodes, especially with help from a launch window planner of some sort (the plugin version is gold). Once my craft is in a parking orbit with help from the timing sat I set up transfer just like with stock, although burns tend to be longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmittedly my space programs are crude, brute-force affairs, but without resorting to automation that\u0027s the easiest way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBring plenty of hypergolics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE: Oh, should mention, when I launch my timing sat I launch from Kourou, typically the easiest place to line up with the solar plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T05:35:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 05:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T00:39:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@NathanKell\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!

I actually figured out how to match the Moon\u0027s orbit using KER while launching a Lunar Inclination Reference probe. That seems like the way to go.
