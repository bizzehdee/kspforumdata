This seems somewhat incongruous with the ISS\u0027s price tag of 150 billion dollars.

It has a similar habitable volume as the core of Mir, and with modifications it could have life support, power, and plenty of other stuff. Plus, it already has quite a lot of berthing ports, and using other modules that are similar to the adapted Unity Node (AUN?), minus the birthing ports on some sides, we could have quite an \u0022FGB\u0022.

So not too much modification there. An MPLM could be used as well, although it would probably need to be modified more heavily to operate on its own. As for the core, some kind of Tranquility node derivative would probably work. Most of our existing ISS modules are based off of the MPLM in one way or another, which makes sense when you realize the MPLM was designed to fit in the Shuttle\u0027s cargo bay. But anything we build in the future will probably be descended from the MPLM as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit in response to your second edit: A modified Unity node would work great as a core. If we setup some kind of automated docking system like the Russians have, we might not even need the Canadarm. An arm might be useful for unloading cargo, but something like the Strela cranes could be used instead. For the cargo block, we have a lot of options. Modified AUN, upgraded ATV, modified MPLM, or maybe even a straight up FGB if the Russians will sell some to us.

Now to throw in my two cents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStation programs, especially the ones that keep on going for a long length of time like ISS, are dominated by mostly two things, logistics and operations costs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOperations costs, like Nibb says, are basically keeping the small horde of managers and engineers that support ISS operations fed and clothed, and driving nice cars and the like. This is not often spoken of, but I gather there are huge inefficiencies here in the ISS program due to its multinational nature. Not to mention that due to its scientific purpose and the fact that it\u0027s still one of the firsts stations ever built, it is reasonable to expect it being inherently more expensive than any follow-on that benefits from the experience of this program. For example, a hypothetical \u0022commercial\u0022 successor to the ISS could use a single ground control center with fewer, more efficiently distributed managerial personnel, get communication coverage through satellite links instead of costly to maintain ground stations, and keep in the payroll a much smaller engineering department if it used hardware with a significant heritage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second big ticket expenditure are the logistics of the thing: resupply and crew rotations, basically. There you have much more rocket launches than for the construction part (if your program is successful, at least), and a big unit price on the rockets will quickly be felt in the bottom line (shuttle, I\u0027m looking at you). There, too, we can expect a big decrease from the ISS figure in future stations, perhaps an even more dramatic one, mostly because the new rockets are not only going to be much cheaper than shuttle, we can also expect them to be cheaper than traditional rockets, now that we are moving away form cold war designs with an eventual promise of at least partial (useful) reusability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
