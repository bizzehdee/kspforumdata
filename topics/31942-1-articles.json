GEO is at ~39,000 kms, while KEO is at ~2,800. As you can probably guess by now, the relative difference in orbit is much less in the case of LEO than if you had two orbits in KSP separated a couple hundred kilometers. Try more like 1/10 to scale distances (very, very roughly, as in completely inaccurate scientifically, but good rule of thumb)... this would turn out to be the rough equivalent of chasing a ~100km station form a ~80km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
