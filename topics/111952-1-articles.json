I dont want players to be able to see the changes unless going to the planets and moons first. It would be too easy. Is there a way to prevent people from cycling through the objects in the tracking station? For example, in order to view duna they could only do it by switching to a vessel that is nearby. \n\nThank you."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T13:22:10Z","Content":"This may help : [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121268-How-to-hide-planets-orbits-in-the-tracking-station?p=1940092#post1940092](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121268-How-to-hide-planets-orbits-in-the-tracking-station?p=1940092#post1940092)"}]}
