Both sides were, understandably, worried about that, since they would consist of nothing more than a strategic warhead strapped to a simple guidance system, a communications system (to receive \u0022attack\u0022 commands and target information) and a retro-rocket with a hell of a lot of delta-V; such a setup could be used to launch an attack with only about five minutes warning time (if that) by cancelling most of the weapon\u0027s orbital velocity and, either simultaneously or sequentially, thrusting radially *down* towards Earth to boost vertical speed and shorten/steepen the entry, sort of like the \u0022stop then drop\u0022 technique of landing on certain small bodies in KSP. First warning would be when the engine fires; five minutes isn\u0027t enough time for detection, confirmation, and getting the message TO the National Command Authority, much less getting a command for a retaliatory strike to the targeted forces. (Alternatively, it could be used for a \u0022decapitation\u0022 strike, since the NCA wouldn\u0027t be able to get a warning in time to flee or even shelter in place.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Soviets then promptly proceeded to develop and test a system that skirted the very edge of the OST, the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System. Basically, it was a missile that launched a weapon into space, then deorbited it on the first pass over the target rather than staying on-orbit as an alert weapon--this would allow them to launch an attack over the \u003Cem\u003Esouthern\u003C/em\u003E polar region instead of the northern one, thus bypassing the US\u0027s early-warning systems, which were all oriented to warn of an attack over the North Pole, the shortest route. Theoretically, FOBS would avoid violating the OST because it was going to have the warhead fly less than one full orbit and could thus be argued to be a \u0022suborbital\u0022 system; the Soviets, however, to make sure they didn\u0027t violate the OST (and to help preserve secrecy) tested it with inert warheads rather than live ones, officially described as \u0022research satellites.\u0022 (The OST only prohibited actually putting nuclear weapons into orbit; it didn\u0027t prohibit developing systems that COULD put them into orbit--largely because at the time, the difference between an ICBM and a satellite launcher was the weight of the payload and the trajectory fed to the guidance system.) Apparently, many of the Soviets\u0027 \u0022failed\u0022 satellite launches in the 1960s and 1970s that all flew a partial orbit and then re-entered were actually FOBS tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFOBS weapons, and all other orbital WMDs, were prohibited by the 1979 SALT II treaty, which prohibited developing or deploying systems used to put WMDs into orbit, not just the weapons themselves--thus making everyone breathe a lot easier about polar satellite launches, because there\u0027s plenty of satellites that require polar orbits, and this means that you just have to launch southward instead of northward and everyone will quickly realize it\u0027s a satellite launch they\u0027re seeing, not an attack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T14:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ShachonianX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ShachonianX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s human nature.
