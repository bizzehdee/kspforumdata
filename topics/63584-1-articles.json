I get the craft spinning really really fast, and decople at the right moment... my lander gets a lower perapsis, my interplanetary stage gets a higher perapsis, it saves a little delta-V.... it sort of exploits the unrealistic reaction wheels (you can only spin them so fast before you can\u0027t spin them any faster and break them, so you\u0027d need to use RCS while the reaction wheel decelerates to \u0022reset\u0022 it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my Duna mission yesterday, I had a ~16 km perapsis on my 2nd aerobreaking go-around, and had the desired apoapsis, and wanted to raise the interplanetary stage\u0027s perapsis (to take it out of the atmosphere), and lower the lander\u0027s (to put it deeper in), so I spun up the craft, and released the lander... the lander was flung off and enfed up with a ~7.5 km perapsis, I forgot what my IP\u0027s perapsis was changed to, but it was higher, and I burned to raise it to 43km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander\u0027s trajectory was acceptable for its landing site (It went a little farther than I wanted, but oh well), and no additional burn was needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I haven\u0027t read about anyone else doing this... is it just me? have other people had the idea, but the delta-V savings are too small to be relevant? is it too cheezy to \u0022exploit\u0022 the reaction wheels in this way?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T12:18:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou use RCS to spin the craft - instead of using RCS to change its orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use spinning sometimes to get a clear separation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T13:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried doing this to get my spent lift stage to fall back into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere so it doesn\u0027t stick around as space junk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MonkeyFuzz","CreatedById":32494,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T13:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll do this occasionally just before reentry to fling the capsule away from its service module.
