That being said, whether it purifies the water or not, a greenhouse should be a consumer of water and not a producer. Based off my extremely limited experience growing plants, it would be waste, carbon dioxide, water, and electricity as inputs and you\u0027d get food, oxygen, and waste water as outputs, with the system loss being less water output than input and a very low level of food generation, something on the order of 0.75L - 1L / day (using the new system and still and probably will always be working on human values).\u003Cp\u003EWhy such a low number? This is because the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.permies.com/t/12422/intentional-community/Amount-land-person\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is quoted on this page\u003C/a\u003E as stating that the absolute minimum land required to sustain one person is about 0.07 hectares, which works out to 700m. Assuming a standard 2.5m x 5m greenhouse, you\u0027re presented with 39.2699m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 of surface on which to grow, which I\u0027m going to say could be made into 80m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 by using the outer walls as well as an inner growth structure. That 80m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 comes out to about 11.5% of the 700m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 minimum, meaning that a single part of this type should provide about 11.5% of the food intake for a single CM-d. I\u0027d say there is a little leeway here for advanced aeroponics horticulture techniques, but the ultimate result is that you\u0027d need at least 9 2.5m x 5m greenhouses to realistically support a single person.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all isn\u0027t to say that a greenhouse or two wouldn\u0027t be a great addition to a long duration mission. The reality is that it would be a great CO2 scrubber as well as providing at least some supplemental food. In addition, if this or any other mod starts tracking kerbal general well being, the inclusion of some greenery should have a positive effect on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBioremediation of wastewater to purify and remove pollutants using plants is a well known function of ecosystem, and is in fact well used in living machines. Many plant types can break down pollution using either photosynthesis or other biological processes. Bacteria play an important role as well.
