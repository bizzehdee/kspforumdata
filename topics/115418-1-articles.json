I see many system resizes do this, but don\u0027t really know how they come up wit the height for the atmosphere. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T13:46:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the first thing I can come up with would be to say: you doubled Kerbin\u0027s radius, go double its atmosphere height too. That would preserve the stock ratio. It\u0027ll result in a very tall atmosphere though (the stock atmosphere for Kerbin is incredibly tall for its size, compared to Earth).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second thing I can come up with is to look up common definitions for \u0022Earth\u0027s atmosphere ends at height x\u0022 and take that as a reference model. Earth is 11x as large as Kerbin. If you define that Earth\u0027s atmosphere ends at, I dunno, 200km, then on a 5x stock scale Kerbin it should be set at 5/11th of 200km to replicate Earth\u0027s atmosphere scale (that\u0027s about 91km, by the way). For small Kerbins, this results in atmospheres \u003Cem\u003Eshorter\u003C/em\u003E than 70km, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T14:44:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do not think atmosphere scale directly to planet scale otherwise I have 700km atmosphere on 10x kerbin \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E.
