Anyway, it seems like promising for travelling around on dangerous terrain, though seems like it would be limited to using RTG for power only, since I doubt solar panels like being rolled around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T06:16:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInspired by Weighted Companion Cube.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHearts are required on every face for proper usage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T12:43:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EInspired by Weighted Companion Cube.\u003Cp\u003EHearts are required on every face for proper usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking of the creative reaction wheels in KSP, all know the tricks of using an command pod and some material labs and goo and then go rolling around on the space center for cheap science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T13:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was thinking of the creative reaction wheels in KSP, all know the tricks of using an command pod and some material labs and goo and then go rolling around on the space center for cheap science.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECubli cube looks very close too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_6p-1J551Y?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T19:49:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is awesome !
