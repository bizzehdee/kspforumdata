Whenever my Kerbal goes EVA from the Mk1, instead of clinging tightly to the hatch ladder like he always has in the past, he either gently floats away from the hatch or is flung violently into space. Then I have to navigate him back to the hatch again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have serous difficulties getting my EVA\u0027ed Kerbal back to the hatch, and I am hoping someone can help me with this. Suppose Jeb has floated half a meter away from the hatch and I just need to inch him forward a bit to get back in the pod. I haven\u0027t figured out an easy way to do this. As soon as I hit R to turn on his jet pack, the Kerbal suddenly reorients himself to face some arbitrary direction (which usually moves him farther away from the hatch in the process). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I recall correctly, in previous versions pressing W would move him \u0022forward\u0022 with respect to the current camera angle. So, I used to be able to just point the camera in the direction I wanted the Kerbal to go and tap W to orient him in that direction. But the game doesn\u0027t seem to be working that way anymore. Instead, it seems that there is some kind of absolute orientation now that is independent of the camera angle, and the WASD keys move the Kerbal relative to that absolute orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this, I usually have to navigate my Kerbal back to the hatch using this unnatural orientation. This means that when he eventually gets back to the hatch he is usually facing an odd direction. Then, as soon as I press F to grab the hatch ladder, he flings himself around and flies off into space again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought it might have something to do with having obstacles close to the hatch, but it still does this even if I only have an Mk16 parachute on the top of the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else experienced these issues, and what do I do about it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeff\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-01T04:42:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2014 04:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by jwilhite\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnswered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T22:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a known issue.
