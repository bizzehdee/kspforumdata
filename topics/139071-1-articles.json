I loaded up ksp as I would always, clicking into my steam library and clicking play full of excitement for what I had planned. When it has fully booted, I was met with the title screen. After that, I located the start game button and clicked it. After, I selected \u0027Resume Saved\u0027. Now, this is when it hit me that something was horribly wrong! All the save files were gone. I was quite used to these things that I like to call \u0027One Time Bugs\u0027 if I fix it with\u00A0a reboot, so I closed down my ksp and launched it again. After going back to the \u0027Resume Saved\u0027, they were still gone. But this time, I clicked out of the menu and then tried to click back in to see if this affected it (Not closing the program down ). When I was met by the start game menu, I clicked \u0027Resumed saved\u0027. Nothing happened. There colour changed, but that was pretty much it. At this , I was getting quite worried so, rebooted my PC to see if that helped. This had no effect. Then I checked my save files via my PC files. Surprisingly enough, they were all there. I spent a few days tinkering with my ksp to try and get it to work to no avail. So, I moved my save files to my back up folder and deleted ksp. Then I reinstalled it via steam. This again, did not work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere, you will find my specs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows 10\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4GB
