I\u0027ve looked at the error info and most of them are something about mono.dll and some are for the KSP.exe itself. Sometimes it\u0027ll give the windows error notice that KSP has stopped working, but more often than not, it\u0027ll just outright CTD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a whole bunch of them zipped into this file here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://sta.sh/0mhwd1myz16\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sta.sh/0mhwd1myz16\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 8.1 64bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 0.90\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 Aerospace (though the version before the one released a few days ago, should check that, just saw a couple min ago that there was an update) Edit: Now it\u0027s updated to 5.2.8, will have to see if there are crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb2 2.4.2 dev build 381\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb extension for NEAR \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60933\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60933\u003C/a\u003E This was after the crashes were happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENEAR 1.3.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock part revamp 1.6 (unless theres been an update since Dec 19th)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHangar mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933-0-90-0-Hangar-v2-0-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933-0-90-0-Hangar-v2-0-2\u003C/a\u003E Edit: The problems seem to have started after I installed the hangar mod, but theres also an update, so it\u0027s updated as of right now, version 2.0.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Attachment System 0.4.10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Apparently there were a few that weren\u0027t updated.
