Single-Axis Tracking**  \n\nDual axis will have issues of clipping the radiators bases on the spacing of the components.\n\nStation modules really dont use much power in the current state of the game. The solar arrays will definitely be overkill for stock, so there might not be much loss in only having tracking in one axis. electrical usage isnt persistent when the vessel isnt active either, so there is no issues with power loss when crafts are on-rails.\n\nAlpha rotary joints can be docking ports, and if you feel like giving the panels a different angle, just un-dock the truss sections and re-dock (the rotary joints/docking ports will have locking offsets of 30 degrees). With the possibility of IR, you wouldn\u0027t need to un-dock, and just rotate with a button click.\n\n**2. All-In-One Truss Segments**  \n\nP6 truss, solar array, and radiator are a single part and rotate together. same goes with P4/5 and its associated solar array and radiator. not sure of something like that is possible, having both a 2-axis solar panel as well as a single axis radiator. only parts that wouldn\u0027t rotate are the docking ports joining them together and the one attachment to the P1 truss.\n\nBack to recent progress, looks like I might have something for you all this weekend. Kibo interior will be a bit spartan for the time being, as IVAs/Props are pretty time-consuming (all work and no play, etc...) and the trusses will be my \u0022break\u0022 from them for a while. Though I might squeeze in a prop or 2 here or there during the next phase of this mod just to liven up some of the IVAs.\n\n![gylNmmc.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/gylNmmc.png?1)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-21T18:12:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2016 06:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by cxg2827**\n  \ntypo"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyMeToTheMinmus","CreatedById":133119,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T19:26:21Z","Content":"Looking good!"},{"CreatedByName":"StarStreak2109","CreatedById":118557,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T11:29:14Z","Content":"Looking forward to the trusses and solar / radiator panels!
