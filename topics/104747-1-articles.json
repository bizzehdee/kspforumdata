In the real world, a nominally empty tank that has not been inerted or purged is a high risk for explosions due to the residual fuel vapour often being present in a fuel:air ratio which is excellent for producing an explosion. A full fuel tank, on the other hand, is much less likely to explode until the contents are vaporised and mixed with air or an oxidiser. In real world physics, a high energy impact often sets up the perfect circumstances for a subsequent explosion due to the vaporisation created in the impact. Half filled, and you can have the worst of both worlds, with a nicely explosive fuel:air mix above the fuel, and plenty of bulk fuel to subsequently vaporise and make things bigger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVapour explosions in slack or empty tanks are a very real concern in the aerospace industry, although the level of risk, and the need for inerting systems is still under debate around 20 years after the loss of TWA800. A320s and 747s have been identified as having a higher than typical risk, and flagged for \u0022early action\u0022, but mostly inerting systems are only common on military aircraft. In a perfect world, they would all have inerting systems, but the real world is forced to accept that it\u0027s acceptable for the tanks to be potential bombs, due to the frequency of failure being sufficiently low. Next time you\u0027re sitting on a plane, contemplate for a moment that by the time you\u0027re half way through the flight, both wings are in a perfect condition to catastrophically explode from the tiniest of sparks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom lumps of metal, on the other hand, sure they should not explode with a big fireball. That said, it\u0027s a game, I see nothing wrong with just having everything explode with fire and smoke, unless the game gets a new mechanic where it actually matters in terms of consequences whether or not something would really tend to explode.
