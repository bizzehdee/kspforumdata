I could even see the possibility of limiting the mirroring to relative-positioning only, so as to eliminate the issue of the follower trying to retreat from the parent craft when the parent is trying to dock while under the influence of other forces. This way, one could make a series of rockets/vessels that launch separately, but in sync with each other, and then dock while under power once gravity is less persistent and combine their thrust for more advanced stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m unsure how this could be done however.
