Sometimes when you plant the flag it\u0027s your custom selection, sometimes it\u0027s the KSP flag. Once today, I landed and planted a flag on the Mun, then saved my game and closed out for a while. When I came back and reloaded my save, the flag I had planted was still there but it was the KSP default rather than my specific flag, which HAD appeared correctly before I saved my game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
