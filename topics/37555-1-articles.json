Hard to explain.. For instance looking at the say Saturn V separations. The bit that is being ejected covered the next engine sequence.. So as i am building my rocket i don\u0027t wish to see the whole engine beel sitting otop of the fuel tank.

Put that on the bell first and the game will generate a fairing for it; then you can stick whatever else you\u0027d like underneath. Even if you don\u0027t stick anything underneath, the fairing still gets generated - then it\u0027s just a matter of setting up your staging so that all the decouplers fire at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
