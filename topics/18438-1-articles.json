While learning about science i noticed that 99% of the material is in english and since my day time job is an english teacher/translator, im doing my best to combine teaching english with some interesting science facts. As many ppl do i dream about going to space and some time ago i picked up Orbiter but since im married and have children and a job i didint have enough time to learn it all and i had to drop it. But now ( like a year ago) i discovered KSP and have been playing the demo for quite some time and lately i bought the game. So i just wanted to say hi to the entire community and inform that i will try to make youtube videos about kerbal space program where i hope to not only entertain but also explain the space mechanics ( learning them as i go). I wish all of you guys good look and i hope that you will support me in the future with the youtube and the craft designs im gonna try to post here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReNe\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T14:50:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ReNe","CreatedById":21672,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T17:05:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethx a lot \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
