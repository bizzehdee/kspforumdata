It seems despite my calculations, I didn\u0027t really think they were really just over two feet tall. In other words the Kerbals are much smaller than I originally anticipated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo offense to Squad, but that\u0027s a really difficult character scale to work with, specially the when you take into account the gnomish leg and arm proportions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZRM has done a more than outstanding job on this project. He\u0027s been really patient with all my nit picking. The best part is that we should soon have the scale issue nailed down. It involves doing some minor adjustments to the seats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, I think it may be best if we collapse the lift vehicle into the first phase. I know this may delay the actual shuttle out, but it would give you guys a proper configuration that ZRM can tune.
