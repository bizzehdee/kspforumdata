However, that does not mean you should get them all. First off, getting mods before learning to play the stock version is going to overwhelm you a lot for the ones who require expertise, and distract you for the ones who don\u0027t . Also, you should probably be really working on a budget when downloading mods, for - in contrast to games like Minecraft- KSP mods can put a real strain to your computer. And finally, just because there are not really bad mods, that doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll like then all in the long run. Even though quality is not a concern, your criteria should be realism- as there are many mods out there that do the same thing, but at varying levels of realism, ease of use and gameplay balance. Your personal view on how much of each you want is the only real judge when you choose mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanBros","CreatedById":151732,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T18:51:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, enjoy your stay!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T19:24:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fubarbrickdust\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fubarbrickdust\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks again for the warm welcome guys \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Yeah, I\u0027m already finding the community pretty cool, and that\u0027s just after a few days...Thumbs up!\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the suggestions, guys - I did give those a shot but to be fair I found them a bit overwhelming when coming straight off the bat.
