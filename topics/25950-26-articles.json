Stage 2 should start with a TWR of about 0.8 (this low TWR means stage 1 must exit with a large time to Apo to allow stage 2 to burn fuel and raise its TWR) rising to 1.9 when stage 2 exits your Apo should be in vacuum leaving stage 3 to circularise. As you can see, TWR 1 for stage 2 is about the 75% fuel remaining point. Stage 3 has a very low TWR of 0.5-0.7 and is meant for orbital maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Apollo_8_acceleration.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022Apollo_8_acceleration.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing telemachus you can get a graph very similar to the one above.
