This new and improved Tunguska has the same guns as before, but now the Missile launchers are not ornamental.  They now fire actual real live PEW missiles. To make this happen I have created one new missile the 57E6 short range radar guided anti aircraft missile and have modified slightly the ATAKA anti tank missile in order for it to also be fired. The missile launchers consist of 8 tubes in 2 banks of for, and in both function guns Or Missiles the turret is fully functional in both pitch and yaw. Apologies to those expecting the fully active  Bradley , it\u0027s simply not yet reliable enough to include, but it should be soon\n\nOther points of interest, the above Logo is part of the new Agency, and you can now select PEW parts by manufacturer, rather than scrabbling through the 200 parts in the BDAc category\n\n![bY7aHBb.png](http://i.imgur.com/bY7aHBb.png)\n\nThere may be bugs , there may be un found problems, we gave it a good shot at catching them all, but we can\u0027t think of every single eventuality especially after weeks and weeks of part and cfg bashing, it all gets a bit fuzzy.\n\nSo be nice, if there\u0027s a problem that\u0027s easily fixed I\u0027ll try to get it sorted ASAP, but as is the fashion these days and something I support, if you don\u0027t make a sensible bug or error report, I\u0027ll ignore it, so things like \u0022 X dont do Y fix it\u0022 will not get you anywhere,  Likewise failure to supply a log and if possible steps to reproduce your problem, will also result in no acknowledgement of your issue\n\n[Another link to the download just in case you missed the first](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3i9kfqjb8gxilk5/P.E.W_R11.zip?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-12T10:05:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2016 10:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SpannerMonkey(smce)**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thatdude253","CreatedById":140179,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-15T00:42:43Z","Content":"YAAAAAAY, CIWS FOR EVERYONE!"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolski","CreatedById":169263,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-05T17:53:33Z","Content":"It would be realy cool to see a m163 vulcan turret and a simple turret for IR anti air missiles"}]}
