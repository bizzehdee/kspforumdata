But if you know some French like I do, you\u0027ll find there are a lot of flaws there as well (I believe the rules in French are even harder to grasp), such as having to write/pronounce a word a certain way based upon if you\u0027re addressing a friend, a parent, using the pronouns you, he/she, and we, etc. Rules like these are simple not needed. With my language design, you don\u0027t have prefixes or suffixes, mostly what I call \u0022daughter definers\u0022 (a temporary name as well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are a few examples.

This is similar to French, how some adjectives follow after the noun. You\u0027ll also see that you no longer need to know all the potential future/past tense forms of a word, something very tedious to learn otherwise (like when to add -ed, has, etc.). I have also replaced all timing things with the words present, past, and future. These words themselves can be modified, should you want, to clarify.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will walk my dog in 10 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI walk(future(10 minutes)) dog(I).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll notice here dog(I).

Very common words would tend to retain the tense and count inflections appropriate to the language they were borrowed from, while less common words would acquire inflexions from other languages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo \u0022child/children\u0022 retains a count inflection appropriate to Anglo-Saxon, \u0022wheel/wheels\u0022 uses a count inflection borrowed from German (iirc), and \u0022radius/radii\u0022 uses a Latin count inflection. Similarly, very common verbs tend to retain the tenses appropriate to their parent language. Rarer words tended to get shackled with the most common word-endings regardless of their parent language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this quagmire of inflexions, a great many have been dropped: almost all the root languages use(d) different inflections for the subject and object of a sentence, but this practice became extremely rare in English and has finally died out now that \u0022who/whom\u0022 has vanished. (\u0022Tell me, who struck whom?\u0022 \u0022I know not who landed the blow, nor whom was struck.\u0022) Similarly, we have dropped person from verbs, so where Latin had \u0022amo, amas, amat, amatus, amatis, amant\u0022 we have \u0022I love, you love, he loves, we love, you love, they love\u0022 - we reduced it all to just \u0022love/loves\u0022 and associate the verb with a noun or pronoun to sort out the person.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has made English very much more dependant on word order - in Early English (Anglo-Saxon) it was possible to reorder a sentence and keep the same meaning just so long as each word retained its endings, and this was often done in poetry. In English, it is easy to change the meaning of a sentence by small variations, and is something that trips up newcomers to English quite badly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the plus side, it has made it extremely easy for English to import and adopt words from other languages. We may not be able to pronounce them in a way recognisable to users of their parent languages, but they don\u0027t get swamped by inflections that fight their native spelling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T00:51:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOP: You funny fella.
