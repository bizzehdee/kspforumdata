It would be extremely nice and very helpful, if when we go to open a ship design in either the SPH or the VAB, that there was a way to create \u0022folders\u0022 within the select ship dialogue. So if there are three variants of the P-1 \u0022Snowy Owl,: such as a P-1, P-1A, and a P-1C, that we had the option to put all three within a folder that we could name \u0022P-1 and variants.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother suggestion that I have is for the menu where we keep sub-assemblies. It would nice we could also use folders here as well. Another thing that I\u0027ve noticed in 0.23 is that there are no scroll bars or next/back arrows in the sub-assembly menu that I\u0027ve noticed, so if you have an absurd amount of sub-assemblies, you would not be able to view them all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T15:52:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYES, folders would be SOOOOO helpful! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso with a picture when you mouse over the craft in the list. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAND maybe an Icon to indicate if it has Mod parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe whole ship organization thing could use some padding out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T15:59:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFolders have been suggested almost to death, and it\u0027s hoped that squad will take notice of the demand and give it to us.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T17:00:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Capt Snuggler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Capt Snuggler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso with a picture when you mouse over the craft in the list. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree, I have thought of a tiny picture beside (on the left) vehicle name, kind of part icon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
