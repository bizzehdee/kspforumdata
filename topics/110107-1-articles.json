What the hell is going on here??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this an know issue with version 1.02? Why havent Squad said anything about this? I have waited so long for Squad to sort things out and we are taking steps backwards..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Unity 5 will improve things hopefully but we are talking 6 months at least.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how can I check if its my PC or KSP?
