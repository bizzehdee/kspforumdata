And what was especially strange was that one of the four was about 40ft in the air, instead of on the pad.\n\nSo what governs this? Why is it \u0022not all the time\u0022? Why don\u0027t they stick around to be recovered for money?"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T12:31:22Z","Content":"They\u0027re counted as debris after they\u0027re detached - if you have debris set to zero or you go over that number, they could disappear (I\u0027m under the impression that the debris delete system is an LRU design but I could be mistaken about that -- if it is LRU, they shouldn\u0027t disappear for a while, unless you\u0027re really spamming the debris..). Also, if you launch something without clamps after that launch, they\u0027ll be auto-recovered silently by the game, leaving the pad free of clamps.."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T13:20:00Z","Content":"Try checking the KSP Debug toolbar, you bring it up by alt-F2."},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T15:01:39Z","Content":"Do you have any mods installed that might remove debris left on Kerbin, e.g. StageRecovery?

This is probably what you\u0027re experiencing with the launch clamps.\n\nFor example, I do a lot of Apollo-style Munar landings with a lander that comes down in two stages and leaves with one. The remaining stage is technically debris, but it\u0027s also \u0022landed on the Mun\u0022 so the game doesn\u0027t delete it.\n\nI quite like this feature because it means I can leave more than just a flag at each landing site."},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T17:49:14Z","Content":"I added automatic launch clamp recovery to StageRecovery around the 0.90 release (which actually works differently from how dropped stages are recovered) but I\u0027m not 100% sure it has been functioning properly (as in, not always removing the clamps). You can turn it off in the settings if you want.\n\nIn stock, launch clamps are automatically recovered when you launch a new craft, and you receive all the funds at 100% recovery rate. I proved that last September in this [imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/I21XP) (no reason to embed it here, so I\u0027ll just provide the link).\n\nIt\u0027s always bugged me that they don\u0027t get automatically recovered when they go out of range. There\u0027s no reason to keep them on the pad anymore. It\u0027s even more dangerous if you use them on the runway."},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T20:09:37Z","Content":"I use stage recovery and noticed that while the clamps disapear, I never get any notice about recovery.

They\u0027re recovered in a separate way from dropped stages, and since they\u0027re just debris it didn\u0027t seem practical to fire off a recovery message about them. They also aren\u0027t recovered using the stock functions (because for whatever reason those only were returning like 60%) so instead I just remove them from the game and manually add in all of the funds for them and any attached parts. I do fire an SR Recovery event, so any mods that use the API will be notified of their recovery at least.\n\nYou should see the funds value go up and a message or two in the log about clamps being destroyed and funds being added."},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T23:07:35Z","Content":"I use Trajectories for reasonably precise landings.

If still in range, they will help, though there still is the flaw that the shutes are removed by the game as soon as the ground is touched and if the part has to be laid down, it just falls over and blows up making the shutes usless"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T23:36:31Z","Content":"The clamps just stay there for all my launches.
