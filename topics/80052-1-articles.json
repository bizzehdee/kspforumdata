Suffice it to say, it took a while. I called my ship the Raven since I had taken to naming all my ships in the .23 career mode save after various birds. Since it\u0027s mostly white, I came to think my choice of bird could have been better... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the ship almost ready for departure:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OdfbvKI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OdfbvKI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost 620 tonnes (at this point) and just over 900 parts.

The main ship was launched almost in one piece, other than having to change out the 3 KR-2L engines for pods of 4 LV/N engines once in orbit. There were three Sr. docking ports arranged around the central crew modules at the nose of the ship, and the main landers were docked on two of them and a \u0022care package\u0022 of various tugs and hab lander modules was docked at the third. The two main landers were meant for Tylo and Laythe, with the Laythe ship\u0027s ascent stage intended to be separated on arrival at Jool for use as a single stage lander for the three smaller moons before being redocked with the ship for the Laythe landing. The care package and two landers were designed to be almost identical mass so the center of mass would be balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H8LDhjn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022H8LDhjn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Raven made its first test flight transferring to a higher orbit over Kerbin.

I had built a couple other behemoths to accomplish the same mission. The first was rather wobbly, so I decided a better design was needed. The second was solid enough, but the lag was crippling, so I abandoned it with my sandbox save when I started over in career mode for version .23. A lot of the same design philosophy went into this ship, though I did simplify a lot of things to save parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this was certainly closer to the goal than I had ever come before. The ship was intended to visit all 5 moons with two-kerbal crews, plus send probes to various locations along the way. The first probe was launched shortly after entering Jool SOI, and was an atmospheric probe intended to mine Jool itself for some science:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hysTyTs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hysTyTs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that the solar panels weren\u0027t as effective as I had hoped. Even though I had all sides covered, the landing was on the noon side of Jool, so once the parachute opened, the craft ended up pointing straight up towards the sun with almost no light hitting the panels. I used the reaction wheel to try to turn one side up towards the light more. The batteries were quickly spent and it took forever to transmit the observations. Fortunately, the probe was well ahead of the mother ship, so I had time to mess with it for a long as it took.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BafLPOV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BafLPOV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool is a dazzling sight, and the cupola module was a good place to see it from.

I decided that Jeb, Bill and Bob needed to be on this mission, so I rescued them from rotting on my space station in Kerbin orbit for this flight. There are four others along as well, two manning the science module, one in the cupola module so I can use that view and another as copilot on one of the landers (with the big three manning the other three pilot seats in the two landers.) Here we have the Big Guy himself, Jebediah, enjoying the view as he makes his way to one of the command pods on the Tylo lander. You can see one of the Mech-Jeb probes docked to a Jr port in front of him. I brought 3 of those along to see what I could do with them. The other 6 probes were stock mini-probes; 3 were parachute probes while the other 3 were orbital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5XVDY6p.png\u0022 alt=\u00225XVDY6p.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter aerobraking I made a couple course corrections to make for an aerocapture around Laythe. I had originally intended to bring the Raven into Tylo orbit and send the landers out from there, but changed my mind and headed for Laythe instead. My reasoning for making Tylo my base was concern about the fuel needed for landing and ascent from there--a concern that was well founded, as it turned out, but we will get to that later...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UpFkdzk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UpFkdzk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1pn2CWd.png\u0022 alt=\u00221pn2CWd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was almost no flame effect coming around Jool, but the arrival at Laythe more than made up for it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aWwVtNV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aWwVtNV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Raven had arrived at Laythe at last.

As I mentioned, the lander itself is the ascent stage from the Laythe lander. It had a docking port installed top and bottom and landing gear added. The crew section is two single-kerbal lander cans connected by bi-couplers top and bottom. This setup is considerably lighter than a two-kerbal lander can. The two of the four engine pods are designed to separate during lift-off from Laythe, leaving an odd-looking two engine ship to reach orbit. To prevent the staging when using it as a separate lander, I only used the permanent engines for lift-off on Vall, Bop and Pol. The Tylo lander\u0027s ascent stage is identical except it has no landing gear and a stack separator connected it to the landing stage instead of a docking port. Oh, and I didn\u0027t bother to put any experiment packages on the Tylo lander since the hab module lander would have them--a tactical error, as it turned out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing is the fuel stage. It was a bit of an afterthought and was intended to be used from Tylo orbit. The engines were only to allow me to use it as a tug if necessary, but they are too small for a real orbital transfer, I think. The huge mono propellant tank was also tacked on at the last minute when I worried there might not be enough RCS fuel storage on the ship. There wasn\u0027t, so it was a good call, but not having it incorporated into the main ship meant it had to be hauled around in cases like this, which did waste some fuel which might have allowed me to avoid some later problems. Next time, I will do it better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I ended up not using the tug\u0027s engines at all, and just used the lander\u0027s instead.

I\u0027ve gotten that \u0022You cannot store 3 of the data items, discard them?\u0022 message a few times with only a single pod. This allows duplicates to be stored. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ladders took a little engineering, but worked out great. When the kerbonaut leaves the pod, he immediately appears sideways to the door holding onto the ladder rungs. When he moves forward/upward and reaches the crosswise ladder, you can turn him either way. When the ladder is extended, he just goes down the ladder, no problem. Coming up the ladder, when he gets to the platform he stops and you can turn him right or left to move to the door of either pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yMtSIZB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yMtSIZB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinding a landing spot was no problem.

It was nice to have an atmosphere to aerobrake into, since there wouldn\u0027t have been enough fuel to make Laythe orbit. It ended up in an inclined orbit which could not intersect the mother ship\u0027s orbit. I had a second transfer stage with a double fuel tank, so I sent it resupply the lander so it could get back to the Raven:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/M2XvNmP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022M2XvNmP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I never took any shots of the lander at the mothership again, but it just docked, unloaded all its science, refueled and then headed back out with both the fuel stages this time.

Once the ship was in high orbit, I took stock of what I had left. I found the lander still was fully fueled, but both the fuel stages were dry. More disappointingly, I found that the burn had mostly drained the hab lander\u0027s fuel tank, leaving not enough to land the thing. And the ship was way too high to land. I decided to dump the fuel stages, they were just dead weight at this point. The hab lander still had some fuel, so I set up a burn to create an elliptical orbit which came down to within 20 km of the surface. There was fuel enough for that, but no way I could circularize. I was perturbed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/53SsPGT.png\u0022 alt=\u002253SsPGT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI left the game for a bit, disconcerted at my predicament. It looked like Tylo would defeat the Raven expedition. Eventually, I decided to just see what I could salvage. The hab lander was abandoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4TeYz0M.png\u0022 alt=\u00224TeYz0M.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s where things got messy. The ship was coming in on the dark side of Tylo and would just get to the light side at closest approach, which is highest speed. All I had for fuel was what the ship was carrying, and it had to have enough left after launch to get back to Laythe, or I would have to use the Laythe lander to come rescue these guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI attempted a manual landing. Twice. Pancaked at high speed. Twice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, let\u0027s see what Mech-Jeb can do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ nailed the landing on the first try. Very nice. Well, nailed it as in ended up standing upright in spite of doing a little hop before setting down and teetering badly before coming to rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ship was designed to drain fuel from the upper stage first. I figured it was better the rob the upper stage of some fuel than to horde it and run out of lander fuel at 50 meters. It turned out that I had more than enough in the lower stage to refuel the upper, so I started transferring fuel back up so the ship would be ready for liftoff again. I did not hit F5 before doing this. Just as I was filling the last tank, I noticed the ship started to shift a little... It had landed on a slight slope and moving the fuel up top had changed its center of gravity. And over it went, landing like turtle on its back. Dang it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, no problem, let\u0027s just do it again. I set up about the same landing on MJ and let it go. It came down, hovered 2 meters above the ground and started moving sideways before dropping, and then tipped over. Nuts. Ok, let\u0027s try again. Same thing again. And again, and again, and again. Sigh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started messing with some settings. I turned off the lander\u0027s thrusters and left the one on the ascent stage working. Almost worked, but only almost. Ok, what about the landing speed? Change from .5 m/s to 5 m/s; it probably needs more vertical speed so it doesn\u0027t go side ways. Plunked right down. And broke two legs. And over it went, again. Bugger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, this is rapidly reducing the fun factor here. All right, I\u0027m going to do another run, reduce landing speed to 3 m/s and then quicksave a minute before landing, so that I don\u0027t have to go way back up to orbit again every time. It\u0027s all or nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn this run it landed perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wd8MSMK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wd8MSMK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TIeMwDL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TIeMwDL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK!

I also had most of its fuel transfered to the Raven since it would not need much to de-orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had several ideas on how I would work this part of the project. The intention was to land a permanent 4 man hab module and have the manned ship land nearby. The crew would use the manned lander to reach the surface and take off again. The hab lander had its own deorbit engines and a small amount of fuel, so I thought about having it land first and then land the return ship nearby. The Tylo mission was supposed to work similarly, but the fuel problems forced that part of the mission to be scrapped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difficulty of getting the ship to land close enough, plus the fact that I intended to land near water made me leery of that plan on Laythe, however. It would be too easy to land too far away or in the drink. So, instead I decided to let the lander take the hab module down with it, and have them separate just before main chute deployment and land separately but at the same time. The chutes on the lander were set to deploy 100m before the hab module\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/srPN4rj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022srPN4rj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI let MechJeb guide the landing because of the precision needed.

I clipped the Science Jrs halfway into the tank on the Tylo hab lander, just because it looked better than having them sticking out like dumbo ears. I also clipped some mono propellant tanks inside the LV/N engine fairings. I figured that was fair game because the space inside was empty and NASA would have used it for something useful, too. Again, I could have strapped them to the outsides of the fairings, but that would have looked dumb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah, I took a hab module and science lab plus a 3 man pod as the main crew section for the 7 kerbal crew.

The landing stages of the Tylo and Laythe landers remain on their respective moons, and the ascent modules and cupola module are still in orbit around Laythe. One parachute probe was crushed in the Joolian atmosphere, one is floating in Laythe\u0027s ocean and the third is landed near the manned landing site on Laythe.

In spite of that, when it came time to launch, I thought I would try leaving the bulk of the ship assembled and launch it as one unit. One change I had to make was to replace the clusters of LV/N engines with 3 KR-2Ls. My first trial indicated I needed more dV, so I added S3-7200 tanks as part of the engine package, along with some stablizers.

They were a modification of a design I had worked on for a previous mission, so there wasn\u0027t much guesswork involved. The only tweaking I had to do was adding a couple of mini tanks to the top of the drop tanks on the ascent stages to give them a little extra dV to make Kerbin orbit. They weren\u0027t really needed for Laythe or Tylo, but every little bit helps.
