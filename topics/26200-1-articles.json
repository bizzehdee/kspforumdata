The best thing you can do from both a TWR and delta-v standpoint is to use OX-4 solar arrays (they have by far the best power to weight ratio 12X better than the RTG at Kerbin\u0027s orbit). To run the PB-ION engine at close to full power you would need 8 arrays at Kerbin\u0027s orbit or 16 at Jool\u0027s. For comparison if you wanted to use RTGs you would need 22 of them for full power, but such a craft would have horrid acceleration and a somewhat limp noodle delta-v budget for an ion craft. Gigantors are not as good as OX-4; their power to weight ratio is half that of the OX-4. Also if you wanted your center of mass to be along the line of thrust (generally a good thing unless you really like spinning uncontrollably) you would need at least two of them, but this much power is massive over kill for one ion engine. To use that much power you would want 2 PB-IONs, but all of this extra mass will ding your delta-v. The bottom line is don\u0027t ever use RTGs to power ion engines, (at least until the devs fix the inverse-square law for solar insolation, at which point they will make sense for outer-planets missions). Also if you can make it work use OX-4 instead of Gigantors, they always will give you more delta-v and you actually will get better thrust with them too (54% more at Kerbin\u0027s orbit, 13% more at Jool\u0027s orbit).
