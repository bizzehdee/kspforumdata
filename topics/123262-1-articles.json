The fact that spacetime is not resolvable really creates a delimna in understanding the probailities because nothing could be a prestate or everything could be a prestate (for example a collapse\u00A0of a previous universe to a single point), though now im beginning to doubt that the second is possible given quantum fluctuations and the matter-antimatter imbalance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with quantum\u00A0vacuum instability is that the nothing state before the temporal amorphous pre-inflation state was almost certainly diiferent than any state approaching empty in the current \u003Cem\u003Evisible\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Euniverse. Fields permeate our universe, but how can they propogate before for the initial inflation, there is no precendent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn example of what could happen,\u00A0supposed that gravity is limited by quantum tunneling, and there is disjoining\u00A0across\u00A0extreme distaces that we cannot percieve. Some entangled gravitational interactions would exist between comiving space time moving away frome each other faster than the speed of light, and partcles ejected from the most poweful supernova at opposing ends be traveling away from each other near to spped of light in thier comiving refence frame.\u00A0Remember\u00A0that the graviational constant is the constant that shows variation several magnitudes more than the other fundementatal constants, this constant could be locally sensitive to the extremes states we cannot perceive.\u00A0The pressure to keep quantum entanglement from breaking down could evacuation\u00A0the center of inflation to a degree that it triggers a subsequent big bang, and this second event could be the cause\u00A0of\u00A0the dark energy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossibilies can exist because the prestate is not defined, this is why its always easier to stop the hypothesis with some line\u00A0of differential uncertainty, for example at the gravity/ quantum\u00A0gravity boundary in the unification theory, in this case we can say since quantum gravity has never been proven or defined, then anything that happens before spacetime resolves cannot be defined. This boundary is set in experimental particle physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe observational boundary is the CNBR, which is likely to give way at some point to the preionization nuetrino boundary. Because of black swan hypothetical perspective i prefer to use\u00A0the observational over the theoretical implications of experimental particle physics. One of the main problem with pre CNBR modeling is that it is impossible to show that all of the universal constants remain constant, for example that spacetime models can be used at all before the energetic stability (meaning net energy additions have significantly slowed down)\u00A0in the universe depending on the model. This is rather contentious point for me\u00A0because the visible universe exhibits euclidian geometry, it is not curved in one\u00A0direction more so than another and densites of matter relative to distance\u00A0milky way is most uniform at the extreme distances and to the CMBR. Neither center or edge is deducable,\u00A0which also means we can only ascert a lower size limit to the universe at inflation, not a upper size limit which sum of mass*c^2 \u002B\u00A0energy is also undefinable, more so with dark energy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to the point, sure there could be everything from nothing, but in science we ask for proof. As i state above there are significant uncertainties in modelling the pre CMBR universe, and so any such hypothesis\u00A0are based on conjecture and should be rejected by referees or redirected to journals of theoretical modelling.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
