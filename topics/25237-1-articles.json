So for aerospikes we have: Isp_aerospike = 390 - 2*p\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor LV-N\u0027s we have: Isp_LVN = 800 - 580*p\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESetting the two equal to each other and rearranging, we get 578*p = 410, or p = 0.709 atm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to get altitude on Kerbin for a given pressure, the formula is altitude = -5000 * ln(p). So LV-N\u0027s are more fuel-efficient than aerospikes for altitudes higher than 1717 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just1ChanceFree","CreatedById":60504,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T23:35:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETavert, thanks.
