Hello everybody!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m Olex, from Germany. I\\\u0027m actually in the same town as the ESA\\\u0027s Satellite Control center... not that it\\\u0027s in any way relevant. I\\\u0027ve found out about this game a week ago or so, played the demo first, and bought the full version soon - this is definitely worth 15$, probably more in fact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel that I need to thank the authors of this game, it\\\u0027s absolutely awesome. I\\\u0027ve always been fascinated by space, and this just gives me so many things to go and try out, it\\\u0027s incredible \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Can\\\u0027t wait for the 0.16 to come out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what have I got so far?

My mother tongue is actually Russian.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover is based on a screenshot I found on Reddit (/r/kerbalspaceprogram). It\\\u0027s a bit fiddly to get off the lander module, many hectic RCS burns and some swearing are involved. It\\\u0027s also badly balanced and pulls heavily to the left when driving, and I have rolled it on the Mun multiple times - but it can be rolled back up on the wheels using RCS. I will be building a bigger, more stable rover soon to explore the second arch - thinking of putting some engines on sideways and landing it wheels down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
