I\u0027m considering it for some builds as the new effect of the nose cones causes most craft to point towards their vector (is that the correct term?). Where as for a powered landing, I want rocket down and nose cone up. Parachutes would give the desired result, but are less re-usable and less reliable (IRL at least) than using the crafts own aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically I\u0027d want something that has no drag, that I can deploy to give a little drag to re-orientate the craft on an atmospheric descent. Like a radar dish, but as a wing I guess.
