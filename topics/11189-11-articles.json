I didn\u0027t get a screenshot of the completed burn showing a 100km circular orbit. But I made it, with one-and-a-bit tanks left. Plenty for re-entry.\n\nThis was more of a personal achievement. Only thought of posting here as an afterthought.\n\nI had a lot of trouble building a SPH based SSTO, and last night I finally nailed it. It only gets to LKO and back, but that\u0027s enough, i\u0027m chuffed.\n\nEDIT: just to clear things up, I put another up, using MechJeb Ascent all the way to see if it could do a better job. It seems the result was much the same for fuel, but it messed up the burn a little at Ap.
