So I decided to rectify that issue a couple weeks back by building a small base at the site I call \u0022First Landing.\u0022 (Where I first landed on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn with Hudwin Kerman, and where I\u0027ve landed again 6 or 7 times.... Of course that was all in the Null Cycle Universe, so none of that really happened....)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst step in the project was to drop a Habitat Module on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. I built a new launch vehicle, the Mauro Heavylift, using the new 3.75m NASA parts wrapped with a layer of the old 1.25m tanks to form a roughly 6.25m first stage. The first stage uses an S3 KS-25x4 Engine Cluster as its core and 12 LV-T30s mounted radially, and can manage some insane amount of mass to orbit that I\u0027ve thus far failed to calculate. I added 6 strap-on solid rocket boosters to further increase the payload capacity. Second stage is a single Kerbodyne KR-2L. The landing stage \u0022skycrane\u0022 for the habitat module used 3 LV-909s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220140526_ksp0010_pioneer.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20140526_ksp0010_pioneer.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA while later and the boosters are dropped.... Hopefully not onto anything important. The zero-lift maneuver has to begin shortly thereafter or the vehicle will end up in much too high of an orbit (almost following Ferram rules, at 110m/s, though I\u0027m still living in a stock world for this save).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220140526_ksp0019_pioneer.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20140526_ksp0019_pioneer.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first stage separation is a multistage process. The interstage shroud is as much a structural member as it is a fairing, and as such can\u0027t be jettisoned until after the first stage has burned out. After those are jettisoned and are a decent distance form the craft the actual separation occurs. A short, low-thrust burn from the second stage pulls the two apart before the second stage is fully fired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220140526_ksp0024_pioneer.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20140526_ksp0024_pioneer.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220140526_ksp0029_pioneer.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20140526_ksp0029_pioneer.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce clear of the atmosphere the remainder of the fairing was jettisoned and the final orbital insertion burn was completed. The exposed base is visible in the shot below. This was the first of two different designs I was considering. For this design, the access tunnels were elevated above the base structure, and the module was intended to be landed on legs and adjusted to match any neighboring modules. The Pioneer Base Habitat has living quarters sufficient for 6 kerbals on a long duration mission, or so the geek on the ground calculate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220140526_ksp0038_pioneer.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20140526_ksp0038_pioneer.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe transfer burn and the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar capture burn all occurred in the dark, as is only proper with KSP. Once the landing site came within range I started setting up the descent, hunting for a nice, flat spot on the edge of the Farside Crater. The skycrane worked flawlessly, and the base landed very gently. Gentle enough that I decided to not use heavy landing legs on future modules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220140526_ksp0043_pioneer.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20140526_ksp0043_pioneer.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the base down I detached the skycrane and moved it to a \u0022Garbage\u0022 crater more than 3km to the south. Just far enough to get outside of the draw distance and save my frame rate. Planning for the future here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220140526_ksp0071_pioneer.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20140526_ksp0071_pioneer.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mission wasn\u0027t without its share of severe bugs, and I had to spend a good bit of time fighting with the game just to get the second stage to decouple from the base module. Every time I tried to decouple the entire craft would explode into a shower of parts... not something that should happen based on how it was built.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo ultimately I had to edit the save file to replace the troubled part with a normal stackDecoupler. (Cheat? Maybe. But ultimately I would\u0027ve just crashed this craft and launched a bug-free version later.) Yet even that hack had its issues, and ultimately I spent 30mins fighting this bug. I think the issue is ultimately caused by a confused part orientation, with the Top and Bottom attach nodes being reversed in the save (but not the craft file from the VAB). Weird. Something I\u0027ll watch out for in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220140526_ksp0074_pioneer.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20140526_ksp0074_pioneer.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore updates in a little bit....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-28T14:05:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2016 02:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EJust fixing the title........\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T04:19:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next phase of building Pioneer Base was to send up a small Greenhouse Experiment module, followed by a crew of 6, and a set of two Rothar-series rovers. Once again the various components were launched atop a Mauro Heavylift, using skycranes to soft-land on the surface (with the exception of the crew lander). The Greenhouse Lab\u0027s launch and transfer was identical to that of the Habitat module, except at night, and has been omitted.

For those interested, the abort procedure for this launch was to jettison the fairings and fire the Shuttle\u0027s main engines and either abort to orbit or land on flames. Thankfully that wasn\u0027t necessary. To conserve fuel I used the (obviously overpowered) Mauro\u0027s second stage to perform the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar Transfer and Capture burns, as well as the first of the descent burns.

These shuttles are capable of ferrying six kerbals between a station in Low Munar Orbit and destinations up to 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA North or South of the equator on a full load of fuel. (And probably further if I want to press it.) It has a sufficient TWR to perform a powered landing on Kerbin should it be needed for a quick evacuation. Normally a craft such as this would be sent up to AnchorPoint Station, refueled, and then sent over to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar Transfer Station to await its crew. Except AnchorPoint and the Transfer Stations haven\u0027t been built, so I just sent the Shuttle up on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20140528_ksp0057_crew.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220140528_ksp0057_crew.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding occurred right before M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar Sunset, but there was just enough light for the first crew of Pioneer Base to line up for their photo.

Thankfully it was more than up for the job. The arrangement of the two rovers can be seen below. They were mounted back to back, with a ramp at the base of the lander to kick them out to the sides, and arrangement that had worked perfectly in tests on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20140606_ksp0014_rovers.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220140606_ksp0014_rovers.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding was another simple matter, though I targeted a spot a bit uphill from Pioneer Base.

He was subsequently stranded on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, finding no spare rockets or extra fuel to refill his rickety little craft. As the legend goes, he was later visited by his friend Ronton Kerman, and rescued many centuries later by the great explorer Jebediah Kerman.

Rough tests on Kerbin have led me to believe an unhelmeted Kerbal can stand upright in one of these structural tubes, which should make for a more comfortable arrangement than suiting up, running over to the next module, and then getting back out of the EVA suit.
