But for all I know you\u0027d have to double it or more. I don\u0027t remember the mass of Kerbol. xP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I looked it up. Kerbol is only 0.8% the mass of the Sun. More planet-size than star-size, really (almost the same mass as Jupiter). It\u0027d have trouble even being a brown dwarf. But maybe it\u0027s a shard of a white dwarf - a tiny little fragment that got blown off alongside a bunch of even tinier fragments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.: According to this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKp1M4T6z24?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...with the exception of Vall\u0027s unfortunate placement next to Laythe and Tylo (from the latter of which it gets a big gravity assist after a few years), the Kerbolar system is stable for at least the first 100 years. Since any sane Kerballer is unlikely to simulate for more than 50 (c\u0027mon guys), I say it counts if a Kerbolar system can be created IRL that lasts for at least a reasonable play length.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-19T16:26:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2015 04:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T16:29:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebut brown dwarfs can glow a bit too right?
