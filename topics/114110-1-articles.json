Still didn\u0027t unlock transfer of resources or the fuel pipe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a really tiny probe meant to land on Mun; The cheap solid boosters, awesome in the new atmosphere (but very hard to steer) will bring its apoaxis near Mun orbit altitude (probably a bit beyond), then the good-ISP engines (Terrier) would pick an encounter, then get me into orbit. Then I discard the big fuel tanks, and with the tiny probe, the two Terriers and two small fuel tanks I\u0027d perform the landing (the last stage, due to very low mass, has like 1200 dV despite the tiny fuel tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022kinky\u0022 thing is the probe with its two tiny tanks and the Terriers is placed upside-down, the two Terriers pointing skywards (and serving as makeshift nose cones), the big fuel tanks supplying it with fuel for getting into Mun orbit hanging down along the central solid booster. Once in space, separated from the solid boosters, it turns around and the two \u0022horns\u0022 of long fuel tanks on the Terriers pointing forward not being a problem in void and freefall. In the atmosphere they are tucked alongside the central solid booster and provide occlusion from atmospheric drag to shorter solid boosters placed directly below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I performed a test launch into Kerbin orbit. Separation went alright, then I started the LF boosters at full power and they sputtered out a moment later. The two tiny landing stage fuel tanks are depleted, and the big \u0022horns\u0022 of long fuel tanks are still full. And I have no way to get the fuel to the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I sentenced to attach two more engines on the bottom of the transfer stage or is there a way to get the fuel to the two on top?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T13:38:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 01:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eonmoon","CreatedById":137279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehmm, not really unless you got fuel lines to connect from the big tanks to your tiny ones, they hold very little compared to the big ones\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T12:18:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFuel doesn\u0027t flow between parts attached \u0027radially\u0027 (to the \u0027surface\u0027) of another part.
