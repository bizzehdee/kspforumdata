Unreal Engine is made precisely for making FPS games and comes with built in networking support to make a team-based MP\u00A0FPS game. You can make a WWII FPS in Unreal Engine 4 with exactly zero engineers of any kind. You just need a few designers with Blueprint experience.

All of the game components have to be written in C# - there is no mechanism for designers to stand up something functional.

Competent person is not going to try and make KSP2 have multiplayer core with this team without having supernatural powers on their side. A big important feature? Sure. But one that can be removed from the game without making the whole thing collapse. Whatever precise form KSP2 multiplayer will take, it is a side feature. An addition to core gameplay to be enjoyed with your friends, and not the only reason someone might buy this game.

This is more of a human nature thing than anything, because who likes committing a bunch of resources/energy to something believe in something only to flip/change later?

Even though, again, those original assumptions are primarily built on experience rather than much hard evidence. \u0022Nate already has played multiplayer?

This is what you want from the game. That has no bearing on how the game is designed or what the team\u0027s objectives are. I\u0027m seeing absolutely no supporting evidence for multiplayer being something more than a way to play the game co-op, and that\u0027s not a core feature. There have been no mentions of social, infrastructure, or any sort of features in support of multiplayer as core.\u00A0What we have seen a lot of evidence for\u00A0is expanding the game\u0027s progression and new user experience. These are all core features of KSP2 and they are clearly there to make sure the game is a complete experience out of the box even without the multiplayer. Very clearly, Intercept\u0027s design team thinks they can have a complete user experience as a single player game. And this is a crucial disagreement with your premise that KSP2 cannot exist as a successful product without multiplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you accept that KSP2 can be a game that a huge number of people can enjoy without multiplayer, that such a game will sell and generate revenue, the rest falls into place. You build core gameplay around single player experience. You start with the gameplay loop of KSP, which is perfectly solid, and you work on improving progression. The basic pitch of KSP but with new star systems to explore and with a good, well-designed progression system to replace career/science in KSP is absolutely solid. That alone is a game a lot of people want to play.\u00A0I\u0027m fairly confident that this was the entire pitch for Star Theory\u0027s original project. The next iteration on top of that is adding better tutorials, base-building as part of progression, and multiplayer. This increase in scope is why the game is coming in \u002722 and not \u002720. And while tutorials and base-building have clearly been integrated into the progression, meaning they are now core features, we\u0027ve heard hardly anything about multiplayer development. Which wouldn\u0027t make sense if the entire game was overhauled to be multiplayer-first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if you look at multiplayer as a bolt-on co-op feature which doesn\u0027t alter fundamental game progression and merely lets you experience the game with a small group of friends, then all of it makes perfect sense. There are multiplayer-specific design challenges that have to be addressed, such as what happens when two player ships dock together and how to handle time-warp, and there are some fairly hard challenges about synchronizing KSP2 gameplay across clients, but nothing an engineer with multiplayer background can\u0027t solve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis approach fits into the team size and background, presumably, because it fits within the budget Private Division was willing to invest in. It also fits into development timeline and history of the project transitioning from Star Theory to Intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you think you have plausible hints to the game being a lot more than that, I\u0027m actually curious to take a look at your sources. There could be something I missed. But right now, everything looks like a complete picture with assumptions above and there are a whole bunch of missing pieces or pieces that don\u0027t fit if we make your assumption about multiplayer being a core experience of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
