When the bottom stage burns out and separates, it immediately slams back into the top stage, and stays there until it overheats from the upper stage and explodes. The decoupler stays hung up on the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legendas","CreatedById":212394,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-26T18:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave the exact same problem, can\u0027t finish this training missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"garaden","CreatedById":212592,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-05T00:37:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had trouble here as well. After a few tries I got it to work. I think it\u0027s important to decouple \u003Cem\u003Eimmediately\u003C/em\u003E when fuel runs out, and fire the engine immediately after that. Which does tend to blow up the bottom stage lol.

Sometimes decoupling pops it off immediately, sometimes it takes a bit to fall off, sometimes it doesn\u0027t pop off until you fire the engine. But at least for me, all of those are fine for finishing the mission, as long as you start the engine ASAP and the lower stage pops off within a second or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-05T01:20:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2021 01:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by garaden\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDescribe more tries\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
