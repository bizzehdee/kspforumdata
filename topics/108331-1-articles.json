I want you to build your best spacecraft (can be a space plane or a rocket I Don\u0027t Care or it can be a combination.) and at least get into orbit. I understand that this challenge is quite easy but trust me as time progresses these challenges will get harder. MUCH MUCH HARDER.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now that you have heard the challenge here\u0027s what I need for proof. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf you have fraps a video would be greatly appreciated but fraps is not required. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA picture of your vessel on the Runway or Launchpad. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA picture of your vessel in atmosphere. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA picture of your Orbital Map \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA picture of your spacecraft in orbit. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way this mission has to be Manned NO PROBES.

Also, how do you know how long it took somone to get into orbit? You can use the mission clock to tell however you do not spectify that it needs to shown.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
