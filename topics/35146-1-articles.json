I am not that good and my editing is so so lol but I did it. My channel is all about video game commentary\u0027s. I feel guilty but I wanted some feedback on how I am doing so anything you can say would be really cool. Here is the channel and thanks for taking your time to help a lowly youtubin like myself. Of course the very first video I made was of Kerbal Space Program its not as hood as some of my other videos but I still had a lot of fun making it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Channel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/TheTriksterr/videos\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/user/TheTriksterr/videos\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEer-i7k6Rs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
