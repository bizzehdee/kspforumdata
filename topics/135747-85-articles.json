The \u0022event\u0022 starts after the 1st anomalous gas expulsion; the rockets sensors would have been able to record and report this fact, and from this point on they were also still getting data from the 1st stage and the dragon module. They got data after the event, meaning it wasn\u0027t destroyed by the original event. It WAS destroyed, along with the rest of the rocket including the massive 1st stage, by the large angry fireball that enveloped the entire structure as the 2nd stage erupted after the tank failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, that is not the Dragon falling back behind the rocket. 1st of all, I assume you have all played KSP at some point. What happens when you accidently decouple your capsule while the rocket is still going? It gets stuck on top until the rocket flips out and lets it fall away, right? There\u0027s no way an unpowered capsule to get out and away enough to then fall back beside the rocket and trail off behind the event. That\u0027s why crewed rockets have those massive escape towers, with thrusters that pull the capsule up and away in case this happens.
