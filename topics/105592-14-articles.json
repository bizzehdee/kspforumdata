Essentially, your loading screen will look a bit like this with Module Manager installed.\n\n![Z4Gr2wo.jpg?2](http://i.imgur.com/Z4Gr2wo.jpg?2)"},{"CreatedByName":"villavillans","CreatedById":151179,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T14:57:41Z","Content":"Success, maybe?

As I said, you really should only be running 64-bit if you\u0027re running an extensive amount of mods or lots of planet packs. KSP 1.0.4 is fairly stable without mods and most users can get away with a handful before hitting the hard memory limit.

I am close to the memory limit and i\u0027m kinda bored of balancing the mods I want to use based on the limitation. Plus my game randomly started to show a few bugs which caused me to lose my patience (especially a bug where the game would freeze whenever I clicked on a building after I had loaded my saves) and I thought i\u0027m more prepared to deal with a slightly less stable version of KSP with all the mods I want, rather than stick with a version where I have to \u0027make-do\u0027 with a couple.\n\nAnyway, thank you very much for your help with my isssue, I really appreciate it!"},{"CreatedByName":"SpeedDaemon","CreatedById":38448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T16:02:41Z","Content":"You can also easily check 64 vs 32 bit by looking at the KSP process in Windows Task Manager.
