I imagine it\u0027s been done, but I couldn\u0027t find any challenges or mission reports during a cursory search. There are plenty of grand tours, but they don\u0027t all start with one launch, and they don\u0027t always visit the surface of every planet/moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it got me thinking about the best order in which to visit everywhere. Eve would have to be the first stop, because the Eve ascent vehicle would be the biggest payload. But then there\u0027s a decision to make. Obviously Eve is the best place to access Moho, but the issue there is that you would have to carry everything all the way to Moho (including a lander set up for Tylo, which would be fairly large), slow it down, and then cart everything out to Jool (visiting Eeloo/Duna\u002BIke/Dres/Mun/Minmus on the way back when you\u0027ve ditched most of the mass).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA different approach could be to leave most of your ship - including a heavy Tylo lander and something with jets for Laythe - at Eve, and tug a little multipurpose lander to Moho. But the delta v between Eve and Moho is not trivial, and you would have to make the inclination corrections both ways. But at least you have the aerobraking option when you get back to Eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would people approach this? What is the most efficient route?
