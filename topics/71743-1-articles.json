Not to gather soil samples or take pictures, or anything. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s way scarier than that. I know that the long dead Space Kraken was slain there \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 somewhere near the north pole \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and my Kerbals are there to locate its remains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4x7A4OG.png?1\u0022 alt=\u00224x7A4OG.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy the secrecy, you ask? Well, not only does the Space Kraken officially not exist, but I also intend to bring it back to life and restore the universe to the glorious chaos that ruled it back in the old days. If anybody on Kerbin found out, they would just try to stop me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds strange. I know. But assuming that it would be grateful, I could probably use it to get more funding for my space program!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UpcHg0X.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022UpcHg0X.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is just that I have no idea how to actually resurrect anything. But of course, my Kerbals don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know that, and should any of them find out, you can believe me when I say the consequences will be dire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I started to experiment with different alignments of Jool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s moons. I also assumed that I would need candles, so I provided my crew with the most advanced candles ever made by Kerbal hands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZPYwAPO.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022ZPYwAPO.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb, my most trusted pilot, is the leader of the project.

He supervises the ritual from the altar erected outside the circle, and said altar also contains an entire library of stuff to chant at the Kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uGxDK7Q.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022uGxDK7Q.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb is a very good supervisor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1F6ptR1.png?1\u0022 alt=\u00221F6ptR1.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, however, the mission was a failure. Despite my best efforts, I have not been able to resurrect the Kraken, and I really have no idea what I\u0027m doing wrong. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s the planetary alignments, the chanting, the candles or something else that I don\u0027t know about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m kind of starting to run out of ideas, and I almost feel like giving up and just write those applications instead.
