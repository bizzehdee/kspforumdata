I just got XCOM: Enemy Within--you know, the one with cyborgs--from GameStop. Seeing the success and non-banning-forever of the \u0022KSP Forum Plays\u0022 threads around here, and wanting to join the fun, I had a brilliant idea. You may have seen \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61580-Framerate-Games?highlight=framerate\u002Bgames\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFramerate Games\u003C/a\u003E, my Dad\u0027s YouTube channel, if you actually click links in signatures. I want to do an Enemy Within playthrough with him for the channel. I thought it might be a good idea to promote it here, especially since some of you like our KSP stuff. Not wanting to be \u0027That Guy\u0027, I thought I\u0027d do it in a format that isn\u0027t pure spam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will be a little different from the typical \u0022KSP Forum Plays\u0022 thread for a few reasons. First and foremost, it won\u0027t be as centered around the KSP Forum. You won\u0027t control our every move--you\u0027ll be more like advisers. That\u0027s the bad news. The good news? Well, XCOM has a very robust character editor. Hair, armor, vocie, name, even language are all editable. This means that you can request your own character. We\u0027ll get back to that in a sec.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this won\u0027t be simple video posting. For each video, I will also write up a little story that gives life to the gameplay. A bit like the KSP AAR\u0027s, actually.

It was Nigeria that came up with the idea of reactivating one of the Council\u0027s old military projects, The XCOM (E\u003Cstrong\u003Ex\u003C/strong\u003Etraterrestrial \u003Cstrong\u003ECom\u003C/strong\u003Ebat) Project. Originally meant as a \u0027serious game\u0027 training simulation for possible global warfare, using aliens as an example, it was re-purposed into a crack unit of the worlds finest soldiers, organized to stop what was clearly an alien invasion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, even if you included the entirety of the science and engineering teams, XCOM was only the size of a small battalion. Many were needed back at base, so only four people could be sent. It was a good thing these were the finest the world had to offer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was an Argentinean man who was only refereed to as \u0027the Jedi Master\u0027, who was a sniper during the Falkland War that British troops outright feared. There was a Swedish woman named Ingrid Jensen, a heavy weapons specialist who was often jokingly cited as \u0027the reason nobody messes with Sweden\u0027. There was a British woman named Abigail Robinson, an Afghanistan veteran who inspired all with her healing abilities. Finally, there was a Russian man named Mark B., commonly refereed to (by his choice) as \u0027Dude\u0027, a commando who had captured many members of a Siberian terrorist group by himself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, none of them had ever fought an alien.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the squad landed in the Skyranger, the Jedi Master noticed a strange pod. Of course, all the alien pods were strange, but this particular pod was nothing like the others he had seen in news footage. It was orange, glowing, but not quite as menacing as the green canisters. Doctor Vahlen wanted it for the research team, so he moved in to collect it. To his surprise, it opened at his touch, revealing an orange, pulsating crystal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the team moved up. It was a slow advance, but eventually Jedi spotted something in the restaurant. It scuttled away, but Command confirmed it was a sectoid, the most common type of alien. Everyone got into firing positions and waited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the alien popped out, it was meet with a burst of gunfire. It dropped to the ground, dead.

He moved up, using a sign of the cow mascot of the shop as cover. It could easily be destroyed by conventional bullets, but it made it all the harder for the aliens to hit him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo more aliens appeared, one from behind a nearby truck and one from the other side of the building. Ingrid hit the first one with a grenade (Vahlen whined a bit, but the alternative probably wouldn\u0027t have worked), but the other was still up. Mark moved in to get the sectoid, but was hit by a burst of plasma. It \u003Cem\u003Eburned,\u003C/em\u003E like nothing he had ever felt before. In agony, he panicked and shot at the sectoid.

Finally, he said, \u0022You are unlike any soldiers I have ever seen...\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJust a week ago, Hongou had been working with the Chinese government on a project to study the alien\u0027s supposed \u0027teleportation\u0027 technology, as well as to find where the aliens came from. Now, with Beijing swarmed by mysterious aliens that masqueraded as men, XCOM had ordered an immediate evacuation of all research facilities in China. As Hongou had files on the mysterious aliens, named Thin Men by him, he was top priority.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJedi ordered him to move into cover near the door, just in case. The rest of the squad took their positions. Jedi slowly opened the door, and immediately caught sight of a Thin Man. The alien\u0027s attempt at disguise didn\u0027t fool XCOM--they appeared to be old businessmen at first glance, but on closer inspection, they appeared a bit more sickly than a human, just slightly unnatural. It had amazing agility--it managed to jump onto a nearby rooftop in one bound. This was not a problem for Jedi--he killed the Thin Man in one shot. As it died, it released a noxious cloud of poison.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIngrid moved up, but discovered a sectoid just behind a nearby fuel tank. She had trouble lining up a shot, so instead she jumped to one side and into better cover. Mark, ever the brave one, charged at the creature with his shotgun. Unfortunately, this alerted another sectoid. This wouldn\u0027t have been as much of a problem if the shotgun blast hadn\u0027t missed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe sectoids repositioned. Abagail tried to hit one as it passed by her sights, but an assault rife wasn\u0027t exactly the most accurate weapon at long range. One of the aliens hit Mark in the chest, although this only provoked a shot right into it\u0027s ugly face. The second sectoid came out of its hiding spot and hit Mark in the face three times.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESquaddie Mark Dude was killed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EUnfortunately for the aliens, his death did not cause the team to retreat in terror--in fact, it only enraged them. They went out with a vengeance, killing every last alien in the area. The rest of the mission was easy--after all, a man driven to war by vengeance is much more powerful than one driven by political, moral or religious conviction.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe commander decided to call Operation Burning Fear a success.

Get in, kill the buggers, get out. The plaza would provide a strange cover situation, but other than that, it would be easy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt is always the simplest plans that go wrong in the most complex ways.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen the dropship landed, the squad took defensive positions around the plaza. Signs, cars, trash cans--all became potential cover. Jedi covered as the rest of the team advanced on the building.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt was the new recruit, Scottish heavy weapons specialist Charlie Owens, who caught sight of the first Meld canister. He was not to eager to move in on the canister, but went in on the orders of the Commander.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe Commander soon realized he had made a mistake. Two sectoids appeared, and they both had a clear shot at Charlie. No one had a good shot at the sectoids, so everyone had to move up. Still, no one was too worried just yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs one of the aliens moved into Ingrid\u0027s line of sight, she opened fire. The bullets went wide, ricocheting off the wall. The other sectoid moved out of the new hole in the wall and fired at Charlie, damaging his armor. Deciding not to take any chances, the Commander ordered Ingrid to use her rocket to kill the two sectoids in one shot. Despite her doubts, she managed to get the aliens...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnd destroyed the remaining wall, alerting two more aliens.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe Commander was starting to panic now. A panicked leader does not make good decisions. He ordered Charlie to move to nearby cover, but didn\u0027t realize that the cover was flanked on one side. Charlie\u0027s running alerted two more aliens, worrying the Commander even more. His top adviser was now giving him lip.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe next few minutes was frenzied panicking and running from cover to cover. Charlie was shot again, and threw a frag grenade in response, killing the alien and giving Vahlen reason to hate him. In a mad dash, he ran to another cubicle, dodging a plasma bolt in the process. Just as the last sectoid was about to kill him, Charlie shot the bugger in the face.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDuring the flight home, the squad listened as their Commander was questioned for his suitability for this job by the Council...\u003Cbr\u003E----\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWell, it took long enough, but this chapter is finally here.
