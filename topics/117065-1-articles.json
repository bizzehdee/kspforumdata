It is pretty old, from before 1.x, but there the user attaches a winch to a moving arm, and with the winch he picks up a docking port, proceeding to dock several different things with that. Is it still possible to do that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T17:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP has a facebook page?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways if you\u0027re talking about\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tp6yj2k0Fpc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E then there\u0027s a part that mentions something very important:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YF8JASNl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YF8JASNl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking port is not actually attached to the winch, so they\u0027re two separate vessels.
