But I must ask anyway: Are there any good part packs out there that add futuristic looking parts (not just engines but also structural stuff). I\u0027m really jonesing for a futuristic space exploration game and Kerbal is the best out there, despite it not being futuristic. Anyway, any suggestions are appreciated though I should mention that I know about the Interstellar mod and the Near-future Propulsion one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a slightly off-topic side note: if anyone knows of any good futuristic 3d (preferably) space exploration games with large ships with hangars and all that feel free to share. But I\u0027m not expecting too much here, I\u0027ve searched and haven\u0027t found anything. Think Firefly, and you are on the right track.
