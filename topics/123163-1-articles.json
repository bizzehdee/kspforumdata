This is a single stage to \u003Cem\u003EMun\u003C/em\u003E. Or Minmus. Or \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E. Presenting the easiest way to get your crew to lvl 3 in a single flight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WX5qthB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WX5qthB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, there\u0027s this mission profile that has been short of my standard for crew training before they step out of Kerbin\u0027s vicinity: visit Minmus, plant a flag, pop out of of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence for the briefest of periods, then reverse and boost back into Kerbin\u0027s SOI, getting a Mun encounter on the long way down, to finish with an aerobrake and back to base. It gives you just enough XPs (Flag on Minmus, solar orbit, and Mun flyby) to bring the kerbals cleanly into lvl3, where you unlock pretty much all the abilities worth having (specifically, all the repair abilities). Problem is, the dV Budget to do that is \u003Cem\u003Esteep\u003C/em\u003E. Going to Minmus saves you landing dV, but still, that\u0027s like 3-4km/s depending on how long you take to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI and come back, and that is if you aerobrake for full effect and are really good at navigating. And since 1.0, aerobraking at interplanetary speeds is either tricky if you are a very good pilot in a thermal-proofed ship, or downright suicidal if you are not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yq4cKp6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yq4cKp6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis kind of mission is \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E what my old, pre-1.0 Spatha was built to do, have a crapton of dV and just plunge in the good old souposphere to break at the end of a mission. Some of you might remember that ship... But nowadays that just won\u0027t fly with the reentry heating! So I\u0027ve had to actually improve on the performance, and quite a lot. But fear not! I did, and this is the result: After such a strenuous mission, the new Sabre gets back to Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere with \u003Cem\u003E800m/s still in its tanks\u003C/em\u003E. More than enough to slow you down to suborbital speeds before the reentry interface, but you also have a \u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E lifting ratio, and the thing is balanced really nice, so you can \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E reenter at frightening speeds, completely sideways to the airflow, and brake in the high atmosphere before things start to really heat up (tested at 2,900m/s at entry with a periapsis of 30kms). The thing is so light and \u0022lifty\u0022, it is like reentering on a leaf! And, no part has a less than 2000\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA rating, just to further ease things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NlWcls2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NlWcls2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now, a word or two on the user manual:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, never mind that orbital proofing pic up there, it says you only have about 2km/s on LKO, but that is because I didn\u0027t put any fuel lines there, to save weight and drag: you will have to move fuel manually from the wing tanks into the central rocket body. With that taken care of, your dV is around 3,250m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the thing is a leaf, with a ridiculously low wing loading. That \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E helps, making it rise like an elevator with minimal drag losses, tearing through the Mach barrier like it wasn\u0027t there, and aerobraking incredibly gently if you present all that surface to the atmosphere. But, it can also glide very far, and fast, if you go prograde, and I didn\u0027t put any airbrakes, so you can actually get to the runway a bit \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E fast if you don\u0027t take care. If that\u0027s the case, just circle around it until you speed goes below 100m/s or so. Turns out, having a lot of wing \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E cuts on drag, and this is an extreme example. If anything, the thing is a tiny bit unstable in roll, due to the anhedral tail, but hey, it looks awesome, so I\u0027ll allow it I guess. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E In any case, it is balanced enough so that you can actually maintain the \u0026gt;45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA angles of attack required to turn lift into drag, and make full use of a spaceplane\u0027s ability to brake much higher, and faster, than any capsule, without bouncing out of atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I almost forgot: ther is some oxidizer in there, but it\u0027s only for the kick out or Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. It should run out just as you get your apoapsis out of the atmosphere, and afterwards the RAPIERs are pretty much useless until you reenter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it think that\u0027s everything so, without further due, here you go!

The 2400 I calculated is still a little high because some of the fuel is reserved for the Rapiers during said return flight. It seems that neither MechJeb (reports false numbers) nor KER (refuses to report) understand which fuel is going to go where, which probably means that the crossfeed and/or fuel pump mods and/or KSP are not reporting something correctly... but analyzing code is too much like work for me - I\u0027m just gonna fly it and see what happens. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think my delta-V budget for landing on Min, then escaping Kerbin and coming back via the Mun should be under 2k anyhow, right? Let\u0027s see... Insertion 160, landing 180, ascent 180, escape (Min) 160, escape (Kerbin) 20, return 90... that\u0027s 790 - I have 2400... I can do it with three or four little mistakes and still be able to glide in... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a plan, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanny\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, so Mechjeb is also confused. Move all the fuel towards the center tanks, it\u0027s the best plaace for it. I really tought long and hard about piping it up... But honestly, you only need to move it once, and at leisure once in space. The RAPIERs can draw it wherever it is if you ever re-light them, so don\u0027t worry about that. All in all, you should have quite a bit more than those 2km/s, at least one more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. You might have some fuel still in the wings, too\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Castille7","CreatedById":101668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T17:55:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s enough challenge building an SSTO and you made one to do this, definitely deserves REP but I can\u0027t rep you again yet and I am ok with that its a good thing to spread the love around, I\u0027ll catch you later on that rep\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlithyTove","CreatedById":151140,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T18:49:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just did a similar training run with my XP Bus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYours looks to be much less expensive though.......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the name goes....
