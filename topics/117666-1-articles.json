I am stuck at 94% of a 95% completion criteria. I was at 76% with a slightly non-polar orbit (about 85 degrees vertical) and this increased to 94% when I altered the orbit to a polar one.\n\nI have not yet figured out what is needed to pick up the last percentage point of coverage. With a polar orbit, the probe should eventually cover 100% of Kerbin.\n\nBut it have been quite some time with no increase in percentage, so I decided to ask for some ideas.\n\nThanks,"},{"CreatedByName":"Prime flux","CreatedById":57347,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T07:56:02Z","Content":"Try to change your orbital time just a bit (increase/decrease Apoapsis/\n\nPeriapsis).
