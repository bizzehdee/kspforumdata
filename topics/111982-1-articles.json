The first one being much more frequent crashes than I had in 0.90 despite running fewer mods. I\u0027m aware of the 32bit RAM limit and some memory leak issues and use ATM but if someone could kindly check my logs to make sure it\u0027s not due to another issue I\u0027d really appreciate it. \n\nThe second issue is that the log shows rendering device as my Intel HD 4000 chipset. My laptop also has a GT630M for gaming purposes but it seems like even though I have NVIDIA driver settings set to force KSP to run with the graphics card it is still using the integrated chipset, would anyone know anything about that?\n\nHere are the stats/specs:\n\nKSP: 1.0.2 Windows 32 bit\n\nMods installed: Active Texture Management, Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Kerbal Engineering, Chatterer, Final Frontier, Kerbal Inventory Systems, Real Chute, Scansat, Stage Recovery, DMagic Orbital Science, KAX, Infernal Robotics, NovaPunch2, SpaceY Heavy Lifters, Station Science \n\nCrashes can\u0027t be reliably reproduced, does not appear to be associated with any mod specifically. RAM usage at crash typically ~3.4-3.6 gb but it seems like it doesn\u0027t like to crash when i have task manager open, only when I\u0027m not checking....\n\nLog file here: [http://www./view/n26mngnnrtphx68/output_log.txt](http://www./view/n26mngnnrtphx68/output_log.txt)\n\nThanks in advance guys!\n\nNightOwl\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T19:08:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 07:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NightOwl07**"}]}
