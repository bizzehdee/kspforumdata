The first one being much more frequent crashes than I had in 0.90 despite running fewer mods. I\u0027m aware of the 32bit RAM limit and some memory leak issues and use ATM but if someone could kindly check my logs to make sure it\u0027s not due to another issue I\u0027d really appreciate it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second issue is that the log shows rendering device as my Intel HD 4000 chipset. My laptop also has a GT630M for gaming purposes but it seems like even though I have NVIDIA driver settings set to force KSP to run with the graphics card it is still using the integrated chipset, would anyone know anything about that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the stats/specs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP: 1.0.2 Windows 32 bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods installed: Active Texture Management, Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Kerbal Engineering, Chatterer, Final Frontier, Kerbal Inventory Systems, Real Chute, Scansat, Stage Recovery, DMagic Orbital Science, KAX, Infernal Robotics, NovaPunch2, SpaceY Heavy Lifters, Station Science \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrashes can\u0027t be reliably reproduced, does not appear to be associated with any mod specifically.
