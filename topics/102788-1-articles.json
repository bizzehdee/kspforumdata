On some video I saw one that you have to supply water, food and oxygen and you have water filtering, farms and oxygen recycling systems.\n\nI am not sure that I am ready for that level of realism, so choosing this kind of mod is with the lowest priority for now, but nevertheless I would like if you point me to the right one.\n\n **RemoteTech** caught my eye, but this may make the inclination from vanilla way too steep, not to mention all my satellites will go down. Same goes for the mapping and Deadly reentry.\n\nHere is what I am planning to use :\n\n**1. Adding some life in the universe :**\n\n**1.1** [Kerbal Attachment System (KAS) 0.4.10](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-90-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-10) - Hope this will be implemented into vanilla as it adds huge potential for everything.\n\n**1.2** [Kerbal Inventory System (KIS) 1.0.0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-0-90-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-0-0) - Hope I can manage get rid of the \u0022old containers\u0022 and use only the proper ones, as I did read they will replace the KAS ones with those on it\u0027s next version.\n\n**1.3 -** [**Universal Storage 1.0.90.2 (For KSP 0.90) 19th January 2015**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75129-Universal-Storage-1-0-90-2-%28For-KSP-0-90%29-19th-January-2015) **-** This should help with the FPS and also pack neat. Also has hangars for my equipment.\n\n**1.4**  **** [**Kerbal Mechanics: Part Failures and Repairs v0.6.3**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85798-0-90-Kerbal-Mechanics-Part-Failures-and-Repairs-v0-6-3) **** OR Dang It! - Leaning toward the first one, but need your opinion on which one may be better. I think having the option to EVA and repair works nice, do not think Dang it has it ?\n\n**2. Building Modules and Parts** : - Well, basically I am looking for the most stock alike parts, but one thing is what I am really looking for - A cargo bay with doors. \n\nFrom my last vanilla attempt ( [http://s28.postimg.org/cu3ht1v6j/image.png](http://s28.postimg.org/cu3ht1v6j/image.png) ) you can see all those mini vessels attached and all those docking ports made, so they can dock back after mission. \n\nMostly I want different size cargo bays, so I can dock my vessels into and then neatly close them. And ofcourse for various other applications.\n\nI do not really like those inflatable stuff and unfoldable launch pads.\n\n**2.1** - [Fuel Tanks Plus 0.7.1 (2015-03-25)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108238-0-90-WIP-Fuel-Tanks-Plus-0-7-1-%282015-03-25%29) so I can reduce part count and fps drop\n\n**2.2** - [Modular Rocket Systems v1.5.1 (2015-02-10) - Stock-alike Parts Pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93067-0-90-Modular-Rocket-Systems-v1-5-1-%282015-02-10%29-Stock-alike-Parts-Pack) - Is this the one with quad ION and quad Nuke engines ?
