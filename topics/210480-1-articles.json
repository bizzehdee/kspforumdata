Title is issue. Whenever I click on a command pod part in the build menu it acts all buggy. Sometimes it spawns in but I can\u0027t interact with it at all, or other times it just wont spawn in at all. Or if it\u0027s not the first part, it wont be able to be attached. Here\u0027s my modlist:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/9qeCKzL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/9qeCKzL\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame version is latest version\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
