As an aside, so far I\u0027m impressed.\u00A0 The radial control menu\u0027s take a little getting used to, but I\u0027m surprised how easy it is to do things after being used to the keyboard mouse combo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing I can\u0027t work out how to do; in order to choose the option \u0022Warp to next maneuver node\u0022 you have to be on the map screen.\u00A0 Once you start the time warp, is there any way to switch back to the main view, or do you have to stay in map view?\u00A0 It\u0027s not a major issue, but I do like to watch my target getting closer as I travel!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClipper\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-23T00:24:49Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2018 12:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Clipperride\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded tags\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-23T00:24:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found the answer whilst playing this evening.\u00A0 I\u0027m so used to hitting the \u0022M\u0022 key to toggle the map view that I completely forgot there\u0027s a button at the bottom left of the screen you can click on to return to the view of your vessel!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps some future gamer \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-23T05:53:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on which preset you are using, clicking both Left and Right Bumpers together should also toggle\u00A0you into flight view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-23T13:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried that thanks\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0- as it is the default method of switching to and from the map view when using the Radial Control preset.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, for some reason, this doesn\u0027t work when you are warping time.\u00A0 The work around of pressing the left stick to call up the cursor and then clicking the button at the bottom left of the screen isn\u0027t a problem and gives me those satisfying views as I approach my target.\u00A0 Especially as the graphics are better than my laptop was ever able to deliver!\u00A0 I\u0027m hoping that the addition of shadows (again beyond my previous setup) and more detailed terrain (Kerrain?, Munain??) will make landing easier now I don\u0027t have access to the rather excellent Better Burn Time mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT an even quicker way to switch back to the vessel view whilst warping to next maneuver (as long as you are using the Radial Control Preset) is to call up the quick menu (\u2206 on PS4) and select \u0022close map view\u0022 from there.\u00A0 Thanks to the \u0022bullet time\u0022 feature of the radial menu\u0027s, this closes the map almost as quickly and easily as on the PC version\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-25T15:41:03Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2018 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Clipperride\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnother method for closing map screen in warp\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
