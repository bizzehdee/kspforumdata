It might be a little late, but if that happens, ideally you would want to wash the substance away with distilled water. It feels odd, but is the best chance of preventing damage. After that just dry it in mild heat. No blowing, just put it somewhere slightly toasty and leave it alone for however long it needs and then a bit more.
