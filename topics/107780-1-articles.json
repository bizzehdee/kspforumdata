For example, with a simple rocket right after launch I can see a red arrow protruding from the engine bell. Ok so that means red arrows show thrust, or the direction of a force acting on the rocket. But then when I start the gravity turn, red arrows show on the parts of the rocket where you\u0027d expect drag. So red mean drag, then? Or maybe it does mean a force, but why do they point in the wrong direction (i.e. if they represent the force exerted by drag, I\u0027d expect them to point in the opposite direction of movement, because drag slows you down, right?) All of this is confusing for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:19:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lines show drag (red), wing lift (blue), and control surface (yellow) forces.

I think the confusion is because a red arrow always seems to be s coming from the middle of the engine bell, so I thought red had something to do with the engine\u0027s thrust. Still not sure why that happens though, since the engine should be shielded from drag by the rest of the rocket (at least immediately after liftoff when I\u0027m flying straight up).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
