So next up, rover on mun. Problem I don\u0027t have any rover wheels unlocked. Hmm, I do have some wheels from the landing gear for my planes. So I whipped something up and wow, it worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wW5tBjc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wW5tBjc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt landed on it\u0027s tails where the rear 2 legs took the impact from the landing. Then, since there were only 2 legs back there the whole thing slowly tipped forward unto the bottom four legs (retracted in the above screenshot). Once the whole thing settled, the airplane landing gear was deployed, which actually lifted the rover slightly. I had left the bottom legs deployed thinking they would help stabilized the 3 wheeled rover over uneven terrain. But in the end one of the front legs usually caught on something and pinwheeled the whole thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS thrusters provided forward thrust. Unfortunately I didn\u0027t have enough RCS fuel to get anywhere far from where I landed, but it was fun. Relaunching from the surface involved pointing the nose uphill and firing the main engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SGANxUj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SGANxUj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be lonely up there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FITorion","CreatedById":7606,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T01:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis is funny because this is basically what we did before rover wheels were added to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V6MZL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022V6MZL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Mc3no.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Mc3no.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat one is Ion propelled and since the wheels couldn\u0027t turn then...
