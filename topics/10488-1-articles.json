At that point, PhysX stops governing the motion of the spacecraft (therefore precision errors disappear,) and calculations based on the orbital parameters of the object assume the responsibility of determining spacecraft position and velocity."},{"CreatedByName":"chillman1212","CreatedById":16988,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T18:15:39Z","Content":"This has happened to me multiple times while taking my warp back to 1x and 2x.
