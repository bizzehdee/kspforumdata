At first this game wasn\u0027t that interesting to me, then I discovered the \u0022Add-on Releases\u0022 section and the game totally changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started using ScanSat, Remote Tech, Deadly Reentry, those loving USI addons... and few other mods for resources and space station modules.

So I decided to delete everything and restart choosing accurately which mod/plugin/addon/whatever to install. But meh.. what a choice!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, I found my win 8.1 / 64bit install isn\u0027t -that- supported from the game and this is even more complicating things (I suppose)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly... if it\u0027s up to me, I would download everything and go berserk. More stuff, more modules, more everything, more fun. But it doesn\u0027t look to be such a good idea. Even because Some mods apparently don\u0027t support others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently I have \u0022discovered\u0022 the realism overhaul thread which is offering many interesting things, but although I do want something more realistic, I am not sure it suites perfectly to me (I like the challenge of it, but I would love to discover things using ScanSat and have fun with station modules/colonisation, still trying to figure out if it is supported).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end, is there any guide, or package, or anything else that helps choosing the mods in that flooded section?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T14:19:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst - the Windows 64-bit version of KSP/Unity itself is buggy, so you\u0027re always likely to have problems with it.
