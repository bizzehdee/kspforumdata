It explodes at every single joint, sending debris flying everywhere, somehow Jeb in the miner is unharmed, and no kethane is lost cause that was to be my first load, so its back to another wobblingly painful launch to Minmus again with a huge space station, which ends up failing, by then I realized I wasn\u0027t gunna get another up there without cheats and hyper edited it up to Minmus, and guess what.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE KRAKEN ATTACKS IT AGAIN!!!!!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T13:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy station for deploying sacrifices to the Kraken that lives in Jool was devoured and pulled into Jool. my game crashed shortly after.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPRO TIP: Do not play KSP on a Macbook pro.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T13:29:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI only remember veing attacked of the Kraken once.

Just as he landed 5 meters away from the lander, the Hell Kraken struck.

The ship was catapulted out of system at a significant fraction of the speed of light and, according to the mission clock, about six months forward in time. Then the ship vanished, when I jumped back to Kerbin so did the rest of the universe. And it wasn\u0027t just that save it ruined, it corrupted every save I had and every new save I made, I had to reinstall KSP to get it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
