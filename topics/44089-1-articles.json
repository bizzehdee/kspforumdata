But docking two stations that are only equiped with landing struts seems impossible to me. I can land in the vicinity of a station, but to then navigate precisly enough to land with the docking ports perfectly aligned seems extremely difficult to me. Switching from controlling via the navball to visually looking at the craft always messes me up. Sometimes the docking port isn\u0027t on the \u0022front\u0022 and so makes left/right tilt the craft up/down(seen from the position of the docking port being front). This compounds the difficulty. It is hard enough in space. With a surface and gravity to contend with I just can\u0027t do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen several multidocked station on the forums so I know it can be done. Is there a special technique to doing this? I\u0027ve searched to no avail, yet maybe I missed a tutorial somewhere? Or better yet, a video tutorial?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance, fellow kerbinauts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T22:42:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the part being docked doesn\u0027t have wheels, it is usually put in to position and docked on the back of something that does have wheels. That\u0027s how I put my Mun base together anyway. I had a rover type vehicle which was basically a set of wheels with a docking port on top that I would drive under each section, dock with it, raise the legs of the section so that I could then drive it about, and once it was docked with the rest of the base, I would lower the legs and drop off the rover/mover.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-27T22:44:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2013 10:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ohls","CreatedById":78935,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T23:03:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, thanks for you answer!
