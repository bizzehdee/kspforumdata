At the energy levels of typical chemical rocket exhaust, the exhaust particles still interact with the lattice as if it\u0027s a solid. But you are already at the boundaries of it with something like a NERVA. As you get into even higher energies, the binding energy in solids becomes lower than kinetic energy of incoming exhaust. At that point, exhaust doesn\u0027t interact with a solid, but rather with collection of particles that make up a solid. In other words, fluid dynamics takes over. You\u0027ll probably be getting some splash-back, but at much lower energies. You might be getting equivalent of a sand-blasting, but that\u0027s true with pretty much any engine, and hopefully, you\u0027ll cut duration to a minimum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t worry about landing into puddle of molten rock, though.
