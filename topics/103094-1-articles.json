(0 points)\n\nVTOL: Self-explanatory. Launch it from the VAB rather than the SPH. (\u002B5 points)\n\nUniversal I: Don\u0027t use air-breathing engines, even those that can use both (e.g. the RAPIER). (\u002B8 points)\n\nUniversal II: Give it enough delta-V to land and ascend from Tylo (about 5 km/s). Emergency one-time-use staging qualifies for this category. (\u002B15 points)\n\nCome Home I: It must be able to de-orbit itself. Using emergency staging qualifies for this category as well. (\u002B7 points)\n\nCome Home II: Land successfully on Kerbin without damaging the ship. Must deorbit itself. Note that the ship is allowed to fall over after touchdown, but the touchdown itself cannot damage it. (\u002B10 points)\n\nCome Home III: Land successfully on Kerbin without using emergency staging. (\u002B12 points)\n\nCome Home IV: Land your SSTO at the KSC. (\u002B4 points)\n\nAlmost Won: Give it over 11 km/s of delta-V. That\u0027s enough to escape from Eve, although the TWR to do it probably isn\u0027t possible on an SSTO. (\u002B15 points)\n\nComfort: Use a proper capsule or pod rather than an external seat. (\u002B1 point)\n\nCompany: Design it to carry more than one Kerbal. (\u002B3 points)\n\nOld Fashioned I: Use 100% vanilla KSP (not even MechJeb) to achieve orbit. (\u002B3 points)\n\nOld Fashioned II: Using 100% vanilla KSP, prove you didn\u0027t just guess and get it right, but actually did some math. (\u002B8 points)\n\nAmbition I: Send the SSTO craft to another planet and test it for real. All planets and moons in the stock Kerbol system qualify. (\u002B10 points)\n\nAmbition II: Send the SSTO to another planet under its own power and do a successful landing and takeoff. (\u002B15 points)\n\nAmbition III: Successfully send out, land on another planet, takeoff, and return your SSTO back to Kerbin. (\u002B17 points)\n\nAmbition IV: Send out, land on another planet, takeoff, and return your SSTO back to Kerbin, all under its own power. (\u002B25 points)\n\nQuick, Call NASA: Achieve the Come Home II challenge in the Real Solar System mod. (\u002B35 points)\n\nHopper: Touch down more than once and lift back up again. (\u002B5 points)\n\nLightweight I: Have your SSTO weigh less than 50 tons. (\u002B4 points)\n\nLightweight II: Have your SSTO weigh less than 20 tons. (\u002B6 points, but Lightweight I\u0027s points are not included)\n\nAll the Toys: Include more gadgets on the SSTO than necessary, such as remote guidance, SAS, RCS, etc. (\u002B2 points)\n\nTotal points possible: 206\n\nI did this challenge and my final score (having completed VTOL, Universal I, Universal II, Come Home I, Come Home II, Come Home III, Comfort, Lightweight I, and All the Toys) is 64 points, for a modest 31%."},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T14:40:15Z","Content":"Here you go:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
