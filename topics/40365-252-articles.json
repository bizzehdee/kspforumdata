The concept is flawed it you look at it from a realistic point of view anyway, because the power transmission happens with \u0027only\u0027 lightspeed and as such even if you are able to focus on a 1m target you would need to know where the target is in some minutes/hours which is definite impossible with manual craft controlling. So from my point of view when we are on the unrealistic side anyways the addon should allow instant transmission power throttling based on requests from the receiving vessel too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E.
