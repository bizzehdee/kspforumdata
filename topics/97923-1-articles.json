These long craft have docking ports far from the centre of mass. When you rotate these vessels in order to change their orientation, you are rotating around the centre of mass. Since the docking ports are far out, they move a signifcant distance as you rotate the vessel, and this moves them out of the axis of opposing docking port. Switching back and forth is just a chicken and egg game which will go on forever until one or the other actually moves over by the correct amount to place it\u0027s centre of mass on the axis line of the target docking port, and then rotates it\u0027s own docking port into alignment on that same axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this makes sense.
