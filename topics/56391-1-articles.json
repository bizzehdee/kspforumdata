Basically does it get more resource heavy when you go to the Mun etc... ? And I suppose are we expecting later updates to need a better computer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - If I buy from the website in dollars, will the game run in the UK?

It depends on your style. My ships tend to be around 200 parts. On the other hand, I\u0027m sure that you can manage to get pretty much anywhere with only a hundred parts at a time (though you\u0027d need to do a TON of docking).
