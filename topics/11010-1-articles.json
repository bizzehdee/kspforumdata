Landing gear location. This is surprisingly important. Think of your aircraft as one big sea-saw. If you put your rear wheels at the very back, it\\\u0027s going to be near impossible for the elevators to \\\u0027lever\\\u0027 the nose up. The best location for your rear wheels is just behind your aircraft centre of lift (just behind the wings). It DOES mean you have a risk of destroying your tail if you get over excited with your take off, but that\\\u0027s an issue with real world aircraft too...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Keep your aircraft balanced. Unfortunately while burning fuel your weight will shift. As a rule of thumb, it\\\u0027s better to be nose heavy than tail heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Don\\\u0027t bother with ailerons! but do put rudders and elevators on your aircraft.
