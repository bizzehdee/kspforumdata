Using the remains of the space center; now just a few piles of rubbish and a few computers running out of power, the virus worked through all the technologies, and figured out how to search space itself by using portable sub-light radio wave beaming antennae. Just soon after, a disturbance was detected within the outer reaches of the Kerbol system. Radio waves couldn\u0027t penetrate it, and sub-space itself seemed to have been damaged.

The idea was scraped because of the danger it poses to the fine gravitational balance with Kerbol and the planets, but being the NaNo virus, it didn\u0027t care...\n\nSeveral computational cycles have passed, the NaNo virus has synthesized enough graviton particles, and is prepared to launch them into a single concentrated point, which should have compressed the space between the Kerbol and Solar system enough to where it would take a matter of minutes to cross... but it didn\u0027t work that way. The rift was opened, but instead... it led to our world. All of a sudden, there were no limits; no game engine to power it down, nothing to give it bounds. It started to invade computers, one by one. Already, a few have been affected beyond repair, and I hope I will not be one of those.

The first one was shortly after I put the finishing touches on a 667,000 ton rocket (yes, that big, look in my posts) the game was crippled. Couldnt launch. Ships being built in the VAB lost parts midway through construction. Everything was bleak. It even spread through game installs, tearing into the stock game. Then, I built a 1.1 million ton rocket (yes, 1.1 million tons, RSS for you) and it ripped itself apart on the pad, throwing launch clamps on suborbital trajectories.

To fix it in that circumstance, it would require a quicksave. No other circumstance is like this. You would need to restore your orbital parameters to a launching configuration, and possibly edit your fuel level back to normal. Basically just a hard reset.\n\nEDIT: Though, another look at the picture, the air pressure gauge thinks I\u0027m in space... I didn\u0027t intend to actually launch; just some seat positioning tests.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T08:08:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 08:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T13:53:23Z","Content":"Yeah...
