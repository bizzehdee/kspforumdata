It doesn\u0027t happen with 1 hitchhiker, gotta have 2 to get the message. Connecting fuel tanks doesn\u0027t help. Fuel lines won\u0027t attach. Am I missing something, or is this a bug?

We\u0027ll see if I can complete the contract. Funny thing is, this was the first time I have ever tried to use fuel lines to do asparagus staging. Just before I thought I was ready to launch, I checked the engineer\u0027s report and found this message. Of course I thought it was something I had done with the fuel lines and spent far too long rechecking my plumbing. Finally I just started tearing pieces off the ship until all I had left was a pod on top of 2 HHs, and still the message was there, but it went away when I took away one HH. Came back if I reattached it. The pod was the 1 kerbal octagon pod. iirc it is called a lander can.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T12:32:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 12:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T12:30:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like an interesting bug.
