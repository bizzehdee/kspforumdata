I get the feeling this craft has the fuel to do that, but it\u0027s so excruciatingly difficult to fly efficiently that I haven\u0027t even been able to get it out of the atmosphere (And the few times I\u0027ve been able to get the Apoapsis above 70 km, I\u0027ll do a Physics warp to get out of the atmosphere, and the drone core will spontaneously explode), even when I do fly the proper ascent profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the SSTO in question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9CrbTIq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229CrbTIq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft File: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/nq58lvkhwysad81/Starchaser%20Mk2.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/nq58lvkhwysad81/Starchaser%20Mk2.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest thing that\u0027s driving me crazy is how hard it is to break 400 m/s with this craft.

I\u0027m honestly not quite sure where I can cut down on drag, and I really don\u0027t want to add another engine or two.
