Specifically, it would take the amount of science required to complete a tree (e.g. 50,000), multiply by x, and divide that number up between celestial bodies based on their wiki science multipliers. So minus might end up with a total available science of 2,000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve hit the maximum allocation for a body, its science multiplier would be reduced to say, 0.1x.
