They may be selectable from a menu. Lets say, you save positions of followers relative to the leader when engaging time warp. Than, during the warp, ships drift. Upon setting up a maneuver node, followers set up and perform interception burns, that will get them back to the leader after a breaking burn, some time before the maneuver. You may have to force dropping out of warp in time to kill relative velocity.
