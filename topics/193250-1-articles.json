Once I was confident I had set my periapsis at a proper altitude, I ditched my booster and placed my CM into the\u00A0degrading orbit... eventually resulting in my CM landing on Kerbin. Since I ditched the booster on my first aerobraking pass, it drifted\u00A0so far that it was outside of \u201Cphysics range\u201D by the time I made re-entry. Based upon the fact that my CM successfully aerobraked, and re-entered, I assumed that my booster would have a similar, albeit slightly more destructive, fate. After giving it little thought, and after a few in game years, to my surprise, I see debris on a suborbital path around kerbin, but the debris never appears to drop from orbit (when viewed in the tracking station).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question, if things are outside of \u201Cphysics range,\u201D or not being \u003Ci\u003Edirectly\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0observed, do things like atmospheric drag, or craft/debris collision not happen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stamp20","CreatedById":202020,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-19T16:32:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s not in physics range, KSP puts it \u0022on rails\u0022 and doesn\u0027t do any sort of collision or physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-19T16:33:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed not. unless you focus, on it or get within physics range, it just stays on rails forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless it gets too close to the surface (under 20km on kerbin) then it just disappears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
