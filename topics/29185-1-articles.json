Now, when you click on a customizable ASAS module in the Action Group editor, you will have the option to configure up to 3 PID settings for that ASAS module. If you configure 2 or more PID settings, a set of Actions will appear that can be assigned to Action Groups, which will allow you to switch between PID settings in-flight. For example, you could set up an ASAS module with an Avionics setting (Ki = 0.0, Kp = 0.2, Kd = 0.2) and an ASAS setting (Ki = 1.0, Kp = 0.6, Kd = 1.0), and assign the switch to the same button that changes your SABRE rocket settings - so that when you switch to air-breathing mode, your ASAS changes to the Avionics control scheme, and when you switch to rocket mode, your ASAS changes back to the Rocket control scheme. You could also set up two separate control schemes for low-mach and high-mach, or for early-stage and late-stage for rockets that drastically change their control authority as they stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChanges in 1.0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - merged Advanced and Basic distributions; the Advanced version is now simply a set of configuration files in RealFuels.zip - if you want to play with LOX and LH2 and realistic nuclear engines, unzip RealFuels.zip after unzipping ModularFuelTanks.zip\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- moved the install folder to /GameData/ModularFuelTanks instead of /GameData/Ialdabaoth (doesn\u0027t change anything, but people can read it better)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ditched using Liters in the advanced version, because apparently I suck at the maths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Xenon is no longer absurdly heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All engine heats are halved, so that they won\u0027t explode in DeadlyReentry 2.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat it does:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdvanced Version Only:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

It identifies three new resources: LiquidH2, which is an extremely light cryogenic fuel, LiquidOxygen, which is a highly efficient but cryogenic oxidizer, and nuclearFuel, which is a heavy resource used by RNGs and nuclear engines. \u0022Cryogenic\u0022 means that you will be able to store slightly less of them (usually 99%) than regular LiquidFuel/LiquidOxygen, and that they will slowly evaporate over time (usually on the order of about 1% per week, depending on temperature).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. It redefines the fuel ratios for all stock, KSPX, and KW engines from 0.9 LiquidFuel/1.1 Oxidizer to one of four possibilities, each of which are used by real-world rockets (hey, if it\u0027s good enough for NASA...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - 0.4 LiquidFuel / 0.6 Oxidizer (for cheap rockets)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - 0.35 LiquidFuel / 0.65 LiquidOxygen (for big boosters)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - 0.73 LiquidH2 / 0.27 LiquidOxygen (for high-Isp rockets)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - 1.0 LiquidH2 / 0.00000000000001 nuclearFuel (for nuclear rockets)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. It adds a new submenu on the \u0027Action Group Editor\u0027 menu of the VAB whenever you select a liquid fuel rocket, that allows you to switch fuel types for that rocket - so you can change a rocket\u0027s fuel type from 0.4LiquidFuel/0.6Oxidizer to 0.35LiquidFuel/0.65LiquidOxygen, which will adjust the rocket\u0027s Isp and thrust. In general:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquidFuel/Oxidizer is what you\u0027re used to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquidFuel/LiquidOxygen will give you slightly higher thrust and slightly higher Isp, but the fuel is cryogenic so you\u0027ll hold a little less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquidH2/LiquidOxygen will give you moderately lower thrust but MUCH higher Isp, and again the fuel is cryogenic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclearRockets cannot currently be changed, but I might change this since apparently there are real-world mods to NERVA that use LH2/LOX.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdvanced and Basic Versions\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. It adds a new submenu on the \u0027Action Group Editor\u0027 menu of the VAB whenever you select a fuel tank, which allows you to completely customize what (and how much) fuel goes into that tank. Most tanks can hold any ratio of LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, LiquidH2, LiquidOxygen, XenonGas and MonoPropellant that you desire, but some tanks will be more efficient at holding some resources than others. There is also a button for \u0022Remove All Tanks\u0022, and a series of buttons for \u0022Configure Remaining Volume to {engine mixture}\u0022 which appear whenever you add an engine - i.e., if you add an engine that takes 35% LiquidFuel and 65% LiquidOxygen, a button will appear that allows you to fill any remaining volume with that ratio of resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings to keep in mind with this mod:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You really don\u0027t appreciate how light LH2 is until you start using it. Nuclear rockets require an INSANE amount of space for fuel, although they\u0027ll be incredibly light compared to other rockets of the same bulk. Don\u0027t be afraid to put some big orange tanks on and fill them with LH2; they\u0027ll barely weigh as much as a standard-size tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Symmetry is automatically preserved as you edit, so if you have 3 identical tanks in a 3-fold symmetry and attach a rocket to the bottom of each, then change one of those rocket\u0027s fuel mixtures, all three rockets will automatically match. Likewise with the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. With so many options (each with their own advantage and disadvantage), the Advanced version really does put you in \u0022hard mode\u0022. Only install this if you\u0027re looking for a challenge. Otherwise, if you just want to customize tanks but don\u0027t want to worry about LH2 or LOX, download the \u0022Basic\u0022 version.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-23T15:12:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2013 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ialdabaoth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T03:34:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESweet.

Is there any benefit to be gained in going from 0.45:0.55 to 0.4:0.6? Like I said, this dynamic is the only thing stopping me from using the \u0027advanced\u0027 mode, because I\u0027m wary of mods that change the core underlying game.

And as for mixtures, you\u0027ll find that my fuel mixtures are actually derived from the figures you quoted (your mod was actually the inspiration for mine). For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E73% LH2 \u002B 27% O2 by volume. With LH2 density at 0.00045 and LOX density at 0.007 (which are actually their real densities in Kerbos, where one Kerbo = 1 volume unit (6.25 Liters, if you measure the tanks and do the math), that actually works out to a 5.76 fuel ratio by mass, which is well within the range (1:4 to 1:8) that LH2/LOX engines run. Likewise, if you look at the Isp of all the LH2\u002BLOX mixes, they\u0027re in the 390 - 460 range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E35% RP1 \u002B 65% LOX by volume. With RP1 density at 0.005 and LOX density at 0.007, that\u0027s a mass ratio of 1:2.6 - pretty close to the 1:2.56 listed above. If you look at the Isp of the RP1\u002BLOX mixes, they\u0027re in the 300 - 370 range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E45% RP1 \u002B 55% N2O4. You\u0027re right that that\u0027s not a common fuel mix, but I didn\u0027t want to add too many fuel types, and I figure \u0022Oxidizer\u0022 isn\u0027t NECESSARILY N2O4, it\u0027s just some non-cryogenic oxidizer (who knows, maybe it\u0027s even H2O2). In any case, with an Oxidizer density of 0.008, that\u0027s a mass ratio of just about 1:2, and they all have Isps in the 250 - 330 range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Nuclear engines, note that the amount of NuclearMaterial used as propulsion is so close to 0 as to BE 0; the rest of it is just used for the Generator and Alternator, where it gets turned into NuclearWaste. And all of it is non-pumpable; it\u0027s just there to track how much there is in case I ever make a mod that lets you scavenge parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-02T03:51:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2013 03:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ialdabaoth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
