Let me know if the report belongs somewhere else. I hope you don\u0027t mind this sort of report, I know it\u0027s nit-picky! \n\n**KSP Version:** \n\n1.0 on OSX\n\n**What Happens:**\n\n\u0022enter\u0022 key fails to dismiss the mission summary dialog\n\n**Mods / Add-Ons:**\n\nnone\n\n**Steps to Replicate:**\n\nGo to VAB, pick a pod, press \u0022launch\u0022.\n\nThen press \u0022recover vessel\u0022. The Mission summary dialog appears.\n\n**Result:**\n\nContrary to expectation, pressing \u0022enter\u0022 does not dismiss the dialog (it does nothing). \n\n**Fixes/Workarounds:**\n\nMove hand to mouse, click the \u0022Done\u0022 button\n\n**Other Notes/Pictures/Log Files**:\n\n\u0022esc\u0022 doesn\u0027t dismiss the dialog either, which is correct - that matches my expectations (\u0022esc\u0022 is for auto-pressing the cancel button and there isn\u0027t one here)."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:29:27Z","Content":"This would be a feedback issue on the public tracker, things like this, while not bugs, are still usability issues and having the ability to dismiss the dialogue with the enter key could be useful.\n\nPlease see the stickies for info on the public tracker ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"nohelmet","CreatedById":99742,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:41:17Z","Content":"Thank you!
