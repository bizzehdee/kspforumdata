Ignore this post then. Keep up the great work, the mod is fantastic!\n\u003E \n\nThe main problem I have is that these settings are not reflected in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E life support monitor thingy.  Which is my main frustration with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS: \u0022Just how much dang life support do I have anyway?!\u0022.  The numbers seem to have no relation to the actual amount of life support, and once you add in recycling and agroponics, I\u0027m either completely guessing or having to break out Excel and a slide rule to figure out whether this mission can get to Duna and back. \n\nIt\u0027s too bad, I really like MKS and USILS together, but I\u0027ve had to switch back to TAC, because at least with it, the numbers make sense and are reflective of reality.\n\n/Rant mode off.\n\n//Still love your mods RD!"},{"CreatedByName":"PocketBrotector","CreatedById":135814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-26T05:56:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, archnem said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The main problem I have is that these settings are not reflected in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E life support monitor thingy.

It seems that the various life support tooltips and windows in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E are not consistent so there\u0027s not a great way of seeing what hab times, etc., one is actually going to get. I have been using Alt-F12 to get into orbit to find out what the actual in-flight values will be. This also helps to plan out power requirements, since there is currently no way to see how much electricity is required for habitats.\n\n[Here](http://imgur.com/7PNdvMG) is an overview of the readout issues using a craft with just the three stock parts:\n\n- Recycler readout in the part tooltip always reads 0%\n- Hab multiplier shows up as zero in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E life support summary\n- Hab time (kerbal-months) per part is inconsistent between part tooltip and life support summary\n- Total calculated hab-time does not reflect in-flight value\n\nI\u0027m also still trying to figure out what the CrewCapacity value in ModuleHabitation represents - it doesn\u0027t always reflect the part\u0027s actual crew capacity (see the cupola), but I don\u0027t know how it\u0027s incorporated into the overall formula for total habitation time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-26T06:08:55Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2016 06:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PocketBrotector**"}]}
