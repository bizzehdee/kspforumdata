The idea was to use nose cone advange while in atmosphere and then detach it when in space.\n\nI was surprised than i saw that **rocket with added separator / decoupler performs better than without it !!!**\n\n![ghgRoWj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ghgRoWj.jpg)\n\nThis is also true for other types of **small** nose cones.\n\n![1YkE60D.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1YkE60D.jpg)\n\nBut this doesn\u0027t improve larger rockets\n\n![fAIA703.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fAIA703.jpg)\n\nWas this already know to someone? Was this intended? \n\nI also made video about this discovery. If photos isn\u0027t enough for someone and if You want to see how test was done...

And... can nose cone really impact performanse so much??? Keep in mind that separator adds additional 0.075t mass...\n\n(BTW rocket in left accelerates faster, but rocket on right reaches highermax speed. And this is with small Fuel amount... In larger rockets this difference will be way more noticeble.

The difference is even bigger at lower altitudes.\n\nMaybe try both cases 75% or 50% thrust, so that it doesn\u0027t hit speed of sound too low? The point is to control the differences of their transonic drag coming from altitude (not because of shape)."},{"CreatedByName":"Bzz","CreatedById":142563,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T09:38:57Z","Content":"Another test.

Notice how mass is not a factor in that equation?\n\nIt\u0027s similar for watercraft; a longer hull is generally faster than a shorter hull, even though it\u0027s heavier, due to the reduction in drag (but the shorter/lighter ship will accelerate faster, thanks to superior TWR).\n\nShaving mass gains you acceleration and \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV by increasing TWR. Increasing maximum atmospheric speed, OTOH, is all about drag and thrust (note, *not* TWR). Especially if you\u0027re dealing with supersonic speeds at relatively low altitudes, a tiny reduction in drag can have a massive effect on speed.\n\nHowever, because you\u0027re aiming to launch rockets vertically instead of set speed records horizontally, you\u0027ve got gravity as well as drag losses to deal with. Gravity losses are controlled by TWR (the more the better) and ascent path (the more horizontal the better).\n\nAs you may notice, the methods to reduce gravity losses are sometimes in direct opposition to the methods to reduce drag losses. Exactly which factor should have higher priority at any given moment is going to vary substantially based upon a host of variables related to ship design and intended mission."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T16:02:08Z","Content":"Add an RCS tank below the capsule in both vessels, then adjust the monoprop mass until they mass exactly the same.
