The effect of their proficiency and/or specialisation should not, in my opinion, impact too much on the player\u0027s own skills for piloting or building, imo. If you can\u0027t fly a craft because your Kerbal is too inexperienced, even though you\u0027d normally be able to do it just fine, even unmanned, that\u0027s something of a game-breaker for a lot of people, in my opinion. Science is abit iffish as-is, and is probably going to see a fair bit of rebalancing in future, but even then I don\u0027t see the need to have specialised Kerbals for it, really.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T05:14:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I read this, I thought you wanted to make kerbals bigger..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T06:05:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can see pilots nominally increasing the flight capabilities of a ship (maybe slightly higher SAS torque and part collision resistance to represent good maneuvering skills) and scientists increasing the science output from gathering data/analyzing it if occupying labs.

Now I think that\u0027s a whole new can of worms, because I wouldn\u0027t want to have to return Kerbals all the way home if they are inhabitants of a far-off base. Maybe having their effectiveness slowly increase upon introduction to a ship, stay at peak for awhile, then gradually go down again until they are rotated into a different (fully separate) craft? Additionally, if they are moved back to their original ship prematurely, the effectiveness would go back to where it was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay Jeb (a pilot) is launched into LKO. His effect would start at \u002B1% torque and collision. After awhile as he got more comfortable with the workings of the ship, it would slowly raise to \u002B10%. It would stay there for quite some time, but eventually he would get bored and complacent, where his effectiveness would start going back down. If he were transferred to a new ship at \u002B5% and sent back right away, he would return to \u002B5% and dropping because the long stay with it is still fresh in his mind. But if he were allowed to stay in the new ship and gain some experience there, his potential effectiveness on the original ship would go back in the cycle, raising it again if he were rotated back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize if it\u0027s too complicated to follow; I could explain it better with a white board in real life. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I\u0027d also be perfectly happy with static bonuses that didn\u0027t require any special crew treatment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T06:10:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s a very cool idea.
