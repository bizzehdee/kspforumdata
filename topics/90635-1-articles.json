All other behaviors are components added to a GameObjects. e.g. a GameObject with light component becomes a light/shadow casting object ; a GO with mesh filter and mesh renderer components become a visible 3d object; etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea max dummy will become an empty Unity GameObject. but if you are place them as thrustTransforms or RCSThrusters, it\u0027s better to add them in Unity. Max and Unity has different orientation system and it can be a little confusing importing objects from Max to Unity\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
