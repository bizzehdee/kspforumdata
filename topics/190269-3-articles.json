for the somewhat late update, ive just bee stupidly busy IRL (although i get good money and enjoy what i do, my job takes way too many effin hours out of my life, and i had no real time to actually update my craft until now).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIve also thought how to best add my universe to yours, and the only way i can see that happening is to attribute all my ships to Replitech (RT) which is purely a company that sells vessels.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAKS in my universe has nothing on kerbin besides a few minor allies (none of which have any capability to launch ships or do squat military wise), and they are currently based on Duna and Dres, so if your factions ever actually make it to either of those 2 planets then i see it possible to have AKS be an actual faction that can be added and not go against lore, otherwise the only way AKS can be added and not mess up my universe\u0027s lore is as a random encounter in space.\u00A0 Their ships are available through RT as sold to anyone who has money so you can just say they were sold to either of your 2 major factions (albeit they are rare and expensive since the only way for RT to obtain AKS tech is by repairing old hulls in space).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBCorp has kerbin presense but doesnt own any surface infrastructure (there is none after a massive war wiped it all out before BCorp even existed), and like everyone else who remains kerbin bound, does everything in underground facilities, shipping their vessels through tunnels to the 3 space launch points available (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, desert, and the north one).\u00A0 If you want, you can include BCorp as an actual kerbin faction, but they would not have any surface presense, their facilities are virtually indestructible as they are deep undergroud and seismic weapons dont exist in universe (so no destroying their HQ), and they would primarily be added to story as ally of your less technologically advanced faction (dont remember which 1 that is) since they are currently severely limited in what they can deploy after AKS wiped out virtually all their research, scientists, ect at the end of the last major conflict (second battle of minmus), and its very unlikely to change any time soon in universe.\u00A0 BCorp as of this moment possesses almost entirely space forces, a few tanks (all of my vehicles need a major overhaul as most are stock and stock wont stand a chance vs BDA so i wont even bother posting these), and some supply/utility vessels.\u00A0 Their current goal is to restart their Mun mining operation after loosing it to AKS

Kerbin.\u00A0 Created the AI that formed AKS by accident when trying to make unmanned weapons smarter, and ever since have been at war with AKS and its allies.\u00A0 Currently won 2nd battle of

afterthought.\u00A0 It was originally created to try and give BCorp a survivable ship that wasnt immediately blown to bits by advanced torpedoes, and it did just that.\u00A0 Quickly became the number 1 hated vessel of anyone hostile to BCorp with many cases of the best ships completely depleting their ammo and still not fully removing a Broadsword from the battlefield, and due to its low cost and ease of manufacture, when 1 was destroyed, 2 more would take its place a week later.\u00A0 It changed alot from initial versions, but the current model fixed the ship\u0027s massive ammunition problem (older series were armed with a single SRM-6M which was inferior to a bomber offensively), at the cost of having less anti-ship weapons.\u00A0 Armed with 2 SRM-1M and 4 SRM-4L (very good against fighters with lots and lots of light missiles, only 2 medium ones that will damage capitals).\u00A0 Like most BCorp ships, its a bit high on parts, you might want to swap the SRM-4Ls with SRM-1Ms as the light SRMs are basically useless against capital ships and eat alot of parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca

have like 10ish of them in warehouses from earlier manufacture), the longsword offers good range and firepower that gives it a chance in a 1v1 against AKS warships.\u00A0 Armor is paper thin against G

warships that were deployed to devastating effect throughout the 2nd battle of Minmus.\u00A0 While the project utterly failed at creating an equal, it managed to build a ship entirely out of new tech which could be manufactured by anyone on Kerbin and was able to survive anything but a very unlucky shot from AKS G series torpedoes.\u00A0 The 1st prototype was finished and immediately blown to bits by AKS (it did claim a Nebula as its 1st kill but they got swarmed), but engineers didnt give up hope, made modifications, and the 2nd prototype supported by 2 broadswords, a longsword and a squadron of fighters managed to defeat a AKS strike group around Kerbin composed of 3 vulture squadrons, 1 nova, 1 starlight, and even a pirate controlled Vanguard class battlecruiser with just the loss of the longsword (considering how much stronger AKS ships are and that they had 3 times the number of fighters thats actually very impressive).\u00A0 The ability to carry starfighters was never taken advantage of in combat, so they may be removed to save parts and or improve armor/firepower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca

and constantly been updating them for nostalgia and the fact that they really make solid fighters with regards to everything but armor (super agile, small enough to stack 8 of them in a carrier with ease, nose mounted guns are very accurate).\u00A0 They were originally sold in lore by Allied Shipyards (bought out by RT a long time ago), and are used by every single faction in my universe to some degree except for AKS ) they used to be 2nd line, but were phased out and replaced by the even cheaper and unmanned Berserker series).\u00A0 The current updated refit model featured high powered monoprop thrusters for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E that exceeds any other fighter, and after arming with a single SRM-4L, it has enough firepower to engage any starfighter, enough ammo to allow the occasional bad aim, and they are light so that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E doesnt suffer much.\u00A0 They can fit the Warhammer class no problem but are normally deployed from 100% pure starfighter carriers which have the range and fuel to resupply them properly.\u00A0 Not very popular among pilots due to lack of protection (pretty much anything that direct hits the pod is lethal and not just disabling), but respected by even the best pilots due to the sheer agility and speed (not to mention its not exactly easy to hit a fighter so bloody small).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/w85arkdmgfvhfdv/BC%20Micro-C%20Refit%20Launcher.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external

is not very common due to a continuous demand for the tugs the pidgeon is based on (BCorp sells those to civilians), but its well liked due to the heavy armor plating thats uncommon on starfighters

to both the vulture and berserker series and can even engage a tri-fighter although the latter\u0027s medium SRMs are capable of 1-shotting the Pidgeon making it risky to try (very few pilots in

their hands on (hence the trashy look random wing parts and structural tube sticking out of the side that was strutted together).\u00A0 Its remained operational in high Kerbin orbit ever since and has engaged both AKS and BCorp forces, constantly changing ownership as 1 pirate faction steals it from its previous owner.\u00A0 You are free to blow this thing apart as many times as you want as in lore it just keeps getting rebuilt/recreated by someone in the underground pirate world.\u00A0 Also, please keep the name and dont deploy more then 1 of them at a time, its supposed to be 1 of a kind that

up since i lost the old files and many of those are from KSP version 0.24 and will likely not even work like at all.\u00A0 Its not armed but i will have LRM launcher modules and probably a SRM turret (or just use BDA for weapons) to provide the complex itself with some degree of protection.\u00A0 Its badly needed since BCorp has finally managed to clear AKS from orbit and got their mothership to drag the old-tech refinery module which is compatible with this style of base system to the mun (this will function as the core the refinery attaches to and ill need to make a solar reactor to power it as well as a radiator module as well to make the drills/refinery not cook itself too
