However, I always get stability Isssues at about 7500-20000 meters. The roket just suddenly turns, as ift its top were drawn to the earth. I tried moving the SAS and installing winglets, but it didnt help. My current design is in the Attachment. I already checked the center of mass and thrust, and cant find any assymetries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T13:56:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWholey smokes!
