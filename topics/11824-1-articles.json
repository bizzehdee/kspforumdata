However, I always get stability Isssues at about 7500-20000 meters. The roket just suddenly turns, as ift its top were drawn to the earth. I tried moving the SAS and installing winglets, but it didnt help. My current design is in the Attachment. I already checked the center of mass and thrust, and cant find any assymetries."},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T13:56:55Z","Content":"Wholey smokes! I haven\\\u0027t flown it yet but I already know what\\\u0027s wrong with it ....\n\nedit:\n\na) you have WAY too much fuel and rocket to do the job. You can halve all of that and still get to the Mun. Removing rockets will reduce your thrust but it also reduces your weight. \n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) your craft is so heavy it is uncontrollable. I got it to 22000 straight up, which is more than your best, but as soon as I tried a gravity turn the beast just feel over. \n\nc) you have WAY too much fuel ...\n\nd) you\\\u0027re not using symmetry in the VAB. You should be using the \\\u0027three\\\u0027 setting so everything is balanced right. That\\\u0027s not causing any problems this time but it\\\u0027s a good habit to get into so you don\\\u0027t cause heartache for yourself later on.\n\nOn the plus side, interesting staging. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"prince_of_savoy","CreatedById":27400,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T14:08:07Z","Content":"thnx.

See if you can drop some engines sooner. You have to wait the length of 5 LFE tanks before you can shed your first lot of engines. See if you can get rid of that sooner."},{"CreatedByName":"majineko","CreatedById":12254,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T23:26:11Z","Content":"I got to the Mun with your craft pretty easily.

But anyway, I have built a new craft already thats more stable."}]}
