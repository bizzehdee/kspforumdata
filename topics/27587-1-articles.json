It only requires the kethane pack as 1 of its features is it can hold 40k of kethane all the other parts are stock(yes I know I cheated and used MechJeb to get it into a 85km orbit because I freely admit my piloting skills SUCK but I didn\u0027t use infinite fuel or any other cheats that was the only cheat I used) and you see how little fuel was left. I will give you a tip on the 2nd stage SRB you want to manually jettison it with about 1-2 secs of thrust left cause if you don\u0027t it tends to crash into the main ship cause a rather unfortunate explosion \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E. I know it can probably be improved by better Kerbalnauts than me I will post a link to the craft file as I can find a place to upload it to.
