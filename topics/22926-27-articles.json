There\u0027s some other stuff in there too, like the Hog IVA, but that\u0027s only half finished.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spacex34","CreatedById":66275,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T17:47:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOMG Epic mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat work\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JonoRig","CreatedById":57882,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T17:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat is all\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torminator","CreatedById":78617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T18:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI AM HAVING A CRISIS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStellar work.
