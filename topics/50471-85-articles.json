Jool lacks PQS and has only the static mesh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe static mesh is spherical mesh transformed to fit the planet\u0027s terrain and given a diffuse map (the colors) and a normal map (the bumpiness you can see from high orbit). In stock KSP, since the terrain is already known, (and ditto for PlanetFactory IIRC) the meshes are prebuilt to follow the procedural terrain and just loaded as they are; in RSS, each load, I reconfigure the meshes to comport to the PQS. Since these are static meshes with a single texture page each diffuse/normal, so they have a hard limit of 8192 pixels wide for each texture. This means, when you are viewing a CB in scaled space, you literally *cannot* make it less blurry beyond a certain point (well, if you remade the mesh to have *multiple* textures, you could, but 8192x4096 is 32MB of ram each).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do *not*, however, remake the texture on each load (it takes about 40 minutes for my i7 to render an 8192x4096 map of a planet), though RSS can be configured to do that (the Export node in the cfg, when reenabled [i.e. foo removed] will export diffuse and bump maps of the given size for that body).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dynamic terrain is the terrain you can see from very low orbit and from within the atmosphere/on the ground. It is dynamically generated into a sphere subdivided into quadtrees (Planet Quadtree Sphere) and then each vertex (and other things) are modified by all PQSMod components (like a heightmap component, or a simple noise component, or a City component that adds a static mesh...).

I did verify that all my stuff does at least work in .23.5 so I didn\u0027t feel the urgency to roll out an insta-fix.\u003Cp\u003ESpacedInvader: Ah, maybe I should back up a bit--and forgive me if this is info that you already know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECelestial bodies other than Jool are rendered in two ways in KSP: via procedural terrain (PQS) when close, and via a static textured mesh (the scaled space mesh) when far away. Jool lacks PQS and has only the static mesh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe static mesh is spherical mesh transformed to fit the planet\u0027s terrain and given a diffuse map (the colors) and a normal map (the bumpiness you can see from high orbit). In stock KSP, since the terrain is already known, (and ditto for PlanetFactory IIRC) the meshes are prebuilt to follow the procedural terrain and just loaded as they are; in RSS, each load, I reconfigure the meshes to comport to the PQS. Since these are static meshes with a single texture page each diffuse/normal, so they have a hard limit of 8192 pixels wide for each texture. This means, when you are viewing a CB in scaled space, you literally *cannot* make it less blurry beyond a certain point (well, if you remade the mesh to have *multiple* textures, you could, but 8192x4096 is 32MB of ram each).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do *not*, however, remake the texture on each load (it takes about 40 minutes for my i7 to render an 8192x4096 map of a planet), though RSS can be configured to do that (the Export node in the cfg, when reenabled [i.e. foo removed] will export diffuse and bump maps of the given size for that body).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dynamic terrain is the terrain you can see from very low orbit and from within the atmosphere/on the ground. It is dynamically generated into a sphere subdivided into quadtrees (Planet Quadtree Sphere) and then each vertex (and other things) are modified by all PQSMod components (like a heightmap component, or a simple noise component, or a City component that adds a static mesh...). Once all PQSMods have been applied (in their specified order) the quad can be rendered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55145-0-23-WIP-Alpha-Real-Solar-System-v5-5-KSP23-fix-12-23-13?p=992302\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post992302\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E is a previous post of mine detailing PQSmods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to increase the fineness of the terrain (so it doesn\u0027t look so flat/angular/low-detail), you can increase maxLevels (it\u0027s commented out, IIRC, in v6pre) which will increase the maximum subdivision of the PQS beyond what you have set in Terrain Quality. I run with 14, which means my MET is often yellow but I get very pretty coastlines in Florida. If you want to increase the roughness, your best bet is playing with deformity and frequency of the various PQSMods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, summary: PQS and its mods is the dynamic terrain (that usually is a heightmap and some noise/fractal-based things to create terrain below the resolution of the heightmap), then the result of that is \u0022rendered\u0022 if you will to a mesh and two textures for the static scaled-space object you only see when far away (like, 120km or more--in RSS, 200km or more IIRC) from the body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, this would explain why the surface of the CB tends to \u0022evaporate\u0022 as you descend to land. The static mesh is giving way to the dynamic terrain. I\u0027m guessing this happens in stock as well, but because the static mesh is 100% match to the dynamic, you don\u0027t see the switch, or at least not as easily. That being said, the heightmap does affect the PQS dynamic output, so I guess my desire to try and increase it\u0027s resolution somehow still stands. I will also go back to messing with the PQS modifiers to see if I can come up with something less drastic (75km is pretty big), but also with much more definition so landing and exploring is much more challenging and fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T07:37:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKonstantine the Great: It\u0027s been out for about 2 months, altough not on the OP.

I think this may be the result of how those features are created compared to normal craters. That being said I\u0027ve been able to tweak the munar surface into something interesting again at least and some issues at least I\u0027m almost sure stem from the massive increase in distances associated with the rescale... if the planet is 10x larger, an object is then 10x farther away so it would have to be 10x larger to appear the same as if you were closer to it. I may just have to accept a much different appearance than what I\u0027ve gotten used to in stock and just be happy that I\u0027ve been able to turn the surface into something better than flat. I would definitely still like to see the rest of the system with the higher resolution heightmaps though, and would be interested in how you went about making the one for Kerbin. I should also mention that I\u0027ve tried now for a couple of hours to get the PQS to work for Minmus as well and just can\u0027t seem to get it do do much more than the old flat plain that I found originally on the Mun.
