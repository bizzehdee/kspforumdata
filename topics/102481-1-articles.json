I never got past about 220 m/s. So here\u0027s a challenge: build something that can go faster than 320 m/s below 500 meters!\n\nRules:\n\n- No mods, other than visual and information mods. you may use FAR, but you will have to state that in your post. you will be put in a different scoreboard.\n\n- Do not go higher than 500 meters above sea level(duh).\n\n- Do not use rocket engines. only airbreathing engines are allowed because they are so efficient.\n\n- NO use of glitches like infiniglide or flapping with lots of control surfaces. if any such glitches/exploits are used, you are no longer allowed to post any submissions on this thread and all your posts will be deleted immediately.\n\n- The entire flight must take place below 500 meters, and you may not use a dive to increase speed. remember, this is about straight flight.\n\nThere will be a leaderboard; the fastest person is the winner!\n\n**\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9Good luck!**\n\n**Leaderboards:**\n\nStock KSP:\n\n1.
