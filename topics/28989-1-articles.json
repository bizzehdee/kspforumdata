Compare that to Kerbin and even Earth, which both have a atmospheric pressure at sea level of 101 kilopascals. KSP seems to have a somewhat realistic representation of atmospheres, except for the fact that they thin out at a much higher rate than for normal atmospheres. This exponential atmospheric fading is probably in the game to make it easier to get to orbit, like how celestial bodies in KSP are 10x smaller than what their gravity\u0027s should allow, increasing the rate of curvature and decreasing orbital speed and d/v needed to get to orbit. (with the much smaller size and faster tapering atmosphere, you only need around 4200-4500 d/v to get to Kerbin orbit. Compare that to 9400 m/s for Earth orbit, which is very similar to the d/v cost for an Eve ascent.
