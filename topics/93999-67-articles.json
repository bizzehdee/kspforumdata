That\u0027s right, OPM is getting a so-called subsatellite or a moon of a moon. There is no known confirmed real-life example of such a thing, but scientists have calculated it would be possible for certain moons to have small stable satellites around them, specifically Rhea and Iapetus. The cause of Iapetus\u0027 equatorial ridge has also been theorized to have been caused by moon that has since been destroyed or ejected. Since Iapetus is a partial inspiration for Wal and Urlum\u0027s other moons also have a unique relationship (Priax is a trojan moon of Polta), Tal felt like a perfect fit for Wal and a great way to add another small moon that did feel unique.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EPlease no.

Subsatellite (I\u0027m glad the name stuck) is a splendid idea, highly eccentric one is even more, but Wal is too close to Urlum for it. Such system could not survive even one orbital period and after few wobbly orbits the subsatellite would either be ejected or would crash into something, possibly Urlum.

Wal was based on a moon made by Porkjet which was never released and that was gathering dust on his harddrive. He gave us the files (for Wal and several other planets/moons) and the right to do what we wanted with it and we based Wal on that concept (Tekto also started out as a Porkjet moon). So the name was made up by Porkjet. There was also a smaller moon that Porkjet made that was called Dal. It wasn\u0027t a subsatellite of Wal as far as I know, but the name fit together so well for a moon and its moon that we used it. As time went on we ditched Porkjet\u0027s look for that moon but kept the name, which slowly morphed into Tal instead of Dal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eleven\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eleven\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhile we\u0027re all talking and waiting for new moons, here\u0027s a SS I took of Urlum and all it\u0027s moons in one frame.
