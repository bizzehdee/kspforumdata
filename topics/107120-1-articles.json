And it als has two canards at the front, and one rudder. \n\nThis should fly great I thought. But no. It cannot get even to 400m/s! Useless! Two rapiers spaceplanes can\u0027t fly anymore. I could just add another but then it would not be skylon! Seriously it would easily beable to go atleast 1300m/s before flameout... Personally I cannot understand why squad messed up the drag so badly that even a realistic design like that sucks. Either that or airbreathing engines at the current time do not produce enough thrust in subsonic and transonic flight... I played with FAR before for a while and it looks like I\u0027m going straight back to it when NuFAR comes out. Or is NuFAR out?. Anyway... Point is, with this hot\u0022fix\u0022 one cannot make a reasonable ssto with 2 or less rapier engines"},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:02:20Z","Content":"Remove the wings completely, your current build is just not realistic enough."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:03:41Z","Content":"Did you go for altitude or stay low?

Some bi-rapier designs can get to space by racing to 12-14km, then taking a shallow dive to get the engine power to kick in, and turning back upwards with that added oomph.\n\nDamned annoying, tbh, but there it is :/ I have a thread going about this issue in the support forum if it interests you; [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118686-Rapiers-seem-too-weak](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118686-Rapiers-seem-too-weak)"},{"CreatedByName":"Screeno","CreatedById":141893,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:40:50Z","Content":"Fusalage Got really hot and had to switch rapiers because jet mode was useless past 1100 m/s at 20000 m...

Transonic barrier was an issue in 1.0 when trying to optimize payload fraction (i.e. as few engines and fuel as possible, as much cargo as possible). I used an ascent profile that climbed to ~7-9km subsonic, went into a dive to push through to 450m/s. Now it\u0027s impossible, or at least much much more narrow. Dive doesn\u0027t really help because even 1km loss in altitude means absolutely massive increase in drag and will actually slow your plane down in a nosedive (which is absurdly unrealistic, dart shaped planes will not slow down in a full-thrust nosedive at 300m/s). With the mk3 hull I found I need around 1.5 TWR to be able to go supersonic in level flight. Another hurdle is related to the first. Because I need so many engines to do the same as in 1.0, they need to be packed tightly to reduce drag - so then they overheat. The one ascent profile I managed to achieve orbit involved climbing as hard as I can through 15-30km at the expense of speed just to get into thin enough air so my engines don\u0027t explode. This results in a horribly inefficient ascent needing to burn 90% of previous payload as propellant. Oh and CTDs are frequent in 1.0.2, gona try disabling the heat gauges if it helps. Frankly I had more fun trying to build an SSTO spaceplane in .90 with FAR, DRE, AJE and realistic solar system."}]}
