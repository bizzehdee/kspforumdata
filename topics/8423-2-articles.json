The middle rocket shows the straight-line flight configuration in which the direction of thrust is along the center line of the rocket and through the center of gravity of the rocket. On the rocket at the left, the nozzle has been deflected to the left and the thrust line is now inclined to the rocket center line at an angle a called the gimbal angle. Since the thrust no longer passes through the center of gravity, a torque is generated about the center of gravity and the nose of the rocket turns to the left. If the nozzle is gimballed back along the center line, the rocket will move to the left.

The ideal package would be the glide model you\\\u0027ve made for CSS coupled with all the tiberdyne plugins. If you are wanting to model a decoupler though may i recomend cutting the fuel lines from the ET and using that for the texture and set the config to allow fuel to pass through? either way i\\\u0027m really glad you kept this mod alive. if i had any graphic skills i would help you out. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cepheus","CreatedById":10683,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-06T21:07:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ev0.3.1 released!
