I believe I know about 80% of the things you can do with a .cfg file, so that is the perfect amount of knowledge for starting the 100 times more difficult process of creating a plugin.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst project:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I know that the stock game, and FAR, \u003Cem\u003Ecan recognize whether a part is inside a cargobay/fairing and is shielded from the airflow. Is it possible to add another property to those parts?: Physics significance 0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI\u0027m not sure I\u0027m using the correct vocabulary, but I want shielded parts to be ignored for physics calculations. No more oscillating fuel tanks inside cargobays, but a rigid physicsless part. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027arial black\u0027;\u0022\u003ESecond project: \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-For a career mod, I want to restrict the amount of LiquidFuel (or any other resource for that matter) that you can \u0027buy\u0027 from the KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first idea \u003Cem\u003Ewas to create a resource pool for the Kerbal Space Center that the player draws from with each launch. When it hits zero, the player simply cannot launch a rocket with that resource onboard.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second, \u003Cem\u003Ewas to force all rockets to start on the launchpad with zero resources. The player would then have to transfer resources through a launch clamp. The clamp has a persistent resource pool that it can draw from, much like Science or Reputation points.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy third idea \u003Cem\u003Ewould be convert Resources into something from the Scenario {Funding} in Save files, so you\u0027d have to basically \u0027buy\u0027 LiquidFuel by spending 300 \u0027LiquidFuel\u0027 points. Dropping extraplanetary resources on the KSC for recovery could replenish these points.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy final, and most cherished idea, \u003Cem\u003Eis to create a \u0027Resource\u0027 cost for all resources. This could be a very simple step of converting the \u0027cost = x\u0027 line in the resources.cfg file into \u0027cost = x resource points\u0027.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027arial black\u0027;\u0022\u003ESo, my dear experienced C# wizards, how do I go about writing plugins for these mods? \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027arial black\u0027;\u0022\u003EPlease do not simply direct me to the various outdated tutorials lying around.
