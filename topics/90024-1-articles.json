That got me thinking...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that we know that won\u0027t happen, what are your thoughts on a similar process happening to the Kerbals themselves?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me explain my idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if when you hire an Kerbal you could train \u0027em to become one of several roles/classes(for a funds cost of course). For example you could train a kerbal as a mechanic and only then would that kerbal be able to repair wheels and repack chutes. Or maybe you could train \u0027em to become a scientist and only then would that kerbal be able to remove data from instruments on EVA and operate the Lab part. You could train a Kerbal to have multiple roles/classes but the more you train them, the higher the funds cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll Kerbals would be capable of controlling manned capsules, making Crew reports, making EVA reports, and planting flags regardless of role/class. Each Kerbal\u0027s role/class could determine the color of the EVA suit\u0027s helmet marking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrainable roles/classes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone - Grey - The class of a Kerbal you just hired. Has no outstanding traits what-so-ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechanic - Brown - Can repack chutes, repair wheels, and do anything relating to activating parts while on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientist - Blue - Can collect data from science experiments on EVA and can operate the mobile Lab part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeologist - Green - Can gather surface samples and must be present to transmit the sample\u0027s composition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilot - Orange - Can operate a craft from an external seat and has the navball visible while on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther roles/classes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiple - Red - Has multiple roles/classes. Perhaps instead of a red marking, the marking would be decided by combining the colors of the roles/classes the Kerbal has been trained in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV.I.P. - Black - A Kerbal who has payed your space program in exchange for being on a flight. Would be a med-high paying contract depending on what the V.I.P. wants to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what are your thoughts on this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T17:57:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the idea of having multiple \u0027roles\u0027 for the kerbals.

Even though Jeb, Bill and Bob are dead to me right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso engineer. One that can get more juice out of their fuel like reach max ISP sooner. Then you can have one for Jets (not like they need any help), L\u0026amp;O and Xenon (not like this needs it either, but could be a reduce need for electricity instead). Or even help reduced how fast the engines over heat that are not SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, there is another position that currently only mods can fill. Life Support. Yup. A Kerbal dealing with the waste, O2/Water and food needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
