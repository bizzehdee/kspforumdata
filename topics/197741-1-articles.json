Yesterday I successfully tested this design out with an aerocapture at Duna, which used up slightly more than 1/8 of the heatshield\u0027s ablator to insert the craft into a 61 km orbit, with nothing on the craft ever showing overheat bars. I also wish to future-proof this design eventually to the point where it could survive aerocapture at Eve at 120% reentry heating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut anyway.

The heatshield is already autostrutted, so it shouldn\u0027t have stability problems.
