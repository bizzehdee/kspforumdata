And for those that have fallowed my post also know my opinion on the current intake system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem with it atm is the bucket system, its quite easy to get a handle off, many intakes or not. But a bucket system is basically a buffer and you dont have that IRL. So more intakes means bigger bucket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond problem is that intakes supply a specified amount off air etch that the engine can use so another buffer. More intakes means more intake air. Just dont work IRL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing many intakes is not a bug nor exploiting the game. That was how the GAME was designed. Simple formula is that Number off intakes Equals amount of available air at a given altitude. So more intakes means more air and thats how the game works. The game dont work like reality so stacking is with in the rules of the actual games, your opinions dont mater taking the current system in to account unless is changed, changing how you build after personal preferences wont change the rules for others sens the rules are what they are in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaking intakes heavier wont change the rules off how intakes works just how many you can carry realistically. It would still allow for intake abuse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the parameters needed in the game for a proper intake system already exists. A proper intake should be altitude limited and to some extent maybe limited to speed but real intakes can adjust the amount of air taken in so they are already designed with the target speed in mind. Just have a look at SR-71 blackbird or any other Mach 2-3 or above craft like the mach 5.5 skylon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntake air is regulated to make sure it stays subsonic because that waht the compressor needs to be feed with in a jet engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically what you need is a formula that specifies the amount of intakes needed to saturate en engine, for example two big intakes should saturate the intake air an engine needs anything else would not add any effect. So basically you need a formula that sees that if Intakes divided by number of engines is greater then two then intake is 2 per engine no more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple enough for a programmer to write, even I could do write something like that in Qbasic as a kid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow KSP is a bit more complex but its not rocket science for a skilled programer and all the variable exist in the game, altitude, speed etc. Secondly a jet engine is limited by temperature from the intake air, faster you go the hotter it gets from friction. So for all you how dont like stacking but fly at anything over 1100m/s, there is no engine to day that can do that so why not stop wining about it and fly at mach 3.2 at the most hey? If you dont like stacking mach 3 should be your limit to. Simple fact is that an engine would overheat and be destroyed eventually. The compressor will heat the air up a lot in a jet engine, then the combustion chamber heats it up to to so the air hitting the turbines after the combustor is many hundred C hot maybe over a 1000C. Modern jets runs at the brink of melting more or less but to avoid melting they use cold intake air to cool the sensitive parts like turbine blades that have holes in them for cooling. If you run at say Mac 5.5 like the skylon the intake air is a 1000C, enough to melt aluminum and well wont leave much for cooling hot turbine blades made of titanium or cool any oil or bearings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats why the skylon will have a Precooler that basically uses the fuel, Liquid hydrogen at very low temperatures to bring the 1000C hot air down to room temperature before entering the jet engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA jet engine uses about 3/4 of the intake air for cooling, only 1/4 is used for burning fuel and generate trust to power the turbine and compressor. Sure the added 3/4 increases efficiency but with out it the engine would simply overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for all you non stackers and intake abusers, run mach 3 at the most thats my advice. If you dont like that why not play with the rules of the game as they are atm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater in the game development Im sure squad will have altitude limited intakes, saturation taken in to account so no more then two intakes per jet will give it any better altitude performance and we will hopefully have precooler parts in the 1-2 ton range offering those that wants mach 5-6 instead of 2-3 to go there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut right now intakes work they way they work and thats it. And dont think its a walk in the park adding 120-200 intakes either.And it do not make a bad plane good. Makes a good plane better but it takes some doing still and there is no constant gain, double amounts of intakes wont get you twice the altitude or speed, gains drop off pretty quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current implementations off spaceplanes in the game is well fare behind rocket part so I would say that its better to let people play the way they want now untill its finished because as it is now spaceplanes have a 1/10 realism factor. Just so fare of reality atm that stacking or not wont change there realism that much. More a mater of taste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiggest problem I have with the current system is the fact that stacking if you want performance rater then having a precooler part that exist but dont work in the game is the fact that 200-400 parts that it costs to add 100-200 intakes makes the game require some of the fastest hardware out there to be able to play it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you dont like stacking maybe you should let squad know you want a more realistic intake system? I have advocated one for a long time but it seems mostly to go by def ears.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pirke","CreatedById":77207,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T15:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is my entry for 21.1: the Shotgun Hawk, 100% stock, 100% reusable single stage to Mun and back, and below is my very first testflight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt uses 2 jet engines, 2 RAM air, 2 scramjets (simulated by stacking RAM air), and 1 atomic liquid burner.

Then you would add in altitude as a factor to to the units of air so eventually the unit of air would be less then whats needed to sustain combustion and it would flame out.

They drop speed very fast fully loaded and starts to descend rapidly. Most of them just have enough trust to get the job done no more no less to keep part count and efficiency up in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of my crafts this days uses very few surfaces for there tonnage because I realized if its well balanced and there placed properly one wont need that many and it reduces wobble a lot. I can spend 3-4 days just tuning control surfaces then one wont need that many.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with the old ASAS my 230 ton jumbo with a max payload hardly used 10% authority on the control surfaces according to the indicators but the animations shows the fluttering like mad. So it didn\u0027t take long to figure out that they did not imitate what was realy happening. My latest uses 4 big control surfaces for ailerons and thats for 184ton take of weight. An I usually add my pitch surfaces fare back and fare front to get the most out of them, that way I dont need that many. But it do require a mix of maybe 10 small and big once to get a 150-230 ton SSTO to rotate on the runway at take off but still thats not much in comparison to what a small plane has in authority control in comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have to few you simply cant control a big craft and you often lose it when doing a 180 or something. I put all my SSTO spaceplanes trough manual and asas assisted acrobatics. Even loops some times but mostly 180 at a 45-90 degree bank. Its a good way to know it can be controlled with relative safety during reentry and landing. Last thing you want is to lose it and spin out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I have never built nor tested infinite glide crafts. I didn\u0027t even know about it until a few weeks ago sens its realy nothing I would consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: 320 control surfaces sounds little but I believe you.
