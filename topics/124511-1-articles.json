I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m ready for Real Solar System, since I\u0027ve been dying to work with real world delta-Vs and planetary arrangement, but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m ready to leap into Realism Overhaul yet. I\u0027ve only just become familiar with all the stock parts, and I\u0027d reather not have to learn the ins-and-outs of anoter dozen or more engines, etc. I can get used to things like procedural tanks and fairings, but I\u0027d rather not add too many part mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess I\u0027m just looking for suggestions on how to construct a playable setup with RSS, but no RO. Are there, for instance, mods that could improve the thrust of stock engines?

I would recommend SpaceY for 5m parts, and even SpaceY Extended for 7.5m parts. These might seem overkill in stock, but it\u0027ll be a lot nicer in RSS than strapping loads of Kerbodyne stacks together. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
