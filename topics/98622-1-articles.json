You\u0027re punishing developers who allocate reasonable texture sizes for things like icons, by making them larger than neccessary, just because you did not spend 5 minutes to consider, that textures smaller than i.e. 128 do not need further downscaling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(For those unfamiliar with the issue: The texture-quality setting in KSP does not care about the size of textures - it downscales anything it finds, no matter how small it is - if it is already smaller than i suppose 32x32, it will become invisible (i.e. blank icons) because of GPU limits. It also is the reason for the recently reported pixelated icons... see, before 0.90, KSP would not downscale textures in PNG format, so modders thought their textures/icons in PNG format were safe. Starting with i think 0.90, KSP started downscaling PNGs as well, so modder\u0027s icons became pixalated/invisible. Still, neither did SQUAD apparently inform modders about this, nor did they finally implement any way to recognize textures that shouldn\u0027t be downscaled further - most simply of it being a plain lower texture size limit: \u0026lt;5 mins of coding time refused).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-03T01:59:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/03/2015 01:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rynak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T02:43:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible that this was done by mistake and wasn\u0027t caught in testing.
