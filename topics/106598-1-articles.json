It doesn\u0027t happen all the time, but still pretty frequently. I\u0027m not sure faring geometry is a factor but on the off chance it is, see this screenshot.\n\nResult: Craft becomes impossible to register a left-click on (effectively making craft parts impossible to remove or rearrange). Left-clicks on any GUI elements and menus continue to behave normally, and right-clicks continue to work properly everywhere (even on craft parts).\n\nFixes/Workarounds: Restart KSP.\n\nOther Notes/Pictures/Log Files: \n\nI\u0027ve already posted it the bug-tracker here: [http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/4862](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/4862)\n\nBug tracker post also includes a Player.log.\n\n![9FsBe3O.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9FsBe3O.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T16:35:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 04:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Entropius**\n  \nformatting"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:53:37Z","Content":"I encountered the same problem.
