I need to reduce them whereever I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR also seems buggy when it comes to connecting one wing directly in front of the other, so I wanted to avoid that by having one long wing going along the side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy wings are shaped a bit like the SR-72, and in order to do that with P-Wings which forces the root length to match the tip length that a wing is attached to, I had to arrange 4 sets of wings in line.

What if someone has a large swept and thick wing, and they\u0027re trying to add an additional wing behind it that makes a thin trailing edge at a different angle? By looking at it, you can see that the wings are intersecting together and they intend for this to be one wing, but the game doesn\u0027t see it that way since the root is attached to the fuselage and not the trailing edge of the other wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP lets you do some messed up things.
