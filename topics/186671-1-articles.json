I had it when all I had was BetterTimeWarp and KerbalEngineer installed, in version 1.7.3, however at the given moment I do have extra mods. All I know is that whatever it is makes playing impossible. I have a career mode on halt because Bob and Bill can\u0027t dock up with Jeb\u0027s service module around Mun, because it keeps slingshotting itself away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
