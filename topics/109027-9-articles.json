He has saintly level patience when it comes to dealing with people asking for support.   He said he\u0027s already tried to duplicate the problem even though nobody gave him logs, which he is VERY clear about as a basic requirement before he\u0027ll feel obligated to help out.  Then he told you it was going to be a while before he got back to it.  I didn\u0027t take his post as \u0027punishment - because you were naughty I\u0027m going to refuse to support it for two weeks to teach you a lesson!\u0027   It was simply him saying he was going to be busy.  And he doesn\u0027t OWE us support.   Shrugging and saying \u0022I dunno...  I guess don\u0027t use this mod?\u0022 would be a perfectly reasonable answer but instead he said he\u0027d work on it more, even without logs, but that it would be a while.   What more do people want from him?  \n\nIf we looked at the number of hours I\u0027ve played this game... vs the number of hours I\u0027d have played this game WITHOUT mechjeb to take care of both the routine and boring (launches!) and the difficult and tedious (interplanetary transfers and maneuver planning), I\u0027d say Squad probably owes Sarbian about 80% of what I paid for the game. And then include the fact that a lot of my KSP time has been since I got interested in modding... and...  I don\u0027t know what plugin author HASN\u0027T at some point had to dig through Mechjeb\u0027s code to figure out how to do or access something...   I bet I\u0027m not the only one who can say that well over half of my enjoyment of this game has hinged on work sarbian is involved with.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-15T01:17:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2017 01:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by artwhaley**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-15T02:19:18Z","Content":"Guys, let\u0027s cool down a bit here, please."},{"CreatedByName":"terminalmonky","CreatedById":95476,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-15T05:13:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 8/11/2017 at 0:01 PM, terminalmonky said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am having a very very similar issue.

I should have some time to test this a bit and get some logs uploaded to you.  Thanks for the work you do."}]}
