But with encouragement from the forums and some great tutorial posts/videos, I finally tried my hand at one. So I sat down this morning and hammered one out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI fell in love with the look of the Russian PPTS capsule. But I really wanted a 2-kerbal pod, so I borrowed the look and sized it down. It\u0026#39;s a 1.875 base and .625 top. I\u0026#39;m still working on tweeking the cfg file for optimal mass, buoyancy, MP, electrical, etc... but I wanted to show off the outside right now.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[imgur]0OhjG[/imgur]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ve still got a lot of work on the textures to pretty it up and get it to look more stockalike. And then I\u0026#39;ve got to teach myself the ins and outs of IVA, but I\u0026#39;m excited how it turned out this morning.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Josh\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beale","CreatedById":70533,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T19:33:40Z","Content":"\nIt\u0026#39;s great! :)\u003Cbr\u003E\nVery cute version of this spacecraft.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MK3424","CreatedById":19932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T19:54:05Z","Content":"\nIt could also be used as a Gemini spacecraft...\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T20:14:40Z","Content":"\nLooking great!
