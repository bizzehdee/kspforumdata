How do you get BIG things to orbit? I mean, REALLY big. I mean things that take up most of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E themselves. Massive hollow cylinders. If there is interest I might make some massive tanks and boosters. To get big stuff to orbit, people usually just add more boosters, and more, and more condensing them all into much smaller numbers of parts should greatly reduce the strain on lower end processors as well. As long as they are proportionally scaled weight and cost wise it shouldn\u0027t really be any different than strapping them on the side... except less explodey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-15T20:32:37Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2018 08:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceMouse\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceMouse","CreatedById":126931,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-16T06:37:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xPySn31.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022668\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/xPySn31.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMock up for anyone wondering what I\u0027m rambling about. ^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
