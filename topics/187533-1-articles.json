Another question is the legal relationship between Youtube and content creators. Are the creators employees, independent contractors or something else?\u00A0One thing led to another and he partnered with IG Metall, who is a large metalworkers union, and happens to be the Germany\u0027s largest worker union. As such, IG Metall is very important in Germany (and EU), not only for metallworkers but for all workforce and when they put their weight behind a cause, they can initiate substantial changes in labor laws and regulations. They also happen to agree with\u00A0J\u00F6rg Sprave that Youtube is not transparent enough when it comes to their relationship with content creators, so they joined forces and sent an open letter to Youtube, inviting them to start the discussion. They gave a deadline which we are to reach in about 24 hours (23.08.2019, midnight).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA brief press statement from YT is not particularly informative and seems to entirely miss the point of the call to talks. Youtube promised to come to the table, but it appears that they have not done that yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are interested in further development on the issue, visit their site:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.fairtube.info/en/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.fairtube.info/en/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems to me that with the legal department of IG Metall backing them, the Youtubers Union could force Youtube to make changes. Of course, this would not necessarily mean worldwide change, but certainly within Germany, and possibly entire EU. With that, it would not be a stretch of imagination that the rest of the world would start pushing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, the clock is ticking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-23T12:51:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223657065\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187533\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566506655\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002245577\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Shpaget said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(23.08.2019, midnight).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat time, CET ?
