When I was playing .22 the other day, I was *trying* to fly a airplane in FAR, and I saw something that looked like a meteor or a spaceship reentering the atmosphere, of in the distance. I was flying straight out and I saw it far away, in line with the equator. I looked in map view to see if I left a craft on a suborbital trajectory (which I didn\u0027t) and when I returned, it was gone. Of course, I didn\u0027t think to take a screenshot first before I went into map view. My brother was there watching me, and he saw it too.
