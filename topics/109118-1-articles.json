Add in the weight difference between the engine masses (Nervas are heavy) and you find your discrepancy. Nervas become much more useful when your rocket size hits a point where the extra weight from the Oxidizer (which is 55% of the fuel weight for normal engines) starts costing you more than the difference between tank \u0026amp; engine weights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad sorta overlooked that there wern\u0027t any really good LF only tanks for use with the Nerva since all the fuselage parts are balanced for aircraft/jet use.

In this case, the LV909 provided more DV with the same fuel tanks, but the LV-N still ended up being the better choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission is to start at 200km orbit of Ike, land on Ike, extract 3,000 units of ore, return to a 200km orbit, and dock with an orbiting ore processor. So, I\u0027m bringing to the surface a lander holding two Kerbals, a drill, and two large ore tanks. I wanted plenty of DV to spare, in case I want to make large inclination changes, and because my landings are never anywhere near 100% efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 2160 LF and 3 LV-Ns (and zero oxidizer), I came up with about 3043 DV. Using the same 3 fuel tanks with 2160 LF (plus oxidizer this time) I came up with about 3192 DV using LV909s. Either configuration will complete the mission, and using 909s actually gives a little more DV even though 909s actually make the initial mass much higher due to the mass of oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LV-Ns in this case are a much better choice however. This is because when I reach the orbiting ore processor I have much less fuel to manufacture to replace the fuel spent during the flight. With the LV-Ns I burned about 2/3 of my LF, which now needs replaced. With the 909s I also burned about the same amount of LF, plus an even higher mass of oxidizer. So using LV-Ns leaves more ore available, because I end up replacing less total fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, using the LFO tanks for LV-Ns isn\u0027t really that bad. There is a slight improvement in the fuel to tank mass ratio using dedicated LF only tanks, but it is a very slight improvement. I did calculate DV using LF only tanks, and in that case came up with about 3308 DV, slightly better than using 909s. Unfortunately, the available LF only tanks are very limited, so the ship design gets a little goofy if you go out of your way to select LF only tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the end of this story is that while LV-Ns and 909s yielded nearly identical DV values, the LV-Ns actually ended up being a much better choice. Each situation will be different, however. I ran the DV calculations because I was also beginning to wonder if LV-Ns still had any value in the game. They do, but they don\u0027t have the same advantages they did in 0.90 and earlier. If you want to put a positive spin on the situation, you could consider that the 909 is now one of the best engines in the game, and is available very early in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EInvader Jim,\u003Cp\u003E I ran a comparo between these two a couple weeks back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Basically, the LV-N has the advantage when you\u0027re planning for burns over 1500 m/sec at low acceleration (less than .8G).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For shorter and faster burns, the LV-909 is superior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to point out that the LV-N and LV909 have identical thrust in space. So the engines themselves do not have a difference in burn times. For the same weight, LV-Ns and LV909s are going to have essentially identical burn times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the total mass of many ships is going to be higher using 909s, because the extra mass of oxidizer can easily offset the extra mass of the LV-Ns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, there is another penalty using LFO engines like the 909- If you are lifting the whole thing to orbit from the surface of Kerbin, you really pay a penalty to lift the extra mass of oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, this is not always the case. For ships which do not require a lot of DV, the weight of oxidizer does not exceed the weight added by switching to LV-Ns. I am personally finding the 909 to be a better choice in many cases in 1.0, but it is so close that there are no simple \u0027rules of thumb\u0027 that always work when comparing them to LV-Ns. In my above example, I found that even for a very short range mission (Ike orbit-Ike surface-back to Ike orbit) the LV-N was the better choice. For a nearly identical mission at Minmus, the 909 was the better choice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T13:28:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget to remove oxydizer with LV-N\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T14:53:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease note this question was answered, so better this thread be closed.
