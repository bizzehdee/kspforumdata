It a three person thing with a Mk-3 cockpit, a turbojet and two 48-7s engines. I was quite happy with it and it did all it had to reliably. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the update however, something weird is happening on takeoff. As it pics up speed, it becomes unstable and crashes. Note that this is not the usual \u0022veer to the side and crash\u0022 thing that we\u0027ve all experienced when our landing gear wasn\u0027t parallel. As it hits around 60-70 m/s, it starts bouncing from side to side, each bounce becoming bigger and bigger until it flips. This happens regardless of whether SAS is on and i even tried switching out the tubojet and the rockets for a RAPIER, which didn\u0027t work either. I have never experienced this before, neither with this plane or any other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone help shed some light on this issue? I am quite proud of the plane and would hate to have to can it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere is the craft file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/home/KSP%20share\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/home/KSP%20share\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T23:42:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECommand pods now have monopropellant in them and they are heavier by the weight of this monopropellant.
