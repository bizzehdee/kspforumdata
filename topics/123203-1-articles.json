Then, add new \u0027engine\u0027 parts, which are, at smallest, the size of the thinnest 1.25m tank, and at largest the size of the FL-800. There would be 3-4 engine types, maybe with a really thin electric engine thrown in. Any engine could be combined with any nozzle to get a \u0027jet\u0027 with very diffrent stats. Turboramjet nozzle\u002Blow speed engine= High alt/low speed or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear Engines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear engines could have two buttons--a \u0027start reactor\u0027 and a \u0027activate engine\u0027, the reactor has a very long spool up time and the engine only works at full capacity when the reactor is fully spooled up. This makes nukes more interesting and let\u0027s them be buffed a little while still having a downside. When the reactor is spoolling up, it produces lots of heat, but upon the activation of the engine it all god away. This is realistic and, IMHO fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T00:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah, that\u0027s all we gotta do... stop nuclear fission.
