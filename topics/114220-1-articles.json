It lets you launch from places other than Kerbin. But Kerbin is always \u0022home\u0022. Mission difficulty is based on departing from Kerbin. You can\u0027t recover a vessel unless it\u0027s on Kerbin. I want to start the game with a different \u0022home\u0022 body than Kerbin, and try out a career starting from, for instance, Duna. Imagine having to figure out landings with only SRB\u0027s and mk16 parachutes!
