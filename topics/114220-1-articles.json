It lets you launch from places other than Kerbin. But Kerbin is always \u0022home\u0022. Mission difficulty is based on departing from Kerbin. You can\u0027t recover a vessel unless it\u0027s on Kerbin. I want to start the game with a different \u0022home\u0022 body than Kerbin, and try out a career starting from, for instance, Duna. Imagine having to figure out landings with only SRB\u0027s and mk16 parachutes! It\u0027d make for a different and, I think, wildly entertaining experience.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t have to be fancy. I think all (...\u0022all\u0022...) you\u0027d need to make it work would be something that: (a) lets you recover vessels on Duna and (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) makes all the missions aware that you\u0027re starting on Duna now - therefore adjust the relative planetary mission frequencies and perhaps the rewards as well. **Bonus points** for adjusting science multipliers appropriately.\n\nOf course, you\u0027d also need to use extraplanetary launchpads to launch from Duna, and probably hyperedit to initially get the pad to Duna, but otherwise, ***bam***, Dunan Space Program. **Double bonus** **points** for letting you set any (solid) planetary body as \u0022home\u0022. \n\nWho\u0027s with me?"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T09:39:27Z","Content":"This is as far as I am aware flat-out impossible.\n\nHowever, what you CAN do is change Kerbin to look like Duna, have Duna\u0027s atmosphere, be orbited by Ike instead of Mun/Minmus, and orbit where Duna orbits.
