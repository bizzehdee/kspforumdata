At slightly more than 10k (past the light blue section), i tilt the pitch to ~70 degrees toward 90degrees heading. Then, when im out of the slightly darker blue i slowly tilt all the way to 30degrees and let my apoapsis rise to my target orbit. After that, fast forward to 20seconds before apoapsis, set ship pointing at 10degree pitch 90 heading and burn until periapsis is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo that a couple times and check your remaining fuel after reaching target orbit. Then you can benchmark your gravity turns and refine it by making it smooth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-11T00:39:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2012 12:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Kiershar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
