It will just start to load plugins first when loading progress will appear to freeze on some random plugin, it\u0027s usually not the same every time. But the game will seem to be locked up for up to several minutes, then the loading bar should \u0027jump ahead\u0027 a bit to continue loading your various mod folders, along with the screen image switching from the Squad chimp to the 3 Kerbal scene. Once this happens the rest of the loading process should finish up fairly quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the above description is how it works for me on my PC. If the loading bar immediately starts loading plugins and textures \u0027normally\u0027, i.e. With no pause or \u0027lockup\u0027 at the beginning, then I know that the game will REALLY freeze when the loading bar is at about 50% progress, that\u0027s where my game always runs out of memory because the textures didn\u0027t get compressed and cached by ATM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this info helps, friend. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smunisto","CreatedById":57789,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T13:38:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, Green, I installed it correctly, but as Neutrinovore mentioned - apparently something in D12 Knockout does something to stop ATM from working.
