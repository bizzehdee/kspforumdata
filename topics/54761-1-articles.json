We could use these to generate science reports, like around Duna, the report could be like, \u0022So THAT\u0027S why Duna\u0027s atmosphere is so thin!\u0022, but you would have to discover the solar (or should I say, Kerbolar?) wind first. Then, if you mapped the sun\u0027s, you could then detect the edge of the heliosphere, and send a probe like Voyager 1 into interstellar space to investigate it.
