Or I\u0027m allowing people to optionally install a mesh-switcher mod (either Firespitter or InterstellarFuelSwitch), and if they don\u0027t install those mods, then meshes need to be disabled for a stock-like experience. Currently the only way to disable a mesh in the stock game is to assign it like an engine shroud, but use an attachment node that\u0027s positioned somewhere outside the VAB/SPH editor so that it\u0027s effectively disabled. However, this results in extra \u0022Shroud\u0022 enable/disable buttons in the right-click menu in these editors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cleanest solution would be to have the \u0022MODEL\u0022 section have an optional field where mesh objects could be listed that are to be ignored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
