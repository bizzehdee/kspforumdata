Usually I can get it up to at least 20,000 m, but that\u0027s about it. I\u0027ve noticed craft seems to start slow down at high altitudes and follow a parabolic arc. Even I have to point the craft at about 45 degrees up to just to maintain a level trajectory, but with that attitude, I slow down even faster. Switching off the turbojets and switching to the rocket doesn\u0027t help. The damage is done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried shifting my fuel from the front to the back of the jet, but that doesn\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T20:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t go quite as high / don\u0027t milk them for as long. If you have any data display mods, you will notice that thrust decreases with altitude. Even though the jets may keep running well above 20km, most of the work happens below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of what makes spaceplanes more difficult since 1.0 is that the jets cut out at an altitude where the air is still comparatively dense. You not only want to build horizontal speed (though that\u0027s still the main point), but also have some upward momentum that helps you into thinner air.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T20:05:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is that you don\u0027t have enough lifting surface for the weight of your craft.

In most designs, there will be an intermediate period where the rockets will be active at the same time as the jets. Right click on one of our jets and watch the window monitoring its thrust output. Watch the thrust rise as your altitude goes up. Once your thrust starts to level out, and then dip, that should be when you fire the rockets. Let them carry you up. Leave the jets on to add their thrust to your horizontal speed for some time, as they can continue accelerating you on top of what the rockets themselves are doing, but cut the jets (and the drag from the intakes) once their thrust starts to get too low and leave the rockets to do the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T21:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, you want to light rockets when you lose speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerobic engines have thrust multipliers in two curves: velocity and altitude. There is a speed were jets hit peak thrust (1000 m/s for turbos, 1300 m/s) the longer you linger there on jet power, the more thrust you get from your hyper efficient engines, and the less dV you expend to orbit. Going faster than this while your engines run wastes rocket fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as parabolic arc, good space plane ascent transfers from aerodynamic flight to ballistic trajectory as max speed is reached (and the lift surfaces can efficiently alter trajectory). For a mass optimal craft, you actually want to enter a gravity turn where you circularize between 50-60 km and the rest of orbital insertion is a Hohmann transfer. This minimizes the thrust of your orbital insertion burn and this OMS/ascent rocket mass. My goal is to have prograde at least 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 above horizon when I light my rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
