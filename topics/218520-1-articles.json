This will be CRUCIAL for the Xbox One port of this game as it is currently unplayable to use more than 4 Juno engines, at least from what I have tested, as the game chugs hard and the framerate drops to about 3 - 4 due to the PARTICLE EFFECTS emited from the engines (the white smoke clouds). It is likely to occur with anything that emits the same particles. I am confident that this is the issue because upon opening the radial menu, the particle effects disappear and the framerate skyrockets up again, almost immediately, while the game still plays behind the radial menu. An update to address this and implement a slider or similar feature to allow a useable framerate would be appreciated by not only me, but many others, I\u0027m sure. Thank you either way for taking the time to read through my post, I hope it is brought up somewhere, and new players like me will be able to experiment and build our own rockets and spaceplanes without worry of unusability due to framerate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA relatively new Kerbal Space Program player on an Xbox\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
