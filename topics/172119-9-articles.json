If we see a clause that we don\u0027t like or don\u0027t understand, very often the best way to resolve that is simply to ask the other party why they included it. Sometime\u0027s there\u0027s a good reason\u00A0that we hadn\u0027t considered because it turns out that the other party need the contract to cover various specific situations that we weren\u0027t aware of. At that point we\u0027re in a good place\u00A0for further negotiation - perhaps we can agree to a restricted version of that clause, or can agree to the original version, provided that they can agree to tweak another clause somewhere else in the contract to protect our interests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if the other party can\u0027t provide a reasonable explanation for that clause\u00A0they wanted, then we would tend to regard it with a somewhat jaundiced eye and\u00A0at the very least, we may end\u00A0up pushing back harder on the rest of the contract,\u00A0since we don\u0027t have much option but to take a pessimistic approach to it.\u00A0Not knowing what the other party wants from a contract isn\u0027t the best way of building a good working relationship with them,\u00A0either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the present example, it appears that Take Two are throwing a contract at us on a take-it-or-leave-it-basis without being willing or able to explain that contract. Which would be ridiculous in a business-to-business relationship and is egregious in a business-to-consumer relationship, because our ability to negotiate a more favourable contract\u00A0is severely restricted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223309497\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171236\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221520115800\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002285181\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yakuzi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Yakuzi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t accept the new EULA, it means you\u0027re terminating the license provided by Take Two, and, as described by the EULA, you are required to destroy and/or delete any and all copies of KSP Software in your possession, custody, or control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that\u0027s correct then so be it.

You\u0027ve deliberately mislead people I feel by not including the entire sentences and paragraphs from the parts you want to appear more intimidating than they actually are. Prime example being 7.3. You failed to include the last part that says, \u0022with the intention of illegal distribution\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has previously been discussed on these forums\u00A0and Squad\u00A0made alterations to the EULA specifically to make it clearer and allow people to have multiple installs for personal use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m all for playing the devil\u0027s advocate at times because...why not\u00A0but deliberately misrepresenting the terms in this way is not cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was intended. All legalese sounds scary, and every EULAs are written to allow the game developers/owners to ruin your day. Even if you include the parts that I snipped, it still is very intimidating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point is that even though Squad or Take-Two has all the rights on their product, it doesn\u0027t mean that they will enforce every single clause of their T\u0026amp;Cs as strictly as possible (as you said, they have altered the EULA several times). They can, but I don\u0027t think they will.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModding is a good part of what makes KSP alive, KSP has zero DRM, KSP\u0027s code has been written to be as open to modding as possible since the beginning, KSP developers have supported modding since Alpha, KSP is strictly single-player... Buying a licence and banning modding to force people to buy DLC (alienating a good part of the game audience)\u00A0is a terrible decision from a business perspective, even more so for KSP specifically. The case of GTA V is completely\u00A0different (a mod that allegedly reverse-engineered the game code and that interfered\u00A0with existent online microtransactions), and everything that may have justified T2\u0027s decision to send a C\u0026amp;D back then is absent in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso remember that this new EULA is T2\u0027s EULA, it was not written specifically for KSP and neither Squad nor T2 have ever expressed any intent to ban modding from KSP (if anything, all statements regarding this issue seem to indicate the devs wish to keep modding as free as possible).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-04T21:31:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2018 09:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Gaarst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-04T21:43:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223310167\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171236\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221520197296\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167285\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ble210\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n33 minutes ago, ble210 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand your concerns.\u00A0 It sucks that EULA\u0027s like this exist, as they (justifiably) seem draconian.\u00A0 But the legal department is doing so because if they don\u0027t publish EULA\u0027s like this, then the company will be in significant legal and financial jeopardy.\u00A0 Its a result of some very strict and punishing IP laws (it\u0027d be nice if the law weren\u0027t as strict as they\u00A0are, but that\u0027s the environment that legal departments find themselves and have to operate within).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps this is better taken to private messages but as an honest\u00A0question, motivated by professional curiosity, which strict and punishing IP laws did you have in mind?\u00A0I ask as an IP manager for a tech transfer office but one who\u0027s more familiar with patent law (and European patent law at that) than copyright law.
