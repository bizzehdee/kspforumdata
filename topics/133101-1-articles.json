The suggestion is to devide Jool\u0027s atmosphere into the upper, middle, lower and deep atmosphere, and have science situations for them. This makes Jool a\u00A0more interesting place to visit, (as going deeper can give you \u0022\u003Cem\u003Emoar science\u003C/em\u003E\u0022). And that\u00A0is, in my opinion, a big deal as it is the only gas giant in the game. Therefore saying: \u0022yea it has no surface, but that doesn\u0027t mean Jool isn\u0027t an interesting planet\u0022 is a good thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you also make the deep atmosphere difficult to get to, (like with a high temperature curve), and add a contract, you just added\u00A0an interesting challenge to the game, and made an entire class of planets more interesting to players. Because with this layout, players have an incentive\u00A0to design a ship that can withstand a journey to the deep atmosphere of Jool, and actually go there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are the Posts in that thread concerning this topic:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbacusWizard:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131120-biomes-for-jool/\u0026amp;page=2#comment-2396049\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131120-biomes-for-jool/\u0026amp;page=2#comment-2396049\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSnark:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131120-biomes-for-jool/\u0026amp;page=2#comment-2396640\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131120-biomes-for-jool/\u0026amp;page=2#comment-2396640\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaguna:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131120-biomes-for-jool/\u0026amp;page=2#comment-2396724\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131120-biomes-for-jool/\u0026amp;page=2#comment-2396724\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSnark:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131120-biomes-for-jool/\u0026amp;page=2#comment-2397056\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131120-biomes-for-jool/\u0026amp;page=2#comment-2397056\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T15:33:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood idea.
