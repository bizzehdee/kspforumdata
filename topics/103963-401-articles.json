Now that I know how to load up the plugin in debug mode, if I run into any problems I\u0027ll at least be a little better equipped to give you information that\u0027s a bit more helpful than a simple NRE.  \n\nI admit that I was frustrated and inarticulate and the whole thing could have been handled better.  I was grinding on trying to find \\*some\\* way to get this lens dirt gone for quite some time. Even offered to buy Jade lunch to fix the unity flare, assuming it was as simple as replacing that dirt layer with a transparent one, only to find that it was much more involved than that and that addressing it was going to be quite the undertaking.  When you didn\u0027t address the NREs and then I loaded the in game editor just to find that it was an in-game text editor, it felt like a complete brush off, and even though that\u0027s totally fair since you don\u0027t owe me \\*anything\\*, I didn\u0027t handle it well.  It wasn\u0027t you, it was just realizing that I was basically at the extent of my abilities and out of options, and I vented.  Sorry for that.  \n\nDidn\u0027t mean to imply in any way that you don\u0027t understand your own mod or anything of the sort, though I see now how that was how you took it.  It was more an \u0022well damn, if I\u0027ve been banging my head against this wall for a week, and you just looked at the logs and don\u0027t see anything obvious, I\u0027m \\*never\\* going to fix this\u0022 exasperated statement.  I think the vent about the uselessness of the error message was valid, but also unnecessary, after all it\u0027s not like you designed the engine or how it reports NREs.    \n\nTo address the last bit, I did try using the in game editor to delete the sunflare config for Destiny as you suggested, and when I cleared it all out and reloaded the config, Destiny was still there in all of it\u0027s scattery glory.  I don\u0027t know if \\*that\\* is a bug or just pebcak or what, but it\u0027s worth mentioning.  At any rate, coming from 15\u002B minute load times on my full install, restarting KSP with less than 10 mods total isn\u0027t much of a bother at all so I\u0027ll start with your suggestion if I run into any more problems with the dev build and report my findings as best as I can.\n\nThanks for your help ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-08-25T07:18:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2022 07:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by DeliriumTrigger**"},{"CreatedByName":"DeliriumTrigger","CreatedById":184699,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-25T22:40:14Z","Content":"Okay!  I have good news and bad news.\n\nThe good news is that simply commenting out the Sun (read: barycenter) config entirely made the NREs stop, and while the sun is visible in game, it\u0027s also super tiny and only visible if you go out of your way to zoom in on it, so it looks correct for my purposes.  Tested in both the release and dev build. The bad news is that I only found this out by commenting out that portion of my config outside of the game and restarting the game.  Any time I edit the flares in game with the scatterer in game editor, it throws an exception and nothing actually changes.

result of commenting out an entire sunflare config, but the NRE still happens if I flip a 0.3 to a 0.7 on the intensity multiplier, change the aspect ratio, or whatever else.  This is why removing configs one by one wasn\u0027t working for me, didn\u0027t test it by just editing the config outside of the game and restarting, and missed the NRE about the editor in the gigantic log full of NRE spam.  I wrongly assumed that the problem with the editor was related to the other NRE spam when in fact it was an independent issue.  \n\nAs it stands I\u0027m pretty satisfied with how things look, could stand to change a few things with some of the ghosts to clean up a little bit but going to chill on that until I can do it with the in game editor, since seeing immediate feedback will make that whole process *much* easier.    If there\u0027s anything I can do to help out with the editor issue, let me know, happy to try some troubleshooting steps, test changes or send you screenshots from the debugger with my specific setup or whatever else you need.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-08-25T23:11:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2022 11:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by DeliriumTrigger**\n  \nclarity,punctuation"},{"CreatedByName":"AntiAirCannon23","CreatedById":222388,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-11T15:27:13Z","Content":"Hi, since installing this mod, I may have had a few issues concerning the camera wobble in the map screen, I\u0027m certain Scatterer is the cause, as I tried removing it and the camera wobbling disappearing, though that works, I would like to keep the mod installed in my gamedata folder, could there be a fix to this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Krazy1","CreatedById":203523,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-16T07:11:20Z","Content":"Hi [@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/) I\u0027m getting constant NRE log spam.
