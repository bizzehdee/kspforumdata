Giving your most rabid fans something to do that take some time, effort, sleuthing, and general intelligence really does a great job distracting us from the elephant in the room - all the while not having to do anything to hide said elephant!

Also, we have a \u0022crib\u0022, since we know what the message will ultimately contain.\n\n Therefore, the riddles are solvable.

Knowing that, it seems likely to me that the words would be names of missions, names of craft, or names of personnel. It only took a few minutes really to rule out missions, and a short time more to see that craft wouldn\u0027t likely fit, leaving personnel. Personnel is the hard category because there are so many people who have been in space, but it becomes immediately obvious that some prominent names fit in certain spots. Such as Hadfield, Tereshkova, Eisle, and Aldrin. From that point, it is just a matter of simple research (i.e. pattern matching against a long list) to find possible candidates.\n\nAs far as I can tell one or two of the people named in the puzzle are ambiguous because there isn\u0027t enough info to uniquely identify the names. Nonetheless, once a number of items begin to fit it becomes clear that a pattern has emerged and (as Slashy mentioned) with several people working cooperatively, it doesn\u0027t take too long to piece all the clues together.\n\nThat said, Kasper provided a real challenge in this puzzle due to the amount of info one had to peruse in order to find the various words. Even more challenge was provided by the fact that some of the clues provided were incorrect leading to a number of interesting guessing games.\n\nWhen all is said and done, for a person who loves puzzles this was a lot of fun.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vallius","CreatedById":100188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T03:05:43Z","Content":"Oh, don\u0027t get me wrong. I love puzzles! I just prefer ones that are a little less ambiguous. I\u0027m better at logic related puzzles than trivia related ones.
