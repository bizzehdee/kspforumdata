Knowing that, it seems likely to me that the words would be names of missions, names of craft, or names of personnel. It only took a few minutes really to rule out missions, and a short time more to see that craft wouldn\u0027t likely fit, leaving personnel. Personnel is the hard category because there are so many people who have been in space, but it becomes immediately obvious that some prominent names fit in certain spots. Such as Hadfield, Tereshkova, Eisle, and Aldrin. From that point, it is just a matter of simple research (i.e. pattern matching against a long list) to find possible candidates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I can tell one or two of the people named in the puzzle are ambiguous because there isn\u0027t enough info to uniquely identify the names.
