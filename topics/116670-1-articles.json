There is a note on the Mono source for pdb2mdb that says there was a problem reading bits dated sometime in May which was fixed, I however conclude that the fix is definitely not in the version of Mono included with Unity 4.6.x - that uses the 4.0 Mono library. Unsure if this has anything to do with the error I\u0027m getting above when running pdb2mdb. I would however think that the 4.5 release of pdb2mdb requires the 4.5 runtime which is fine, however once the mdb file is output, it should work with the 4.0 runtime for the purpose of guiding the debugger. Assumption there of course as I can\u0027t get pdb2mdb 4.5 to work at all right now.\n\nThanks!\n\nZ.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T17:08:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 05:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ziporama**"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T17:07:01Z","Content":"1) Are you sure you compiled for .NET 3.5 ? \n\n2) Mono 4.0 drops support for .NET 2.0 and 3.5 so you should keep using 3.8 or earlier"},{"CreatedByName":"ziporama","CreatedById":97320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T17:14:59Z","Content":"Yes, the output is 3.5 (again, code runs just fine in Unity, it\u0027s just the pdb2mdb tool that bombs so that means debugging is a pain as there is no mdb created from the .NET 3.5 pdb file)."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T18:20:08Z","Content":"Stay on VS 2013 then"},{"CreatedByName":"belpyro","CreatedById":120761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T16:53:47Z","Content":"Try to install last release of [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/)and call \u0022%MONO\\_PATH%\\bin\\pdb2mdb.bat\u0022 with path to dll as first parameter.

Your [instructions](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/102909-ksp-plugin-debugging-and-profiling-for-visual-studio-and-monodevelop-on-all-os/) fill such a gap for what is otherwise a near total vacuum of information - this is great.\n\nI see your tools zip file contains Mono.Cecil 0.9.5 whereas the version in Unity 5.2.4f1 is 0.9.4.   I was able to compile just fine with your version of pdb2mdb and cecil 0.9.5 under VS2015.  Unfortunately, pdb2mdb.exe doesn\u0027t have a file version (0.0.0.0) so i can\u0027t tell the difference outside that it\u0027s a different file size so different file from the one shipped in Unity - I assume this is the current release.
