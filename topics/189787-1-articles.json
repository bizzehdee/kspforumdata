We should probably have it that there is a bit of a curve, maybe quadratic or normal distribution, meaning the extreme outliers are possible but rare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question is, would a craft like this be still controllable? I think it would, but it wouldn\u0027t fly straight up without controlling it somehow in most cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
