I\u0027m a bit\u00A0surprised to see a\u00A0visible reduction in performance on an otherwise decent PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider a Core\u00A0i7 (i4771) PC with 32 GB RAM and a GeForce\u00A0GTX 760 graphics card. Stock KSP using Direct3D v9 (-force-d3d9) seems OK delivering 60 FPS \u002B/- 5 FPS\u00A0consistently. Direct3D v11 (-force-d3d11) produced a sawtooth performance graph fluctuating wildly between 30 FPS and 160 FPS, and played fairly roughly that it was almost unplayable. OpenGL (-force-opengl) produced a different kind of sawtooth graph going between 30 and 60 FPS that ended up being\u00A0quite unplayable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I add Scatterer to this mix and no other mod. I find I can\u0027t even load the game without forcing one of either OpenGL or Direct3D 11. The FPS graphs were similar to the stock game, though I think D3D performed slightly better when near the KSC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to balance performance with appearance while still playing the stock game, so it\u0027s\u00A0appearance mods only. On top of that I\u0027ll be using Shadowplay to record games. Are there any combinations of stock settings, Scatterer settings, and renderer choice\u00A0that seem to work better for this sort of thing? What are other SVE / Scatterer users using for a performance / appearance balance?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s my config file minus the key bindings. The stock game is quite pretty on its own with these settings, though I really want the clouds that SVE will provide. Those lovely bits of mist I\u0027ve seen on some Minmus missions would be nice too. I can provide portions of screen shots that show the FPS graphs if I can find a place to store them on my home server.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\nSETTINGS_FILE_VERSION = 1.0.5\nTUTORIALS_EDITOR_ENABLE = False\nTUTORIALS_FLIGHT_ENABLE = False\nVAB_USE_CLICK_PLACE = True\nVAB_USE_ANGLE_SNAP = False\nVAB_ANGLE_SNAP_INCLUDE_VERTICAL = False\nVAB_CAMERA_ORBIT_SENS = 0.04\nVAB_CAMERA_ZOOM_SENS = 0.1\nFLT_CAMERA_ORBIT_SENS = 0.04\nFLT_CAMERA_ZOOM_SENS = 0.5\nFLT_CAMERA_WOBBLE = 0.1\nFLT_CAMERA_CHASE_SHARPNESS = 1.5\nFLT_CAMERA_CHASE_USEVELOCITYVECTOR = True\nFLT_VESSEL_LABELS = True\nSPACENAV_CAMERA_SENS_ROT = 30\nSPACENAV_CAMERA_SENS_LIN = 20\nSPACENAV_CAMERA_SHARPNESS_LIN = 8\nSPACENAV_CAMERA_SHARPNESS_ROT = 10\nCAMERA_DOUBLECLICK_MOUSELOOK = True\nIVA_RESETS_CONTROL_POINT = True\nCAMERA_FX_EXTERNAL = 1\nCAMERA_FX_INTERNAL = 1\nSIMULATE_IN_BACKGROUND = True\nPHYSICS_FRAME_DT_LIMIT = 0.04\nMAX_VESSELS_BUDGET = 250\nCONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = 3\nCONIC_PATCH_LIMIT = 3\nSHOW_PWARP_WARNING = False\nEVA_ROTATE_ON_MOVE = True\nSPACENAV_FLIGHT_SENS_ROT = 5\nSPACENAV_FLIGHT_SENS_LIN = 1\nKERBIN_TIME = True\nCALL_HOME = False\nDONT_SEND_IP = False\nSEND_PROGRESS_DATA = False\nCHECK_FOR_UPDATES = True\nVERBOSE_DEBUG_LOG = False\nSHOW_CONSOLE_ON_ERROR = False\nAUTOSAVE_INTERVAL = 300\nAUTOSAVE_SHORT_INTERVAL = 30\nSHOW_SPACE_CENTER_CREW = True\nUI_SIZE = 768\nUI_OPACITY = 0.4509981\nTEMPERATURE_GAUGES_MODE = 1\nSHIP_VOLUME = 1\nAMBIENCE_VOLUME = 1\nMUSIC_VOLUME = 0.8045812\nUI_VOLUME = 1\nVOICE_VOLUME = 1\nSOUND_NORMALIZER_ENABLED = True\nSOUND_NORMALIZER_THRESHOLD = 1\nSOUND_NORMALIZER_RESPONSIVENESS = 16\nSOUND_NORMALIZER_SKIPSAMPLES = 0\nSCREEN_RESOLUTION_WIDTH = 1920\nSCREEN_RESOLUTION_HEIGHT = 1080\nFULLSCREEN = True\nQUALITY_PRESET = 5\nANTI_ALIASING = 8\nTEXTURE_QUALITY = 0\nSYNC_VBL = 1\nLIGHT_QUALITY = 8\nSHADOWS_QUALITY = 4\nFRAMERATE_LIMIT = 60\nFALLBACK_PART_SHADERS = True\nPLANET_FORCE_SHADER_MODEL_2_0 = False\nPLANET_SCATTER = True\nPLANET_SCATTER_FACTOR = 1\nWATERLEVEL_BASE_OFFSET = 1.5\nWATERLEVEL_MAXLEVEL_MULT = 0.1\nAERO_FX_QUALITY = 3\nSURFACE_FX = True\nFALLBACK_UNDERWATER_MODE = 1\nEDGE_HIGHLIGHTING_PPFX = True\nSCREENSHOT_SUPERSIZE = 0\nINPUT_KEYBOARD_SENSIVITITY = 2\ndontShowLauncher = False\nTRACKIR_ENABLED = False\nFEMALE_EYE_OFFSET_X = 0\nFEMALE_EYE_OFFSET_Y = 0.009083331\nFEMALE_EYE_OFFSET_Z = 0.03378779\nFEMALE_EYE_OFFSET_SCALE = 2.03\nFI_LOG_TEMP_ERROR = False\nFI_LOG_OVERTEMP = False\n\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T13:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven the best computers are affected by these mods, so don\u0027t think it\u0027s only you.
