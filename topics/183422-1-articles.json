People are mostly talking about balance issues and role-canges, but I have a little suggestion that would not affect performance or usage at all, but just improves presentation and representation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of adding normal emissives (i.e. hot) to this engine, have it become white and frozen on the outside when fired to reflect the regeneratively cooled nozzle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rs-25_engine_test_2_1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/rs-25_engine_test_2_1.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022617\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s not a major request nor somethng we absolutely need, but it\u0027s just a little detail that goes a long way for immersion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Loskene","CreatedById":141778,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-04T20:19:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA little nod to the quirks of cryogenic engines would be...
