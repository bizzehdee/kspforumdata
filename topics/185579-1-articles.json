Add small servos to it so you can control the blade pitch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA second limiting factor is efficiency. Put a freewheel under your motor and attach more blades to that, pitched the opposite way. It\u0027ll contra-rotate and greatly increase efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, tune your props. Eight blades is a lot. I\u0027ve gotten best results with 3-6 blade props. Make them as big as you can fit in your craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should be able to get close to 90 m/s this way. At that speed your blade pitch will be around 77 degrees. This is way too much to get moving on the ground, which is why you need adjustable pitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-18T11:47:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2019 11:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
