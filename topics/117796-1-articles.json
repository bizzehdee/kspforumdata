Are there any tips for launching smaller Launch Vehicles?\n\nI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m just wondering is that are any methods that I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know about?

These days, you want your gravity turn to be long and gentle. Start turning just a little off the launch pad, and turn a tiny bit at a time. If your rocket is well balanced, you should keep the nose pointed at the prograde vector as it very slowly slips sideways. You want to make one continuous turn between 500 and 20,000 meters, starting pointing vertical and ending pointing about 45 degrees from parallel with the surface, though your mileage may very depending on your design. \n\nSecondly, center of mass versus center of drag is now a much bigger concern, and this is what is responsible for rockets flipping (the gentle turn mentioned above mitigates this somewhat.) You can avoid the dreaded flip by keeping the rocket\u0027s center of mass low, and keeping its center of drag even lower. This primarily means two things. First, shorter, fatter rockets are more stable than longer, thinner ones. Try to build them with the minimum number of stacked fuel tanks. A single large tank will be less in danger of drastically shifting the center of mass than two smaller tanks with the same total fuel would. In fact, having radial fuel tanks that feed into the main booster fuel tank (and jettison when they are empty) is in my experience an effective solution. The other is that you want to minimize drag on the top of the rocket, while actually deliberately adding drag to the bottom. Avoid excessively wide fairings, as while careful use of fairings can reduce overall drag, they can also shift that center of drag upward. Obviously place aerodynamic nose cones where you can, particularly if they are angled to deflect air away from the main body. Adding fins to the bottom of rockets is now almost mandatory, if only because they create drag down low and help keep the rocket stable. Put some with control surfaces on there and you can even increase your control of the rocket at lower altitude (where they can also help your SAS.) Airbrakes with freedom of control can also help with this, but they create a lot of total drag so they are only worth it in this capacity if your rocket is really big or has a lot of unavoidable drag at the top."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T17:03:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can avoid the dreaded flip by keeping the rocket\u0027s center of mass low, and keeping its center of drag even lower.\n\nOr by using heavy upper stages that keep your CoM up."},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfox","CreatedById":59958,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T17:24:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Or by using heavy upper stages that keep your CoM up.\n\nTrue.

The actual, \u0022true\u0022 dV to equatorial prograde LKO is something of order of 2000m/s (a bit over 2200 of LKO speed, minus initial speed of Kerbin rotation). The remaining 1400 is the extra that accounts for unavoidable losses to atmospheric drag, gravity drag and poor ISp in low atmosphere.\n\nIt\u0027s the same 2000m/s that were there before 1.0.3, but since the air got much thinner, the proportions of losses changed: you lose less to air drag, so you may start gravity turn earlier, to gain horizontal speed faster, thus reducing losses to gravity drag as well. But since you\u0027re moving slower vertically, your ISp losses increase somewhat - not so much as to outweigh the gravity and air drag benefits though.\n\nIn the past you had to keep your speed below 200m/s in low atmosphere, increasing time of ascent and so losses to gravity drag, the air drag was generally higher, and since you started the turn much later the gravity drag swallowed even more. That\u0027s why the overhead above the obligatory 2000m/s was much higher."}]}
