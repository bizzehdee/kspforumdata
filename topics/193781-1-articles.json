You haven\u2019t included much information. Please read the article below and include the information it recommends, which will make it much easier for someone to help you. As a start, I\u2019d like to know: your KSP version, what mods you have installed (you are posting in the modded installs section so I\u2019m assuming you use them) and if possible upload the log files (KSP.txt from inside the KSP folder as well as Player.txt and/or output_log.txt which can be in different places on different operating systems, try searching for them) and post a link so I or others can read them. Log files contain a lot of information that can help pinpoint what\u2019s causing a problem and suggest ways to fix them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002275006\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5989306289\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83212-how-to-get-support-read-first/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
