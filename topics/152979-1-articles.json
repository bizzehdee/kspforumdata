So you are likely to need to orbit for maybe 8 days before you have good odds of seeing every single one of the anomalies. Plus, there may be \u00A0a randolith in there somewhere, and I think the tracking antennas also count as anomalies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow","CreatedById":65767,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-04T23:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you don\u0027t need a survey scanner, what should I be using to find the anomalies?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-04T23:43:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222875356\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152979\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221480894542\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002265767\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, Scarecrow said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you don\u0027t need a survey scanner, what should I be using to find the anomalies?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny probe core gets you access to KerbNet (so long as you have connectivity to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E). Different probe cores have different detection rates for anomalies. The more advanced the core, the better it detects. The exception is the RoveMate, with a 100% detection rate but limited range. And it\u0027s KerbNet that shows anomaly detection -- that\u0027s all you need. But you can only have one KerbNet window open at a time, so you need to pick the core to have the capabilities you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow","CreatedById":65767,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-05T12:26:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk.
