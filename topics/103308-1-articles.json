Basically to get most of Mercury through Apollo), and something that got me thinking was the image of the \u0022Space Cowboy\u0022, and how there\u0027s quite a lot of people who, for lack of a better description, despise the type and the image itself.\n\nI personally like the idea. Aside from the obvious PR benefits having these kinds of people going into space, it just seems to me like these were the sort of people that you\u0027d want doing things that weren\u0027t as simple as just sitting in low earth orbit. The way they behave, in popular culture and in real life, just seems ideal for the situation."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T12:05:31Z","Content":"I\u0027m not sure what you mean with \u0022Space Cowboy\u0022, but your reference to the early US astronauts doesn\u0027t fit at all with that description.

A great movie, but I dont think it accurately depicted the Mercury Astronauts. For instance I\u0027ve always wondered why in the movie they made it out as if Gus Grissom had a panic attack.
