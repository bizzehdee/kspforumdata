Its not enough to argue that a customer could have ignored the store page entirely and never heard of early access in their life, the bar is \u0022Reasonable Customer\u0022, which is generally considered to include \u0022Basic Familiarity with market\u0022 and \u0022Reads the product pages\u0022. If you pass that bar, then you need to prove (And actually prove, not assert) that the product failure was deliberate mishandling and malice beyond what might reasonably be considered in the normal failure of a product or project. IE, you\u0027d effectively be hoping against hope that you find during discovery that Nate kept a log of every bad decision made on the project and every bad justification that was given with full awareness that they were bad. If discovery turns up that the team put a good faith effort into building the product, that Take2 put a good faith effort into funding the project, and it simply didn\u0027t work out due to market realities, then that\u0027s that, its over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd unfortunately, the evidence is exactly that. Take2 via Private Division funded the game for years, to a fairly significant sum of developers, and only started pushing to see a return years later with the EA push - after providing additional resources and time to deliver on a scope expansion pitched by the team (Important detail as this indicates faith in the project, a malicious project wouldn\u0027t have bothered) to try and meet market expectations. They then gave it a good period of time to prove its wings, before a combination of evidently poor sales, poor reception, and poor progress joined with current market realities of expensive capital and declining revenues across entertainment, causing the company to pursue a wide ranging and market-reasonable reduction project. It\u0027ll be extremely hard to argue that KSP2 specifically was a malicious, mishandled project when they axed multiple projects and studios that all appeared to be underperforming, and now look to be axing an entire label that fit under the same problem space. The project simply lacks that single critical obvious malice failure moment that makes it irrefutable that they intended a bad or scammy outcome. Its absolutely possible to argue some widespread connection or conspiracy element, but you need evidence, not conjecture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelieve me, I wouldn\u0027t mind if the opportunities were better, but the reality is that no sane court is going to hold a videogame to Criminal Trial standards based off \u0022The games unfinished, and they stopped developing it when they told us that was a thing that could happen\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-09T10:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224396862\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225062\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221717870585\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223932\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AstroWolfie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, AstroWolfie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly what the title says.

Fill out the paperwork, pay the filing fee, which isn\u0027t even that much in the grand scheme of things, and then expect a 50 page motion to dismiss from T2 lawyers within 2-4 weeks. If the motion to dismiss is shorter, don\u0027t even bother, it means your filing was crap. But if you want to prove that there\u0027s a case, that\u0027s when you\u0027d start.

There might be additional regulations T2 didn\u0027t adhere to, however, especially if you look globally, which might give you a stronger case based on the known facts. You\u0027ll still need a good law firm to take it, though. And the thing is that if you do find a good law firm to take a class action, and it looks like they have the case, T2 will settle for the fraction of the sales, which any sensible law firm will take, and you\u0027ll get maybe $5 in the mail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it worth the hassle just to serve as a warning to publishers?

Not that it\u0027s a reason to let publishers get away with crap, obviously, but I\u0027m not sure KSP2 is the right target. First of all, it\u0027s not a huge amount of money for T2. It\u0027ll cost them a few mil at worst, and they\u0027ve just recently posted a few billion in losses. They won\u0027t notice.

The whole business of unpaid testers (early access) should probably be a violation of employment laws.
