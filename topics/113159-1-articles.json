It\u0027s been about the only thing I do in KSP. And I\u0027ve created alot of huge behemoths. I\u0027ve stuck to only stock parts and did use FAR before 1.0.\n\nThis is my latest creation. Stock with Engineer and Action groups extended. No cheats, no clipping.\n\n**The SCI Levo.** \n\nA SSTO capable of taking 45t out into orbit. \n\nIt\u0027s 351t at launch with the payload. \n\nConsists of 387 parts, of whom 38 are RAPIERS and 4 are NERVA\u0027s. \n\nIt has full RCS maneuverability, which is needed during the insertion stage for extra control authority. \n\nHas detachable front wings to alter the CoL and make reentry possible. \n\nLanding is tough, with the plane unable to land on uneven terrain in more than -2m/s in vertical velocity. I don\u0027t think you can land it if it\u0027s full of fuel.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Well it gets the job done, although there are less party alternatives ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nHere\u0027s a stretch; You\u0027re using too much engines and fuel, it goes like - need more thrust - need more engines - need more fuel, and that\u0027s how most problems start with large lifter designs. Pretty sure that much of a powerplant can lift something more than just an orange tank,but no space so .. \n\nThere is much room for improvement, mainly decreasing the powerplant and engines, which removes excess wait in the process, the wings may as well be causing much drag to be practical, balance the powerplant, the fuel levels, and the lit ratio and you\u0027re good to do ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nNote to SHiftER, it\u0027s always fun to diagnose other people\u0027s crafts ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Screeno","CreatedById":141893,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T08:36:08Z","Content":"Also shift, minimizing drag using a streamlined airframe reduces the need for redicoilous amounts of engines, the craft in the op I can tell from looking at it has many large changes in cross section area so it will produce a lot of transonic/supersonic drag.

First on the agenda was to have some nacelles away from the main fuselage to make it stable on the runway, and when I had done that I was up into such a large mass that I felt like I had to spam engines. I\u0027ve been using the old rule of thumb to have atleast one engine per 10t, which might very admittedly be outdated now with how the new jet engines handle. \n\nWith the wings I tried to keep each heavy part supported by a lifting surface to avoid aerodynamic destruction. I think I tend to forget that aircraft should be streamlined :\u0027D But is this what you say about the different intakes true, or just speculation? I haven\u0027t found much information on what sets them apart, and as of now I just use the ram intakes because they look better\n\nAlso, wow, 45t with 130t? That\u0027s quite the achievement! Was that with stock parts or mods?"}]}
