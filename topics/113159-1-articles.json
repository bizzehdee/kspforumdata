First on the agenda was to have some nacelles away from the main fuselage to make it stable on the runway, and when I had done that I was up into such a large mass that I felt like I had to spam engines. I\u0027ve been using the old rule of thumb to have atleast one engine per 10t, which might very admittedly be outdated now with how the new jet engines handle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the wings I tried to keep each heavy part supported by a lifting surface to avoid aerodynamic destruction. I think I tend to forget that aircraft should be streamlined :\u0027D But is this what you say about the different intakes true, or just speculation? I haven\u0027t found much information on what sets them apart, and as of now I just use the ram intakes because they look better\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, wow, 45t with 130t? That\u0027s quite the achievement! Was that with stock parts or mods?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
