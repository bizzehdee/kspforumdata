So let\u0027s start \u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EReplace the Red Cross of procedural part interfaces with a Green Tick\u00A0headband at the bottom \u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0You can\u0027t place parts on a procedural part (like Wings) while the \u0022move\u0022 menu is open, the only way to and it is to click on the very little red cross at the top right. I think it would be much clearer if you replace that with a green tick bandeau\u00A0(French don\u0027t know if it\u0027s the right word) at the bottom, just like you did with the bin Icon at the bottom of the Part-Catalogue (but green with a tick lol).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDisplay a small part preview on managers :\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003ETo make part names in the differents managers (like Part-Manager, Kerbal-M, Ressource-M) less\u00A0abstract (the names are most of just random letters for most of us), you could place a small part preview (like the Part-Catalogue one at the right of the name).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPlace a little indicator to tell us the engine type\u00A0of a engine in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0I truly like how you placed size-indicators (XS, SM, MD, LG and XL) on all the in-game\u00A0parts, that\u0027s really cool. But I think we could see an another one on the engine top-right preview image\u00A0with its engine type (BS/BT for Boosters like Mammoth, ST for Sustainers like Vector, OB for orbital engine like Poodle, and DP for Deep Space engines like \u0026lt;NOT FOUND\u0026gt;). This would gladly help new-players to understand what engine is needed in what circonstances (if you explain this mechanic to them). would see the indicator in like gradient\u00A0of blue (light blue for boosters --\u0026gt; Really dark blue for Deep Space engine).\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really hope you\u0027ll see al of this, and I wish this game to run on my PC anytime soon \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is a little (and bad) Paint image to explain graphicly what I mean \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/2gaCFc1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/2gaCFc1\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethe URL don\u0027t work so here it is\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
