A 4 kerbal pod that is similar to the orion capsule and other new capsules\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Better \u00A0eva science experiments. In the stock game science kits only have 1 eva experiment per planet. It would be \u00A0nice to have more experiments that could be done. Maybe some science experiments would require more than one kerbal to perform\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Animated interactions with other kerbals. Stuff like waving, High fives. \u00A0stuff like that would make them feel more alive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Eva following. Other Kerbals can follow you. There could be multiple modes like follow or follow right next to you\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Better inventory. You could carry heavier stuff with more kerbals which would be useful in building bases and space stations\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGive me more ideas in the comments\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-07T18:24:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2022 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by THE_KERBAL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
