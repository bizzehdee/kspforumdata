The highway can contain bridges, but it\u0027s going to be a great idea to actually model around the major geographical features such as mountains and lakes. Since modifying the planet is WAY too far, I think that simply putting a model around these features is going to be good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIt is impossible to do this alone, this is why I posted this on the forums as a community project.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we need a map of Kerbin with elevations. Something along these lines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://serc.carleton.edu/images/NAGTWorkshops/visualize04/world_map.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022world_map.jpg\u0022\u003EThen, we would need to draw the highway line going around the geographical features. Then, it would be a great idea if we can find the actual 3D model of Kerbin in actual size. After that, the segmental building process may begin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is for KSP 0.24.2, and we would use the KerbTown mod for help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope to receive support for this big oncoming project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
