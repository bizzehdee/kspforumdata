NASA decided based on the 2013 decadal survey that Europa wasn\u0027t going to be a priority for now (instead focusing on Mars). This year\u0027s review may change that but that\u0027s never going to be on time for a 2024 launch. Keep in mind Clipper has been in development since 2013 with the design going as far back as 2011 and the availability of funding coming from the 2003 decadal survey. That\u0027s 21 years from funding to launch. And the only reason it got funded at all after 2013 was because of Senator Culberson\u0027s clever trickery, otherwise it would have been 30\u002B years. That money is already spent and even if there was any left it would not be available for additional Europa missions AFAIK (Culberson\u0027s efforts only forced NASA to one Europa mission).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this year\u0027s survey earmarks Europa, we might see a lander mission in the next decade, but funding and designing a lander mission in 1 year by a government organization, I\u0027m sure you know as well as anyone that\u0027s going to be a pipe dream.
