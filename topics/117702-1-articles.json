Working title is \u0022Flight Operations\u0022. Features currently are:\n\n- Names flights automatically from the vessel name, e.g. \u0022Untitled Spacecraft\u0022 becomes \u0022Untitled Spacecraft 1\u0022, then \u0022Untitled Spacecraft 2\u0022, etc.\n- Support for specifying number location and format, e.g. \u0022STS-##\u0022 becomes \u0022STS-01\u0022 then \u0022STS-02\u0022 etc.\n- Tracks the following information for each completed flight:\n    - Flight Name\n    - Vessel Name\n    - Vessel Type\n    - Launch Mass\n    - Launch Cost\n    - Pilot Name\n    - # Crew\n    - # Passengers\n    - Launch Date\n    - Science Discovered\n    - Funds Earned\n    - Reputation Gained\n    - Contracts Completed\n    - Landing Date/Destruction Date\n    - Costs Recovered\n    - Orbital Reference\n    - Apoapsis\n    - Periapsis\n    - Inclination\n    - Orbital Period\n- Has a Spaceport UI Window which displays most of that data\n- Orbit information is calculated as the \u0022best\u0022 orbit around the \u0022best\u0022 body. Currently I only support Kerbin, and \u0022best\u0022 orbit is the largest orbital period\n- \u0022Best\u0022 body will probably be based on furthest body orbit is achieved around\n\nStil to do for v0.1 release:\n\n- Complete UI [Currently just shows a few items, and doesn\u0027t support scrolling]\n- Currently not saving orbital parameters for some reason\n- Add Mission Duration\n\nRoadmap:\n\n**v0.2**\n\n- Launch dialog on click launch which captures flight details, desired apogee and perigee and inclination\n- Track success vs failure of the launch\n- Show success/failure on Mission Display via red/green/amber\n\n**v0.3**\n\n- Track telemetry (acceleration, altitude, speed, distance, dynamic pressure, fuel flow, thrust)\n- Track \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E against Vessel Modified events\n- Track continuous throttle settings, yaw, pitch, roll\n- Track angle from prograde vector\n- Show mission graph with events marked\n\n**v0.4**\n\n- Add root cause analysis to Launch failure. Payload problem. Launch Vehicle problem. Pilot error. Kraken. Other.\n- Add Launch name and details to vessel tag in UI\n- Integrate with StageRecovery\n- Show mission map with events marked\n\n**v0.5**\n\n- Track screenshots at certain events. Launch, separation events, destruction events, orbit achieved. Payload decoupled.\n- Launch screenshot. 1s, 5s, 10s, 10s from set location\n- Screenshot from above and in front on separation events\n- Same on destruction events\n- From side 3/4 up on orbit achieved\n- Same from 5s after payload separation\n\nIf you\u0027d like to be a beta tester, please DM me, and I\u0027ll send you the beta mod when it\u0027s ready for testing."},{"CreatedByName":"Heed","CreatedById":165609,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-23T20:19:39Z","Content":"Below you can see a screenshot.
