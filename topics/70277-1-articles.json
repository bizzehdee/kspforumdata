You basically need to remove the bottom stage in the VAB and then redo the entire six-step list to get the numbers for the second stage. And then you remove that stage in the VAB and do it all again for the third stage, if it exists. And so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd because that wasn\u0027t confusing enough, you then need to think about \u0022what defines a stage anyway\u0022. Because while that is a fairly easy question to answer if you think of real life rockets like the Saturn V, in KSP we tend to do more exotic staging concepts. For example, in the Saturn V, the first stage engines burn only during the first stage, the second stage engines only burn during the second stage, and so on. But in contrast, the space shuttle: The solid boosters burn during the first stage, and the three liquid engines also burn during the first stage... AND the second stage. Stages change when the solid boosters run out, but the liquid engines never even shut down, they just keep burning. Asparagus staging pushes this to the extreme - really heavy lifters may have an onion shell of 18 tanks around the central core, which are dropped in pairs every couple moments. And every dropping action is actually a stage change, even if you\u0027re not igniting any new engines but rather have 17 out of 19 first stage engines continue burning. This can easily lead to lifters that require you to calculate over a dozen stages individually just to get out of the atmosphere, some of which are active only for a few seconds and supply only a small few hundred m/s of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and on the topic of atmospheres: All Isp and dV numbers calculated herein are vacuum numbers. If you want to determine how much actual, atmospheric dV your lifter stage gives you, you need to plot a curve of the Isp profile during a typical ascent from ignition to flameout of that particular stage, with that specific payload on top, and then integrate that over time in order to find an average Isp value to use for the rocket equation. And if you\u0027re mixing engines, then you need to of course do this for each type of engine individually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if your payload changes? You do ALL of this all over again. I suppose you now see why people prefer using VOID or KER \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E And even those tools are not able to show you actual atmospheric dV, because that depends on the exact ascent path chosen, and would be a pain in the behind even if you knew the exact path. So they only show you the worst-case, sea level atmospheric dV as a comparison point.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-24T07:51:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2014 07:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T17:13:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tbridges42\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tbridges42\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow lets say I want to introduce an arbitrary payload of x tons, and for some reason I don\u0027t want to just put the launch vehicle on there and see what VOID says.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be a pain making test loads of a specific mass - stupid_chris has done it for us: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76231-0-23-x-Kerbal-NRAP-adjustable-test-weight-for-rocket-building%21-v1-4-11-04-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENRAP adjustable test weight\u003C/a\u003E.
