It has led me to having a heightened interest and knowledge regarding space exploration as well as many other individuals. The feeling of euphoria you recieve when you first get into a stable orbit, or a successful mission to the Mun, the essentially endless possibilities, the many obstacles and challenges to set and conquer for yourself, the vast array mods and the list goes on. I have always loved this game and I still will. Despite this however, it is most definitely wrong to release the game into 1.0 this early, simply out of concern of the vast amount of features that are being implemented which increases the risk of new bugs, which you most certainly do not want if you intend to give the critics good first impressions, and the lack of certain content that the devs still have to address.
