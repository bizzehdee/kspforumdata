Which is best, or does it depend if you use it for peace or war?

The M drive, when engaged, will allow the ship and crew to harmlesdly shift the vessel\u0027s forward momentum wherever the the ship\u0027s nose is pointed. In other words, to go backwards just flip over and engage the M drive. If you want to actually adjust your vessel\u0027s speed you need to either burn rocket fuel or use a planet for grav-assist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAntimatter thermal rocket: with liquid hydrogen propellant. Can thrust for days at 1g or somehat less at higher g.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1g constant acceleration drive: Provides 1g forward momentum via a kilogram of antimatter. No rocket plume is created as antimatter is converted directly into forward acceleration\u00A0without blowing exhaust out the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would take a month at 1g to run out of a kilogram of antimatter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only catch is that the 1g drive only can\u00A0do 1g or below. So to take off from Earth it needs to take off like a plane and build up enough forward velocity to enter orbit around earth. Simply flying vertical from a standstill won\u0027t work, it would only make your vessel hover in midair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo...
