At first, I thought it was going to be a very well-written, well thought out message to the community. Even though it satisfies those criteria, it seems to be just another complaining fan-boy who wants his toys working NOW, as well as the fact that he can\u0027t seem to remember that this entire game, every bit of it, aside from Squad\u0027s efforts, it is completely free and is a hobby. Bac9 have been kind enough to spend a considerable amount of time using his talents, using his passion, to help make our gameplay that much better. Why can\u0027t we be thankful for that and leave it alone? Why do we have to chase, hound, and bicker about a lack of updates or the fact that he can\u0027t take a couple minutes to leave a message to let us know what\u0027s going on in his life? What does it matter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Crazier\u0027s post, to get back to my original subject, I have to agree that it is just a thinly veiled attempt at trying to appear to take the high road, when, in reality, he is just like every other poster who wants an answer yesterday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the long run, whether or not we get a response, we get an update to this marvelous pack or not, what does it matter?
