As long as they\u0027d be placed near the end of the tech tree, does it really matter if they\u0027re \u0022better\u0022 than the other engines? As it stands RAPIERs aren\u0027t able to lift huge loads to orbit unless you use a \u003Cstrong\u003Elot\u003C/strong\u003E of them, which of course increases part count and lag. As 5thHorseman said, with updated stock aerodynamics those engines wouldn\u0027t need to be as powerful as they currently are, and RAPIERs in rocket mode are not very efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
