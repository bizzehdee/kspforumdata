I\u0027d love to see one that \u0022circulates fuel\u0022 to try to change or average the temperature of fuel tanks. Hmmm, one could use an interface, similar to the fuel flow priority, to designate which tanks are to be kept warmest or coldest. That way you could try to minimize the temperature of the tank behind the cockpit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese were interesting:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19750009264.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19750009264.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/912902.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/912902.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(pg 63)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-02T11:43:15Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2017 11:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by FleshJeb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-02T16:51:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223209207\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167063\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221509622089\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022111640\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FleshJeb\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, FleshJeb said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember reading something that said not to bother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight have been me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now I have the very special use case of a gentle entry with airliner wings. Those radiate well, so if you don\u0027t put too much load on them at any given time you can reach an equilibrium well below their critical temperature. The cockpit, however, will eventually get into trouble with it\u0027s core temp.

Of note, the one large radiator accounted for about 1/3 of the drag of the entire craft. Also, I think the Precooler may have a much higher overall emissivity\u00A0than the Mk1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0tanks.
