V2.1a is the last one I tried and unlike every other mod I\u0027ve used that just copies additional files to the GameData folder it instructs you to copy files to the KSP_Data\\Mono folder and I think that\u0027s where the rub is. The instructions say to overwrite the KSP_Data folder which is ridiculous as there is all kinds of other files there. Anyone out there got this to work yet? I\u0027d really like to add some different music to KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
