As it \u0022zips\u0022 past the planet and moves away, it again slows down. However, the planet is moving in relation to the Sun, and as the probe flies by the planet, some of that momentum and kinetic energy is transferred to the probe. In other words, the planet pulls the probe along for a sjort time in its orbit around the sun, giving it a boost in speed relative to the sun. \n\nThe total amount of kinetic energy and momentum is conserved. The planet loses some momentum and kinetic energy. But the effect on the planet is not noticable because of its large mass in relation to the probe.\n\nEdit: Gravity assists can also slow a spacecraft down in relation to the sun. If a boost in velocity is required, the spacecraft will travel alongside the planet in the same direction as the planet\u0027s orbit. If a decrease in velocity is required, it will travel in opposite direction of the planet\u0027s orbit and the planet will \u0022drag it back\u0022 in relation to the sun.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T17:10:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 05:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jonboy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T17:05:00Z","Content":"Ok, empty universe, small object (0), heavy object (1) appears on trajectory, that just misses object 0.\n\nI ran a simulation in my mind, and found that small object will get some velocity change, but there is big probability of collision.
