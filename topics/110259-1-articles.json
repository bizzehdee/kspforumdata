However, the planet is moving in relation to the Sun, and as the probe flies by the planet, some of that momentum and kinetic energy is transferred to the probe.

I recall that Stochasty won by building a lander that could make a roll-on landing at high speed (one restriction of the challenge was that you had to land in one piece). I got close to Stochasty\u0027s result by using multiple munar gravitational assists to match orbits with the Mun before making my final approach. On my best attempt, I entered the Mun\u0027s SOI on an elliptical orbit.
