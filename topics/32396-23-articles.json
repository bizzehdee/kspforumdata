It couldn\u0027t be one part with different efficiency because 2/3 of the stack wouldn\u0027t function outside of micro-gravity.

I\u0027ve got a fully functioning base established on Minmus, but I did it using the Runway instead of the launchpad because not only does the Runway fold up more effectively, but it allows you to forgo launching up a smelter or workshop because the runway does all of those functions on its own. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first problem, is that no matter how I try to connect the runway module with my Kethane miner, the build menu will not recognize that there is fuel to be used for the build. It doesn\u0027t matter if I connect them with docking ports, KAS connectors, nothing will work. And yes, I tried connecting the KAS DIRECTLY onto the runway.
