Aerobraking (even only a few thousand meters deep) at a reasonable planetary system entry speed (say 3000-4000 m/s at periapsis) has resulted in virtually instantaneous combustion, particularly of struts. Even return to kerbin from minmus took about six passes and a strong retrograde burn to keep the struts from failing. Regular parts however do seem fairly reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeo","CreatedById":147045,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T00:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SebLavK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SebLavK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIIRC, the space shuttle\u0027s ceramic tiles were not ablative, and were to be replaced after a few flights or if they sustained damage.
