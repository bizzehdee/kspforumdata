As an added bonus I did the same thing to Kerbal Alarm Clock and now the buttons have symbols on them. Thanks again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the solution is to peel the Chatterer Game Data file down to the file that says Chatterer and put that in the KSP game data file ( with KAC its peel to the file called Trigger tech). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thanks to all who read or tried to help.
