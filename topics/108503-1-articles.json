What a terrific \u0027game\u0027! I am now on the steep (vertical?) learning curve but have so far managed to get into orbit around both Kerbin and Mun but not without some spectacular failures.\n\nThis forum is a fabulous resource for information about all manner of KSP aspects and will certainly be my first stop for help with any difficulties I have. \n\nI\u0027m looking forward to deeper explorations of the Kerbal universe. I also hope to be able to contribute, although there are many people here much cleverer than I am.\n\nWakaleo (Jim)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T01:52:15Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!
