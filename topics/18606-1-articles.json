Their descriptions make me feel like they can get pretty high, but it seems like after I reach a certain point in altitude, I start to drop, whether I\u0027m using the turbo or the regular ones. My questions really come down to what is the maximum altitude for both engines, how do the nacelles work, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe turbo engine\u0027s description makes me think it could go really high, because of the part that says it\u0027s better in thin air environments, but once I get around 8000 meters, I start to drop and it chokes. I\u0027m just confused and terrible at this game. Anybody have a definition of these parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I\u0027ve noticed is the \u0022OptimalFlow\u0022 when I right click the engine. It says 60.00, but the higher I get, the less efficiently the engine appears to operate. I\u0027m not a rocket scientist yet, so I\u0027d love to have someone explain all this, or give me a link to a guide that does that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-04T07:28:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2012 07:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Aphox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emore confusion!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serratus","CreatedById":12069,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T09:02:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no \u0022maximum\u0022. It\u0027s a gradient. When You fly, right-click on the engine and look at efficiency. as long as it\u0027s over 0.2, that engine is producing more thrust than it needs to cancel its own weight (that\u0027s a presumption I\u0027m working on). Some designs can go as hight as 10Km or even higher. My standard alt. is ~7Km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptimal flow is about wind speed.

I got my jet, which is roughly based off the design of a 747 (pretty long, 4 engines) to around 13,600 meters and it seemed to hit it\u0027s maximum thrust, giving me 200 intake power and using fuel pretty slowly. If I went higher than about 16,000m, the efficiency dropped a bit and I lost a little speed. I didn\u0027t design the craft to jettison the fuel tanks so the fastest I got going was 650 m/s, but that\u0027s still pretty fast considering my previous flights maxed around 250 because I wasn\u0027t climbing high enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould still like to know if the nacelle/radial engine mounts/fans/ram scoops have any significant effect though, and on which engines each works best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T11:46:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah, efficiency depends on both speed (in any direction) and altitude, if you\u0027re going up to orbit then you\u0027ll notice jet engine efficiency will often increase again when you fire the rockets because of the faster speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serratus","CreatedById":12069,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T11:59:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so far fans/ram have no effect as well as engines \u0027body\u0027.
