This is not to replace those per s\u00E8, but to have a more intuitive utility inside the game for those playing stock only.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, with all the talk of multiplayer being said about competing space agencies or collaborative projects, I submit an additional multiplayer idea in tandem with the first suggestion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, flight planning. Not using \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eany\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003Eutilities or mods leaves just a few things for an all stock player to plan their trip around Eeloo by way of Jool: experience (which may not always apply), adequate planning (also known to the inexperienced as \u0027wild guessing\u0027), and (mostly for me) luck. I say that something should be done to fix that, and it can be with a simple utility: the creation of a relatively simplistic mission planner.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission planner itself will appear in the form of a \u0027tracking station\u0027-like orbital map, displaying the KSC on Kerbin, a small icon representing the planned flight, and optionally one target non-celestial object. In addition to the orbital map, the mission planning center will m support a\u00A0couple of functions. The first function is an adjustable \u0027launch\u0027 time setting, using universal time. What this does is shifts all celestial bodies (and any target object) around to their exact position at this given universal time. The second function is a \u0027Mission Elapsed Time\u0027 (MET) slider/editable field that also adjusts these celestial bodies (and target object) position, in addition to the small ship icon along a planned flight path (more later). The third function is a set of adjustable trans-atmospheric parameters including position, heading, speed and time including a projected suborbital path (this establishes, relative to launch, where and when you\u0027ve left atmo and can rightly use nodes). If the MET slider is less than the time to orbit, the spaceship is not represented along its flight path, as it would still be in atmosphere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, as with the orbital view, the mission planning center can add and edit maneuver nodes to the flight path. The\u00A0game already features maneuver nodes that can be edited in flight. Having this should allow\u00A0the player to view any transfers that they set up, and by editing the MET parameter, view transfers and intercepts (with updated vessel, target, and celestial bodies positioning) for any time in the flight. Lastly, there are two buttons: \u0027Upload Flight Plan to Pad\u0027 and \u0027Upload Flight Plan, Warp to Launch\u0027. Both have similar effects, where you then select a vessel for the mission, with proper crewing, very much like just clicking the launch pad or runway. Both will have the maneuver nodes loaded, including the atmospheric node, which will be locked to the pad until launch. The \u0027Warp to Launch\u0027 would time warp to find minutes before launch, and then go to the launch pad with the MET clock counting down from T-Minus 5:00 for launch (hitting 0:00 wouldn\u0027t stage, but provides a good launch indicator).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second half of this post involves having a single player as pilot with additional person(s) possibly building the rocket ahead of time, planning missions, etc. and during missions functioning as a ground crew, viewing flight telemetry data, viewing part statistics (fuel, power, etc.), equipment data (pressure, temperature, etc. if the equipment is on), being able to interact with the in-flight tweakables from the telemetry screen, adjusting flight plans and maneuver nodes, and so on from either a LAN connection or over Internet as a multiplayer experience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
