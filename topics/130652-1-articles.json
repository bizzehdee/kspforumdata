Also potentially good for fitting stuff in cargo bays. Maybe it could add structural weakness or whatever it naturally would. but it could be invaluable for plane design. Preferably the ability to effectively define a line and place it anywhere on the wing at any angle to bend it there or add a hinge etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-24T20:47:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2016 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T00:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would be difficult to code.

You give it a mesh, and an axis on which to bend out, as well as a bending distance, and their function needs to pop out a new mesh ASAP, and if that part is animated, the animations need to be recomputed as well, so, for example, bending a cargo bay in half means the door animation needs to be automatically fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capran","CreatedById":65692,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T21:47:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInfernal Robotics gives you motorized hinges and other parts.
