Changing pitch decreases the \u003Cem\u003Ehorizontal\u00A0thrust \u003C/em\u003E(because part of it is now used to raise the altitude)\u00A0and that causes an airspeed drop, resulting in increased \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, which in turns increases drag and slows you down even further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn theory, throttling up to climb works, but you\u0027ll pick up a lot of speed doing that. In practice (at least, the way I\u0027ve heard it), you only control climb/descent with throttle during landing, where you use the throttle to control angle of attack, which is directly related to your\u00A0angle of descent. In all other regimes, you use throttle and elevator in coordination in order to keep your airspeed more or less constant. Autopilots sometimes include an airspeed hold that does this automatically (you throttle up, it pitches up to maintain the desired airspeed). If you try to accelerate in straight line without stick input, the plane will climb, but that\u0027s because it\u0027ll be out of trim for the new airspeed, and in most\u00A0airliners, thrust will induce an additional pitching moment, because the engines are below the wings (An-72 will push the nose \u003Cem\u003Edown \u003C/em\u003Ewith increased thrust because of this).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are getting yourself confused somewhere. When you throttle down, in steady state, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E stays constant, air speed stays constant, and you descend. Your pitch angle changes, because your relative wind now has vertical component, so the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E means a more nose-down attitude. Likewise, if you throttle up, the nose goes up and you start climbing, but again, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E and air speed stay pretty much constant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the reason is that airplanes are intentionally built this way. The CoP of the main wing is behind CoG, which means that with no other forces, the only direction a plane would be going is a vertical dive. But the horizontal stabilizer on the tail is built for negative lift and is way behind the CoG. The net CoP is balanced on CoG in level flight. Now, if you apply external force to force a plane to pitch up, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E on both the wing and stabilizer increases, which increases lift on the wing and decreases negative lift on the tail. This shifts CoP back and causes the plane to pitch forward. Likewise, trying to force the plane to pitch down results in CoP shifting forward and plane pitching up. Assuming all other factors impact your wing and stabilizer the same way, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E is fixed in steady state and depends only on position of elevators. And because \u0022neutral\u0022 position of elevators depends on your trim settings, when you trim your aircraft, what you\u0027re really trimming for is specific \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as pointed out, if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E is fixed, so is the air speed. Once airplane settles down to your adjustments, all forces and torques are balanced. (That\u0027s definition of steady state.) That means Lift \u002B Weight \u002B Drag \u002B Thrust = 0. And unless you\u0027re doing something really drastic, Lift and Weight are roughly opposed and Drag and Thrust are roughly opposed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this in mind, what \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/137807-mikegarrison/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022137807\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/137807-mikegarrison/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@mikegarrison\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0wrote should make more sense. If you keep your trim settings and throttle down, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E can\u0027t change, because your elevators didn\u0027t move. The lift hasn\u0027t changed, or you\u0027d be accelerating down. And so the only thing a plane can do is continue at the same air speed, descending gradually, trading gravitational potential energy to substitute for reduced power from the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, all of this works to first order. Yes, real planes are more complex. L/D is not constant. It\u0027s a factor of absolutely every variable mentioned and a few that weren\u0027t. The wing and stabilizer do not respond the same way to air speed changes, because they aren\u0027t the same shape and there is air stream interference.\u00A0If your climb/descent rate are significant, then your lift and weight vectors are not colinear. All of that means that in a realistic scenario, if you adjust one thing, you have to adjust all the others. It\u0027s not as bad as flying a helicopter, but you still have to coordinate your inputs. Nonetheless, if you want to descend, you reduce throttle\u00A0and then correct everything else. If you want to slow down you pitch up, correct everything else, then trim if you\u0027re happy with the new speed. The intention is still tied to a specific input, with other inputs being corrective. Mentally, think of it as a difference between making small adjustments to the steering wheel in a car when you\u0027re hit by sudden gust of side wind vs making deliberate turn. You\u0027re turning the steering wheel in both cases, but intention and how you process it are very different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisclamer: I don\u0027t have significant air time on anything larger than a C172.

As I mentioned, what I wrote applies to quasi steady state level cruise. Obviously if you change something, it\u0027s no longer exactly steady state.

When an airline crew decides they need to make up time and therefore fly a little faster, the autopilot will lower the lift coefficient in order to match the increased airspeed.

If you want to correct your altitude by a handful of feet, then maybe minute throttle adjustments are the way to do that, but in the general case, elevator is very much used. In fact, during the initial climb, you use full throttle and adjust elevators to maintain optimal climb airspeed. This is true both in Cessna and in the F-16.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI admit, I am coming over from fighters, where \u0022jamming inputs to the limits\u0022 is something you do quite often, especially in modern FBW birds. So I might be flying that Cessna a little rougher than it\u0027s usual. However, physics don\u0027t change between a Mustang and a C172, only engine power (that and the fact you can trim your ailerons in a Mustang). \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E depends on weight and airspeed. In fact, military planes usually don\u0027t have a landing speed specified, because their weight varies so much that it would be pointless. Rather, they have a specific \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E that you\u0027re supposed to hold. For civilian planes, it works the same physically, only instead of flying the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator,\u00A0you have to calculate a landing airspeed which, incidentally, is the airspeed which would give you the proper \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E for landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt helps to think of what fighter pilots call \u0022energy\u0022, and which in physical terms is the sum of kinetic and potential energy of the plane. Your engine gives you energy, which you can put into airspeed, or into altitude. By changing your pitch, you adjust how much of your thrust is going into either. Drag takes away your energy at a rate dependent on\u00A0your airspeed and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, which is dependent on your airspeed and weight. Gs you\u0027re pulling (by actuating your elevators)\u00A0factor into the latter, but most GA planes can\u0027t stray too far from 1G. Pitch itself doesn\u0027t, as long as you\u0027re not climbing or descending so\u00A0steeply that it causes your\u00A0G-load to change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said, landing is one situation where you generally use your throttle for fine glideslope\u00A0adjustments. However, that assumes you\u0027re close to glideslope in first place. It\u0027s pretty easy to correct three whites or three reds that way, but if you\u0027ve got four whites or four reds, I\u0027d adjust the elevators, too. Another example of precision flying, that is formations, doesn\u0027t do\u00A0that, though. You control your vertical and horizontal position with the stick, your overtake with the throttle, because there you don\u0027t care much about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, but airspeed has to match pretty exactly.

A simple constant speed prop for a piston engine uses engine oil pressure to drive a hydraulic cylinder in the prop hub. The amount of oil it is fed is controlled by a centrifugal governor mounted to the side of the propeller shaft. When the engine is throttled up, it tries to increase RPM. This drives the governor to feed more oil into the hub, which increases the pitch of the blades. This increases the load on the engine, and prop RPM remains relatively constant. Likewise, when the engine is throttled down, the pitch on the blades is decreased and engine RPM remains about constant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMulti engine aircraft have the ability to feather the prop, or turn the blades such that they are parallel to the air flow to minimize drag.

Meanwhile, F-15 and F/A-18 do actually need a bit of lift to get them off the ground, but so little that it can actually be entirely body lift, with Israeli F-15 infamously landing without a wing. The way these aircraft stay in the air has more in common with physics of skipping rocks than aerodynamics of an airliner, let alone a general aviation aircraft. Most crucially, they aren\u0027t stable, with flight computer actually responsible for turning pilot\u0027s inputs into movement of control surfaces that result in the sort of movement of the aircraft that makes intuitive sense. When you pull on the stick in a modern fighter, it doesn\u0027t translate into movement of elevators. It translates into movements of every single control surface throughout the aircraft. This is almost never simulated in flight sims. Instead, they fake a conventional aerodynamics model that resembles the flight dynamics of a fighter, but which is, in fact, stable. The virtual control surfaces that simulation uses usually have nothing to do with locations of real control surfaces on a jet. Building an actual aerodynamic model of a fighter jet would require writing a dedicated flight computer for every fighter, and that\u0027s almost never done. Stock X-Plane and Microsoft Flight Simulator X\u00A0jets most certainly do not do that, as I have messed with modding these. There might be some modded aircraft out there that attempt to reproduce correct flight model and flight computer\u00A0behavior, but since all of the originals are military secrets, it can only be an approximation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is why bringing fighter piloting experience from a generic flight sim, not one built for military training, is just a tier above citing an action movie. They do replicate a lot of the flight characteristics, and some better ones even do a decent job in replicating the feel of flying such a plane. But they have almost nothing to do with physics of an actual fighter jet, because that\u0027s just not the sort of thing these games are built to simulate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also why I keep telling you to load up the C172. One of the nicer things about that plane is that it has a very simple aerodynamic model. Outside of wind shear, the hardest thing to simulate on it is p-factors, and that\u0027s not very hard. I cannot overstate the difference that a real cockpit makes with all the movement, vibration, that feeling of seat pushing into you as your wing load increases, and how you can feel every shift of the wind on a small plane. But all of that aside, even older flight simulators tend to do a good job of simulating how a C172 actually responds to input and how it behaves in the air. So it\u0027s a good test case. You can learn\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealmost\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0everything you need to know about flying that plane from a sim.

have some excelent points, in an slow plane having variable pitch is less useful as as these tend to be cheap planes you just as well go with fixed pitch.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow for something fast like an turbo prop or an WW 2 fighter plane you need variable pitch, you also want the engine to run near optimal RPM and flying high should also demand more aggressive pitch.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd as you say changing pitch is fast who is useful for an fighter.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKnow about the trading speed for attitude as an way to do slow landings in KSP, nice for rugged terrain landings, downside is that its hard to land accurate but you can always taxi

to my first post in this topic and say again that the main reason why most propeller-driven airplanes use constant-speed variable-pitch propellers is because propeller tip speed is a very important design parameter and it is easier/better to design a pitch adjustment mechanism than it is to try to design for a wide range of tip speeds.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
