That could take a very long time. The physics engine is constantly updating the position of everything in the game. The problem is, with 32-bit numbers, you will get rounding errors. The position your ship is in is due to these rounding errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP tests the boundaries of 32 bit.
