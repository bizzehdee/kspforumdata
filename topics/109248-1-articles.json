That could take a very long time. The physics engine is constantly updating the position of everything in the game. The problem is, with 32-bit numbers, you will get rounding errors. The position your ship is in is due to these rounding errors.\n\nKSP tests the boundaries of 32 bit. Considering at has to deal with extremely large AND miniscule numbers in calculations constantly, I\u0027m surprised it handles it as well as it does."},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T20:10:43Z","Content":"The launch clamps were merely suggesting a sooner gravity turn. ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nAlthough, I\u0027ve warped on the pad for encounters and never encountered this bug.
