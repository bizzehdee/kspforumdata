All my craft is unmanned, I remote-control using my own network of 3 kerbostationary sats and 3 munar sats with all-around coverage (Should I get into this and if you accept the sat network mod in the list, I will set up the same system in your persistent).\n\nI currently have the following standard loads available for delivery to your munbase:\n\n1. Energy storage module - core module of the munbase power plant.\n\n2. Cuttlefish lander - solar panel part of the power plant. A storage module and 6 landers make a complete power plant.\n\n3. \u0027Armed Rovver\u0027 - a truck equipped with a manipulator arm for moving stuff around.\n\nNew payloads are being perfected now and will be available soon.\n\nPlease excuse the lack of pictures, will add some tomorrow.
