But I do support the idea of cueing the player into steering their spacecraft the correct way, as opposed to blindly following a computerized auto-flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m kind of in favor or re-doing the \u0022navball\u0022 in Surface mode to carry more information for atmospheric flights.

In this case, \u0027prograde\u0027 means flight path angle, which is the angle the aircraft\u0027s prograde vector makes with the horizon underneath. So with a horizontal\u00A0FPA of zero, you\u0027re flying level and not gaining or losing altitude. The FPA marker moving off the vertical axis means the aircraft is turning. A roll indicator and a sideslip indicator (which is important for making a coordinated turn) are at the top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight director is shown here as two crosshairs which line up in the center when the aircraft is flying the correct path. Horizontal lines mean pitch, and vertical lines mean \u003Cem\u003Eroll\u003C/em\u003E, which is currently impossible to display as a target marker on the KSP navball. Targets are strictly pitch and yaw only, because for a rocket, roll is practically irrelevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-12T07:47:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechJeb actually lets you do that, if you wish; it calculates the trajectory, gives you control, and points a target programme marker where you need to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for implementation in stock, sure, I\u0027m all for it.
