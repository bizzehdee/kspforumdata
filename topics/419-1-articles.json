Perhaps one of the simplest (vanilla) to orbit machines I have used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresenting the newest MagTech Rocket, the Iridium-TR! Simple yet functional, this Iridium Class light lifter will put three Kerbal \u0027Astroneers\u0027\u00C2\u00A9 into an orbit with sufficient fuel to bring them home, or push them to the great beyond! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis two stage model model can reach a height of nearly 50km on the primary stage, and achieves 300km at 3300km/sec at second stage burnout, on an unguided vertical launch*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay this cheap model enable your future endeavors into the final frontier! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Note: Flight was stabilized. Flight reached a height of 1111K within 10 minutes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=\u0026gt;Usage notes: An initial set of decouplers will \u0027decouple\u0027 you from the launchpad. If you desire more maneuverability, jettison the previous stage at full burn, your ship will remain attached and in control (see pic). This also eliminates any massive slowdowns the game may or may not be suffering.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mixinghoney","CreatedById":2266,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-16T15:00:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI Tested this ship , and its awesome ;D i got into orbit , and still got fuel to go back , thats what i done , but when i got back the parachute didnt worked and we exploded! fun anyway \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhynri","CreatedById":654,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-16T20:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you land on the dark side by any chance?
