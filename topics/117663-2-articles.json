Here\u0027s my feedback:\n\n- it would be nice to have \u0022poses\u0022 in addition to animations. I generally only do screenshots so posing the characters would be great. Right now I just have to make long animations to give me time to start another animation or two, or just do them one at a time and then patch the various poses together in post.\n- being able to reset all sliders to their default position\n- you can enable the editor while time warp is active but it won\u0027t pull the kerbal up to be manipulated\n- if you accidentally double-click the editor button, you can\u0027t actually exit\n- leaving the flight scene and coming back, the editor does not load regardless of whether or not you used it last time you were in the flight scene\n- I can\u0027t seem to create any keyframes when Val is loaded in the editor\n\nI also am having a hard time understanding the key frame editor. I\u0027m not unfamiliar with key frame editors at all, but this one I just can\u0027t seem to fully grok. I got two animations working (cheers and a sustained hand wave) but it was through a lot of trial and error without really understanding how I eventually got them to work the way I wanted.

You can use the Show Hierarchy Tree button when the second page of the animation window is open to add mixing transforms.\n\nAn excerpt from the unity docs on mixing transforms:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E For example you might have a handwaving animation. You might want to play the hand waving animation on a idle character or on a walking character. Either you have to create 2 hand waving animations one for idle, one for walking. By using mixing the hand waving animation will have full control of the shoulder. But the lower body will not be affected by it, and continue playing the idle or walk animation. Thus you only need one hand waving animation.\n\nIn unity\u0027s animation system, layers are just a way of having multiple animations playing at a time, and there is a maximum of 1 animation playing at a time per layer.\n\nYou can use the number keys (not on the numpad) to play animations on the currently \u0027piloted\u0027 kerbal. You can play animations simultaneously on all kerbals using leftAlt\u002Bnumber, or leftCommand on mac.\n\nYou would press 2 keys at the same time to play 2 animations at the same time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-16T21:51:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2015 09:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MrHappyFace**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpriteCoke","CreatedById":123609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T05:27:23Z","Content":"\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
