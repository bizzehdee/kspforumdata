Which means the tree is less linear than the stock.\n\nSo lets me know how can i improve the work ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"aislas","CreatedById":142738,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T17:36:32Z","Content":"This looks great!

It looks really intuitive, organized and it makes sense. I just have a question, by lifeSupport which mods are we talking about? Otherwise this looks really good, great job!\n\nThe first choice was TAC lifeSupport, and it will be completed by UniversalStorage. But it\u0027s not definitive\n\n\u003E \n\u003E One little question: all those mods, will be dependencies or just suggested? Cause with the current 32 bit limitation, all those parts mods will kill almost every install...\n\u003E In the second case, I would suggest to include Interstellar in the tree.\n\nBefore adding these mods, i tried to make a template with the stock techtree, but it was very poor in parts, and not only in count. \n\nSo :\n\n-Remotech is for me essential to turn the stock tree in an unmanned progression.\n\n-KW Rocketry, Novapunch and SpaceY add more power, more punch to your rockets, I can not adding them, anyway, they\u0027ll cost lot of science point to unlock them.\n\n-NearFuture Package adds Solar panels, and some engines (small orbiter etc) but you can play without it.\n\n-FASA launch clamp is additionnal\n\n-LifeSupport, I will see how can I implemente it discretly. Like this, it lets the choice to play with or not. \n\n-RealChute is additionnal\n\n-DrMagicOrbital is a must-have too, to unlock all the node you will need this I think\n\n-And finally, all mods which change the Spaceplane gameplay or add some parts is very very important.\n\nTo resume this, \n\nKW Rocketry, \n\nNP, \n\nSpaceY, \n\nRemotech,\n\nDrMagicOrbital,\n\n\u0022spaceplane parts\u0022\n\nare the required mods at the moment, but I think about to let the choice to install one of rocketry pack..\n\nI will check Interstellar of course ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) It should take a node near the nuclear propulsion\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T19:19:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 07:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rabzoue59**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T19:33:07Z","Content":"For Spaceplanes obviously you\u0027re thinking about B9..."},{"CreatedByName":"rabzoue59","CreatedById":89075,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T20:31:51Z","Content":"B9 adds too much parts maybe,\n\nI\u0027m thinking about Mk2 expansion, QuizTech aerospace or this Adjustable landing gear for example.
