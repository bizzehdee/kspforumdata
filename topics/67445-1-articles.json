However, autonomous lethal robots that have a low incidence of collateral damage is still a few years off. One of the big advantages of a robot though, is that you should be able to log everything it does and thinks about. This allows you to precisely determine why the robot decided to fire on what turned out to be a civilian. It is even a testable situation for humans. You could have a simulator that feeds in all the same data to a human that is \u0027controlling\u0027 the simulated robot and watch if the human decides to make the shot. Perform 30 or so simulations of this, ten with the target set up exactly as it had been, ten with a modified set of data that tended a little more towards a determination of a civilian, and ten with a modified set of data that tended a little more towards a determination of an enemy. If the difference in results between the \u0027real\u0027 simulation and the others is not statistically different, then the situation can be declared to have been ambiguous enough that it was a human-level judgement call. If the difference shows a statistical anomaly towards holding fire, then you know the robot made the wrong decision and you can now use this data to train the AI with a better set of constraints. Conversely, if the results show a statistical leaning towards firing, then you can prove that it made the same call as a human would have made (IE, even if the system had been a human-in-the-loop system, that civilian would still be dead) in which case you cannot blame the programming any more than you could blame the pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is quite important, because with a human pilot, they can be susceptible to faulty memory, outright lying, or even just the fact that the situation might have been somehow cloudy enough to skew their judgement in the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Omicron314","CreatedById":59506,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T23:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESouth Korea has something along these lines, I think.
