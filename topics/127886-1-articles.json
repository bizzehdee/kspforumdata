Not as many people even know who they are due to the lack of a flag for them. People who prefer to put the flag of the company when it is requested to plant a flag for a company in a contract cannot do this for the LightYear Tire Company. For both of these reasons, I ask/suggest that we have a LightYear Tire Company flag by 1.2, or that someone unofficially makes a placeholder flag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-15T03:56:02Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2015 03:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LaytheDragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T04:24:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree! \u002B1 to this fabulous idea\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
