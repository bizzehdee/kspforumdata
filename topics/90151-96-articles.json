During very shallow reentry with apoapsis at 132 km and periapsis at 90 km, it gets to about 80% it maximum temperature as soon as it touches atmosphere and begins eating away ablator. By the time it is at 113km altitude it explodes. There are no visual re-entry effect by then yet, and other parts in craft do not even have their temperature gauges showing yet. Doesn\u0027t seem right by any standards. Even when I brought up basic airplane cockpit into orbit, it was more sturdy during re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried attaching some radiators to it in case it is internal temperature issue, but no change.
