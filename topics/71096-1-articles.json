This causes users to inadvertently upload the less useful KSP.log file in place of the more detailed output_log.txt (or Player.log) files, delaying diagnosing issues for Squad and mod developers, and delaying providing users with solutions. KSP.log should either not be created by KSP, or it should be made as detailed as the output_log.txt (or Player.log) files to streamline support for the stock game and for modders.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those who don\u0027t know, KSP currently writes to two different log files when it is playing. One is a detailed log file (henceforth output_log.txt) that (I believe) is created by Unity, and it differs for each OS; KSP_Data/output_log.txt for Windows, Player.log for Mac, and I believe something similar for Linux. The other is the less detailed KSP.log, which is universal across all OS\u0027s. The output_log.txt includes the valuable \u003Cstrong\u003Estack trace\u003C/strong\u003E, which (in layman\u0027s terms) is a list of all the functions that were called when the error occurred; this allows the developers to quickly look at the stack trace and see where the error occurs, which gives a starting point for debugging. The KSP.log \u003Cem\u003Edoes not have a stack trace, and is therefore useless as a log for diagnosing severe issues.\u003C/em\u003E This is even acknowledged implicitly in the support guidelines, since they ask for the output_log.txt instead of KSP.log.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we have two logs, one useful, the other useless. But the average user doesn\u0027t know that KSP.log is useless, and that output_log.txt is useful. So if a user makes a bug report (for the stock game or for a mod), there is a chance that they submit a useless log. It\u0027s even more likely that they submit the useless KSP.log since that exists in the KSP root, while the more useful logs are hidden away in subfolders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why does this matter? Well, if a user submits KSP.log instead of output_log.txt, one of two things happen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:lower-alpha;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUser doesn\u0027t follow up, bug cannot be diagnosed, bug report becomes useless, bug doesn\u0027t get fixed. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUser does follow up, becomes annoyed that what they\u0027ve done so far is useless, everyone gets annoyed, especially if the initial report didn\u0027t include a log in the first place. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs things currently stand, this makes getting support a lot more difficult than it should be for users (since they\u0027re inadvertently providing useless files) and makes diagnosing issues more difficult for Squad and modders alike, since they\u0027re getting useless logs. \u003Cem\u003EKSP.log\u0027s existence does not serve to help with support of the stock game or mods and only serves to confuse users already suffering from issues.\u003C/em\u003E Therefore, KSP.log should either be removed or should be made into a copy of output_log.txt that is simply dropped into the KSP root for easy access.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-01T02:52:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2014 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ferram4\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T02:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI endorse this product/service.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T03:57:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is one useful thing the KSP.log does over the output_log.txt -- it timestamps every line of the log.
