I was never comfortable doing it that way with my piloting skills, personally. When you start dealing with TWRs near 1, the margin of error is quite small.

But if I assume \u0022asparagus\u0022 means dropping identical stages consisting of a tank and an engine, then asparagus staging means the ship gradually loses TWR because the payload stays the same and there\u0027s just fewer engines to push it.
