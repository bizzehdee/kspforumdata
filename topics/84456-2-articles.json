I might give another go at a Laythe derivative here soon. I discovered a really neat technique of layering a few atmosphere layers with interesting node setups on top of the initial planet texture. It seems to really set off the water and naturally add a nice specularity to any area facing the sun. Add clouds and shadows from the clouds and I think I might actually have something!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo further have some fun with making a new planet I\u0027m going to give texture painting one from the ground up a go.
