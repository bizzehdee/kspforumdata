I play on windows and I don\u0027t like full screen mode so when I want to open the navball I can\u0027t click on the arrow at the bottom for 2 reasons, the window is kinda messed up when its not full screen, and 2 KSP\u0027s buttons SUCK! they are so odd to press! And I don\u0027t have a numpad, or a numlock key on my laptop so I can\u0027t open the navball! I used to use an on-screen keyboard but 1: that makes my computer run slow 2: its kinda a waste of time 3: I DONT CARE!!! please help me! I looked in the keybinds and I can\u0027t find the navball toggle keybind! I remember seeing it somewhere but I can\u0027t find it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
