If that happens again, as long as you quit before the game autosaves again, your last autosave will load when you restart the game. The game autosaves every time you go to the Space Center, so you\u0027ll need to use Alt\u002BF4/Cmd\u002BQ/Ctrl\u002BQ to quit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you happen to have Kerbal Alarm Clock installed, by default it creates a backup save every time you jump to a ship, so you might be able to find something more recent that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xephirious","CreatedById":77577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T20:25:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI went to one of the backup saves and moved the persistant file from a few hours ago into the saved game folder.
