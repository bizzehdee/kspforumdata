The enclosure is subdivided into panels, which can break off individually or in groups, which means we can have full control over how the fairing will come apart once it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s jettisoned. During construction, you can place a fairing and build it up immediately after placement, or you can use Tweakable actions to edit it later. There are actions to delete, re-build and edit fairings at any time in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up is implementing the actual jettisoning behavior for the panels, and also writing in the enclosure detection, which is already being handled by the cargo bay module. There is quite a bit of work still left to be done, but I dare say what we have is looking pretty good already. .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fairings are very customizable via the part.cfg, so we can determine the number of panels, the amount (if any) of edge smoothing between panels of different angles, as well as a number of other parameters, on a per part basis. And yes, we are planning on a number of different sizes of fairing parts (at least covering 1.25m through 3.5m profiles).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlex (aLeXmOrA):\u003C/strong\u003E Had to download the whole project of the game to my computer again since we did some equipment changes at the office.

Read some really cool stuff on all the social networks. Glad that you like her that much, it was months of team effort to make it right. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re working on a new animation. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been playing with the animatic, the editing and the blocking, to make something that makes sense. We are still not sure what could be changed. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s that moment where everything looks ugly, but needs to make sense in timing and camera work.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJim (Romfarer):\u003C/strong\u003E This week my Engineer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Report branch went into QA testing. As expected they found bugs with many of the tests. They also reported some issues which were rooted deeper in the code base. For example: the preflight-checks had a bug which made it possible to launch uncontrollable vessels and a bug in the staging toolbar where the backup state (the state you load when you hit ctrl z) was not set correctly.

Other than that, absolutely thrilled with the response and love Valentina got from you guys. KSP continues to have the coolest community out there.

And vice-versa as well. There should be (hopefully) minimal coupling between the two systems. The functional bit (the actual enclosing of the volume) is handled by yet another system, so coupling should also be minimal for the functionality of these procedural parts and their procedural-ness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GusTurbo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GusTurbo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EExcited about fairings!

The current system doesn\u0027t support them completely at the moment, but it doesn\u0027t preclude them either. They\u0027re just not accounted for yet, and we\u0027re probably going to have to do some playtesting to figure out how (and if) the fairings would work in between two chunks of spacecraft. We might be able to adapt the current module to do both, or we might require a separate module to handle those cases.
