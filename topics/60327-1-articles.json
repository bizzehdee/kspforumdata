I have send several ships into orbit and I have even sent kerbals to minimus and the mun. However, docking is proving to be much more troubling than I previously expected. Right now I have two ships in orbit around Kerbin I wish to dock. One is around a 300-350k orbit. The other is at 400k orbit. Here is my issue. When I try jumping into a higher orbit, to dock the separation is around 200k. Why? because one ship is significantly behind the other. So, my question. How would I increase my velocity without increasing altitude to drastically to catch up with the other ship? I\u0027m sorry this is a very noob like question but... I guess I launched at the wrong time ect. so.... \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www./convkey/3d77/yld6l86ndewew7rfg.jpg?size_id=8\u0022 alt=\u0022yld6l86ndewew7rfg.jpg?size_id=8\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nobody","CreatedById":64303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T15:58:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this situation time warp and wait.

You cannot increase your speed without increasing your altitude. What you need to do is actually \u003Cem\u003Edecrease\u003C/em\u003E your speed when you\u0027re at your Periapsis to bring yourself into an overall lower orbit than your target. I know that sounds \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally\u003C/strong\u003E counterintuitive, but the lower your orbit, the shorter your orbit is and the faster you go. Increasing your speed at a single point actually means you\u0027re moving around the planet slower than you otherwise would and will lower your speed at the opposite end of your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, since both of these craft are almost a half orbit away from each other, you could really go either way. What you want to do is either slow down, shrink your orbit, so that you can catch the other one up; OR you can accelerate, enlarge your orbit, and let it catch up to you. When you\u0027re still a little ways from catching up, make a manoeuvre node and either pull prograde or retrograde, in order to re-sync your orbits. Move the node around on the orbit path a bit to get the closest approach markers as close as is possible. If it ends up being still extremely far away, time warp until you\u0027re a bit closer to your target and try again. It takes some getting used to, but once you\u0027ve figured it out once, you\u0027ll be able to do it significantly easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Ah, I see I misread. The orbits are already different enough. All you need to do is timewarp till you\u0027re closer, then try making the node again and seeing what the closest approach is.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverchain","CreatedById":83000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T16:05:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t \u0022go faster\u0022 around the same orbit.

Since Ship A is in a lower orbit it is naturally moving faster than Station B. (Due to having a much shorter orbital period) It will eventually catch up to Station B, it\u0027s just going to take a while. I would also advise matching planes while you wait (If you haven\u0027t already) as this will save you some trouble on the back end. What I would do is when they get about 15deg apart plop a maneuver node down and pull it prograde (To raise your orbit) and see where that puts your encounter it you are withing 2km that\u0027s good. 1km is great, and anything less than 1km is absolutely beautiful. Once you get your encounter execute the node. Once you are almost at your new apoapsis switch the Navball to target mode (By clicking the green bar at the top where it gives you your speed) and point your ship at your Relative Retrograde(This is important) then do a burn to cancel out all of your relative velocity (This will circularize your orbit, kinda) then point target prograde (the pink meatball on the navball) then execute a short burn in that direction, no more than about 5m/s, then it\u0027s RCS from here on out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T16:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emake your apoapsis touch your target orbit.now the marker should be at apoapsis too.After several warps,you should see the \u0022target location at closest point\u0022 should be behind the intercept point.Then make your periapsis higher.after you have like 20km between you and your target,switch to target speed,and burn to him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s like racing.I finally got my new tower,I\u0027ll make a video about it.I will.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pauly","CreatedById":99914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T17:01:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI watched many videos on how to meet up and dock and this was by far the most noob friendly for me.

Obviously both ships need the same sized docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. One ship at least should have RCS thrusters and hopefully these will be balanced with the center of gravity so it doesn\u0027t turn while you try and move is sideways.

Wait till the lower orbit/faster ship is a bit behind the higher ship about 20-5 degrees or about 2 hours to half and hour if looking at it as a clock. Then make a maneuver node for the lower/faster ship so that the purple or orange markers line up. You will see that one purple is target at interception and the other is closest interception. You want these to be the same, and colour must be matched with colour. Anything within about 5k is OK but closer is better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Make the first burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.

Make the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. You should now be floating near the other craft and not moving very fast relative to it. It should be selected and be green in the real world (Kerbin real world) view. Your speed indicator should now show target speed but this doesn\u0027t show if you are moving towards it or away.

You want to approach slowly 10m/s or less at 1k separation, about 1m/s at 200m, 0.5m/s at 100, 0.2-0.1 at 50 meters. You will want to turn on RCS and docking control.
