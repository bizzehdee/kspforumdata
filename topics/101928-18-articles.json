As Apollo13 has previously stated, carrying objects on the backs of Kerbals is a very fun and realistic feature!\n\nWell, grabbing part one by one on kerbal back (like KAS) is maybe realistic, but, from a gameplay point of view it\u0027s really to complicated to use and not smooth at all.\n\nThe goal of KIS is to simplify part manipulation by using an inventory with drag \u0026 drop capabilities. It\u0027s really far more simple to use and I don\u0027t think it break fun or immersion, inventories is pretty common in a lot of game. \n\nAnyway, carrying object on the backs of Kerbals is always possible if needed, you just need to configure it for the part you want (using the equip/unequip feature).\n\nIn KIS 1.1, you will also be able to carry small container on back by default (carried container don\u0027t take volume in the inventory and are shown on back of the kerbal), you can configure this feature for other parts if needed.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Does this mean KIS 1.1.0 will have ground attach?
