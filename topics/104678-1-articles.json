There is program that you hook to the Skyrim .exe It detects your saves and creates profiles for each character and it\u0027s saves. When you boot up the program, you choose a character, and forces the game to load only saves that has to do with that specific character. \n\nLike-wise as we all know. Elder Scrolls games also lets you activate and de-active mods with a push of a button. \n\nSo why have this? \n\nYou could have multiple career games with different setup of mods. One game could be focused more on cosmetics, and EVE, making the world beautiful with minimal other mods. Another could be focused ehavily on parts, or difficulty by using TAC and Remote Tech, etc. (Stuff like this would seem to be helpful to youtubers as well). \n\nBasically the idea is to combine the two into 1. \n\nA program that hooks into the KSP .exe that you start up first. (Similar to the already created CKan for mod management). In it you can select and deselect mods, and only the mods you selected are loaded by KSP. The others ignored. \n\nHaving the option to \u0022save\u0022 profiles, or mod loadouts as well for quick switching. \n\nPossible?"},{"CreatedByName":"Shurikeeen","CreatedById":114554,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T15:49:30Z","Content":"I have seen a mod for this but I cannot remember the name of it.
