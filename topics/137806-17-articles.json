any built-in IndicatorLights support for ModuleWheelMotor (or any of the other wheel modules).\u00A0 Until this syntax came around, it would have been impossible for you to add an indicator to a wheel that would show the wheel\u0027s state.\u00A0 Now you can.\u00A0 Also, it works with other mods, too-- so if another mod implements some custom PartModule, it\u0027s possible to add IndicatorLights

built-in animation of the part, so it just stays put.\u00A0 This is kind of unfortunate, but there it is.\u00A0 For example, look at what I did when I added the meshes to the stock Communotron-16 and

their mods IL-compatible, I\u0027m happy to chat with whoever\u0027s interested about what the technical requirements to do so would be.\u00A0 It\u0027s pretty

However because (unlike in blender) Unity can have multiple instance of the same component names, whilst they are separate objects they have similar mesh names. This is the Patch that\u0027s drives the effect seen above:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003E@PART[miniDock]:NEEDS[IndicatorLights] \n{ \n     \tMODULE \n \t{ \n \t\tname = ModuleControllableEmissive \n \t\ttarget = ledLower \n \t\temissiveName = dockingLEDs\t \n\t} \n\tMODULE \n \t{ \n \t\tname = ModuleEmissiveArrayController \n \t\temissiveName = dockingLEDs \n \t\ttoggleID = ModuleToggleLED\t \n \t\tactiveColor = blink(#08E8DE, 200, $Off, 800, divide(index, 5)) \n \t\tinactiveColor = $Off \n \t} \n \tMODULE \n \t{ \n \t\tname = ModuleControllableEmissive \n \t\ttarget = ledLowerB \n \t\temissiveName = dockingLEDs2\t \n \t} \n \tMODULE \n \t{ \n \t\tname = ModuleEmissiveArrayController \n \t\temissiveName = dockingLEDs2 \n \t\ttoggleID = ModuleToggleLED\t \n \t\tactiveColor = blink(#08E8DE, 200, $Off, 800, subtract(0.8, divide(index, 5))) \n \t\tinactiveColor = $Off \n \t} \n \tMODULE \n \t{ \n \t\tname = ModuleToggleLED \n \t\tstatus = false \n \t}\t \n} \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the above the arms on one side have a small emissive lug called \u0022dockingLEDs\u0022 and on the other side they are called \u0022dockingLEDs2\u0022. Now we couldn\u0027t have them all called \u0022dockingLEDS\u0022 because the array controller fires each sequentially and the effect would leap frog from side to side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterestingly enough, and only found through trial and error,\u00A0if the code was the same for both sides they do not run together. Instead one side ran a slight delay (one LED in fact) behind the other so when one running sequence was at the end, the other was at the start.\u00A0Also worth noting is that\u00A0when using the ModuleEmissiveArrayController, IndicatorLights will determine the direction in relation to the origin of the part, which means that\u00A0the array for one side needed to be told to be negative and run in the other direction, to appear as though its mirroring its counterpart array on the opposite side. The 0.8 is used to offset the start of the sequence for one side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if you are still with me at this point good going, I will try to\u00A0expand on the answer to\u00A03);\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou can see from the\u00A0code that we are targeting the meshes named\u00A0\u0022dockingLEDS\u0022 and\u00A0\u0022dockingLEDS2\u0022. they both use ModuleToggleLED so despite being two separate controllable emissives\u00A0the toggle in the part controls them as one.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the ModuleEmissiveArrayController we actually define the colour we want to change on the targeted mesh. This is to say that for that mesh, we are changing the value of _EmissiveColor of the shader in that mesh\u0027s material. It is for this reason that each mesh must have its own material (if they are all on the dame .mu) because if all of the emissive shared a material then when one mesh was toggled, all the meshes that shard that material would change colour too. So for the running lights in the above config, if all the \u0022dockingLEDs\u0022 used the same material, despite being separate objects in unity, when the LED was toggle on then all the lugs would appear to be constantly on, their would be no sequence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo put this into terms you could use for the custom runway. If it were me and I was building this in Unity, I would added the \u0027LED\u0027s I wanted to use for my running lights over the original model. I would have all the objects on one side with the same name, than all the objects on the other side with a similar name. Each of the \u0027LED\u0027s gets its own material, a duplicate of the material is fine but it must have its own name (for instance runwayEmisMat1, runwayEmisMat2, etc.).\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you were trying to implement this through a patch alone, you could use the BL-001 model (.mu) to give you your \u0027LED\u0027s, then you wouldn\u0027t need to worry about Unity at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bit Fiddler","CreatedById":103108,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-12T14:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nok so the emissive is a material defined in the .obj (

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ematerial\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eemissive mask\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 And the \u0022mask\u0022 is, in fact, a texture.\u00A0 Technobabble about this in spoiler section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nEach mesh on a model is made out of a \u0022material\u0022.\u00A0 A material is a simple object with a set of properties, such as \u0022which shader does it use\u0022 and what are the properties of that shader.\u00A0 Note that a material has no texture per se; it\u0027s a homogeneous \u0022stuff\u0022.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor an object to have any emissive \u0022glow\u0022 at all, it has to have a material that supports emissivity.\u00A0 The \u0022emissive color\u0022 on that material specifies how brightly it glows, and in what color.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHowever, that alone doesn\u0027t control the appearance on-screen.\u00A0 There\u0027s also an \u0022emissive mask\u0022, which is a grayscale texture that \u0022masks\u0022 the emissive color.\u00A0 Think of it as \u0022paint\u0022 of varying opacity that\u0027s covering up the glowing \u0022stuff\u0022 that the object is made out of.\u00A0 Where the mask is white, the underlying emissive color shines through 100%.\u00A0 Where the mask is black, none of the emissive color shines through at all.\u00A0 For gray values in between, the glow shines through partially.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExample of this in use:\u00A0 Engines glow when they get hot.\u00A0 But they don\u0027t all shine a uniform \u0022flat\u0022 color, right?\u00A0 Parts of the engine bell glow more brightly than others.\u00A0 They achieve this visual effect by having an emissive-mask color.\u00A0 When the engine gets hot, the game cranks up the emissive color on the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ematerial\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, but it\u0027s brighter or darker on various pieces of the engine because of the emissive mask.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnother example is where certain crewed parts, such as the Hitchhiker container, have light-up spots that turn on (e.g. around the crew hatch) when you activate the cabin lights.\u00A0 They don\u0027t have to model that as a bunch of separate glowy meshes-- they can just make the whole part glow, except that most of it is masked out and you can\u0027t see any glow except in those spots where the emissive mask lets the glow peek through.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIndicatorLights works purely by controlling the emissive color on the underlying material.\u00A0 It doesn\u0027t do any animated changes to the emissive mask at all.\u00A0 If the part happens to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehave\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E an emissive mask, then IL will \u0022work\u0022 with it, in the sense that the game will use the mask to affect how the emissive color (which IL is controlling) ends up shining through.\u00A0 But IL itself is completely unaware of the emissive mask; it doesn\u0027t do anything with it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTherefore, any animation that you do with IL (such as lights blinking in sequence) is all done by having different meshes so that IL can animate their emissive colors.\u00A0 That\u0027s not a limitation of the game, it\u0027s just how I happened to implement IndicatorLights.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI don\u0027t actually use emissive masks in any of my own modeling work.\u00A0 All of the meshes I\u0027ve added to the stock parts (and on the BL-01 light) have very simple one-pixel emissive masks that are pure white.\u00A0 Essentially, I\u0027m just letting the naked material shine through; I don\u0027t get fancy with masks.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing (though I\u0027ve never done this) that if you can animate a texture in Unity, you could therefore animate an emissive mask, and use that to create the visual effect of moving lights.\u00A0 Even if that\u0027s possible, though, it has nothing to do with IndicatorLights, and you wouldn\u0027t have any particular reason to use IndicatorLights in that case.\u00A0 (Unless you wanted to use IL as a sort of \u0022master switch\u0022 for turning the lights on and off, or tying their control to something in-game.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steedcrugeon","CreatedById":168050,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-14T06:36:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote
