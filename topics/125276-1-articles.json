My understanding was that you deployed an M700 scanner to a planet, analyzed and transmitted via antenna, then could forever view that data from the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a satellite to do such, flew it to Mun, analyzed it and received the green text reporting it was received and saying Science was added, woo\u0027d at the pretty pink, then dropped it on the surface for giggles. Deployed another to Minmus, analyzed, then decided to check my data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can only access the scan data via the scanner itself: the tracking station says I need to perform an orbital scan but flying the satellite will allow me to turn on and adjust the overlay.
