I then had the idea of opening two Cleverbot\u0027s in separate tabs, and then copy pasting one Cleverbot\u0027s text into the other, and vice versa creating a conversation between two AI\u0027s. It was even more amusing than speaking to the AI myself, watching the conversation sway from one wild topic to another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I had the idea of creating this thread where, using any AI system (eg, Cleverbot, Siri, IGod) you can copy and paste or simply type the previous thread reply into the AI and post its response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen posing a response you should quote the previous reply, and put the AI\u0027s name before it\u0027s own response. You could even nickname your specific AI if you want. - [Name of AI system, Nickname]: \u0022text\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(eg; [Cleverbot; GLaDOS]: \u0022insert reply here\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea how the conversation will flow. It could be a complete disaster, but you never know. Maybe we will see a difference in personality/perspective between the different AI\u0027s or more interesting effects. Its like an experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EWARNING:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, anyone who has used Cleverbot or IGod will know that sometimes, they can be a little ...inappropriate, so show some common sense. If you wouldn\u0027t say it yourself then DON\u0027T POST IT. If you stick to that rule, things won\u0027t get messy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods, If conversation gets too inappropriate, or if you don\u0027t thinks its even a good idea in the first place, then of course you should take down the thread. However, I hope this doesn\u0027t have to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, I\u0027ll start:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E[Me, (to get the conversation started); GLaDOS]: \u0022Oh... its you\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u002B If you want to comment on the conversation, then put the comment in brackets so that we can distinguish between human/AI, (if it isn\u0027t already obvious \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ninjakids","CreatedById":70896,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T00:22:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E[Cleverbot; SCP-079] What is your name?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
