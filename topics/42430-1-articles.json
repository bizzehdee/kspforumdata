I had a set of solar panels attached in 4-way symmetry and only one of them actually responded to the action group. I know it worked before, so perhaps it really is a bug. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, this particular issue with the solar panels went like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I attached my solar panels but forgot to turn on 4-way symmetry, so I only attached the one, and didn\u0027t notice my mistake. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I immediately set up the action group to toggle the panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Flew my thing into orbit, and THEN realized my blunder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Later I reloaded the craft in the VAB and clicked on the panel with 4-way symmetry on, and everything was cool. I didn\u0027t check the Action Group, as it was already set up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.
