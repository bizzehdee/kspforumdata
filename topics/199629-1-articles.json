However, I noticed that anything short of 100% braking strength (including 95%) is not sufficient: the plane is stable upon landing but continues to ride along the runway until it just runs out of braking distance. If I suddenly set braking strength to 100% though, the rear wheels lock up instantly and if my speed is roughly south of 80 m/s without any sideslip, all is fine even though the plane and its occupants are a little bit shaken. Otherwise, I end up tumbling and exploding depending on how much the rear landing wheels are separated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a known bug in KSP or is this expected behavior? Is there a way to modify the config files to mitigate this problem? Also I have to let you know that I\u0027m playing a modded game but the only mod that would potentially act on braking strength is tweakScale since the landing gears have been resized.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t write this thread in the modding section of the forum though because I assume mods are irrelevant: This also happened on an non-modded aircraft, using only stock parts and resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPotentially important info:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- I use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E and Kerbal Joint Reinforcement\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Friction control is set to 5.0 for the rear wheels and 0.2 for the front landing gear.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- braking strength is set to 95% for the rear wheels and 15% for the front wheels (using 55% for the front wheels for instance doesn\u0027t seem to improve braking performance).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- I use a plethora of mods but I don\u0027t think they influence braking behavior since I also had the same issue with unscaled landing gear installed on a lighter and fully-stock spaceplane.
