You have to come in perfectly for all the ports to dock together otherwise only a couple might. I guess the trick for it is to take it slow and steady and really make sure you\u0027re lined up as you come in. Also, rather than using girders, you could use the tri or quad adapters and put ports on those, then you wouldn\u0027t have to worry about the girders flexing and causing the ports to move slightly out of alignment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"espm400","CreatedById":71109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T18:11:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to try \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/lazor-docking-cam/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERomfarer\u0027s Lazor Docking Cam\u003C/a\u003E.

It was a really stable design that I used exclusively until they came out with the senior ports (which to be honest, I never really got a chance to try out under thrust in 0.20). That port required Subassembly. With the advent of 0.21, you might be able to try to construct similar with one of the quad adapters. I obviously haven\u0027t tried this out myself yet...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick with the quad-port, as MidwestB indicated, is getting things aligned. That\u0027ll be a problem no matter how you go about doing a multi-port docking, but I find that if the target ports are closer in to one another things are easier in general. Being aligned first is important. It helps to have one craft pointed north and the other south when you\u0027re docking; then you only have to roll to get things lined up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
