Because it sounds like a perpetual motion machine to me, they need practical numbers of the efficiency of that method of generation in order to figure out how long it will take to refuel for a given solar panel area for instance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the only method of generating antimatter that I know of relies on using a particle accelerator to blast a heavy metal target with electrons, in the process kicking up clumps of positrons that can be identified by their flipped spiral in the magnetic fields of the accelerator chamber. That method requires gigawatts of energy for perhaps a few individual particles yield, nowhere near the amount of energy said antimatter will give back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough this approach does have the advantage of possibly creating fuel while in space without having to cart about raw materials, which is a big plus that was also seen in the Bussard Ramjet concepts of a decade ago. \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
