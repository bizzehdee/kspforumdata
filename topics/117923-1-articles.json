That is the primary reason I do not want a popup for this, because there are many cases where you want that, and a constant pop up would be annoying (generally speaking in software development pop-ups are evil 90% of the time). For example, a Clamp-o-tron on a Mk 1-2 capsule with a Launch Escape System on top of it will throw a warning in the report but is a perfectly valid construction.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![0422960205C3CB67A8C019E8482D619D0A739A46](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/449584776021511792/0422960205C3CB67A8C019E8482D619D0A739A46/)\n\n\u003E ![55FA8BC68AEA1BC26F348FFF1D77CB49B7339D69](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/449584776021512120/55FA8BC68AEA1BC26F348FFF1D77CB49B7339D69/)\n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T17:21:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"}]}
