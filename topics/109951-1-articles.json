My Kerbol system is over 4 times the diameter of the stock system. I have PLENTY of destinations where solar power is absolutely worthless. I\u0027d like the Jool system to not be one of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it stands right now, you have to use a plugin to change the stock power curve. I don\u0027t disagree with it being inverse square law by default; I think that adds some much needed realism to power management (though the RTG does need to come down the tech tree a ways). The caveat, however, is that for people like me using something much larger than the stock system it gets unnecessarily hard. Getting out there is enough of a pain, taking almost a decade for some transfers. I\u0027d like my power management to be a bit easier, able to maybe get a shred of use out of solar panels out by Sarnus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is the ability to scale the power curve in the difficulty menu on savegame creation, or in debug at the bare minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
