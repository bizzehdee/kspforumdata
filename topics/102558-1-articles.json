I\u0027m still working out all of the kinks. Any feedback is extremely helpful and welcome. Enjoy!\n\n**Hotkeys:**\n\n- **L** - Toggle day/night mode and all part lights\n- **U** - Toggle all part lights\n\n**Preview:**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

As it is, we are left only dreaming... that is until someone goes out and makes a \u0022model replacer\u0022 mod in the style of Texture Replacer. Oh well.

I\u0027d use another button, but that feels wasteful, so maybe I\u0027ll make the current button have a popup? I\u0027m open to any ideas."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T16:06:23Z","Content":"hmm, I find it rather intuitive considering it\u0027s really a secondary function for this mod. The real important thing is the day/night toggle. I don\u0027t know enough about the stock or non-stock toolbar API to know if there\u0027s a way to put something into a tool-tip such as \u0022left toggles world time / right toggles lights\u0022 when hovering the button.\n\nAt the very least, I\u0027d think a readme entry (and a note on the OP) explaining it would be enough for most users. It\u0027d certainly be more intuitive that a number of other more complicated mods and their various right/left clicking methods for activating different things.\n\nThe complicated part would be whether or not you want the icon to reflect the various states and the process of tracking those states. Currently there\u0027s only two modes for the icon, activated \u0026 deactivated, for the toggle between night and day respectively. I would think adding another little icon to that image to track the light toggle state would work, however you\u0027d then need to track, and create the respective icon image for, an extra two states for a total of 4 icons: night mode with lights off, night mode with lights on, day mode with lights off, day mode with lights on.\n\nI probably shouldn\u0027t be thinking so hard right now considering I have a math exam (statistics sucks) later today, but I\u0027m almost interested enough in how this might work to tackle it myself later on. At the very least, I might have a look at the code as it is now and get back to you if I come up with anything. I know things like this have been done before using the toolbar addon, but I\u0027m unsure if Squad did anything similar with their own toolbar."},{"CreatedByName":"nodrog6","CreatedById":93747,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T18:33:10Z","Content":"I updated LightsOut for KSP 1.0 compatibility.
