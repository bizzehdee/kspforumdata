Specifically, the code hasn\u0027t yet been finished for procedural costs (at least, as of when I checked the thread a few days ago). I am considering eventually adding that mod in once it has been updated for 0.24.2, but the update is likely to be \u003Cstrong\u003Emajor\u003C/strong\u003E and save-breaking (or at least breaking of previous craft designs), as adding procedural costs to parts isn\u0027t nearly as simple as it sounds...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also assume when you talk about fuel leakage you are talking about \u0022boil-off\u0022 of cryogenic fuels (Liquid Hydrogen/LH2, at a *very fast* rate, and Liquid Oxygen/LOX at a *much slower* rate). This is actually a problem faced by space programs in real-life, and there is a much cheaper and easier solution to it than use of cryogenic storage tanks (which are included in Procedural Parts mod when using Realfuels- but cost Ec/s to keep cold): it\u0027s called hypergolics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHypergolic fuels are those that combust instantaneously upon combination. RealFuels includes a number of these in its fuel mixture (almost any of the fuel mixtures in the mod beyond LOX/LH2 and LOX/Kerosene), each with substantially different benefits and drawbacks (such as higher/lower density or ISP). However as a class of fuels, hypergolics tend to be \u003Cstrong\u003Emuch\u003C/strong\u003E denser that LOX/LH2 (meaning you can hold more Delta-V in each tank, as each tank holds a much greater mass of fuel), saving on craft size and the fiscal cost for tanks; and ALL of them can be stored without boil-off or the need for cryogenic storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary disadvantage of hypergolics is their lower Specific Impulse (like LOX/Kerosene, in the 300\u0027s range, although slightly lower than LOX/Kerosene. LOX/LH2 can reach into the low-to-mid 400\u0027s with the right engines). However, engines burning them tend to be capable of higher thrust than those burning LOX/LH2 (due to the greater mass-flow rate through the engine at a given pressure), reducing the need for engine-mass; and as already stated, there is no need for extra electrical systems to power cryogenic tanks: which can become quite power-hungry, like in real-life... (to the point that several NASA Mars Design Reference Mission variants proposed using a NUCLEAR REACTOR to power cryogenic fuel storage tanks- though admittedly this reactor was already to be onboard for nuclear-propulsion reasons... The reactors were for a type of nuclear propulsion known as BNTR- a superior-performing successor to NERVA, a working prototype of which was co-developed by the USA and Russia, and little-discussed until recently due to political reasons...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were currently ready to start building next-generation reusable infrastructure (due to \u0022tech level\u0022 advancements in the RealFuels engines, any reusable spacecraft launched NOW would quickly become obsolete when I advanced beyond tech-level 2/3, which approximately represents late-1950\u0027s/early-1960\u0027s technology...), then building orbital cryogenic fuel depots would quickly become a priority for me, due to the lower mass of fuel I would need to launch to fuel up the reusables for each mission. However, when using disposable spacecraft, LH2/LOX \u003Cstrong\u003E*simply doesn\u0027t make financial-sense*\u003C/strong\u003E, as it means I have to launch a much greater mass (and cost) of fuel tanks, which only get used once and then get thrown away, compared to using LOX/Kerosene or Hypergolics, which only costs me around two-thirds as much on fuel tanks (after considering the need for more fuel mass due to lower ISP) due to the 2.5-3 times higher fuel-density...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u003Cstrong\u003EI only wish NASA and the United Launch Alliance would realize this in real life, like Space-X has already caught onto.\u003C/strong\u003E Fuel costs are only 1-2% of real-life launch costs, which is probably why fuel is currently \u0022free\u0022 in RealFuels- since even the minimum resource-cost allowed by KSP would quickly exceed real-life costs by almost an order of magnitude. LOX/LH2 makes no sense in real-life, like in KSP with RealFuels, because you end up launching more than twice as many expensive tanks just to save a little cheap fuel. It\u0027s like building a $2 million car just to save a few gallons of gasoline every year over a comparable $200,000 car... \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOn second-thought, ULA probably already *has* realized this\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, which is precisely \u003Cstrong\u003EWHY\u003C/strong\u003E they *choose* to push LH2/LOX on NASA- as United Launch Alliance is nothing but a bunch of money-grubbing dirtbags with no real interest in advancing the state of rocket science like Space-X or Boeing are both trying to do, albeit by very different philosophies...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, you mentioned \u0022Real Engine\u0022 before. \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI can only assume by this you meant the \u0022Real Engines\u0022 config for RealFuels mod.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI choose not to use that mod for three (all very good) reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) The \u0022Stockalike\u0022 config for RealFuels mod I choose to go with instead is easier to adapt to for a player who has never played with RealFuels before, and retains more of the \u0022stock flavor\u0022 (in fact, I was surprised to hear you recommending the \u0022Real Engine\u0022 mod to me instead Sirine- wasn\u0027t it you who was refusing to use anything but stock parts back in the early days of the Flying Duna challenge by Geschosskopf?) It also still maintains realistic TWR ratios and ISP values: by increasing or (more often) decreasing the mass of stock engine parts to bring them more in line with real-world rocket Thrust-Weight Rations (the rocket engines in Stock KSP are \u003Cstrong\u003E*much*\u003C/strong\u003E heavier for the thrust they produce than their real-life counterparts...), and adjusting Specific Impulse as necessary to match comparable real-world rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) The \u0022Stockalike\u0022 config for RealFuels is compatible with a wider variety of mods. More precisely, it has been expanded to revise the engines for a much wider variety of mods than the \u0022Real Engine\u0022 config.

Both Kerosene and LOX can realistically be produced by ISRU anywhere there are readily-accessible sources of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen (on Mars in real life, for instance), so I would have no objections to setting up a base on Duna to produce these resources... I might also make use of LH2/LOX on/around the Mun, since on Earth\u0027s moon, it is probably much more practical to make LH2 from water-ice than it is to combine it with recently-discovered graphite to make Kerosene; as the latter would require harvesting and refinement of two separate solid-state resources not necessarily always found in the same place...

I placed the radial chute as close to the Center of Mass as possible, and attempted to land horizontally- but that didn\u0027t *quite* work out as expected, and I ended up losing the LV-T45 engine on touchdown...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the cost of the lost rocket engine, the total cost of the plane mission came out to around 2000 Funds- so I definitely could have done it cheaper with a rocket (a BACC booster plus a decoupler lifting a LV-T45 engine, a probe core and a radial parachute probably would have worked, and would have been cheaper...) But I gained some valuable experience building planes with FAR, which was probably worth the cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also gained insight into the utility of Orok- the ISP of the LV-T45 engine I used for my plane was 18 points higher on the runway (280s) than at sea level (262s at this tech level) just from the 2500 meters or so of elevation... The higher terminal velocity at the launchpad (meaning you can utilize rockets with higher TWR throughout their ascent, and save on gravity losses without as high aerodynamic stresses or as much energy lost to drag) and reduced distance you have to climb to exit the atmosphere is also nice... So it\u0027s definitely worth utilizing over the KSC for most of my suborbital trajectories, where it really doesn\u0027t matter if I enter into an inclined orbit... (the only real downsides to the site are that it\u0027s not near the equator- where the rotational velocity of Kerbin is highest and you can easily launch to an orbit of ANY inclination- or water, which aids in recovery of spent stages by somewhat cushioning landings...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-01T05:47:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2014 05:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T18:19:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENoting much to see here, just a suborbital Materials Study launch to pick up some !SCIENCE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/UeQAm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
