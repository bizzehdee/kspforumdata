going.\u00A0 There\u0027s a world of difference between efficient and inefficient piloting.\u00A0 If you\u0027re new to KSP, it\u0027s possible that you\u0027re piloting your ships to space really inefficiently (without knowing it)-- if that\u0027s the case, it may be that revising your piloting would allow you to go a lot farther with the rockets you\u0027re already building, which in turn would put more stuff within reach for gathering science.\u00A0 Here\u0027s a simple question you can answer that will help us gauge whether you\u0027re on the right track here, or not:\u00A0 When you\u0027re launching a ship to orbit, \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhat\u0027s your speed and your angle from the vertical when you\u0027re at 10 km\u003C/strong\u003E?\u00A0 It ought to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 300-400 m/s, and at about 45 degrees.\u00A0 If it\u0027s much steeper or shallower than 45 degrees when you\u0027re at 10 km, that\u0027s a warning sign that your piloting may need some tweaking, in which case we can talk more about that.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

You\u0027ll probably need an additional flight somewhere in there now before you can unlock the mentioned tech nodes. Additionally, the science income was augmented through contracts, which are not available in Science mode, so you need to make up for that with additional manual science collection as well.

I\u0027ve never tried.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, the basic advice remains the same: be aware of the concept of \u0022situations\u0022, and make sure you\u0027ve done each experiment in all situations that are currently available to you.
