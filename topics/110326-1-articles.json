The surface tension created by the water molecules mean that it behaves far more like a solid in high speed impact, than as a liquid. It is only \u0022soft\u0022 at very slow speed. A 50m fall onto salt water results in catastrophic damage to the human body, breaking pretty much every bone, in some cases causing near decapitation (in the real example I\u0027m thinking of, complete separation of the skull from the spine is quite common).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying that the current ocean physics are good or perfect, just that it\u0027s highly realistic that a high speed impact with water is catastrophically destructive.

Water is much softer in that situation, or to be more accurate the surface tension causes it to act like a lubricated solid surface with a little give, and you hydroplane over the surface until the speed drops low enough to fully penetrate the surface. I\u0027ve personally landed on water with about 15\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015320m/s horizontal speed and negligible vertical, after parting company with a boat at speed, without much protection, and it was very wet but not otherwise unpleasant, but I did skip over the surface for quite a distance before going under. In those types of cases, the surface tension actually helps you, as it delays the point where you decelerate rapidly due to breaking the surface and having to push the water aside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVertical speed is the main problem for landing on water. Horizontal speed has the problem of abrasiveness, and can be catastrophic if you get something like a wing digging in and causing the craft to cartwheel, but it is quite survivable if those problems don\u0027t lead to consequences. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d call it \u0022relative safety\u0022, as there\u0027s really a fairly big element of luck involved (and pilot skill), but it\u0027s certainly not guaranteed death and destruction. In many cases, ditching has been catastrophic, as there\u0027s very little error margin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
