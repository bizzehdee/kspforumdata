With PhysX3 we are able to support non-negative scaling without any baking. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s basically free.\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I think this may at least be due to how animation is imported into Unity (\u0022Legacy\u0022 mode), though I\u0027m unsure if this is a Unity or a KSP/.mu requirement (but I generally assume the latter as the other import methods appear to work in Unity as far as I can tell).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I also think it\u0027s worth noting that I would have liked to use true \u0022Box\u0022 colliders from within Unity, but matching the opening of the iris is harder to do there compared to just doing an animated mesh in blender. Yes, it\u0027s probably less efficient than doing box colliders, but I have even less success at scripting things in Unity compared to blender, and it\u0027s as simple as adding two key-frames in blender and it matches the blades of the door very closely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe same does not work for\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qdJdzU2wbd8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E nor\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/CjQYcdcG_o0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E; which is what I think you are attempting to do from the OP.\u003Cp\u003Enevertheless, based on how your solar panel part appears to work, separate objects with box colliders is the best way to go performance and setup complexity wise. if your solar panel works like the shutter, then rotating and/or scaling colliders would certainly work better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, I\u0027m trying to get the bounding box to scale.
