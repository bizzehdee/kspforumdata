Could have been debris from the 2004 explosion that touched off the second, wouldn\u0027t it be strange if the 2004 caused a chain reaction that in 20 years takes all the sats out in the weather satellite belt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt","CreatedById":131025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T02:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESounds like an anti-satelite weapon.

From what I can tell about the sat, no one else would care to blow it up. Plus there is a lot that could cause a temperature spike. Perhaps a battery exploded, perhaps it was hit by something, perhaps something else happened. We may never know.
