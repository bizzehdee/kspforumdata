This is only for landing, however. Initial takeoff is done with a sort of maglev track which accelerates the craft to 300 m/s. Now, this is way faster than necessary speed for a ramjet or a scramjet. So very little moving parts in initial ascent engines. Make them like the Sabre engines, only ram/scram jets. This would mean those same engines could eventually be used as the upper stage, probably either RP-1 or Methane as fuel. Primarily because they are awesome.

While scram jet is a type of a ram jet, it\u0027s designed for much higher intake speeds. I don\u0027t think there is a specific cutoff for these either, but in practice, you need to be well into supersonic before you can start using a scramjet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn principle, the only part that has to be different is the combustion chamber. Scramjet and ramjet can share an intake. So you might be able to build a scram/ram jet at expense of just a few moving parts to switch from one mode to the other. I don\u0027t know if you could get both maximally efficient, but since ram jet only needs you to get to scram speeds, if you can make operation at the hypersonic speeds as efficient, it\u0027s probably good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I still think this idea has promise for a small, reusable shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERATO \u002B Rocket engine = no longer single stage to orbit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo? It\u0027s a technicality. Reason we want an SSTO is to cut launch costs by reusing the craft as much as possible. Yes, R/JATO boosters would technically be a stage. But in terms of practical use, they are just consumables. We aren\u0027t talking about Shuttle SRBs, here. We are talking about small boosters attached to pylons which just get the ship off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith what you are going to save on weight with (sc)ram jets, you are still going to end up way ahead even if your R/JATO are single use. In fact, you might even still be ahead compared to using a true SSTO with SABRE-like engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. While I still think maglev to 300m/s would be too expensive to be worth it, I\u0027d definitely look into pneumatic catapults, similar to these used on aircraft carriers. Nothing new to invent, hardware exists, and it can get you to a pretty good fraction of that starting speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-19T23:09:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2013 11:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaveofDefeat","CreatedById":58539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T23:09:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow much testing has been done on ram/scram jets?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T23:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA lot.
