Nothing is more aggravating then being stuck forced to spec someone (or need to rejoin server), especially when it happens after you crash and you get switched to spectate somoene else with no ability to do anything whatsoever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like the ability to autopilot a craft (say set it in a heading and have it just keep flying), as id lieki to test some mid-air combat, ive seen peopel do it in vids, but i seem unable to actually achieve this yet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, itd be nice if DMP added the ability to isnatntly go to space center regardless of what is happening, but until then, such a mod would be plenty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
