Back in 0.24 I made a really cool base, with a lot of \u0022docking ports\u0022 for rovers etc to refuel their supplies. - And also docking ports to extend the base further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever then I launched the system, and suddenly when I finally got the massive thing (It contained also 2 massive kerobdyne tanks as reserve fuel for rovers on the mun, which was half the mass of the base). And then the second mission that brought the rovers I noticed something terrible: gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gravitational forces on the mun were different, making suspension act differently, and the lightweight vehicle didn\u0027t align with the base anymore. Now I could \u0027fix\u0027 it slightly by removing the suspension. But that still was very hard to align.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis made me realize that to connect land-bases you really need to have more tools. - Something that gives the exact center of the docking port in height above ground is the minimum. And ideal would be a special docking port that \u0022is lax on position\u0022, so you could say connect your small rover\u0027s 1.25m dock to \u003Cstrong\u003Eany\u003C/strong\u003E position on the 3m docking port of the base. (and the game would leave it at that spot, not forcing a perfect alignment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a mod to do this? Or is it nowadays a non issue? I\u0027m asking this here since I don\u0027t wish to discover it again after I build my bases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MunarKows","CreatedById":152943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T04:05:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout stock modular base building: Back in September 2013, forum user Temstar posted a thread called \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48876\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe art of modular base building\u003C/a\u003E, about how to move modules around and align docking ports on different modules.

The pipe merges the vessels, just like when docking, allowing transfer of resources between them using the right-click menu. However, some people think that this is too cheaty and/or not as fun as the stock docking system, because it allows you to just place some landers together, connect them all with pipes, and call it a base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut using features from KAS and it\u0027s sister mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Inventory System\u003C/a\u003E, you can also bring parts with you stored in containers and assemble them in the field to make a base (or whatever you want to build), as if you were building on the VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T06:14:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKIS works well for connecting modules. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127413\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127413\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanetary bases has some support for this, the ultimate solution is the KAS corridor, this require KAS but let you draw an pipe between modules who are wide enough for an kerbal to walk. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever that I think you are after is adjustable landing legs or better wheels where you can set adjust the height\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul23","CreatedById":120544,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T14:52:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already USI for \u0022bases\u0022, so kis looks kind of \u0022too much\u0022.
