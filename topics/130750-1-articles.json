what would it see?\u00A0 As it leaves your bow, it\u0027s pointed almost perfectly at the target (you\u0027re a good shot, any error is invisibly tiny), so the target appears to be perfectly centered in the camera\u0027s view.\u00A0 But as the arrow gets closer and closer to the target, any errors become more and more apparent, and pretty soon the bull\u0027s eye is sliding off to the side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the \u0022wandering\u0022 of the blue maneuver marker.\u00A0 Think of it as the bull\u0027s eye, and your burn is the shooting of the arrow.\u00A0 If you don\u0027t make some sort of adjustment, you\u0027re just about guaranteed to miss the target by some amount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you make corrections as it goes, to keep the maneuver centered:\u00A0 that\u0027s the equivalent of having a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eguided\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E arrow that is tracking the bull\u0027s eye and making minor steering corrections to keep it on course.\u00A0 That\u0027s the thing to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yasmy","CreatedById":79995,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T18:43:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222380120\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130750\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453818192\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154477\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JoeSchmuckatelli\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, JoeSchmuckatelli said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo\u00A0- the reason behind the question - I\u0027ve seen some guys manually\u00A0\u0027feather in\u0027 their burns - firing aimed at the Radial Out for a while, then rolling to Retro for a squirt or two, then Normal and back to Radial Out to get the alignment they want, all the while zoomed in on the planetary system to see the effects of their burns.\u00A0 Seems fiddly - but it obviously works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis method of firing a bit on each of the axes (radial, normal, pro/retrograde)\u00A0is less efficient than burning directly along the maneuver node\u00A0(ignoring for the moment, corrections at the end of a burn when the maneuver node marker wanders because you did\u00A0not exactly point at the maneuver node for the entire burn duration).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes you have fuel to spare and efficiency doesn\u0027t matter, and it\u0027s just easiest to manually \u0027feather\u0027 in a burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it\u0027s a judgement call. \u00A0If you need every last bit of delta-v, or prefer not to be grossly inefficient, drop a maneuver node and follow it. \u00A0If you want to fine-tune an encounter, and have fuel to spare, and feel like eyeballing it, burn on the axes as needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say you need to burn N m/s normal, R m/s radial, and P m/s prograde.
