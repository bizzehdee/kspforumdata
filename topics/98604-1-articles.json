Furthermore, the earlier versions of Unity 4 had quite a few bugs of their own which we had to work around (or hang tight) until fixes came along. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is, moving to Unity 5 is very unlikely to be a straightforward transition, and by no means I expect KSP to be stable or even playable (let alone improved) after simply upgrading the project over. I would be very happy to be wrong in that one, I must add, but historically, every time we upgraded to a new major version of unity, we came across new issues we had to contend with, so please don\u0027t get overexcited about Unity 5 just yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis late in a project, most games tend to freeze engine versions when they find something stable that fits their needs. Regression issues is in fact the main reason why Unity stuck with PhysX 2.8 until now. If breaking mods and saves is an issue for us, imagine their case, where instead of mods and saves, they risk breaking hundreds of commercial projects. We have it easy by comparison really... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, we don\u0027t plan to freeze engines, but I just wanted to clarify that moving to Unity 5 may not be as simple and so immediately beneficial as it may seem.

Unity is at it\u0027s peak, and the vendor is milking it while it still sells well (even if in the process killing the goose that lays the golden eggs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT: Unity 5 will bring actually stable 64bit builds, and a physics engine with more or less improved performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince KSP has horrible memory optimization and leaks, and no actually optimized physics subsystem (instead relying on unity to do the grunt work), unity5 would allow KSP to continue its memory wasting behavior without running into 32bit VMEM limits. Furthermore, the bad (in terms of performance) physics of KSP could run faster and be distributed over multiple cores.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to put it bluntly: Unity5 will change nothing about KSP\u0027s badly optimized and memory-leaking behavior - BUT it would open up more ressources (VMEM, cores), so it would crash/bog down to a lesser extend, until KSP exceeds those extra ressources as well. Unity5 will not fix anything about what is problematic about the implementation of KSP - it simply will enable it to consume more ressources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince KSP has an overally supportive and \u0022progressive\u0022 community, and SQUAD has not yet shown any sign of intention to clean house/optimize and bugfix KSP, people are hoping for unity5 to be the saviour, by \u0022fixing\u0022 bad programming with more abundant ressources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, i\u0027m sure there must be more that unity5 is bringing onto the table - that can\u0027t be all of it? Well yes, especially for handhelds, it will enable easier integration of adware, fancy shaders that only cost a bit more performance than is already the case, and it will enable more people to scriptkiddie even more stuff without knowing anything about even .NET coding (SLOW!!!). Oh, and for devs there will be better tools to compose music soundtracks - cause that\u0027s what everyone wanted. I could go on, but you get the picture: Besides of 64bit VMEM and physics updates, unity5 seems to address nothing of what its critics actually demand. It just ADDS even more, instead FIXING what is wrong with it.

So yes, they usually do have scene transitions - whether or not that is apparent to the user.\u003Cp\u003EKSP, being a sandbox game with mostly user-generated content (planes/rockets) and being able to switch between them at will irrespective of where they are or what parts they consist of means it does not have that luxury. Yes, startup could be reduced to only loading the assets required initially, but you\u0027d still need to have most/all assets loaded before the player actually is let loose or you risk very slow switches between vessels and/or scenes as any assets not currently in memory need to be loaded in at the time of the switch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou know what takes the 99% of the programs running time? the human interaction. think of loading up the most important assets and let ppl playing with the menu... in the meantime a thread can run in the background loading up the main scene assets, let them start, they see nice buildings, looking around, in the meantime you can still load... etc etc etc. if they press the button too quick \u0027cos they already know the stuff, a little \u0022be patient\u0022 message and its done. this is how big asset programs work. you just need to know what will you need next time. dont even mention the amount of assets ksp has is just a fragment of how many assets a modern game put on the opening screen \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E the magic is called optimisation\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T08:23:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JordanL\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JordanL\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr they could not load every asset in the entire game at once before reaching the main screen.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not like we DON\u0027T have scene change loading screens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, how people used to whinge back in 0.20 (or whenever the pre-optimisation update was) when the loading screens were delayed by a few seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt grinds after a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn topic: unity 5 will basically create a lot of frustrated players when they realise that it doesn\u0027t cure teh kancer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-06T08:30:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2015 08:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TMS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T10:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tuareg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tuareg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou know what takes the 99% of the programs running time? the human interaction.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, fully agreed on your post to hide/optimise the loading of the assets during initial startup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I thought the main point of your original post was for KSP to actually NOT load all of the assets in order to use less RAM, and only load in the assets as and when required.
