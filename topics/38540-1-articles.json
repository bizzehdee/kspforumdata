I maximized the thrusters and no luck. Now my Stayputnik is stuck in orbit no idea what happened there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone bring light to this matter?

You need solar panels or radiothermal generators to supply power to your craft when rocket motors aren\u0027t firing, or enough battery capacity to last through times you\u0027re coasting. I usually go with a couple of lightweight (fixed) solar panels and a small battery to tide the probe controller over when the panels are in shadow... but that may change with the new version which needs electricity to drive SAS/ASAS modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -- Steve\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
