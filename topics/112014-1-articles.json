Also, a second module works like \u0022Dang it!\u0022 but for time spent in the KCT (random events). Designed primarily to work with KCT, but options open! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIntro Note (hear this in a suitably awkward, stuttering voice)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay so I wanted to get a feel for this mod concept, and to check for interest. I will likely not start development for a month or so. I haven\u0027t coded in a *long* time and plan to work with some modders and reverse engineer some code as well as learn the basics of C# (my background is mostly in basic and C\u002B) I am going to time mod development with an upcoming class on C# I am taking online so I have something fun to apply my new-found skills to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFirst Points:\u003C/strong\u003E It will likely be intended to work with Kerbal Construction Time. This is mostly due to the fact that this mod will take advantage of the longer timeframe KCT creates for the game, unlike a normal KSP game. In your standard game, you can complete your career mode easily within the 1st year, which would create a very compact timeline and limit events. However, it is possible I will create a slider that increases event frequency if desired. For the most part, the random events will make perfect filler for the \u0022down time\u0022 in KCT between builds and during pad refurb/rollout/etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat I want this mod to do:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E- Creates a timeline of activities using game logs and arranges them in a way to be pleasing and encyclopedic\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E- Adds decision points in-game on occasion with choices and consequences (minor and mostly relating to crew, cash, rep, and research) Nothing effecting active flight scenes. Adds some extra pressure during long waits for ship builds/pad reconditioning/etc\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E- Adds comedic news stories to timeline with no game impact. May crowd-source this out ala community research results to give it a \u0022kerbalized\u0022 feel.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E- Have an in-game summary and a file created outside of the game for easy posting/reading in save folder. Fun for the whole family!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow this mod will interact with the game (if possible)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbals that are not on mission can have decision based events affect them. Their stats will determine the results/options available. High stupidity and courage will create brash, unpredictable Kerbals (these guys don\u0027t do well with down time!!). Low stupidity, low courage types will be the safest ones, likely spending most time working experiments and staying in their offices. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- General events and decision points will also affect the Space Agency. These will call upon and influence the Space Agency stats (Rep, Funds, and Research). Essentially, this mod will treat these values like RPG stats. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a nutshell, this mod will add immersion and depth to the game outside of flight and missions. Think of it like Dang it! but for the time spent at KSC. The timeline creation may be a separate module, and be useful for those that like to review their career/science games or post them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETimeline Example:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of simply \u0022X ship built\u0022 the mod may occassionally add little snippets such as \u0022X ship built at X time, pad crew discovers a rat stowed away in the engine bell.\u0022 Just for fun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it so far.

I\u0027m thinking maybe between 2 and 3 a game/year, with increasing frequency as your budget inflates and crew roster increases. But no \u0022congressional wrestling\u0022 or politics.. because, gawd, I hate politics in space flight and I know the reason we play KSP is to run a space program without idiots messing with our ideas. But.. lately I have become more fascinated with the human side (astronauts, pad crew, mission control, admin) and think their actions need to be represented somewhat. Besides, Kerbals are funny little creatures: Great engineers and field scientists but obviously lacking some common sense. Besides just blowing rockets up and sending manned missions before probes, we should experience some of their silliness outside of flight scenes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@theonegalen Thanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T16:45:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis looks pretty interesting look forward to seeing more!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotaru","CreatedById":135669,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T16:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also think this sounds like a fun idea!

I\u0027m going old school, using RND generators and RPG-style charts to get results. I\u0027m also flirting with the idea of crew downtime between missions (currently 10 days for every 1 day on mission, up to max of 90) as well as a TMT (Total Mission Time) value to allow retirement. Optional! And also modified by experience and stats. I\u0027m even thinking retired Kerbals will still have roles in the roleplay system, maybe more then before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also reading up on individual astronauts in RL and seeing what they did throughout their careers and afterwards to get ideas for events and modifiers. Honestly I want a solid and semi-balanced system before I start coding so I can release something functional initially. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFInal Frontier has been very useful to me, as well, and I may take a few cues from it for development alongside KCT. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thought of an actual \u0022stat sheet\u0022 for individual crew has also crossed my mind.
