Then go to the main site, sign in, \u0026amp; click on My Account. You can download the most recent update, (90) \u0026amp; the current one too. (1.02) Install, blah blah blah, \u0026amp; then yeah! But, if you want some of the old parts back, go to gamedata\u0026gt;squad\u0026gt;Parts\u0026gt; Whatever you want back, \u0026amp; put it in the current folders.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
