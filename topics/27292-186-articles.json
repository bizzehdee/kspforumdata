I was conservative on the launcher for the drive section up front, so used a decent amount of it\u0027s fuel to orbit. Then since the next section which will house all the extra fuel for the spaceplanes didn\u0027t have any rockets so I used a very heavy lifter which still had like 4 tanks left when done which is in the 3 stacks at the end. So then although going conservative with the final section, I wound up with a whole lot of fuel in the lifter. So I thought I can\u0027t let all this fuel go to waste and the only way to dock it would be with the medium clampotrons on the 4 guys return vessel, which was extra tricky because the nukes go past the docking port. I wound up with a ridiculous amount of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan was to not have all that fuel from the boosters. The whole thing got to Jool with only that booster fuel, and then got to Laythe, at which point Jenzer (I) was too scared to aerobrake and we went ahead and used the rest of the booster\u0027s fuel and a lot of the driver\u0027s fuel to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s why the naysayers were doubting that this was in the spirit of a \u0022minimalist\u0022 space program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoPanShabuShabu","CreatedById":91327,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T06:09:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemembered why I always wanted to do a good Laythe mission....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/HU0F8Lc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HU0F8Lc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HU0F8Lc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoPanShabuShabu","CreatedById":91327,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T06:40:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry to keep spamming this thread with pictures, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh God!
