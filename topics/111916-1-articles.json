The crew survived to their landing site but both engines of the lander have been lost, as has power generation. Right now my two Kerbals have life support that will last them at least 3 days, at which point they\u0027ll have to take their chances with the ascent stage, which is already low on power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion is, using a (FASA) Saturn V outfitted with a remote controlled LM but without any satellite networks (been too lazy to set them up), could I get a landing to them in time? Funnily enough I\u0027ve never actually paid attention to how long a trip to the Mun takes, so I\u0027m not 100% on it. And then theres teh whole issue of controlling the LM on descent. If I\u0027m lucky I might be able to use teh CSM to control the LM by proxy, but that\u0027ll be tricky with the limited overhead time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: Determined to survive, Kasie spotted an bit of debris in the distance and threw caution to the wind and went to investigate. Lo and behold, one of the RTGs survived the crash.

Pulling out the ALCOR pod to be piloted by Jeb. Going to be a lot of rendezvous\u0027 though.

An average, lightly-built human can survive over a month without food, around a week without water (without reusing urine) and only the air is a limited resource (though with liquid oxygen, only CO2 removal filters become an issue of a scarce resource.) Oh, and the matter of thermoregulation, I guess balancing freezing in the shadows and frying in the sunlight would be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
