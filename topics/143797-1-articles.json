It seems to be like a shift in the controls or something and suddenly I am unable to select a node or anything on my ship. This basically happens to me almost every flight, especially if they are anywhere outside of kerbin\u0027s gravity (but it has also happened in kerbins orbit as well).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat seems to happen is when I\u0027m trying to adjust a manuever, I hold down X when moving the retrograde or anything else,\u00A0and when the mouse seems to\u00A0line up with an orbit line as well and I release X it accidentally selects the orbit line and prompts you to set a node or warp time. I always ignore these of course but when I seem to back out quickly and spam O out of frustration that\u0027s when my ability to place a node or even select ANYTHING disappears and you can really see a shift in the control\u00A0system like something changed.
