It doesn\u0027t look like their API scraping captured the [KSPField] declarations, but any values listed under \u0027Public Attributes\u0027 *should* be accessible as a config value for that module.\n\nE.G. The stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E module lists the following \u0027public attributes\u0027  -- [https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/api/class_module_s_a_s.html](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/api/class_module_s_a_s.html)\n\n    int \tCommandModuleIndex = -1 \n    bool \tRequireCrew = false \n    int \tSASServiceLevel = 0 \n    bool \tstandalone = false\n    string \tstandaloneStateText = \u0022\u0022 \n    bool \tstandaloneToggle = true\n\nIt is very probably that those are all valid config file entries.\n\nIn general development news:\n\nMore work on cleaning up issues in KSPWheel (dust-effects null-ref log spam), more fixes in TU (transparent materials, flag decals), and finally figured out why some of my config node parsing was returning values in reversed order (changes in stock code that now write-out config nodes backwards). \n\nThat last one has been a head-scratcher for a couple of weeks now, as the problem itself was making debugging it difficult;  the problem was that the configNode.ToString() method would return values in the opposite order they were defined in the config file, and I use that method to \u0027store\u0027 config nodes in text form within some of the part-module classes.  So when the config node is stored into text, the values get reversed.  It is then reloaded from the text form, in the order that it was stored (backwards).  Any attempt to use the ToString() method to debug those reloaded nodes would display the \u0027proper\u0027 order, as it would re-reverse the ordering in the displayed text output.\n\n100% certainly a \u0027bug\u0027 in stock code.  Likely it was someone trying to make an optimization regarding a loop iterator, but in many cases ***iterating backwards is incorrect*** -- notably anytime you are iterating a list or array -- ordering is important, and you ***cannot arbitrarily re-order a list or array*** (part of the \u0027contract\u0027 of a list or array is that the ordering is guaranteed by the implementation; it is one of the main reasons to use a list or array compared to some other unordered storage method).  Only that is exactly what the stock code is doing -- re-ordering a list of values, arbitrarily and without explicit (or implicit) instruction.  Worse yet -- the code worked fine in previous KSP versions (it iterated values in the proper order in the ToString() method).  This was an intentional and unnecessary change someone made; a change that should have never made it past review and into production code; a change that cost me at least a few nights worth of dev time to track down and hack around.\n\nSo, with that figured out and mostly worked around, I can finally get back to actual progress."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-12T02:36:33Z","Content":"As I was working on fixing up some PBR texture sets, I though \u0027ehh, why not give it a try\u0027.... and enabled basic PBR shaders for all of the lineup of engine models.
