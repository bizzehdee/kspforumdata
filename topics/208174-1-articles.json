I created a small patch to move the small Cacteye telescope back a node from \u0022Advanced Science Tech\u0022 to \u0022Scanning Tech\u0022. To do this, I used the following patch\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E@PART[spacedust-telescope-1-small]:NEEDS[CommunityTechTree]\n{\n\u00A0 @TechRequired = scienceTech\n}\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe part is successfully available when I unlock the Scanning Tech node except in the preview section of what each node contains, the small Telescope is shown as being present in both \u0022Advanced Science Tech\u0022 and \u0022Scanning Tech\u0022 nodes.
