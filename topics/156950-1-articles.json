I can easily put the thing into Kerbin orbit and set up the maneuver to get a Duna encounter but the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E system seems unable to keep the craft on the maneuver node when Im using the NERV engines. The only thing I can do is have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on but I dont have enough of it for all the burns.

But in space, you don\u0027t have air to push on so you can only rely on TWC, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe above is pretty much a guess though: to be able to determine the exact cause of your problem, a screenshot of your craft would be very helpful.
