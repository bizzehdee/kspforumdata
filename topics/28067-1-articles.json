Put a Rockomax Adapter and a Hitchhiker below that, then a Rockomax Adapter 02 and a stack decoupler. Put a small RCS tank and the core engine main stage fuel tanks below that and an LV-45 below that. Stick a couple of radial decouplers on, attach the same number of fuel tanks to those and put LV-30s on the bottom of that. Run fuel lines from the outer rockets to the core. You\u0027ll have a rocket that looks about the same as the Heavy (and produces roughly the same amount of thrust - 630 kN as opposed to the Heavy\u0027s 620 at launch). Only tricky bit is going to be figuring out the number of fuel tanks needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to make the payload a space station core, use a set of BZ-52s along the sides of the Hitchhiker, and attach Clamp-o-Trons to them. Add solar panels and presto - instant space station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETricky bit is going to be making it a 1:1 replica; this will give you something that at least approximates the overall look.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
