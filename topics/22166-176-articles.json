I think I was in warp at the time. As you can see there is green dust, so the tanks should be filling. I have tried re-positioning the lander, saving and loading, and restarting KSP without success. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to note - this lander wobbles slightly. I didn\u0027t think that made a difference though since the kethane mining was working initially.
