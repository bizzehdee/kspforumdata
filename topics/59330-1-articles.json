Also, you really have to bleed off almost all speed before touching down. On your landings, get as low as possible, cut the engines, and hold the nose up just enough to stay at like 3 meters altitude as long as possible while bleeding off velocity. I can\u0027t remember, but I think I had to get this baby down below 30 m/s or so to land safely. At that point, the nose-up attitude would pose more of a danger of knocking off my rear engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame goes for takeoff, you have to get up quickly while watching your angle of attack- again this means you need a lot of horizontal space. Gun the engines, and keep holding back on the stick to get the nose just above the surface so you both get the structurally weaker parts away from the water sooner and get airborne before your velocity gets too high. You really have to go slow while in contact with the water or any craft will break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an example, here\u0027s a low part count, stock seaplane I made. Note the I beam, structural plates, and landing gear assembly. This allows it to both land on the runway and to float.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xjqtl3q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xjqtl3q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-13T15:56:29Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2014 03:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by UH60guy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
