Also, flying with no fins or insufficient fins will do this. \u00A0Also, flying too fast too soon can do this - don\u0027t accelerate too quickly low in the atmosphere - this will cause an instability to get worse, not better. Finally, keep your rocket pointed toward the prograde marker as much as possible when you fly through air - the more \u0027off-target\u0027 your point the rocket, the more likely it will be to go out of control.

When done properly, this will result in a circularization burn of less than 100 m/s or so of delta-v. -- If you just go straight up, your orbit has an apoapsis of 200km, periapsis of -600 km. If you do a lot of sideways burning, you have an apoapsis of 80-100 km, and a periapsis of 20-40km. The first case you\u0027ll need to put 1500-2000 dV into it to round it out to something orbital, the latter will need 30-80.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will probably have far more fuel left than you know what to do with, and the ride up will be a bit warm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last thing -- that ASAS probably quits working completely about 3 second after you shut off your engines. The reaction wheels in the asas and the pod both need electric charge to run, and I see no batteries or solar panels to provide it. The engines should generate enough to keep them running, but only when the engine itself is running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should have to consider this. And HOW then would that 909 be heating ANYTHING up, when it wasn\u0027t burning, in the first place?

(though this isn\u0027t too bad- was just a little disconcerting the first couple test runs, not knowing what to expect, and it actually appears to be pogo oscillations, to boot! ) but other than that it now seems to be pretty much behaving itself. I\u0027ve found that I\u0027m having to wait until around 35,000 m or so (about the time the first stage decouples from the stack in flight) to execute any turns, because if I turn before this, my acceleration is too great to have enough time to correct vector to burn prograde to raise the Ap/Pe. If I turn at the 10,000 m\u00A0 mark, I\u0027ll end up raising Pe to around 50,000 to 60,000 max, and because the velocity is so great, I usually end up having to throttle up the engines and decouple them from the stack to avoid ending up planting it nose-cone first in Kerbin- impact crater and all.\u00A0 But I find that it works fine to delay the turn by about 1.75 to 2 times the the standard turn altitude. Reason being is because by the time I\u0027m getting ready to burn prograde to raise the AP, invariably my velocity will already be close to orbiting velocity, at somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1,000 m/sec.\u00A0 what appeared to be causing the nasty handling was that extra set of wings that I pulled off the middle stage. Now that I\u0027ve got this craft in basic workable condition. I also have tested with/without SRBs- and the SRB\u0027s are giving me enough thrust that they\u0027re probably what\u0027s getting my velocity as high as what it is, as the velocity drops by about 700 m/sec without the SRBs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John Doe","CreatedById":162546,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T05:39:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would say thanks to everyone for taking the time to help me out. The other space simulator I play doesn\u0027t really involve building a custom stack so much as flying NASA\u0027s\u00A0 STS stack. This has been a radically different thing all together. The STS stack practically flies itself on its own, with autopilot doing most of the work of navigating to the propper vectors and controlling velocity. Most of the work then becomes taking the steps to decouple the stack at the right times, though the most challenging aspect of that has been landing the thing. I\u0027ve yet to NOT belly flop the orbiter on the ground due to the velocity- around 1,000 m/sec on average at around 5,000 ft that you have to bring to practically zero within 5 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T09:43:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may be late for the discussion, but have you used struts to tie the three stocks together at the bottom / middle?
