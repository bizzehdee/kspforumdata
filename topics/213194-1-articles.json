At your tech level you can probably have the mystery goo things, termometers and barometers. Therefore in each biome (= building) you can do up to six experiments: crew report (r-click the pod), thermometer, barometer, mystery goo, EVA report (EVA a Kerbal and then r-click it) and surface sample (again, EVA a Kerbal and then r-click it).

recovery will extract the science data from the experiments without you needing to do anything more.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThis means that if you want more science on fewer flights, it may be worth your time to attach multiple thermometers and multiple Mystery Goo containers to your rocket and run each one in sequence as you reach new situations.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlso note that you can repeat an experiment in location/situations\u00A0that you have visited before, but there are \u003Cem\u003Esharply\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0diminishing returns.\u00A0 Mystery Goo stops generating useful results after the third time, for example.\u00A0 EVA Reports and Crew Reports give you all of the science they can the first time.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDon\u0027t bother with transmitting results in the early game.\u00A0 There is a time and place for it, but transmitting\u00A0reduces the Science you can get from the experiment:\u00A0 you always get the most Science per mission from recovery of the data, either from the experiment part or from the science container.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould you have any other questions, or anything was unclear or unhelpful, please feel free to ask.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave fun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Charley","CreatedById":224393,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-27T07:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224244215\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213194\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677423968\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022226573\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FABIODONATO\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/26/2023 at 5:06 PM, FABIODONATO said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have just started KSP (shame, I know), enjoyed a lot of the trainings (until mun 1 which I find difficult).
