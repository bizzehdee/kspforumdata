I was working on creating a cargo bay capable Shuttle based off of concepts provided by Sgt_Flyer. However, the cargo version I was so arduously working on does not function in 0.21 due to the removal of strut elasticity. I have no clue if the Shuttle works in 0.21 because my main hard drive has been out of commission for the last month. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere I leave the link for anyone\u0027s potential enjoyment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36120-Space-Shuttle-Atlantis\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36120-Space-Shuttle-Atlantis\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4no8zQj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224no8zQj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ignition","CreatedById":60982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T23:06:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/27628-Kerblantis-STS-NASA-Type-Space-Shuttle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/27628-Kerblantis-STS-NASA-Type-Space-Shuttle\u003C/a\u003E\n"}]}
