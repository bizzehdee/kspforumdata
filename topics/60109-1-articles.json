The mainsail is a breeze to get up to the atmosphere, way less frustrating than other rockets, I just used three for this thing, but several times now at the very end of it\u0027s fuel, it shoves the tank through my rocket and blows the whole damn thing up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the heck is causing this? Does the mainsail get some magical mystery thrust right at the end of the fuel tank from the fumes or something? I thought the max was 1500kn.
