Now there is one thing about I\u0027m still wondering. I recently started a new career save, spaceplane-only because I really like the concept of SSTOs. However, I\u0027m flying in Stock Aero, which made me think:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill the new aerodynamics in 1.0 be like FAR and render most of my planes probably pretty unflyable without further optimization, or will Stock Spaceplanes from the current version still be able to fly as usual?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be kinda cool to already get a feeling for it and also see what I should do with my savegame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t seen someone ask this question before or it getting answered anywhere, although I haven\u0027t looked everywhere \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVolcanix\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T20:05:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad claims they are interested in making the new system backward compatible such that most old designs will still fly.
