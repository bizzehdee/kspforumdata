Of course, everything in its basis works using quantum processes because every basic matter we encounter is corporeal due to\u00A0its electron clouds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut on the higher level, no. Neural networks work using ionic currents. Those are not digital processes. There are no ones and zeros in the brain. Stuff works analogue and has lots of interconnected feedback loops, some of which use faster transmissions, and some use slow, molecular signals such as secreting hormones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasic brain functioning is very well known.
