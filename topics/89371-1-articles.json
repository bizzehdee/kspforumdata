Few animals live longer than we do. We also live in the golden age of technology, information technology in particular. One person that was alive to see the advent of the airplane and the car could also have witnessed the rise of the computer - a period in which the world transformed more than once.

You are in the privileged position to experience more than most creatures ever will, in one of the most exciting times until now, while also knowing how things were without all those new and amazing technologies. We are in one of those times in the history books, where we get to wonder about how it must have been. How did the first humans felt when they learned to speak? How did the first people harnessing bronze and iron experienced that shock? How did the enlightenment whirl through people\u0027s minds, altering their thoughts and view on the world? How did electricity amaze people and change their lives forever? We can now know, because we are in one of those times. We are The First Computer People and history will remember us as poor, yet inventive souls that were barely prepared for what hit us.
