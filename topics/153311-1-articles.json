Kerbal cannot board, let go, or move. cannot quicksave, cannot quick load, cannot exit, cannot go to space center. I thought this might be related to the cloning of kerbals, but when checking the crew via crew transfer, the kerbal is not cloned. any ideas whats going on here and how to fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Garrett Kerman","CreatedById":167275,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T17:30:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would probably go in bug reports.

I think the game hasn\u0027t confirmed you left the ship, so it locks your controls. You can test it by activating mod control panels. If they still work, then it should temporarily fix the problem.
