When she refused, her boss made life difficult and she resigned her commission. She had dreams of becomming a kerbonaut that were nearly shattered by her resignation until she became one of the first commercial space pilots, flying for Kerbodyne and testing prototype hardware. One particularly nasty incident left her stranded in space without a way to get home. Sheer grit got Lisa through, and she brought the experimental K-15 orbiter home safely. Lisa\u0027s piloting skills are phenominal and just shy of the best of the best... Or so she lets people believe. She is savy enough to not rock the boat of the male centric space program, but if she ever does, Lisa could give Jeb a run for his money. Her natural personality is to be in charge, which frustrates her to be a follower while the boys are in charge. But to get ahead, Lisa knows to play ball. If she worked at it, Lisa could be a professional model, though her looks sometimes get in the way of her career.

The kraken have highly adaptive tactics, they rely on them. It\u0027s unlikely a fake magnetosphere will save you in real life.
