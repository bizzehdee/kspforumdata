Google \u0022Dunning-Kruger effect\u0022. Aside from that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC# is a rich object oriented language. The concept of methods pretty much belongs to the core of that, as do the use of the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cmain\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 function or the use of libraries (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cusing\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2). Now, what you need for making parts is probably a very small subset of C#. Good tutorials will teach you a lot of things you\u0027re likely to have no interest in: object creation and destruction, distributing assemblies, good programming practices, etc. So it\u0027s doubtful that a \u0022good tutorial\u0022 will bring you what you need which is just a few key phrases to get you going. You\u0027d get more out of some samples of KSP add-ons to see how the code is implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do want to learn more about C# be prepared that you\u0027ll spend a lot of time learning all kinds of good things that have very little meaning for KSP mods. But Microsoft\u0027s \u0022Step by Step\u0022 series are usually decent tutorials. So is the \u0022for Dummies\u0022 series. Not good reference guide but a tutorial is barely ever needed as such. Books from O\u0027Reilly are generally of high quality as well. As \u003Cstrong\u003EHeadhunter\u003C/strong\u003E pointed out, don\u0027t stick to a single book or tutorial. You\u0027ll get far more out of the viewpoints of a few different authors; everyone has their own style and none will match yours exactly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magion","CreatedById":97022,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T10:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like tutorials from the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://thenewboston.org/list.php?cat=15\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENew Boston\u003C/a\u003E.

Every space ship and all stations will require some amount of them because kerbals won\u0027t sruvive without these 2. I also designed a probe that has plenty of room for cargo which will make it a good resupply ship like Progress.
