Happy wife is a happy life and all that, right? But budget creep being what it\u00A0is and getting less than expected on the refinance due to miscommunications, there won\u0027t be\u00A0nearly enough left to make a significant down payment, let alone buy an EV outright. But another factor with having a reno going on is we\u0027ll need an electrician anyways, which would make installing a plug for an EV charger a tiny bit cheaper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe currently pay almost $700/mo on our RAM, which will be\u00A0freed up with the re-finance, along with other interest charges. Of course, our mortgage payment will go up, but not nearly that much, so we should have some room in our operating budget again. It\u0027ll be nice to get rid of those payments; the last thing we want to do now is add another payment\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eagain\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0or rack up other debt again. We should probably be throwing as much into savings as we can while still reasonably enjoying life. But yet, in current conditions, I can\u0027t stop thinking that turning around and buying an EV may not be a terrible idea....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo let\u0027s look at some numbers: While I haven\u0027t been tracking fuel too closely, I\u0027d say the car burns 40-50L/wk with work and other errands. When Covid hit my 2-man carpool broke up, but the price of gas crashed, so that hit wasn\u0027t too bad. But now gas is tracking back to historical highs in this region (we consistently get gouged at the pump here. it\u0027s often reported that we are paying more than market conditions would indicate, but it continues) While not back to $1.50/l yet,\u00A0it\u0027s been at $1.48/L last week, so it\u0027s foreseeable. and it\u0027s a nice, round number, so let\u0027s go with that. My car seems to be tracking the high 6.xL/100km\u00A0these days, although I thought it used to be closer to 6. Maybe I\u0027m driving my average highway speed has been faster, or the car is older, dunno. So say my 100km trip to work is likely to cost me \u0026gt;$10/day or $220/mo in fuel. Not including other errands, such as a nightly short jaunt to the school for our mountain labernese to have her\u00A0 run. The engine is usually cold, so it\u0027s burning a disproportionate amount of gas for that short trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA\u00A0gas wrinkle:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I hear is that when Covid hit and the world stopped and gas demand (and price) crashed, many tanker drivers were laid off and found new jobs. As the world cranks up again, demand for gas is rising again but there aren\u0027t enough tanker drivers around, and as one can imagine hauling a tanker full of flammable liquid requires extra certification over a regular Class 1 truck driver. For that matter there\u0027s a shortage of drivers in general, and autonomous trucks just aren\u0027t going to be quite ready fast enough. But platooning them will help. Anyways, a potential shortage of drivers means a potential shortage of gas, with the result of prices going even higher. Which makes EVs more attractive, but supply is small. So while the inclination is to wait, I fear if I wait the used EV pool will get both more expensive and dry up at the same time.\u00A0Which makes me not want to wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHydro: I see efficiencies of 25-30kWh/100mi thrown around. Choosing 30 for roundness and worst-case estimating, that\u0027s roughly 18kWh/100km. Round up to 20kWh from the meter and a 2nd tier hydro rate of over $0.14/kWh (call it 15. Billing here is two-tier instead of ToD, which I think would be better esp. with an EV) or $3/100km, which compares favorably with $10.50/100km. Not including insurance or maintenance. I still need to get insurance quotes, but maintenance should\u00A0be big savings. But the energy savings alone should amount to at least\u00A0 $7/day\u00A0 or $154/mo savings just on energy for commuting. Hmm, maybe not as big a savings as I hoped. Maybe if I can con my boss\u00A0 into installing a charger so I can charge for free at work...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother wrinkle:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy teenage stepson was working at weekends at McD\u0027s, so I\u0027d rack up another 20km on days he worked. But now he\u0027s finished all his credits for graduation and will be coming to work with me at the tire plant for the rest of the year, then hopefully into trades training in February. So scratch that errand, and he will now be making globs of money to save for school and contribute to the household when he\u0027s not in school. While we weren\u0027t planning on charging him rent just yet if he saves most of his money first, throwing an EV into the picture changes things, and he\u0027s good with that. But we\u0027d have to be prepared to do without his contribution when he goes back to school. Also, he just got his learner\u0027s license. It\u0027ll be a year before he can get his\u003Cs\u003E Newbie\u00A0\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0Novice license, so no point in hanging onto a third car for him until then, making the Yaris available for trade-in bait. But we\u0027d be more comfortable with him learning in a much less expensive car, although with modern safety features? Things that make you go \u003Cem\u003EHmmmmm\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough my youngest son is likely to replace him at McD\u0027s, so I\u0027ll probably still have that errand after all. Bus service to that location is excessively inconvenient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow let\u0027s see what\u0027s available. Of course I want a Tesla, but at first glance that\u0027s way out of my price range. From what I\u0027ve gathered so far, the Chevy Bolt is the next best thing,\u00A0and I\u0027ve chosen to ignore the others for now as I was raised on Chevy and they\u0027ve led the traditional automaker\u0027s tortoise race to useable full electrification. And at a cursory glance the Bolt is slightly less expensive than the others. As for pricing (Cdn$):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the smartest (read: less expensive overall) thing to do if I insist on an electric car would be to buy a used Bolt. But If I\u0027m spending this kind of money (that I don\u0027t\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to) I\u00A0may as well make it worthwhile, and I would want nothing less than the Premier trim w/ the optional (this safety stuff should NOT be optional IMO, especially at a list price of under $1k for the option) auto-braking, lane-keeping, pedestrian-braking etc. Especially with a new driver in an expensive vehicle. That cuts down on the used Bolts I see in the Fraser Valley region on CarGurus quite a bit, but there are some, depending how far I want to go.\u00A0I see around (depending on mileage)\u00A0$27k for a fully loaded 2017 Bolt. But total price isn\u0027t everything, right, what about the payments? The \u0022informational purposes only\u0022 financing calculators say for a typical used-car financing term of 60months gives a monthly payment of ~$500, or a 72month for $420. Which\u00A0is about $350/mo (or less) after fuel savings for the 60mo term, not including trade-in (2k if I\u0027m lucky? No idea really).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut wait! With new-car financing terms of 96 months, a brand-new Bolt, going for ~$43k after 8k in govt rebates and some advertised $2k dealer rebates, has a monthly payment \u00A0still around $500/mo. I\u0027m just in hock for a\u00A08\u00A0years (again) with a new vehicle, instead of 5 years with a used one, or until we refinance the mortgage again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut wait! If I\u0027m creeping up to $43k, well, that\u0027s about where used Model 3s are starting. But that\u0027s back to used car financing terms of 60-72 months, with a payment over $700/mo. Nope, too rich for me now. So much for that dream. I\u0027ll just dream over to the Tesla site..... Waitaminute.... Again with rebates, an SR\u002B is in the same price range as a Bolt? $7500 down will get me a new Model 3 SR\u002B for $548/mo?? Over 8 years, of course, but, now I\u0027m drooling... Not that we expect to have that much of a down payment, but it is do-able.... After fuel and other savings, the net cost should be under $400/mo. Still high but not much more than a Bolt, aside from the down payment. That puts \u00A0a Tesla actually in plausible reach...\u00A0As long as I\u0027m dreaming, let\u0027s see, a Model 3 AWD w/FSD works out to a payment of over $800 *sigh* yup, firmly in dreamland now....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here I am, conflicted. I shouldn\u0027t even consider buying another vehicle, let alone financing one. But deep down, I badly want an electric car, ideally a Tesla, but I certainly don\u0027t need one. At least writing this post forced me to do a little more research, such as electricity cost. So my off-the-top-of-my-head estimated fuel savings of $250/mo becomes a (lowballed; I may save more) net energy cost savings closer to $150, depending on fuel prices. If fuel prices skyrocket, I\u0027ll look like a genius. Regardless, ICE vehicles will be mostly obsolete (there will always be a valid, if rare, use case for ICE, IMO) sooner or later, probably sooner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what are people\u0027s thoughts on my conundrum? Opinions on various EVs? I gotta go for now, but I\u0027ll put up a poll soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-02T20:10:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2021 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by StrandedonEarth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-03T03:33:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, part of making that post was convincing myself that I shouldn\u0027t do it, at least not yet.
