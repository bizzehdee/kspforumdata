My \u0022medium\u0022 lifter (Mk2, 3x cargo bays to carry a payload up to around 13t) uses 6 jets to get to orbit. Your craft there looks like it\u0027s quite considerably heavier.

I have to figure out what the best practice is after 20k, since the jets flame out by 27k but do not provide more than 400kN at 21k. It is not enough to maintain the same speed and gain more altitude. OR should I continue with jets only up to 27k?

Past that in any direction sees rapid performance loss. Once I get that speed, I use my wings and jets to pitch up, keeping as much speed as possible. Lift surfaces are the most efficient way to change heading at those speeds. I hit the rockets when I start losing any speed. Once I pass 28 km, I bring heading inside of the prograde circle.
