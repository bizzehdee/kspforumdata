Heavier payloads need more fuel to maintain the same dV. More fuel means a heavier craft, and on it goes. You need to add thrust accordingly. My \u0022medium\u0022 lifter (Mk2, 3x cargo bays to carry a payload up to around 13t) uses 6 jets to get to orbit. Your craft there looks like it\u0027s quite considerably heavier. Put a couple more jets on it (at least) and see how it fares then.\n\nIf you can\u0027t \u0022find a flight profile\u0022, you don\u0027t have enough thrust. If dropping to ~10 degrees at 10km doesn\u0027t get you into the positive feedback acceleration loop, your TWR is just too low, it\u0027s as simple as that.\n\n(*EDIT: 92t?? Yeah, not going to work with 7 engines. I\u0027ll take a look at mine later on to compare, but I\u0027d suggest you\u0027ll be after an awful lot more than that.*)\n\nI like to be pushing 900m/sec at the 20km mark, with my prograde marker at around 20-25 degrees.. time to apoapsis of around a minute or so, but it varies with the TWR you have when you\u0027re on rockets. The faster you\u0027re going initially, and the faster you can accelerate, the better you can hold your Ap out in front of you, and that\u0027s the key to it.\n\nI\u0027d really like some jet engines suitable for Mk3 parts though. I\u0027m tempted to just .cfg edit and rescale up a copy with appropriate mass \u0026 thrust changes to fit the 2.5m parts (1.25 -\u003E 2.5m rescaleFactor = 2, thrust \u0026 mass increase 2^3 = 8 times). The engine can\u0027t really handle the part counts required to make heavy SSTO spaceplanes properly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T02:51:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 02:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mic\\_n**"},{"CreatedByName":"scavenger","CreatedById":111989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T02:59:13Z","Content":"thank you rubisco, i will give it a try when i will unlock the rapier. for the moment I want to do it with the X4 engine only, as I see many people doing it.\n\nWell, it is much better now: once i got to 18,000m, i made a quicksave and tried different things.\n\n- stayed at 10deg up to 1200m/s then rocket then AP goes to 100km but i do not have any oxidizer left to circularize\n\n- tried different degrees between 5 and 20, AP do not goes up 75km\n\n- tried ascent autopilot too, but then AoA enter into action, and I played with the dynamic pressure fadeout to raise it to 7000Pa and AoA to 12deg but still not enough oxidizer to orbit.\n\nThen decided to land instead, and successfully landed after the 4th attempt.\n\nwill change the design now"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T03:15:49Z","Content":"PS I don\u0027t really agree with those curves. If you\u0027re going to do the \u0022level off then climb\u0022 profile, level off and gain your speed lower in the atmosphere.. certainly below 15km. That gives you more time to pitch up at a lower rate (thereby not bleeding off as much speed) and really pull not just your nose but your actual flight path up, giving you a higher, further Ap that maximizes your ability to just burn straight prograde to push that Ap up out of the atmosphere and minimize steering losses while burning that expensive rocket fuel.\n\nThere\u0027s no one-size-fits-all flight profile though. It\u0027s a matter of thinking about what you\u0027re trying to achieve through each step. Climb to altitude, accelerate to maximum speed, turn your orbit, raise your Ap, then circularize... all with a minimum of fuel use. While adding more engines means more weight and burning fuel faster, it also means you accelerate faster and can progress through those stages faster, losing less dV to drag in the process. There are an awful lot of variables and it is a relatively complex task.. much moreso than the alpha releases."},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T04:21:13Z","Content":"Oh..

For reference: if that\u0027s happening you should hear the flameout sound and your craft will start to yaw to one side. That\u0027ll likely be followed by more flameouts and an uncontrollable flat spin, spinning one side to the other as your intakes turn \u0027off axis\u0027 and get less air incoming and more engines cut out.\n\nFrom the looks of it though, you\u0027ve got a ram intake per engine there, so that really shouldn\u0027t be a problem.\n\nIt could also be CoM shifting behind CoL with fuel use. Less of a danger now with even fuel drain, but if it\u0027s relying on a full tank up front to balance the engine weight, that\u0027ll cause \u0022sudden mid-flight dramas.\u0022 The craft there looks basically ok, but there *is* a lot of weight along the back there, and those Mk3 lifting bodies themselves generate a fair chunk of lift.\n\nTo check: Turn on the CoM and CoL indicators (yellow ball and blue arrows respectively) in the SPH. The blue one needs to be (and if you can get airborne, likely is) behind the yellow. Go through fuel tank by fuel tank, right click, and empty all the fuel out of them. You\u0027ll see the yellow indicator shift around as you do. If that moves behind the blue indicator, you\u0027re going to have trouble.\n\nIf you\u0027re flying with SAS or mechjeb, keep an eye on your \u0027control indicators\u0027 in the lower left corner. They reflect your \u0022stick position\u0022 so to speak.. If you have a problem with a shifting lift/mass balance, what you\u0027ll see is the pitch indicator slowly creeping right out to the very end of the indicator, as the autopilot has to apply more and more \u0027stick forward\u0027 to maintain its heading. Once it actually *reaches* the end, the system will no longer be able to hold that orientation and your nose will start lifting uncontrollably.
