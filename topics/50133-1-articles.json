The science points are a great new addition but there are issues with the way they\u0027re handled so you can sit and resend data from one spot without returning your kerbals. Also, there are no specific science missions - I had to figure out that different locations reward additional points but there is no way to look at the map and see the different locations or chart whether or not you\u0027ve been there other than planting a flag. (Sorry for probe landers). Specific commercial missions will be great - really looking forward to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zamaszysty","CreatedById":63306,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T11:32:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou already have this kind of progression system that has a form of \u0022missions\u0022, but it\u0027s not made in a dumbed down way of quests that say simply \u0022do a surface sample of the Mun\u0022.

I think there is a lot of space for STORY mode that would do that.

In every other case having these missions would ruin the very best thing about KSP, and that is freedom.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MGyver","CreatedById":74116,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T14:27:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Force21\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Force21\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou can already see the prices of each part, they display ranged from around the $1000s and are in grey lettering visible in the research building with I think cc after the number.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I noticed that while playing after I started this thread.
