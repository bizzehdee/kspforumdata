Then when I tried dropping the seat in open space, intending to pick it up again in the hopes of \u0022resetting\u0022 whatever was going wrong, the dropped part was instantly at rest relative to the Mun\u0027s surface (and thus dropped out of orbit and was destroyed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an experiment, I then went over to my Minmus-orbiting station and had a Kerbal go outside to rearrange some docking struts. I got the exact same behavior - every surface behaved as if it was out of range, and then when he tried dropping the docking strut anchor in open space it instantly came to a halt relative to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately KAS still seems to work correctly for Kerbals who are down on my surface Munbase. It just seems to be those in orbit that can\u0027t attach things properly.

Perhaps the mod is somehow treating things in orbit as if they\u0027re on the surface?

My Kerbal was able to detach the port and reattach it to the Mk 1 command pod correctly. I then sent the ship to orbit the Mun instead, and when my Kerbal went on EVA he was able to detach the port but not attach it to anything. I did the trick where you switch to the tracking center and then back to the EVAed Kerbal again to \u0022reset\u0022 the KAS system (this is another known glitch the current version of KAS has in 0.21), and that allowed me to *attempt* to attach the port.
