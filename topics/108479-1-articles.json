As such, it only works for science and career mode.\u003Cp\u003EThis is not a tech tree overhaul, although the tech tree could certainly use one. This simply rearranges a few parts between nodes for players who typically use the stock tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not guarantee it will work with your saves. Different parts are moved to different tech nodes, so you may or may not lose some parts you had or gain some you didn\u0027t. I also can not promise this will work with other mods that modify the tech tree and/or what parts go to what nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod\u0027s sole dependency is Module Manager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo install, put the \u0022TTT\u0022 folder in GameData to install the mod. To uninstall, delete it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChangelog:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[Version 1.0]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The order of acquiring the 1.25m fuel tanks has been reversed - the LV-T30 is paired with the 800 tank, the T-45 with the 400, the 909 with the 200, and the 100 with the 0.625m probe engines alongside the Oscar-B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeavy Rocketry and Heavier Rocketry both gained 2.5m fuel tanks to make their engines useful. The former got the X32 tank and the latter now gets the Jumbo 64.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1.25m bi-, tri- and quad-couplers are all in the same node now. I get that Squad wants a sense of progression, but there comes a point where it\u0027s just ridiculous, especially being able to make tri-couplers before bi-couplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MK1 Jet Fuel Tank has been moved to Aviation alongside the jet engine, since without Modular Fuel Tanks you\u0027d have to stupidly use half-empty rocket tanks because reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MK1 cockpit has also been moved to Aviation, since it makes no sense to get a plane cockpit before you get plane parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou now get the Cube probe core before the Octo and the Octo has moved forward a tech node. Why? Because the Stayputnik is useless and the Cube comes way too late to be of any real use. It bridges the gap nicely, too - it can use SAS but it does not contain a reaction wheel while the Octo does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed ladders and the smaller steel I-beam have been moved to the start node. I mean, really, Kerbals can make girders but not ladders and i-beams? Come on. The extendible ladders have also been moved a tech node up. The triple length girder has also been moved to advanced construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LT-1 landing strut and the LT-05 landing struts have been swapped in the tech tree since the LT-05 is nigh useless for manned missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairings have all been moved up a single tech node, with the 1.25m becoming available with aviation. This puts them more in-line with the arguably better Procedural Fairings in terms of balance if you use that mod, but more importantly gives you what is a very basic and fairly essential part at a more useful time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe girder adapter is now under General Construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeparatrons are now available from the beginning, since their only real purpose in career is to separate spent stages, and they otherwise come in pretty late for such a simple use. This is ignoring that somehow a smaller SRB about the size of a model rocket engine is harder to engineer than the NASA SRB that\u0027s taller than most of your early game rockets in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Elevon 5,\u0022 the angled elevon, has been moved to Aviation on the basis that getting swept wings with straight elevons makes no sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sole dependency is Module Manager.
