One way to do this is to use a proton beam and generate neutrons via spallation in the pellet - of course you might need high energy proton beams. The question is whether or not that can be maintained for long enough. Perhaps we can treat it as a fusion boosted fission system, using an amount of fusion fuel in the pellet to increase the neutron flux even further. Or perhaps use even more proton particle beams at the right moment. Or alternately we can configure the system to act as a breeder reactor though such a system would be difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems to be a more workable concept than fusion, at least in the near term.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-03T04:25:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2020 04:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Bill Phil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SOXBLOX","CreatedById":204106,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-03T06:47:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep, I just realized that after I posted. Grabbing some numbers off Wikipedia, I did some math to find the density required to bring a 1 g sphere of pure U235 to criticality. Here goes...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, critical mass and the square of the density are inversely proportional. We need the proportionality constant between these values. (Remember, inverse proportionality says that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ea \u00D7 b = k\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0where k is the constant.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo room temp. density x critical mass in a sphere at room temp. is\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nk =((19.1 g/cm^3)^2) \u00D7 52000 g\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nk = 18 970 120 g^2/cm^3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow we can set the critical mass equal to one gram and determine the square of the requisite density.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nk= 18 970 120 = p^2 \u00D7 1 g\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 and solving for \u003Ci\u003Ep...\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe required density is ~4355 g/cm^3 .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can then go on to calculate, using the bulk modulus, the force required to compress the U235 to this density. Through more calculations and modeling, we can find the compression generated by ablation from arbitrarily large laser banks, to find the laser energy needed to compress this metal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, this is for a sample of pure U235. I would expect civilian-grade fuel to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enot\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ebe weapons-grade, though.

Here goes...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, critical mass and the square of the density are inversely proportional. We need the proportionality constant between these values.

They then used the world\u2019s first petawatt (10^15 W) laser to blast the gold with a 0.5 ps,260 J pulse of infrared light\u2013packing more than [10^20] W/cm2\u2013which accelerated plasma electrons to energies of tens of MeV. The \u201Cquivering\u201D of these electrons created gamma rays known as Bremsstrahlung radiation that liberated high-energy neutrons from gold and copper nuclei. These neutrons split uranium-238 nuclei and caused other nuclear reactions. With two strategically placed detectors, Cowan and his colleagues monitored the energies of electrons escaping the plasma during the laser pulse.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother team used tantalum instead of gold.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the laser pulse seemed to be very low energy at that - though I don\u0027t know how much energy the fission actually released. If the fission yield could be made considerable then it could be doable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd another option is to use uranium-238 as a kind of tamper-pusher. Essentially we put a shell of U-238 around the fusion fuel. Then the tamper compresses the fusion fuel after its bombarded by lasers and the fusion releases fast neutrons which then cause fission in the U-238. So a thermonuclear micro-explosion reactor. Might be better to use cylindrical pellets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-03T11:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConfinement plays a very different role in fusion and fission. In fusion, you have to have high density and high temperature to get the process going. In fission, increase in temperature actually slows down the reaction, and the only purpose of increasing density is preventing neutrons from flying out of the fuel without contributing to reaction. There isn\u0027t actually a need for proximity between nuclei. Because of that, there are limits to how much you can decrease critical mass by compressing the fuel. And that\u0027s basically where all of this breaks down. You can take a fuel \u0022pellet\u0022 that\u0027s significant fraction of critical mass of uranium and get it to split. Congratulations, you just invented a nuke. You cant go much smaller, because there is no amount of pressure that will get it to critical.\u00A0Alternatively, you can try and look for fuels that will make explosions small enough that\u00A0you can harness this energy inside a power plant. So something with critical mass in milligram ranges or less.\u00A0Now we\u0027re talking about isotopes that have a very short half life and that you can\u0027t practically store, because even at decent spacing, placing enough of them to power a plant in one place is likely going to make the whole store critical. If you somehow manage to avoid that, the background radiation is still going to be quite significant. And all these isotopes will have to be manufactured by some other process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere have been proposals for making a big cave, dropping in a nuke every once in a while, and using\u00A0heat of the walls to drive turbines.

I might be entirely wrong about this, but such a setup could bring about more efficient compression of the fusion fuel and perhaps better confinement as well.

In fusion, you have to have high density and high temperature to get the process going. In fission, increase in temperature actually slows down the reaction, and the only purpose of increasing density is preventing neutrons from flying out of the fuel without contributing to reaction. There isn\u0027t actually a need for proximity between nuclei. Because of that, there are limits to how much you can decrease critical mass by compressing the fuel. And that\u0027s basically where all of this breaks down. You can take a fuel \u0022pellet\u0022 that\u0027s significant fraction of critical mass of uranium and get it to split. Congratulations, you just invented a nuke. You cant go much smaller, because there is no amount of pressure that will get it to critical.\u00A0Alternatively, you can try and look for fuels that will make explosions small enough that\u00A0you can harness this energy inside a power plant. So something with critical mass in milligram ranges or less.\u00A0Now we\u0027re talking about isotopes that have a very short half life and that you can\u0027t practically store, because even at decent spacing, placing enough of them to power a plant in one place is likely going to make the whole store critical.

Curium-245 was chosen but other fissile isotopes were possible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis implies that it is possible to compress masses of tens of grams to critical mass density.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf 40 grams of Plutonium-239 is the target, then it would have a volume of 0.002 cubic centimeters (assuming a density of 19.86 kg/cm^3, though different allotropes have different densities, and a hollow space would be required for the DT - which acts as a neutron source and potentially a fusion boost). Less compression would be required to reach criticality than would be required for DT targets to reach fusion conditions. Larger target masses would require even less compression. There is likely an optimal mass that would be possible with current drivers, considering that the fissile target will be much less compressible than the fusion target. However new facilities would likely be required, but no advances in driver power may be required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis setup, if possible, would still have advantages over IC fusion systems:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the target masses are much larger more energy will be released per shot, and fairly large burnup rates can be possible if boosting is used. The yield per shot would likely be in the hundreds of gigajoules - the reactor must be able to survive large numbers of consecutive shots. The rate at which the reactor operates will determine the power output - at 100 GJ per shot a 1 GWth reactor would only need a shot every 100 seconds, assuming all or the vast majority of the energy ends up as thermal energy. However a shot every 100 seconds is likely easier to accomplish than 10 shots per second, as IC fusion might require - assuming 100 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E per fusion shot. Of course larger fusion targets are possible as well but those would require much more powerful drivers, as I understand it. An IC fission reactor may not need drivers that are much more powerful than already existing drivers. I\u0027m not sure about the numbers though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would also have advantages over conventional fission reactors, which I outlined in the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne disadvantage would be that using nearly pure fissile material as the fuel could make nuclear proliferation a much larger issue. However, surrounding the fissile material with other dense materials which could act as a \u0022pusher\u0022, or just a shell of decent mass, can reduce this risk. This shell can be a dense material with a higher melting point than the Plutonium, so that melting fuel pellets - if some party were to obtain them - would give said party an impure mixture of molten material. So the fuel pellets can be engineered so that they are not easy sources of fissile material.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are technical challenges, but they appear surmountable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I can find Plutonium is more compressible than Aluminum, and much more compressible than steel. Obviously that varies with its conditions and allotropes, but I think it\u0027s compressible enough that a 40 gram target could be made to undergo fission, though I\u0027m not sure about the amount of energy necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n40 grams of Plutonium-239 would actually release around 800 GJ at a 25% burnup rate. So to get 1 GWth a reactor would only need to fire a shot every 800 seconds. Only 108 in a day. That\u0027s around 4.32 kilograms. To keep a reactor fueled for a period of six months each reactor would need 777.6 kg of fissile material. However this would be stored in discrete pellets with other elements in their makeup. They could also be stored in extremely secure storage containers, each one containing perhaps around a day\u0027s worth of fuel. Storage in a highly secure area with automated delivery to the reactor so that as few people as possible are involved in fuel handling would be preferred.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I believe it is possible, and perhaps more achievable than IC fusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr perhaps a Z-Pinch could be used to compress the fuel? As in Mini-Mag Orion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may be possible to capture the waste and separate out the fission products - some percentage of the remaining mass could be usable fuel. Perhaps as much as half or even more. This could be directly sorted on-site using a mass spectrometer, where the actual waste could then be dealt with. Though if such a system is too energy intensive or too difficult to create on the desired scale a dedicated facility could be preferred. Breeding Pu-239 from natural Uranium may be possible (and perhaps more effectively than in a breeder reactor) using neutron spallation from particle accelerators - if the neutron economy in the IC fission concept can\u0027t be made to reliably reproduce its fuel supply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
