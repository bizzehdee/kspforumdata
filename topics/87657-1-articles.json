I\u0027d like to hear your thoughts on it. The only stumbling block I can think of is making it so that a particular Kerbal cannot pilot a craft. Maybe something new in the persistant.cfg file?

Although, personally I would scale down the contracts to be slightly less specific on who you take. For instance, your first general idea bullet point; instead of \u0022Deliver (insert name)...\u0022, I would like to see \u0022Send a piloted craft, able to transport 15 kerbals, into an orbit around Kerbin and return safely\u0022. Then have contract specifics, such as; Min/Max Apa, minimum number of complete orbits, etc. Mainly because I think it could get buggy, with said contract demanding \u0022Kerbal A\u0022 who you just happen to have stationed somewhere around Jool for example. The specifics can come in the flavor text with stuff like \u0022Eccentric millionaire Moneybags Kerbin has decided he wants to take himself and a group of his corporate fellows on a public relations trip...\u0022. Otherwise, the rest all sounds pretty cool, something I would try for sure, and would make a good addition to the already outstanding MC and Fine Print mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lemures3","CreatedById":126263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T20:57:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GeoPhizzix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GeoPhizzix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...with said contract demanding \u0022Kerbal A\u0022 who you just happen to have stationed somewhere around Jool for example.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be clear, accepting the contract would ADD a new Kerbal to your crew roster, and it would never select member of your crew, to avoid exactly that.
