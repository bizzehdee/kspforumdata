Infinite fuel isn\u0027t going to allow him to make the plane change in one pass, as the thrust will be, at best, the same as if he had not used infinite fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T22:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EInfinite fuel isn\u0027t going to change the amount of thrust your ion drive puts out.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ENo, but it will let me use the lander\u0027s chemical rocket....\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tank Buddy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tank Buddy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is no such thing as cheating in a non-competitive single player game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people (myself included) don\u0027t like \u0022cheats\u0022.
