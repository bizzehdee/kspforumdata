I think part of the problem is that KSP rockets look OK in the editor when you snap them together, so people think they will work just like they look. But real rockets have a lot of strutting that is built in to their structure. That is not something that is obvious until you try to build rockets yourself. Then when your rocket fails, the game doesn\u0027t give you a lot of information or help about what to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went through this same process when I picked up the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://thehuwaldtfamily.org/jtrl/vehicle_data/Launch%20Vehicles%20and%20Missiles/NASA/Saturn%20V/images/Saturn-V-Configuration%20Drawing.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EReal rockets do not have struts inside the tanks.\u003C/a\u003E The tanks are just made out of something stronger than aluminum foil, and are attached to things with more than a bit of rubber cement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote the ribbing is not a support structure, it is a baffle to help combat \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slosh_dynamics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eslosh\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://heroicrelics.org/info/s-ic/s-ic-major-components/s-ic-major-components-med.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s another drawing\u003C/a\u003E, this one\u0027s not the whole craft but shows the makeup of the first stage tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-03T19:56:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2014 07:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by draeath\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kzauner","CreatedById":83769,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T19:59:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022agentKmurph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022agentKmurph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWow 50% larger by mass than a Saturn V according to the MechJeb readout.

Making the joints stronger could lead to making whacky machines that are totally outside the realm of of even distended plausibility and sap the fun out of the challenge of building a successful craft, but I think that only begins to happen when the joints become nigh unbreakable. An decent but not gratuitous increase to their current strength would greatly alleviate some of the most frustrating aspects of this game, like the infamous orbital wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we are limited to only attaching at a single point, you need to add struts to bind those three tanks at the bottom together.
