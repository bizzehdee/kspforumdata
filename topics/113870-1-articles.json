You can store and handle it super-conveniently at all sorts of temperatures, it comes into the engine as single atoms, and because of the sheer number of electrons it carries, stealing one in order to ionize it requires very little energy. And then, the heavy atom gives a (relatively) big \u0027push\u0027 when it is accelerated out the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese advantages, combined with the fact that you need only very small amounts because ion drives are so efficient, outweighs the disadvantage of high price in many cases.

That seemed reasonable to me, because I assumed it would always be desirable to maximize Isp. And if you\u0027re keeping the voltage tuned for optimal Isp, then it may be technically correct, but nevertheless seems odd to say that you\u0027re adjusting the electrical level to throttle the engine. Thus, my initial question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reply, Beabop confirmed that Isp depends on the grid voltage, but also explained that ion engines intentionally trade off Isp for thrust. Therefore, there are two aspects to engine performance -- thrust and Isp -- and it makes sense that there must be two inputs -- feed rate and voltage -- to control the performance. It no longer seems odd to say that the electrical level can be adjusted to throttle the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-TC\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy12","CreatedById":103022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T15:35:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you need either nobel gas?
