I mean, you can complete the default \u0022explore duna\u0022 contract with one probe mission. For me, I like to have reasons to go back or to do more than one mission type to a destination - but in stock career, there are often no rewards for doing so (already got the science the first time, no appropriate contract available - and I hate the \u0022test skipper engine flying at laythe\u0022 missions) and it just ends up bankrupting your space program. So the contracts here are aimed to fill some of that void. With that in mind, the station contract chain I\u0027m working on is aimed at motivating/rewarding starting off with a small salyut type station and eventually building up to a Mir/ISS style station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe update after the space station stuff will focus on more repeatable missions for planetary flybys, \u0022grand tour\u0022 style probe missions, \u0022visit 2 planets in one mission\u0022 type stuff, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh is this contract set compatible with other contract sets ?
