Hmm. I\u0027ll have to experiment. My Linux Mint install is totally goofed up right now because Cinammon is crashing for no reason (on both of my computers no less) so I can\u0027t test Linux as easily right now. But I don\u0027t see why that would be the cause of this. I definitely saw it not removing the vessel on launch and then definitely did in the code that #13 is built on.

What it does is takes the current vessel and puts it right back into the \u0022warehouse\u0022 (after a short recovery delay). You can then edit it to refill the tanks and replace any missing/broken parts. It\u0027s mostly useful for planes since you avoid having to rebuild it with new parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s an error prone process since it takes a Vessel that\u0027s had all sorts of things happen to it, and tries to turn it back into a craft file that you can load in the editor. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn\u0027t. Since 1.2 it\u0027s decided it wants to completely crash the game with no errors, but only sometimes and without warning. It\u0027s a feature I added after a lot of requests for it, but it\u0027s always been a giant pain. If/when KCT gets rewritten I might try to avoid it entirely by putting more value into the part inventory (such as making vessels that are 100% from the inventory take really small amounts of time instead of \u0022mostly small\u0022 amounts).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-07T19:14:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a heads up.

I spent some time this weekend trying to get a few more core features into ScrapYard, focusing on the part tracker and coming up with a way for other mods to use the inventory without a hard dependency on ScrapYard. With regards to the part tracker, there are three of them that all appear to be working. The \u0022Individual Part Tracker\u0022 uses a Module that\u0027s applied to all parts to uniquely track them from the time they\u0027re placed into the editor to the time they\u0027re recovered. It also tracks how many times that exact part has been recovered, which is persistent across builds. In other words, you can recover a part and then use that exact part in another build and each time it\u0027s recovered that will be tracked within the part. The other two part trackers fall under the collective name of the \u0022\u003Cem\u003ELike\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Part Tracker\u0022, which doesn\u0027t track things on an individual scale but instead just by name (so two very different shaped procedural parts would count as one thing in the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ELike\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Tracker). That tracker tracks the total number of uses of a part (if you use 9 of the same engine in a build then that counts as 9 uses) and the total number of builds using that part (that same 9 engine build would count as 1 build, but building it twice means 2 builds and 18 uses).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the API, I\u0027ve got a very initial, untested (but theoretically sound), build of KCT locally that is set up to use ScrapYard. There are a few hangups that I\u0027ll need to come up with a way to address. Scrapping doesn\u0027t work yet (just need to add a few more methods to the API, but that should be easy) and editing vessels wouldn\u0027t work right either. Once I track down those situations and double check that all the places that would use the inventory now are using ScrapYard, I\u0027ll release an \u003Cstrong\u003EAlpha\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0build with\u00A0that. I say Alpha and not Beta because ScrapYard might still have some breaking changes on its way with regards to how modules are stored (storing only limited info instead of an entire module) and with how parts are pulled out of the inventory (happening while building instead of at build time). The good news is that if you don\u0027t want to play with the potentially breaking ScrapYard changes, that\u0027s fine since KCT won\u0027t depend on it at all and you don\u0027t need to install it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, progress is going well and I\u0027m pretty on track with the schedule outlined in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://trello.com/b/SDnjLzmI/scrapyard\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScrapYard Trello\u003C/a\u003E.

I spent some time this weekend trying to get a few more core features into ScrapYard, focusing on the part tracker and coming up with a way for other mods to use the inventory without a hard dependency on ScrapYard. With regards to the part tracker, there are three of them that all appear to be working. The \u0022Individual Part Tracker\u0022 uses a Module that\u0027s applied to all parts to uniquely track them from the time they\u0027re placed into the editor to the time they\u0027re recovered. It also tracks how many times that exact part has been recovered, which is persistent across builds. In other words, you can recover a part and then use that exact part in another build and each time it\u0027s recovered that will be tracked within the part. The other two part trackers fall under the collective name of the \u0022\u003Cem\u003ELike\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Part Tracker\u0022, which doesn\u0027t track things on an individual scale but instead just by name (so two very different shaped procedural parts would count as one thing in the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ELike\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Tracker). That tracker tracks the total number of uses of a part (if you use 9 of the same engine in a build then that counts as 9 uses) and the total number of builds using that part (that same 9 engine build would count as 1 build, but building it twice means 2 builds and 18 uses).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the API, I\u0027ve got a very initial, untested (but theoretically sound), build of KCT locally that is set up to use ScrapYard. There are a few hangups that I\u0027ll need to come up with a way to address. Scrapping doesn\u0027t work yet (just need to add a few more methods to the API, but that should be easy) and editing vessels wouldn\u0027t work right either. Once I track down those situations and double check that all the places that would use the inventory now are using ScrapYard, I\u0027ll release an \u003Cstrong\u003EAlpha\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0build with\u00A0that. I say Alpha and not Beta because ScrapYard might still have some breaking changes on its way with regards to how modules are stored (storing only limited info instead of an entire module) and with how parts are pulled out of the inventory (happening while building instead of at build time). The good news is that if you don\u0027t want to play with the potentially breaking ScrapYard changes, that\u0027s fine since KCT won\u0027t depend on it at all and you don\u0027t need to install it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, progress is going well and I\u0027m pretty on track with the schedule outlined in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://trello.com/b/SDnjLzmI/scrapyard\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScrapYard Trello\u003C/a\u003E. I hope to have an Alpha level release of KCT \u002B ScrapYard \u00A0in the next week. Beta level release is still scheduled for May 1. I haven\u0027t followed KSP 1.3\u0027s progress that closely so that might shift plans a bit (in case you are wondering, KCT will not support other languages.

If you wait until release that shouldn\u0027t be an issue and you can drop it into an existing save without any problems. Note that the inventory being broken between builds isn\u0027t necessarily save breaking since you can safely delete all that data from the save file manually if need be.
