You need about 12,000 m/s delta V to get to orbit from sea level, but only around 7,500 to make it from the tallest mountain. (For comparison, you need about 4,500 to get into orbit from kerbin.)\u003Cp\u003EBasically, asparagus it all to hell, use aerospikes, and keep the payload as light as possible. One trick that many people use is instead of sending down a whole command pod, just send down a single kerbal on a chair, sitting on top of the smallest probe core. For my eve lander, the final stage was just the second smallest 1.25m tank and a rockomax 48-7s, with some batteries, a probe core, couple solar panels, and a kerbal. It was god for about 4,000 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Traches\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Traches\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/577876279766665628/0E987822F6CB45BB16C7A685C56D56C8D36CA5A9/\u0022 alt=\u00220E987822F6CB45BB16C7A685C56D56C8D36CA5A9\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what my lander looked like; managed to land it with completely full tanks at a good altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/577876279766692937/A177737658AE0B88AD045B4B240042D8969355DC/\u0022 alt=\u0022A177737658AE0B88AD045B4B240042D8969355DC\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s the last stage that I was talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lumpman2","CreatedById":77718,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T00:14:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I\u0027ll try using aerospikes for most of the engines except for the last - but I don\u0027t have time to test right now since KSP wouldn\u0027t really agree with uploading a video at the same time AND skype.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T00:20:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60331-Eve-Misison-Report-Live-update-with-persistent-file-along-the-way\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60331-Eve-Misison-Report-Live-update-with-persistent-file-along-the-way\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideo and save file available for your testing purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T00:48:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI only just completed this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60438-Return-mission-from-Eve-GROUND-LEVEL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60438-Return-mission-from-Eve-GROUND-LEVEL\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou seem to have a make a choice.
