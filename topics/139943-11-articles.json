None of those interplanetary vessels ever arrived; I think they got deleted when I later opened that old save without the KER\u00A0chip part.

Having finite time to play, I picked Jool for its variety; an initial mission did several landings, and then a follow-up flotilla colonized Laythe shortly before 1.0.

You don\u0027t wonder about driving your trains on Duna with its low gravity? Driving on Tylo with its lack of an atmosphere and the massive Jool hanging overhead (depending where you drive), doesn\u0027t sound fun? The challenge of getting train components to space, landing them, and connecting them on another world doesn\u0027t sound fun? I\u0027m doing a fair amount of designing rovers and cargoplanes to transport them (capable of loading and unloading 2.5m diameter cargos from the mk3 bay)... doing a lot of testing on Kerbin, but with the intent of hurling them into deep space for use on laythe (so I can set up a habitat, ISRU operation, research lab, amphibious science rovers in any location I want, and transport them from one island to another by airlift). Sure... once there it will almost be like operating on Kerbin, but the fun of doing it in an \u0022alien\u0022 setting, with the constraints of making them able to operate far from home is fun to me.... If something was forgotten, or needs to be replaced... it will be a loooonnngggg time until something can be sent from kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Considering that the radius of Kerbin is 600 km, then its circumference is 2*pi*600km = 3770 km... more or less. There are roughly 72 degrees of longitude between KSC and KSC2. 72/360 * 3770 = 754 km ... and thats the straight line distance, ignoring the difference in lattitude as well. Unless your trains are amphibious.... its a heck of a lot longer than 150km between KSC and KSC2/the inland KSC... so how have you never been more than 150km outside KSC?
