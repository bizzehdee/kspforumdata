Until I purchased breaking ground. I have since lost all my game saves due to the files getting corrupted by the CONSTANT game crashes and blue screens. Twice in fact, I put the first one down to the age of my saves and how many updates they\u0027ve been through, however, having rebuilt from the ground up, the crashes continue and the kraken has taken that save as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want to abandon the game, before breaking ground...

But loading \u0022old\u0022 savefiles should not (and does not on my Linux installation) cause actual problems. The only intentional issue is that old savefiles don\u0027t have the BG surface features enabled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlue screens on a PS4 sound to me more like a problem with the hardware or due to corrupted files (either from the PS4 \u0022OS\u0022 or from KSP itself).
