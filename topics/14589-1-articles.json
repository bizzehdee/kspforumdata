All are LV-T30 with 4 fuel tanks. I did not use radial decouplers, as that would mean the centre rocket wouldn\\\u0027t fire til the other 4 detatched. Problem is, the game apparantly thinks the fuel tanks for one of the strap-on motors is supposed to go to the centre...meaning it looks fine in shop, but once on pad, one of the outer rockets will not be \u0027connected\u0027 and thus won\\\u0027t fire, and so be left behind when it lifts off and flips over immediately after.
