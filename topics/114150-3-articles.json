As expected I had my entire 0.9 fleet obsolete and had to re-design them (they weren\u0027t air hogging or aerodynamically draggy) due to the changes to engine ISP, engine weight changes, reduce wing count, and to account for the fact that tubular tanks now contribute to lift. I also changed my ascent profile accordingly to a steep one to avoid overheating.\u003Cp\u003ECome 1.01, 1.02, SQUAD changed the aerodynamics again with new drag values and re-entry heat. My ships had to go through another round of re-designs from scratch (to remove further wings) and my ascent profile had to change to a radically different one with a shallower climb. While you may regard as the aero changes as small, they do impart very large changes to ship design and ascent profiles. I\u0027m mainly a SSTO builder so these changes are very noticeable in crafts that operate within very narrow margins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowing that the aerodynamics is still incomplete and not in it\u0027s final form, I have heard that 1.03 may have yet another aero tweak again. If not in 1.03 it\u0027s a definite certainty that the aero will still change somewhere down the line later, and that always means that I will have to put my career mode on hold halfway to fiddle around in sandbox mode trying to get things to work from the drawing board again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s not addressed to me, but I think you might underestimate how much time some players like myself spend trying to master the new aerodynamics only to realize that this becomes pointless in an aero model that is still subject to changes every few months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122688-Something-doesn-t-seem-right-here?p=1965188\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1965188\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122688-Something-doesn-t-seem-right-here?p=1965188\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1965188\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122688-Something-doesn-t-seem-right-here?p=1978057\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1978057\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122688-Something-doesn-t-seem-right-here?p=1978057\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1978057\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122574-Radial-mounted-parts-on-atmospheric-flight-performance\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122574-Radial-mounted-parts-on-atmospheric-flight-performance\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T12:54:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 12:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Levelord\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T12:51:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see everything from 0.9 on as steps in the wrong direction.

There are too many bugs released that make me wonder how in the world did they let those slip by into the release if they had been properly play testing their own game? The temperature gauge memory leak (1.0.2) should have been detected easily through edge case testing numerous overheating parts at the same time, the launch clamp bug (1.0.2, fixed?) should have been noticed at some point if they had been doing numerous launches, the heat shield problem with 1.0.2 -\u0026gt; 1.0.3 saves should have been discovered if they had been testing 1.0.2 saves on 1.0.3, and the exception spam with the parachutes in the VAB in 1.0.4 (not sure if present in 1.0.3) should have been detected as soon as they started testing building crafts in the VAB (not familiar with actual Unity development, but shouldn\u0027t there be some debug tool that easily alerts you to uncaught exceptions while playing the game during development? Although I\u0027m not a game developer, but if I\u0027m programming something, I certainly know when uncaught exceptions occur during my development/testing). In addition to the bugs, the constant back-and-forth balancing of game mechanics (e.g. new heating and aero) that should have been tested in alpha/beta is very off-putting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand Squad is a small team and do not have the resources and manpower that these large AAA game companies have, especially with a game as complex as KSP. But something needs to be done. KSP is no longer an early-access game and they cannot be expected to allow these obvious game breaking / annoying bugs and balancing issues through into what most people expect to be a, more or less, finished product; I say \u0022finished\u0022 loosely because new features/improvements are certainly welcome, but if they were to just stop KSP development for whatever reason minus minor bug fixes, the game should be able to stand on its own at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest solution would be to give all players (not a selective group such as modders and youtubers) a chance to publicly test a release candidate before proper release. This will effectively increase the testing manpower many-fold, allow Squad to polish the release, and not have to go through this constant mess of having multiple releases in such a small amount of time. Public tests work for other games such as WoW (PTRs) and Minecraft (snapshots).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T15:50:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 03:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stevehead\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T16:01:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the Reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Su6UxX-OohE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T16:07:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi all\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have voted the Game is complete, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ei\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003En my personal opinion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E its on the same level like other highend PC products, aka ARMA series, Flight Simulator X, Morrowind, ... its different and a class of its own, i think it has done PC game history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESQUAD are AWESOME.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreetings\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foxkill2342","CreatedById":120834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T16:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool bug.
