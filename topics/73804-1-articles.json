I want to launch large Kethane tanks into orbit with a massive kick and a tiny circularization, where they will be intercepted by an orbital refinery. Today, I got around to doing something about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the repository in GitHub: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/pdwryst/KSPMassDriver\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/pdwryst/KSPMassDriver\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a recent copy for directly downloading: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0a7PNLYAdzQYThma05fWnd3NnM/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0a7PNLYAdzQYThma05fWnd3NnM/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllow me to paint a picture. Imagine a mass driver on the mun. It\u0027s a pair of long, thin, delicate rails attached to a massive capacitor and control system. Nearby sits a reactor and an electrical generator from interstellar, an attachment system cable snaking between them, providing megawatts of power. The driver itself sits on a rotating platform and a hinge from infernal robotics, so that it can be pointed in any direction. All of that is on a wide, stable base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext to the mass driver is a utility crane with the kerbal attachment system. I keep thinking of the dockyard cranes that pick up containers off the beds of trucks and drive them around the yard. This crane is tall, wide, and on wheels. It picks up a newly-filled Kethane tank with a docking port, some RCS, and a probe body on the bottom. Wheeling it over to the mass driver, which has been pointed vertically at the sky, it\u0027s delicately maneuvered into position over the base of the driver, at which point the docking ports pull themselves together and lock the payload into place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crane wheels away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the silence of space the platform rotates to point due east, and the rails begin tilting down toward the horizon, coming to rest at just three or four degrees, barely enough to miss the rim of the nearby crater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVVVvvvvp! AWAY THE TANK IS HURLED! A new orbit, Ap 143,236, Pe 5, on its way to circularization and orbital processing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that sounds totally awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also set up a very powerful one to fire retrograde along the mun\u0027s orbital trajectory, returning a package from the mun to the surface of kerbin without any propellants! Sweet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcited? Good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpinionated? Awesome! Let me know what you think!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how I\u0027ve been thinking about the mass driver parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Large enough to be difficult to get to the mun, but not so large that they aren\u0027t built into the environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Realistic power consumption and dynamics. Consumes the megajoules resource from the interstellar mod, and produces a decent amount of waste heat on firing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Reloadable. The point of contact with the payload should be a docking port, so that a payload can be loaded into the driver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Space-constrained. A mass driver is essentially two long conductive rods between which the payload rests. When activated, the mass driver arcs current through the entire assembly, creating acceleration with the magnetic field. It should be a challenge to fit a payload in between those rods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* 1.5m, 2.75m, and 4m parts, to snugly fit 1.25m, 2.5m, and 3.75m vessels between the rails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* More advanced parts unlocked through the tech tree, including graphene capacitors and plasma rails (animations for this would be kick-ass) for higher energy discharges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I have written the plugin code that will consume electric charge and kick an attached part with a large force based on some of the physical properties of the mass driver, specifically the length of and distance between the rails, the diameter of the rails, and the conductivity of the rails material. The conductivity of the rails is affected by the rails\u0027 temperature, so you would be advantaged by waiting for night time, and you would need to wait some time for the rails to cool down enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGive it a try, let me know what you think!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need help with textures for the models that lo-fi has created!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-06T21:24:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2014 09:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PeterDolan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T09:09:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea very much. interstellar integration is cool too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine that mass driver woudl me quite large, how about some on site construction?

Yeah, I was definitely thinking of building only the rails part. You would set up whatever else you need to generate megajoules separately, whether that\u0027s a reactor and generator or a remote power array, I think it makes sense for this project to just supply the kapow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set up a github repository for this (now linked in my original post), so if you\u0027re comfortable with using that then just let me know your github account and I\u0027ll add you to the project. If not, dropping zip files in the thread is totally fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like the collision mesh for your draft part is only around the base -- is that a limitation of the modeling? Would it be possible to make the rails themselves also collide-able, so that it would be a challenge to reload it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at pictures of mass drivers, it\u0027s important that the rails be stabilized against each-other. Basically, there\u0027s a huge force driving forward down the rails, but there\u0027s also some force pushing the rails apart. Some mass drivers have the rails inside a full enclosure -- basically a cannon\u0027s barrel. Others have rings providing structure along the rails. Can we add some structural elements stabilizing the rods?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really dig the awesome jagged bits, they make me think that they\u0027re there to stabilize the payload as it is shot out. Can we remove one of them, so that it gives the part an interesting asymmetry? Then it would make sense to angle it above the horizon with the jagged stabilizing bits \u0022down\u0022 toward the surface, and it would make it easier to reload the driver if you had one open side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!

Yeah, I was definitely thinking of building only the rails part. You would set up whatever else you need to generate megajoules separately, whether that\u0027s a reactor and generator or a remote power array, I think it makes sense for this project to just supply the kapow.\u003Cp\u003EI set up a github repository for this (now linked in my original post), so if you\u0027re comfortable with using that then just let me know your github account and I\u0027ll add you to the project. If not, dropping zip files in the thread is totally fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like the collision mesh for your draft part is only around the base -- is that a limitation of the modeling? Would it be possible to make the rails themselves also collide-able, so that it would be a challenge to reload it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at pictures of mass drivers, it\u0027s important that the rails be stabilized against each-other. Basically, there\u0027s a huge force driving forward down the rails, but there\u0027s also some force pushing the rails apart. Some mass drivers have the rails inside a full enclosure -- basically a cannon\u0027s barrel. Others have rings providing structure along the rails. Can we add some structural elements stabilizing the rods?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really dig the awesome jagged bits, they make me think that they\u0027re there to stabilize the payload as it is shot out. Can we remove one of them, so that it gives the part an interesting asymmetry? Then it would make sense to angle it above the horizon with the jagged stabilizing bits \u0022down\u0022 toward the surface, and it would make it easier to reload the driver if you had one open side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! We\u0027re off to the races!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESweet, glad you like it! I have some ideas for a base, capacitors, batteries etc. I\u0027ll crack on and set a few up. If we can find someone who likes texturing, I\u0027ll get all the UVW-unwrapping ready too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe collision mesh is set up like that deliberately, it\u0027s to do with the way KSP handles them. They have to be convex, so a U shape is a no-no. If you try to make the rails part of the collider, you end up with a massive cheese wedge shape with the space in between the rails part of the collider and wouldn\u0027t be able to dock. However, I can make separate colliders for the rails which will work in game, though we need to be careful the payloads don\u0027t hit them! I wonder if this might not be better handled by scripting a force pushing the payload into the center of the rails, though... would work much better, and actually more realistic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, can remove one of the guides and will join the other to the rails. Some rings might look very cool too, actually. I literally spent an hour or so playing with ideas, so it\u0027s more of a conceptual sketch than a complete model! An asymmetrical design actually makes sense because it gives room to dock stuff into the driver easily. I might add a loading area at the bottom before the rails start too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never used Github, but I ought to. I\u0027ll set up an account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working on a wheel pack at the moment. I\u0027ve pretty much solved the weird issues the stock wheels have, but I want to make the suspension spring rates adjustable in-game for different gravity. I know it\u0027s possible, as it\u0027s just a property of the WheelCollider, but I\u0027m struggling getting my head around Unity scripting. I also have a cunning idea for a levitation platform! If I send you the models and a Unity scene with wheel rigged, could you have a look? Would be brilliant to have it as a tweakable, but a little menu gui or just assigning a couple of keys would be a great start.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T13:34:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmmm.
