Ideally, a procedurally sized shield-like one, but a set of other shapes would come in handy, too.\n\nImagine a body close to Kerbol as Ablate is.\n\n![ablatelw_1.png](http://s12.postimg.org/nbvezu6j1/ablatelw_1.png)\n\nYou\u0027d need a decent solar protection to survive. This opens whole new possibilities for KSP. Solar shield EVA suits for couple of minutes of walking around would also be a nice addon."},{"CreatedByName":"Seeker89","CreatedById":78437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T21:30:22Z","Content":"you could try to modded the Deployable Phased Array Microwave Transceiver from KSP Interstellar Extended to act like a heat shield.
