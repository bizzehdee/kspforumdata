You will in fact need both a 3d modeling program like 3DS Max and also Unity with the KSP Part tools script installed to properly export a .mu model file that KSP will load properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity is in fact a game engine (like Unreal and others) as well as a game development environment. KSP runs on top of a Unity executable. Modders use Unity in a few ways, part makers specifically use its editor along with the KSP Part tools script (made by KSP Developers) to set up a 3d \u0022scene\u0022 containing the models for their part (with textures assigned) as well as animations and vectots that describe certain functions called Transforms. (These can be the direction of thrust, which way a docking port connects, the direction a landing leg points when deployed, and so on.) Once its setup properly they use the script to export the entire constructed scene as one model file and any textures it uses. These files can be loaded by KSP, and with the proper CFG file they\u0027ll be recognized as a part and show up in the part menu in the VAB to be used in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to make a part you\u0027ll need 3 basic things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 3d Modeling program; You know of 3ds Max. Some other choices are: Blender, Wings3d, Sktechup. There are quite a few more, some may produce models supported by Unity and KSP easier than others. Some are free (like Blender) and some cost a lot of money (like 3ds Max)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn image editor to create textures and bumpmaps for your models; Photoshop, Paintshop, gimp (general imagine manipulation program, gimp.org), Paint.net (somewhat like the original Paint for windows but with many more features.) Again, some of these are free (Paint.net, gimp) some cost as much as normal software (Paintshop) and some are again quite expensive (Photoshop)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally unity with the KSP part tools script. The good news is that the normal Unity package is free to most hobbyist and students.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for what is best; impossible to say. They all excel at different things, they have different interfaces and all of them will take some time to learn. You should probably hit up Youtube and watch some videos of them in action, it might help you decide which one to tackle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally use Blender (from blender.org) and Paintshop Pro X14\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T11:10:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 11:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tiberion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nikolay-spb","CreatedById":135182,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T11:43:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETiberion, thanks very much for the informative reply! I saw in this section unity so i thought it is also (i though \u0022light\u0022) modeling tool (besides the engine). 3ds max is very heavy (installation was around 1 hour) and cost is unreal, so i am now on 30 days trial. I see that it is very professional tool, more like commercial, and i need something for learning purposes and beginners, and not very costly or free. Also in KSP graphics is not so important so i will probably download some free tool like blender. But here i dont see any tutorials for blender, only for maya and 3ds max.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
