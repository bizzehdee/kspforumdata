The Mission was to transport 32 Kerbal Plus 1 Kerbal Pilot to Minmus for Testing. During the first test I was loading the Kerbals from the ground and that was taking forever to climb the ladder so I changed the design to load them from a closer location which is the design here. I am planning to redesign to a quicker way to board the craft because this was still very time consuming. The Mission was somewhat of a success and I say somewhat because I couldn\u0027t manage to board all the Kerbals in their Pilot chairs because I was squeezing between chairs and knocked some Kerbals off their seats and could not get them back in their seats. One was left floating in space during the orbiting of Kerbin and the other three fell overboard somewhere between the launch and landing on Minmus. This is not a very clean build but it gets the idea across.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/RAK8Kq7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RAK8Kq7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RAK8Kq7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gallery/6YinU/new\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/gallery/6YinU/new\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
