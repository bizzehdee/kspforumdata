notably that they are a sphere and not a cylinder; this means they have more width than they should, and still only contact the ground at a singular point.\u00A0 Also going to be much more painful to integrate into KSP due to same-vessel colliders interfering (e.g. the current stock \u0027wheel blocked\u0027 issues are caused by this exact problem).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSPWheelModule (stock replacement module)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs could be seen in the video posted Sat., the wheels are \u003Cem\u003Eworking\u003C/em\u003E in KSP as far as a stock-replacement goes.\u00A0 Not perfectly yet, but still working quite well.\u00A0 Mostly left to sort out are collider issues; stock models have some colliders in strange places, and whatever the CollisionEnhancer script is loves to explode things that aren\u0027t actually colliding.\u00A0 Also lots of inconsistency in how the stock models are put together and their configs\u0027 specified (e.g. the wheel-collider is in seemingly random places in the model; never at either the top or bottom of the suspension; sometimes not even located -on- the suspension); the suspension distance in the config is often -not- the suspension distance as measured in the model; lots of other hackery/strangeness to sort out in the configs (such as why they all list absurd torque, brake, spring, and damper values).\u00A0 Fairly certain I can get it all working though even if I have to resort to manually measuring things in the models for the patch files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVessel colliders though... still have not thought of any good (high-performance) way to implement the \u0027ignore all colliders on the same vessel\u0027.\u00A0 lo-fi had suggested doing an initial ray/sphere-cast and ignoring any that were hit;\u00A0 which would work for a specific vehicle configuration..... the problem with KSP is that a vessel configuration is not static.\u00A0 Things like joint-flex and docking can alter the positions of parts/colliders relative to the wheel and render doing a single ray/sphere-cast check much less useful (really only useful for a single frame).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/111099-lo-fi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022111099\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/111099-lo-fi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@lo-fi\u003C/a\u003E \u00A0I believe that the low-level component should be ready for the start of external use within the week/this weekend, mostly dependent on the API development and cleanup;
