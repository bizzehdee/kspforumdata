Couldn\u0027t this be explained by gravitational red shift rather than the universe having been initiated from a singularity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 The dark energy problem\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you\u0027ve crossed an event horizon, time will slow from your perspective, making it appear that everything\u0027s gradually *accelerating* away from you. We have observed this and attributed it to \u0022dark energy\u0022. Could it not simply be gravitational time dilation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3 The cosmological horizon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you\u0027ve crossed an event horizon, you will see everything that has ever crossed it and everything that ever will cross it, but you will not see anything else. Could this explain the \u0022Hubble horizon\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If we had not fallen into a black hole, how would we know for sure?

However, this circle will blue-shift (or maybe it was red-shift... I don\u0027t remember for sure) until you can\u0027t see normally anyway.
