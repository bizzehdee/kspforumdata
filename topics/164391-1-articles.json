On/off, nothing.\u00A0I Had mods installed, figured it was one of those so I deleted them all. Uninstalled and tried again, nothing. I downloaded a craft file from kerbalx oddly enough that showed truss structures but I still couldn\u0027t get them on a new craft in any of my saves.\u00A0My installs seem really low too. It asks for about 4.9GB space and it downloads about 980mb. Thought it was weird so I tried 3 different disks.
