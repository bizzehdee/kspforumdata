I\u0027ve been working on a series of cluster bombers. My bombs would consist of fuel tanks and liquid fuel nose cones (mods) all scaled down with tweak scale. My current bombs don\u0027t explode on contact with the ground as they did before. Instead they just crash into the ground and make some black smoke. Does anyone know why this is and how I can fix this?\n\nEdit: When I check the logs it says that my parts are colliding into the surface instead of crashing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T15:27:04Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 03:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lightrampage**"}]}
