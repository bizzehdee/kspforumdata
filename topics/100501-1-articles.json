I\u0027m working on the space station, providing (this time) with safety for the kerbals (Sorry for that!!!). I\u0027ve included a few emergency capsules to return back to kerbin, I tried them and then.. well.. :\u0027( POOR KERBALS!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested one pod.. Decoupled, throttled retrograde.. atmosphere reentry was ok, parachute worked. Good. CHECK! Tried the same while focused on other vessel resulted in a dead kerbal. From my understanding the physics and parachute will only work if the vessel is the \u0027active\u0027 one, right? Otherwise it will just entry the atmosphere and crash into kerbin without hesitation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is the case, what is the best approach to surpass this situation? On an emergency I\u0027d like to send all pods back to kerbin, but I think it will not be safe to send all of them at the same time, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T08:28:43Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 08:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ilo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T08:14:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly the active vessel is actually simulated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll other vessels are considered \u0022on rails\u0022 - the same thing that happens when you timewarp.
