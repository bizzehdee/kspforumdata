It only completed the Hi scan, which I guess is the SAR altimetry (on the big map, only the HI marker is in green when I move the mouse over the map, the rest are grayed out). the thing is, on the small map, the LO, HI, BIO and ANOM scanners are listed in orange. The BTDT is gray since I don\u0027t have one on this because it\u0027s an orbital and that would be useless. The marker that\u0027s blinking orange and green is the HI marker, but your post mentions that this means that it shouldn\u0027t be working because the satellite is too high, but it seems that it\u0027s the other way around, the scanners marked with a steady orange are not working, and the blinking one is working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr is there something else going on?
