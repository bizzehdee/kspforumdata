The lithium ion batteries need to be heated constantly in the coldness of the outer solar system. The engine would have to be replaced with an electric motor, and its not even certain that the prop would survive the cold operating temperatures, the glass windshield would need to be replaced with cameras or some double glass insulation, the weight in insulation would add 20% more weight to the airframe, the crew has to carry their own oxygen, the cabin would need to be pressurized, the landing gear would have to be replaced with skids, the weight distribution would change and the wings would have to be moved.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond I am addressing the rest of the post concerning drops with inflatables, that only works really well for small objects on relatively cold planets, Mars in particular, for the other planets, not so sure thats going to be any use.

Set up solar panels and some sort of energy storage mechanism (flywheels or supercapacitors). When you want to deorbit your spacecraft, you simply load the spacecraft into one end of the coil gun and fire it retrograde, killing its orbital velocity. Far less propellant needed for the deorbit (or, in the alternative, a much easier shot at lithobraking or other landing methods).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe catch is that on worlds without an atmosphere, I can\u0027t see how a 50km\u002B coilgun is any easier to land on than\u00A0a runway on an airless world. \u00A0The benefits are that you can transmit the shock of landing onto the moon/planet while you have to design the 50km coilgun sufficiently rigid to handle the shock along the entire coilgun (all 50km need such robustness). \u00A0Certainly landing on a runway at greater than escape velocity is a dangerous plan, but hitting the coilgun wrong (at \u0026gt;escape velocity)\u00A0is going to be equally fatal and do more damage to the coilgun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd once you stop on the runway, you no longer need to land on the planet/moon. \u00A0Assuming the coilgun is in orbit, you still have to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T22:10:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222578123\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139297\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463090415\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe catch is that on worlds without an atmosphere, I can\u0027t see how a 50km\u002B coilgun is any easier to land on than\u00A0a runway on an airless world. \u00A0The benefits are that you can transmit the shock of landing onto the moon/planet while you have to design the 50km coilgun sufficiently rigid to handle the shock along the entire coilgun (all 50km need such robustness). \u00A0Certainly landing on a runway at greater than escape velocity is a dangerous plan, but hitting the coilgun wrong (at \u0026gt;escape velocity)\u00A0is going to be equally fatal and do more damage to the coilgun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd once you stop on the runway, you no longer need to land on the planet/moon. \u00A0Assuming the coilgun is in orbit, you still have to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis thread just keeps making more an more sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what you do, use the coilgun like a baseball bat and whack the landing object strait up, the have it land in a whole that goes through the planet, as its going through the planet have magnets slow it down to a stop.
