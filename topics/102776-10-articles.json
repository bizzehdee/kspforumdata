I want to look at changing this with something like Custom Asteroids Mod (if it still works) but for now asteroid missions are pretty easy unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5\u0026gt; I manually set them, but I\u0027m still not 100% they are perfect. I have had only limited experience with the mods that use them so i might have gotten abundances wrongs sometimes. (This is why feedback is always important for me) AND with the change to the system I\u0027m still not 100% with the new system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6\u0026gt; No, contracts in stock are generated on a distance scale. So you\u0027ll get contracts depending on distance to another body. I\u0027ve heard custom contracts (like orbital science ones) have unforgiving times (like 3 years to do a minmus mission when it\u0027s now in orbit of Eeloo!). Looking into this is on my to-do list, but i needed to see if it\u0027s stable in 1.0 first before expanding more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7\u0026gt; Possibly, it\u0027s actually a forum member! We had an incident where i didnt set an atmosphere properly on Serran in an earlier version resulting in it getting about 220atm pressure and he gave me the idea of adding a planet with an insane atmosphere and almost no gravity and after I finished it I decided to name it after him/her!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8\u0026gt; Thats easy enough, go into their configs (GameData\u0026gt;New_Horizons\u0026gt;KopernicusFile\u0026gt;NewHorizonsPlanets\u0026gt;[PLANETNAME]) and find the ring section.

The setup definitely provides a different starting experience than the normal Kerbin/Mun/Minmus system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in science mode the reduced science yields really impact the gameplay in a negative way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t feel very rewarding when a surface sample from the Mun or Aptur is actually worth less science than one from Kerbin\u0027s Grasslands 3km away from the KSP. This leads to the odd situation where you do flybys of those moons for the orbital science, but landing on and returning from them is much more effort than it\u0027s worth. Maybe it\u0027s different with contracts in career mode but in science mode grinding all of Kerbin\u0027s biomes is \u003Cem\u003Emuch \u003C/em\u003Eeasier \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E more productive, which feels really weird and counter-productive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to land on Serran next and there seems to be something wrong with it\u0027s atmosphere. Even assuming the extreme stats are intended (three times as dense as Eve, 15 times Kerbin, yet it only starts at 54km?) there seem to be issues with some variables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you go too fast you will just explode at the 54km border.

I also didn\u0027t reach any other atmospheric bodies yet so I can\u0027t tell if it\u0027s limited to Serran or if it\u0027s a general atmosphere issue with the new planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T21:57:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 09:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Therlun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
