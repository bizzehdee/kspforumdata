Their Kerbol orbits are clear of debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.8 Billion BKE- A massive planet-sized asteroid collides with Kerbin, thus forming the Mun. The same almost occurs with Eve, but the asteroid narrowly misses the planet and is captured by Eve\u0027s gravity. Gilly is now a moon of Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.6 Billion BKE- Minmus, a comet without a tail at the time, is captured into a circular, slightly inclined orbit around Kerbin. Kerbin has cooled down very much since it\u0027s collision with the asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.5-3 Billion BKE- Millions of small asteroids have been continuously entering Kerbin\u0027s thin but growing atmosphere. In 0.5 billion years Kerbin\u0027s ocean form.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.9 Billion BKE- Early life begins on Kerbin as single-celled organisms lurking in the oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.5 Billion BKE- Evolutionary processes helps develop organisms capable of photosynthesis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.2 Billion BKE- Single-celled organisms are quickly growing to be more complex in structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.6 Billion BKE- The first multicellular organisms appear in the oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 Billion BKE- Simple animals appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E540 Million BKE- Animals with noticeable \u0022front\u0022 and \u0022back\u0022 ends appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E500 Million BKE- Fish and early-developed amphibians appear in Kerbin\u0027s oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E465 Million BKE- Plants start growing and spreading on land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E415 Million BKE- The first insects can be found and seeds are growing more and more frequent in plants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E370 Million BKE- Amphibians appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E310 Million BKE- Reptiles appear.

Shortly afterwards dozens more countries pop up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E696 SKE- Herlanen-Jerb Kermal, later to be one of the greatest scientific and mathematical geniuses in history, is born. During his life he discovers algebra and, near his death, pre-calculus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1,067 SKE- The very first telescopes are created in the small country of Frenmal. The new invention is used in a variety of ways, ranging from calculating distance to warfare. The telescope is not commonly used for gazing at the night sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1,183 SKE- The telescope starts to be actively used for stargazing. Minmus, thought to be very distant from Kerbin, is found to be the Kerbal\u0027s second moon. The discovery shakes society. Global interest in space and astronomy boosts slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1,327 SKE- Gerbani Wensal is born. Over his life he becomes an extremely well-known astronomer. He discovers several planets of the Kerbol system, such as Duna, Eve and Jool. Their moons remain unknown. The planets\u0027 discoveries, however, surprise the Kerbal civilization again. In response, the \u0022Kerbin International Space Society\u0022 is founded. Poor funding and low interest leaves the organization in poor shape, but it is still managing to survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1,417 SKE- Kerbin\u0027s most history changing revolutions take place. An all-out war breaks out amongst the early superpowers of Kerbin. Millions are killed in the war, along with several leaders. The war lasts only five years, but it leaves society in dread. One man by the name of Gebinsky Kervin begins rallying all over the world. He speaks of the importance of space and astronomy, and that Kerbals\u0027 true destiny lies amongst the stars. He also speaks of a free world where the nations of the world are run by the people. His speeches leaves millions inspired, and the reemerging Kerbal civilization is devoted to creating a free world. The \u0022Kerbin International Space Society\u0022 fires up and becomes one of the biggest organizations on the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1,667 SKE- Calculus is fully discovered and early astrophysics is invented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1,868 SKE- The first modern rocket is launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1,899 SKE- Moho, Gilly, Dres, Ike, Laythe, Vall, and Tylo are discovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1,900-1,930 SKE- Nations around the world begin developing their own space programs.

The idea spreads like wildfire across the world, and eventually all nations agree to found a singular space program. It is called the \u0022Kerbal Space Program.\u0022 Thousands of square kilometers are plotted for the Kerbal Space Program to launch rockets and operate from. The plot of land is located at Kerbin\u0027s equator near the ocean\u0027s coast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1,955 SKE- The first rocket plane is flown.
