You must change ALL references to that Kerbal to the new name. Some cause weirdness, some cause what you describe, but in all cases it\u0027s bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I don\u0027t see how changing the persistent.sfs could make it so you couldn\u0027t load an otherwise perfectly okay quicksave.sfs from earlier.

Another thing that sometimes happen during name changes is a bracket { or } might have been inadvertently deleted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can open the debug log (ALT\u002BF2) and that might give you some indication as to what\u0027s incorrect in the save. If it\u0027s a bad kerbal reference, you can really confirm that by trying to enter the astronaut complex. If you have a broken kerbal reference, it will often throw an error when entering the astronaut complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
