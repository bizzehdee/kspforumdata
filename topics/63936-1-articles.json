As for the fuel use, when flying rockets (as opposed to planes or SSTO planes), so little fuel is used that I either just tie the jets into the rocket fuel tank(s) or I stack a small rocket fuel tank onto each jet. The mass of leftover oxidizer is less than the mass of unused jet fuel in the tanks you were using, and of course now the oxidizer can be set to empty anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, with jet boosters, I always stage them first, prior to igniting the rocket engines and releasing the clamps.
