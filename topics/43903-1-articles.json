I go to VAB, loading screen. Go to Tracking Station, loading screen. Runway, loading screen. Try to launch a rocket, loading screen. I even notice a significant freeze of about 5-7 seconds when I switch SOI\u0027s. The SOI problem wouldn\u0027t necessarily be that annoying if my ship didn\u0027t move in that 5-7 second freeze. When I switch to the Mun\u0027s SOI I normally find myself far past the periapsis when the freeze ends, therefore I waste fuel getting back and getting an orbit. This is especially detrimental to the mission when I am going to another planet, I often approach at very high speeds and have to burn inside the atmosphere of most planets (if they even have one) to get an orbit. With this long delay time I often find that I have already passed through the atmosphere of the planet and I would waste too much fuel trying to land, this results in myself having to go right back to Kerbin, not even completing the main objective of the mission, very annoying. Going back to the loading screen in the VAB and such, I end up spending around 5 minutes total in loading screens when I test various parts of my rocket and make changes. This becomes very annoying after a while, and it makes me stop playing because of all the wasted time in a black loading screen. I suggest loading more of the basic tasks at the beginning of the game, because in the older versions I would instantly switch to the VAB, now I end up waiting 5-7 seconds just to load it. I may sound very picky, and I am sorry, but after a couple weeks of playing like this, wasting countless minutes, possibly an hour or more, in loading screens, it gets very annoying very fast, especially when long SOI switches result in a failed mission. Thank you for your consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CvVtjRtb","CreatedById":59454,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T03:23:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-02T01:09:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2019 01:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by CvVtjRtb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T03:29:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETill this issue gets fixed why don\u0027t you try to use lower time warps as you get closer to the change point?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif that doesn\u0027t solve your problem then you must be going alot faster than you should.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"99TheCreator","CreatedById":31144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T03:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont have any mods, I\u0027m all stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T04:00:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHopefully the 0.22 release will be based on Unity 4.2 and this (and other loader PNG/JPEG issues) will be solved\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tataffe","CreatedById":33282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T11:10:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is also problematic to go to the desktop during the loading screen.
