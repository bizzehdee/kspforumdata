I really would love to play around with it. I\u0027ve created my own modpack that effectively converts KSP into a combat simulator, and military cargo planes are just what I need. Maybe I can even convert one of these into an AC-130 Gunship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I currently made my own placeholder that functions fairly well. However, I would love to see a detailed plane parts pack dedicated to this beast of a plane.
