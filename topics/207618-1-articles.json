You make course corrections as usual, you can change destination without any issue. You go from maneuver node to maneuver node or pause the journey and create new maneuver nodes.

Server could optimize sending you only the relevant localized recordings using an events / actions LOD system.

If Player B that\u0027s playing some days later (real-life time) is faster (relative to in-game time), then that Player B event recording would be placed before the Player A recording on the common timeline. All other players would be notified of milestones when the in-game time hits a recorded event. So the one that wins the \u0022land on the Mun\u0022 space race is the one that created the earliest recording of the event (real life time does not really matter, but there should be rules so someone does not lag behind for a year in real life just to win the race).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-05T17:43:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2023 05:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Vl3d\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ewording, added extras\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norocketscience","CreatedById":211335,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-07T19:07:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is\u2026 complex.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell, it sounds very good, but that isn\u2018t how the devs thaught KSP nor KSP 2.
