The fuel in the outside tank is pressurized both for its turbo and for transfer, its level is\u00A0dropping\u00A0which\u00A0means its hydrostatic pressure is falling, while\u00A0the recieving tank is not. Therefore there is a pressure dynamic between the two tanks that will overpressurize the turbo, the turbo then needs a pressure regulator on it so that\u00A0\u00A0it is getting constant fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy solution to this problem is to use an sfrb of exact duration required as the base of the outside tank. and place an aero lf tank on top of that, its height being above the starting level of the inside tanks it needs less pressure to move up. Since the sfrb\u0027s do not gimble gimbling is reserved for the interior engines\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with asparagas is that it increases drag by flattening the verticle profile and widening the horizontal profiles. If you want realy great speed after liftoff, then aero tanks and transitions can get across that mach barrier earlier. A mission like new horizons which the launch trajectory is nearly verticle through the atmospere, energy is lost in terms of time spent over the launch pad, so really good sppeds save energy, but require low drag. \u00A0If you are launchin a superwide space telescope you might use asparagas cause you have to linger at suborbital velocities for longer periods of

life.\u00A0 If you take what KSP fuel lines do at face value, that leads to rather silly implications.\u00A0 For example,\u00A0there\u0027s no limit on the flow rate of KSP fuel lines.\u00A0 No matter how fast the downstream engine,\u00A0be it a\u00A0Spark\u00A0or a Mammoth,\u00A0is burning fuel, the line from the upstream tank always delivers fuel at exactly the\u00A0same rate, so the downstream tank stays completely full until the upstream tank is empty.\u00A0 That\u0027s asking a lot of a small pipe of constant diameter which might be rather long in some extreme situations.\u00A0:).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027s asking even more of the fuel pumps.\u00A0\u00A0The fuel line pump has to deliver whatever flow rate the downstream engine needs against a considerable and constantly increasing backpressure caused by the downstream tank remaining full while\u00A0the upstream tank drains at twice the natural rate.\u00A0 And it has to keep doing this even down to the last drop of fuel in the upstream tank, all while not interfering with the flow going to the upstream tank\u0027s own engine.\u00A0 That\u0027s an amazing pump there, especially because the same small, light unit works for whatever size engines are involved \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022

pounds / gallon, tha\u0027s 12600 pounds per minute being moved.\u00A0 A pump that can do this is\u00A0rather large.\u00A0 It\u00A0spans the entire width of the big red truck required to move it around and needs several hundred diesel horsepower to spin it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I look at the stats of the F-1 engine\u0027s fuel pump:\u00A0 15,471 gpm of RP-1 and 24811 gpm of LOX for a total weight moved of 340980 pounds per minute.\u00A0 Even scaled down to KSP size, that\u0027s still 3662 combined gpm, and 30998 pounds per minute, both more than twice the capacity of my $400K, 20-ton firetruck.\u00A0 And that\u0027s just 1 engine---the Saturn V had to feed 5 of these at once.\u00A0\u00A0Then if you put\u00A0such boosters\u00A0in a KSP\u00A0asparagus arrangement to lift some monster payload, each tank in the chain would need twice this pumping capacity, one for itself and the other for the fuel line.\u00A0 Egad!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, the F-1 fuel pump was small and light, and used a gas turbine with 55000 bhp, so was a totally different beast than a fire pump.\u00A0 However, I still find it illuminating\u00A0to think of each KSP-sized F-1 analog as needing 2.5 full-size firetrucks just to feed it, and 7.5 firetrucks for every pair in an asparagus arrangement (2.5 in the dlownstream tank, 5 in the upstream tank).\u00A0 This mental image is enough for me to call BS on KSP fuel lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T18:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

thing to take away from this is that to a remarkably high degree, designing a rocket means designing a turbopump (fuel pump). \u00A0I think Scott Manley has stated something like 90% of the engineering comes down to the turbopump, but such things vary so wildly that I doubt you will ever find an \u0022official\u0022 number. \u00A0Just understand that they are by far the most complex part of rocket science and that making your turbopump more complicated is making your rocket more complicated. \u00A0And making things complicated is the enemy of doing reliable engineering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd while someone pointed out that fire engine pumps aren\u0027t the same as rocket turbopumps, I think we can understand that making turbopumps working
