Bad users don\u0027t report bugs, but instead just stop using the software without giving the DEV a chance to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly fluid dynamics are very complicated. The only reason in FAR that they have the atmospheric viscosity set to 0.00002 (accurate)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis because they don\u0027t understand that the atmosphere must be much thicker to \u0022COMPENSATE\u0022 for the fluid dynamic pseudo simulation that KSP uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see, KSP \u0022TRIES\u0022 to simulate a fluid dynamic called atmosphere. But to do this correctly, all our PC\u0027s would need to be 100 x faster to achieve a minimum 30 fps. You see, if we try to accurately simulate true fluid dynamic, all our KSP\u0027s would turn to 1 fps slide shows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what KSP does is cut corners... LOTS of corners!!! This is so that our PC\u0027s can give us that 30-120 fps that we require for having fun...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to COMPENSATE ksp thickens the atmosphere to simulate a true atmosphere. Its not accurate, maybe too thick...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo FAR comes out and improves the fluid simulation, but its still NOT EVEN CLOSE to realistic... Yes its MUCH BETTER than stock, but its still a LONG way off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo FAR also needs to compensate by possibly thickening up the atmosphere as well. Maybe not as much, but still it needs some help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in FAR when they set the atmosphere to 0.00002 viscosity, its actually NOT correct. Because the only way for it to be perfectly accurate would be for the ENTIRE FLUID simulation to be 100% accurate. But its not. so you NEED that compensation to correct for the short comings of our PC\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in this case, less accurate = more accurate. ie: 0.02 is more realistic \u0022FEELING\u0022 then 0.00002 Because we can never achieve true realism with our current PC\u0027s. They\u0027re just too slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this clearifies things for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:09:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I see.
