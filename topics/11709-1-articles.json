Also, flying high lets you cover more ground even though the engines start to lose power, you should be able to cruise at around 12km without much trouble.\n\nDepending on what speed you are getting you might also be able to throttle back a bit to conserve fuel, as the harder you push against the atmosphere the harder it pushes back, I don\\\u0027t know what speed to aim for though, you\\\u0027ll have to experiment."},{"CreatedByName":"Joshmo","CreatedById":10280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T20:28:29Z","Content":"Adding to the arsenal.

The drop tanks do indeed sound like a great idea."},{"CreatedByName":"Joshmo","CreatedById":10280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T04:02:00Z","Content":"Drop tanks and wing surface area. Drop tanks will not require a major re-design though."}]}
