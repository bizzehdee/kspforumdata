Also a waypoint mod. I see a lot of crashes to desktop without so much as a notification. Just \u0022Oh, hello desktop. You weren\u0027t here a second ago. Where did you come from, and what have you done with my mission that was 75% completed?\u0022 I\u0027m seeing this mostly when flying spaceplanes in atmosphere, which means there is no quicksave. I end up in prelaunch when I restart, so the whole mission has to be reflown and frequently will also suffer another mid flight crash to desktop. I also this sometimes after clicking \u0022Recover Vessel\u0022, but that is less frequent and not as inconvenient since it usually quicksaves after landing."}]}
