An old trick to stop unwanted rotations.... Toggling between time warp and back will kill all rotations. Really the only way unless you make specific note of which decouplers and docking nodes have little or no ejection force. Because Rotation would only occur after the object collides with something(if it\u0027s balanced), typically something inside the cargo bay (or it was already intersecting the collision volume of something else you had in there). I believe all the KSO docking nodes have a decent amount of ejection force... Attraction force too it seems (or I haven\u0027t been paying close enough attention... but might explain the excessive \u0022bouncing\u0022). So the only way to deal with that for cargo release that you want to remain static to a target (as in, a pod needing positioning/transfer) is to stop it with a robotic arm or let it bounce around the cargo bay a little to stop itself. Other then that, You\u0027re going to be chasing that thing down with whatever Tug you have on hand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... Unless there was a very flat Cargo Decoupler that had very low/no ejection force? (A modified docking node maybe?) Or make a small robotic arm that can fit in there. There are a couple of mods that are customization.

I implemented a launch escape system that jettisons the crew compartment in an emergency (uses realchutes, perfectons and a modmanager file to add a decoupler to the bottom node) and the parachute is stowed in the nose. I mitigated this tonight in a test flight by adding a second reaction wheel (via modmanager) to the radome that matches the one in the avionics and compensates for the lack of avionics package.

I used 2 docking ports (one in the bay and one on the module) mated together to hold the Habitat module in the bay. Because facing docking ports are forced apart on undocking, the ports threw the module backwards down the payload bay and it bounced as I did the ventral translation, thus it came out almost at 45-degrees.
