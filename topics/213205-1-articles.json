I made a list and divided into two parts the casual and the important list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I launched KSP2 for the first time and my first thought was, can I run the game? And I could! But I have a GTX 1650 and it was ok I had 10-20 FPS and 60-ish in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (low graphics, 1080) so here comes my first worry about the game: Can the devs optimise it so much that I can launch a 1k\u002B part rocket without lag and an ok FPS e.g. 30-35? And I don\u0027t know because if not then I don\u0027t know the interstellar travelling how will be achieved without a high end PC. I\u0027m worrying about the noodle rockets because how would I launch a massive rocket if it\u0027s wiggling around I don\u0027t think this was a good idea to keep this feature. But yet I\u0027m hopeful (good luck dev team \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E).\u00A0 And what I got for this FPS? A very good looking KSP2 and the graphics didn\u0027t get bad even if I\u0027m playing at low settings. When I started playing I got into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and started building a rocket to orbit. One of the first things I encountered was the controls and the green highlight lines those were quite annoying for me. I think if they would be thinner they wouldn\u0027t be annoying. The new parts are really good and I\u0027m wondering what could I do with them when the performance will be better.\u00A0 And the engines were very nostalgic and I think later in the development they could get other forms like the engines in KSP. But I didn\u0027t like that the DeltaV calculator wasn\u0027t working properly in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and didn\u0027t show me DeltaV / stage data. I hope this will get fixed soon.\u00A0 So when I finished the rocket I put it into the launchpad and watched\u00A0 the countdown I really liked it.\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0And when it launched the sounds were very good too. But when I got into the higher atmosphere I encountered with a really weird thing. I couldn\u0027t turn my rocket trough\u00A0 the orbital prograde marker (I had a Mammoth engine and wings) but fortunately after I decupled it fixed (sometimes I couldn\u0027t decouple the fix was to change the decoupler into separator and back and constantly launching).\u00A0 And the gyroscopes were very weak. When I wanted to make the orbit I could pin the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E but when I switched into the maneuver node they disappear it was quite annoying both of them because I could pin the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E but not as easily as in KSP sometimes they just weren\u0027t appear.\u00A0 And the last thing I think maybe the communication e.g. about the recommended specs. Because the devs could publish this sooner and say that \u0022Sorry the performance will be bad at day 1 but we will fix it as quickly as possible\u0022 or anything other then \u0022we take your feedback very seriously\u0022, something to\u00A0 calm down the community. And I\u0027m still excited about the game and would like to hear about the coming updates just a bit more.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOverall I thing the KSP2\u00A0 can be a really good game if the performance get better and some quality of life features get into the game. I say good luck to the developer team and I hope they can fix the game.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EImportant list:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E-Performance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E-DeltaV Tools (from KSP):\u003C/strong\u003E I would like to see my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and DeltaV on different celestial bodies.

It\u0027s a god idea but in action it isn\u0027t working because it\u0027s too big and hard to close, when you have 30\u002B parts the game freeze for a sec to open it and hard to see through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECasual list:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E-Maneuver, remaining DeltaV and burn time:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EIn the maneuver window I would like to have a \u0022remaining DeltaV\u0022 row. Because I don\u0027t know from a white line that how many much I have to burn. This can be under the \u0022Required DeltaV\u0022 line. The other one is the burn time because now this appears when I start the burn and this is a bit late when I try to do very small maneuvers and I reduce the trust of the engine. This can be under or above the \u0022Start burn\u0022 line.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E-Transfer window:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EI think that some transfer window features can be implemented to the game. Particularly the\u00A0 time indicator. This would show the time when will be a transfer window to another planet .\u00A0 You could open this window and with one click you could add the time to your alarm clock. I think that this feature is enough, I don\u0027t think that we would need so many numbers, stats etc.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E-Trip planner start changing:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EIn the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E we have a trip planner thing and this is great but I can\u0027t change the \u0022From\u0022 body to another planet or moon. This would be important when the performance get better.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E-Fairing building:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EI encountered with a bug a lot this bug is when I take off the fairing and put it back it disappear. It wouldn\u0027t be a problem if I could build a fairing with 5 clicks but with this new system the fairing building is slow, hard and complicated. I think if the old building method would be enabled with holding e.g. SHIF and if I want something more precise I would use the \u0022stock\u0022 new method.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E-Gyroscope strength:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EI don\u0027t know what you\u0027ve (developers) done with gyroscope strengths but I feel that they are useless when I want to steer a bit bigger rocket and this is good in some way but I think it would be great if this would be a setting and I could adjust the strength of the gyroscopes. And it could change with the stock settings (easy, normal, hard).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E-Docking:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EI think the lowne lazy method of docking could work but an interface like the docking port alignment indicator mod in KSP would be the best. I miss this from KSP because whenever KSP got an update I don\u0027t dock until the mod was updated (even if I could \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E). In my opinion this is a very important thing that needs to be implemented soon because it helps with docking A LOT. In the game it can be e.g. a part of the probe system from some point and obviously the Kerbals have access to it or it can be a device that looks like a camera that enables this feature.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E-Cheat menu:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThe Alt\u002B F12 is a really important part of KSP if I want to test something e.g. a probe system, a lander, a rover, recording a video etc. I think it needs to be implemented.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E-Alarm Clock:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThis is originally a mod for KSP but later it was implemented into the base game and I think that because of the multiplayer and the fact that now the time works in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E I think this is an important feature to don\u0027t miss anything.
