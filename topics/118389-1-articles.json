I think the problem here is drag. Since you\u0027re never flying directly forward there is a small offset. And if you pull hard this will get amplified through the drag vector. I guess the real world has similar problems and that\u0027s why most wings are never totally flat..."},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T18:17:17Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had this in a couple designs but not all of them. Not sure what causes it but there\u0027s a mod called Pilot Assistant that has a button that will keep the plane level and counter the roll. Works great for my planes that have this issue. Has other cool features too that are handy."},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T18:55:58Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had it happen to me and I think it\u0027s related to a symmetry issue in the VAB/SPH. Check your left and right rudders by right-clicking on them to see if the settings are the same, sometimes if you remove a wing and replace it using mirror symmetry the rudders get borked (technical term). I think the resolution is to remove the rudders and attach them separately. I\u0027ve encountered lots of issues with symmetry when designing/building craft, I\u0027m hoping that they will be fixed in the next release.\n\nJR"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T20:44:15Z","Content":"Lemme guess. You have multiple wing sections. There\u0027s a well-documented bug where symmetric part attachments have different stiffnesses, and the flex and twist caused by pitch-up tends to cause uneven deflection in the wings. Try adding more struts between the wing sections and/or install the KJR mod, and see if that helps."},{"CreatedByName":"Kobymaru","CreatedById":107372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T21:01:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi, ive been having the problem of my planes doing rolls when i pull up, its been happening since 1.0.4 Did squad add engine torque or something??\n\nI have the same problem!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Lemme guess.

I think I should stop reading the Forums because the sheer amount of bugs depresses me, even if I personally never hit them."}]}
