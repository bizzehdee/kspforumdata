For me, Kethane was at first wonderfully attractive, the definitive \u0027must have\u0027 mod if ever there was one, and with quite a bit of \u0027professional polish\u0027 to boot. Refueling on distant shores? Awesome. But... it is just a little too easy isn\u0027t it? There is a mod that enables you to create a spaceship factory on other planets as well, and that\u0027s just going way too far IMHO. Seriously, can you imagine how many centuries in to the future it will be before we can manufacture a spacecraft on another planet from raw materials? We\u0027re really not that good at doing it on Earth yet. I know KSP isn\u0027t supposed to be overly analagous to the real world, but we\u0027re talking a long way off here. So, it was thoughts like that (and career mode forcing me to go without for a change) that made me start rethinking Kethane a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA magical base compound that can somehow be converted in to just about anything I want? Solid fuel, liquid fuel, oxidizer... with a short skip many of us can also include oxygen, water, etc.... Sure, we can argue about the possible real world chemical composition of Kethane, but most of these discussions boil down to something along the lines of \u0022well, if we have Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen, we can make anything! So, as long as Kethane has those three elements, we\u0027re good to go\u0022. No, I don\u0027t think so. There\u0027s this little field of science called chemistry that would have us believe that it\u0027s actually not that easy to simply pull molecules apart in to their constituent atoms and recombine them in any way we see fit. My pint of beer has all of those elements in it, but can I turn it in to rocket fuel with just the help of a little converter (tequila doesn\u0027t count by the way)? When was the last time someone took a good long look at a fuel refinery, notice how big those things are, and how many different pieces of technology are involved? Not to mention the oil or gas platforms/mines/wells that supply them. But, somehow with Kethane we convince ourselves that all of that technology can, in the quite near future, be miniaturized in to a handy little drilling and converting kit that can be strapped on to any self respecting spacecraft and easily deployed over a convenient deposit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, I know, it\u0027s just a game. Look, I\u0027ve loved Kethane as much as anyone, and better a Kethane mod than no Kethane mod. My main point is that I agree with this post, in that it should be a bit harder, and require at least a little more investment in ground-based infrastructure. Getting fuel from other worlds is a fantastic goal, but it should be balanced with a considerable level of effort invested to be able to pull it off. Requiring a second resource to be combined with Kethane sounds like a pretty good solution that\u0027s not overly complicated to implement (yes, easy for me to say), and would increase enjoyment at the same time. I suspect that having the resources geographically separated by any great distance could easily take a lot of the fun out of the concept, but surely there\u0027s a compromise to be had somewhere?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-28T12:10:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2013 12:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Benno\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T14:07:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow many centuries until we can build rockets on another planet?
