My approach so far has been to avoid tutorials and to calculate as much as possible before actually doing things and I had a lot of fun figuring out those orbital speeds on my own and then having the satisfaction to see it work as expected or go horribly wrong if I made a mistake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did the Mun orbit that way and I was a bit annoyed that the game wouldn\u0027t (as far as I know) provide me at least some phase angle measurements to make my calculations more precise, but I managed to do it by eyeballing it (probably wasted a lot of delta-v but that\u0027s why I had some extra). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was still thinking of ways to improve my method when I saw a comment mentioning upgrading some buildings to get flight planning and maneuver nodes. So I tested them tonight they are really good and easy to use but... somehow I\u0027m kind of disappointed as they make calculating orbits myself rather useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope I don\u0027t come across as some elitist saying that calculating things should be the way to play this game or anything, it\u0027s great that there are many ways to play KSP. It\u0027s just that personally, I really enjoyed that part so far and I\u0027m not sure how to continue doing so as the game will start to require more precision. I could just try not using maneuvers node, I guess, but is the game giving me enough information? Should I just stick a protractor to the monitor? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure I\u0027m not the only one who likes to calculate things, so I\u0027d appreciate some advice on how to best enjoy the game in that way. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (or tell me if you think I should just give up and just play the game without maths, that\u0027s a valid opinion too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T23:47:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo get the raw data, Kerbal Engineer Redux(\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-1-0-2-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v1-0-16-6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-1-0-2-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v1-0-16-6\u003C/a\u003E) or Mechjeb (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/12384-PART-1-0-Anatid-Robotics-MuMech-MechJeb-Autopilot-v2-5?highlight=mechjeb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/12384-PART-1-0-Anatid-Robotics-MuMech-MechJeb-Autopilot-v2-5?highlight=mechjeb\u003C/a\u003E) have excellent readouts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb especially can be customised to give you as much or as little information as you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote the Mechjeb also includes an autopilot, whereas KER just provides information\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T23:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Codexus, and welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany players enjoy the mathematical aspect of space travel that KSP offers, but for many others math just isn\u0027t fun and they just want to launch rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI enjoy knowing how to calculate various things, including delta-v. When you launch many times, however, calculating by hand can come to seem a chore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are various levels of this. Some players install mods which do most or all of the piloting, while some install only mods that give additional info such as radar altimeter data (which is found in the cockpit view in the stock game) and readouts for remaining delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome players build the craziest, most outlandish contraptions you can imagine.
