View full album](//imgur.com/a/6XAFp)\n\nThis is one of my favourite craft and has the same engine configuration as the real thing. It has an abort system for extra safety. All of the action groups are explained in the craft and it is only for use in space. Make sure to select control from here on the probe core so that the nav ball will work.\n\nCraft file: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/5s8lpu8ofxrg1x2/B5%20Starfury.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5s8lpu8ofxrg1x2/B5%20Starfury.craft?dl=0) \n\nStarfury Thunderbolt\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/MaYmA)\n\nThis is the first Babylon 5 craft that I made and I think it is probably the worst. It does fly in the atmosphere but if you get too far off you velocity vector it will probably crash. It should be flown with RCS on otherwise it will crash, all of the action groups are explained in the craft\n\nCraft file: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/8b8mty972ca3imz/B5%20Starfury%20Thunderbolt.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8b8mty972ca3imz/B5%20Starfury%20Thunderbolt.craft?dl=0)\n\nCentari Fighter\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/EJsB2)\n\nThis craft is designed to be used in space and in the atmosphere but it is considerably better when used in space as if you pitch up too much in the atmosphere it will flip over. Again all of the action groups are explained in the craft and I recommend using the parachutes to land so that the wings stay connected to the craft. \n\nCraft file: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ttntd9r2v5dls9a/B5%20Centauri%20Fighter.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ttntd9r2v5dls9a/B5%20Centauri%20Fighter.craft?dl=0)\n\nNarn Fighter\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/V5Uxr)\n\nThis is my favourite craft as it works well in both space and the atmosphere. Unlike most of the other craft I believe it is a joy to fly. The RCS is not needed and should only be needed in space. Like all of the other craft the action groups are explained in the craft. \n\nCraft file: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/37wrlbc6ytbomog/B5%20Narn%20fighter.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/37wrlbc6ytbomog/B5%20Narn%20fighter.craft?dl=0)\n\nMinbari Fighter\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/NN457)\n\nAnother space only craft but it is possible to fly in the atmosphere although it is beyond my piloting skill. The cockpit is not the right shape but I think it is good enough to be released. There are no action groups on this craft and the RCS is only really needed to increase manoeuvrability. \n\nCraft file: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/cjg4kgueqsrkj72/B5%20Minbari%20Fighter.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cjg4kgueqsrkj72/B5%20Minbari%20Fighter.craft?dl=0)\n\nI hope you like the craft any criticism is welcome. Thanks for looking.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T13:12:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 01:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mrmcp1**"}]}
