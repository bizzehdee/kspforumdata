Currrently, the only way I know how to do this is to do the animation in reverse in blender/Unity, and if you didnt make the part yourself this is gonna be tricky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, Im sure it would not be difficult at all for the Developers to add to the game, but they have so much other stuff they need to do, I can\u0027t see it happening to be honest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll they need to do is offer an option in the part cfg to play the animation splits in the order and direction you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eie. If I tell Kerbal to play my animation from frame 1-100, it plays it forward, but if I tell it to play from 100-1 it plays it backwards. A thousand other programs and developers have figured it out, im sure these guys will figure it out to at some stage down the track.

It really doesn\u0027t seem to like being deployed on the runway. The ship jumps around till it explodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust out of curiosity, why did you choose to have it start retracted? Is there something about unity that makes that easier?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you update the Pegasus pack at some point perhaps you could have both retracted and extended versions to choose from. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso of note is that with the MK3 cargo hold the engines are too far back and theres a big gap and your eagle VTOL engines are a natural fit for the PX2 but could use a recolor to blend in better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
