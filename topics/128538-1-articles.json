And some of those flights were logistics ones, with no new payloads to pay for (other than cheap consumables like food and air for the station), as NASA lost budget as a percentage of the federal one, and the costs of maintaining the station came up. The main point I\u0027m trying to make is that SLS would need a ton of extra money to pay for its payloads, and NASA\u0027s budget seems like it will be stretched to its limit just flying it with a recurring payload (Orion) once every two years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRune.

No new payloads need to be developed once the initial development is complete (until Moon-Base building begins, that is)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the low launching rate at the end of service life of the Shuttle was because of Constellation being pursued in parallel (meaning they had to juggle 2 manned space flight programs at once) and because of the Columbia Disaster requiring that NASA be much more careful about future launches. Orion has more margin for error- it has a LES, is attached to the top of the rocket, rather than the side, which caused Columbia, and is smaller (and a protected heat shield) meaning MMOD risk is lower.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA will not have to juggle 2 manned spaceflight programs- only one, allowing them to concentrate on Orion.
