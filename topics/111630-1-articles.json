Our engineers claim that with the recently developed SAS systems, I\u0027ll be able to fly just as smoothly as Jeb does, but my scientific experience will be beneficial. They are also content that the new Rockomax parts will be able to lift all the sci-equipment we ever created. My excitement overshadows my doubts. That monstorsity is certainly the biggest rocket that was ever assembled in the VAB. Impressive. How was the rokkit equasion again? Bigger = better.

No 360\u0027 turns or such that always irks the less experienced. I think I did pretty well, though the fuel remaining isn\u0027t as much as I expected. I sometimes wonder if our engineers actually know what all those readouts like TTW, delta-V and such means. Maybe they just eyeball stuff. Ahh, well, it\u0027s just the cynic in me.

On the recent flyby mission, Jeb was able to confirm the theory that this stellar body is actually a lot bigget than it looks from Kerbin. I extended his observation: I state that the apparent size of the Mun is inversely proportional with the distance of the observer. I relaying this equation to Mission Control. I\u0027m starting to understand why they sent me instead of Jebediah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay \u0027n\u002B some\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunar orbit achieved. Fuel feels kinda\u0027 low, but the Mun feels to have a pretty low gravity, so it should be OK.

I\u0027m in the history books. We can send the invoice to our contractor. I have good and bad news tosend towards Mission Control along with the reports of the science equipment. The good news is that the lander only lost some stabilizer legs on the port-side: that means an ideal launching angle - if the craft doesn\u0027t tips over when I\u0027ll leave for the munar rock they really need at home. The bad news is that the simulations show that I only have enough fuel for a suborbital hop - than I\u0027d crash a few hundred kilometers away. I need a rescue operation. Pretty please?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay \u0027n\u002B a few weeks\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have ran out of crossword-puzzles. Mission Control assured me that they will send a rescue craft as soon as it\u0027s convenient. They also told me that I have nothing to worry about: they already hired another scientist to do my job, and he\u0027s doing pretty well. They promised me that they\u0027ll include more crossword-puzzles in their following lander designs, probably even some sudoku. Though after a few days, they admitted that my continous transmissions make them uneasy, not to mention the high fees on distance calls, so it would be preferable if I stopped contacting them. But they sent me a pre-recorded message I can listen any time. It tells me that they are working hard on my rescue, and everything is in perfect order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay \u0027n\u002B a few months\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI met Clara. She\u0027s a munar rock that looks pretty much like Jeb\u0027s mother. But she\u0027s smart, relatively young and good looking. I\u0027m having a hard time beating her in barchoba, though she has to improve in Activity and tic-tac-toe. But still, I think I\u0027m in love. If the rescue craft will be able to carry the extra weitght, I\u0027ll take her home and marry her.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay \u0027n\u002B dunno. A lot.\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rescue craft arrived. First we thought that it\u0027s the extrakerbistrials, but it was just us. Mission Control apologized and assured me that they never forget about me, and I shouldn\u0027t believe if someone says otherwise once I\u0027m home. By the way, the lander is the exact same design I arrived with. Checking the logs indicats that the rocket was the same too. Though they developed some digital version of Jeb that were able to land with high-precision, so I didn\u0027t have to walk to a random landing site. How kind of them. The computer was also able to travel more efficiently: it arrived with 30% more fuel than I did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUmm. That still not enough for a return. If I had a can, I could transfer the fuel of the last craft, but that\u0027s out of the question. But Clara wants to see my homeworld so badly that we won\u0027t wait. We are launching today. She assured me that we\u0027ll figure out something on the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay \u0027m\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cem\u003E(as I lost count, I\u0027ll call the day of our launch \u0027m\u0027. It stands for \u0027Mun\u0027, marriage\u0027, metabolism and many other \u0027m\u0027 words. Like \u0027many\u0027)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel was enough for an orbit. Well, it\u0027s periapsis was on 1400 meters. I didn\u0027t want to retract our bellies and risk a pass, so I used the unofficial emergency-procedure of pushing the craft on EVA. Orbit stabilized - so cool. Now I\u0027m also familiar with the process of distilling EVA-fuel from ration-bars stored in the cockpit for even more propulsion, but it\u0027s a long and tedious work, not to mention that Clara\u0027s religion forbids it, as alcohol can be made the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remembered a tale that Clara told me down there. It was about a certain \u0027Baron M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnchhausen\u0027. He pulled himself up to the Mun and back... by his ponytail. I wanted to test this, but even if I had a ponytail, medical crew advised me not to remove my helmet under any circumstance, especially on EVA. Anyways, probably the Baron lived in a time when the gravity wasn\u0027t that strong. But on Munar orbit, the solution hit me: what if the ship was my ponytail?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay \u0027m\u002B some\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the way home! The theory worked! I deserve a noble prize. I discovered the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnchhause-force, a propulsion system that will revolutionize space travel! So I couldn\u0027t pull myself from a ponytail, but I could kick a fuel-tank of the lander while hanging onto a ladder. I forgot my camera at home so I\u0027ll visually demonstrate the construction by a capital letter \u0027L\u0027. The letter\u0027s vertical part symbolises the ladder, while it\u0027s horizontal part represents the top of a fuel-tank. My physic studies suggested that I will not be able to produce acceleration. Well, I was wrong. One just needs to hang onto the ladder while kicking the can. To my great suprize, this method is a lot more effective than EVA-pushing, and no fuel is needed. Clara and I were never been this happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m full of plans. The M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6nchhausen-force porbably isn\u0027t enough to reachy LKO with (though with enough kerbals kicking... I reed to run the numbers), but once we are on orbit, there are no more limits. Once the honeymoon is over, I\u0027ll attempt a Moho-trip.
