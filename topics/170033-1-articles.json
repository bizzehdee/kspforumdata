And since none of the five remaining competitors are on track to launch in time to meet the existing March 31st deadline, Google\u0027s sponsorship will end and the prize pool will remain unclaimed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick summary:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Israel\u0027s SpaceIL is still trying to raise US $30 million to pay for its launch, with no clear indication of whether or not they can get it, and if so, when they could get a launch slot.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- India\u0027s TeamIndus is in the exact same boat: still trying to raise US $35 million to pay for its launch, of which there is no information about if and when it might happen.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Japan\u0027s Team Hakuto was slated to fly with TeamIndus, and is 100% dependent on what they do.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- US-based Moon Express\u00A0technically still had the best shot at winning, as their launch is already paid for, and the vehicle (Rocket Lab\u0027s Electron) has entered commercial service in time to provide said launch before the deadline. But Moon Express has apparently stated that they don\u0027t really care that much anymore, they\u0027d rather focus on their actual business case. Which still involves launching to the Moon on Electron, but later in the year. Think of that what you will, I guess?\u003Cbr\u003E\n- International team Synergy Moon decided to bet on Interorbital System\u0027s Neptune N36 rocket for their ride to space. In fact, the team went as far as merging with Interorbital Systems. But this rocket has never flown to date. In fact, it has never even been tested. They had planned to test a single-core version, the Neptune N1, in Q4 2017, but\u00A0missed that date. And it\u0027s quite a ways to scale from one core to thirty-six. If this team ever launches at all, it will probably be no earlier than 2019-2020.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe X-Prize foundation said that they\u0027re considering keeping the competition alive in spirit - by no longer having a prize pool but still potentially awarding winner\u0027s honors. They are also open to other sponsors stepping in to replace Google and providing a new prize pool. But this is not a concrete plan, just speculation about possibilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-24T08:41:07Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2018 08:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-24T13:55:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point I would just give it to Moon Express.
