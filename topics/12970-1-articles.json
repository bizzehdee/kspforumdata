When your design is lacking (mine always are) the keyboard controls become so twitchy even in precision mode but with the stick (haven\\\u0027t used one in ten years) everything got significantly easier. I labelled a few of the buttons so I can access RCS controls (in all directions), SAS hold and toggle, precision mode, map, throttle, landing gear, warp controls and staging pretty much all with my right hand - with better rotation control on top of it all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one disadvantage I see to using a stick in KSP is camera control unless you have one of those flash sticks with a cursor or you never use RCS and bind the hat swich to camera control (wish there was a fixed \u0027from behind-and-above\u0027 camera mode for aircraft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO I really recommend checking out a few sticks - for KSP I reckon you want something with lots of buttons, a throttle, twist (for roll control) and a hat switch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(~third post on these forums ~third post about joysticks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
