Currently there is something in Smokescreen to so that : activating collision. The problem is that it is really slow.\n\nUnity does not allow for the creation of proper colliding particles from script (Unity advanced \u0022Shuriken\u0022 particle system does not allow much scripting so far). Once/When KSP move to Unity 5 I\u0027ll be able to play with asset bundle (or whatever replace them) and that should allow for some use of Shuriken from mods.\n\nTLDR; : no."},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T13:49:45Z","Content":"at least you tried leaving me with problem 2.

Understanding the MLP is the key part of the launch structures- I find that moving a rocket from A to B (albeit at a painful slow rate) is an interesting one- especially when you\u0027ve made something within RSS and make it work- the size would be astounding.\n\nWhat I\u0027m saying is- I\u0027m willing to go into the painful detail but sadly it isn\u0027t an option at the moment... besides FASA has launch clamps and all that already but if they could open up a compatibility for this mod (if not adopt it) so that players can take realism to the next level using Infernal Robotics to assemble their rockets in a self-made VAB by hand realistically then move it onto the CT for it to be moved to the FASA launch clamps finalizing the realism of pre-launch procedures. I\u0027ve been there... there\u0027s a lot to it.\n\nAlso- new thought- Anyone made a mod that adds lightning towers? I\u0027ve been to 3 launches here recently and just realized KSP (granted lacking weather of any sort on stock) lacks the lightning rods (I know they have a better name but I can\u0027t remember)...
