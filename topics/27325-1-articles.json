I\u0027ve been lurking here in the forums for the last couple of weeks, since I first purchased the game on Steam. I haven\u0027t really felt like I\u0027ve had much, if anything to contribute to all the posts I\u0027ve read, but they\u0027ve certainly helped me along in learning some of the more advanced features of the game (I\u0027m still trying to figure out the node system to make it beyond the Mun. Thus far, I\u0027ve only managed a successful round-trip to the Mun, but have sent many, many missions off to Duna that have wound up drifting off into the deep reaches of space with no remaining fuel LOL!) In any case, I\u0027ve already logged 106 hours playtime (according to Steam), and while I\u0027ve had a lot more failure than success, I have to say that I\u0027ve NEVER had so much FUN at failing at a game!! In fact, I even managed to get one of my brothers to try the demo, and he got hooked on that, and also bought the game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKudos to the developers, as I\u0027ve wanted a game like this for as long as I can remember.

So if it takes the devs more time to get the next update out, I\u0027m ok with that. I knew when purchasing it, that I was getting an alpha product, and so I already came in knowing that updates don\u0027t always get released at their expected time, due to things like last-minute bugs and such that are found and need to be fixed before releasing.
