However, textures are no longer assigning themselves to the models. Let me explain.\n\nI\u0027ve been following a couple of tutorials on using Unity, namely Nifty255 on Youtube. I followed these tutorials when first generating the mod, and it worked fine...but now, not so much. Here is my process....\n\n1. Create part and collider in Blender\n2. Paint .png texture in photoshop (based on Blender UV map)\n3. Export part as .fbx\n4. Import .23 part tools into Unity (4.6.3f1)\n5. Import model and texture into Unity\n6. Assign texture to material\n7. Assign PartTools to new GameObject\n8. Migrate the model to the GameObject\n9. Assign Collision Mesh to Collider\n10. Write GameObject as \u0022model.mu\u0022\n\nI then move the model.mu to the Gamedata folder as well as the .png texture. I rename the texture as model000.png. Thus my file structure is as such:\n\nGameData \u003E JAT \u003E Converter \u003E model.mu\n\nGameData \u003E JAT \u003E Converter \u003E model000.png\n\nGameData \u003E JAT \u003E Converter \u003E part.cfg\n\nI have tried many model declarations in my .cfg, and currently it reads:\n\n    PART{    // --- general parameters ---    name = JAT_Converter_25    module = Part    author = Kalloran    // --- asset parameters ---    mesh = model.mu    // --- node definitions ---    node_stack_top = 0.0, 0.275, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0,2    node_stack_bottom = 0.0, -0.2576, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0,2\n\nI have also tried\n\n            // -- asset parameters ---        MODEL{                model = JAT/Converter/model                texture = Diffuse, JAT/Converter/model000        }\n\n**In either case, the model shows up in KSP as a white part with no texture. Help!**\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n**Ok figured it out.....apparently renaming the texture .png is a BAD idea......**"}]}
