Probably something dumb to report today. Last night I decided to do a \u0022static firing\u0022 test of an individual Turbojet and an individual RAPIER engine on the runway just to get some data on those. With FAR in effect, a single Turbojet puts out 88 kN on the runway while a RAPIER does 80 kN, if anyone\u0027s curious. Now, what I did with that data was calculate a mass-per-engine guideline based on eddiew\u0027s earlier suggestion of a 0.75 TWR on the Runway. Given those thrust values and TWR target, a guideline of 11.75 tonnes per Turobjet or 10.75 tonnes per RAPIER is suggested. The actual values are somewhat larger than that but they aren\u0027t cut and dry; these values give a TWR ever so slightly greater than 0.75.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, last night I designed a new plane to test the guideline - turned out to be a 17 tonne craft with dual Turbojets. 100 m/s takeoff. Hit Mach 1 at 7k and Mach 2 around 17k, and topped out at Mach 4.2 at 30k - so I take it that was actually too much thrust? Perhaps a better thing to do is to use the guideline to figure out how many engines you need but then limit the thrust based on the plane\u0027s final mass. That\u0027d take some math but math rarely daunts me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill not sure about a rule of thumb for an Intake to Engine ratio; does 0.03 intake area per engine still apply or not?

Unlike stock, where drag depends on the mass of the craft, and performance is therefore closely linked to TWR, FAR also looks at the shape of your airframe.

SSTOs can absolutely be made to fly with less, but the flight to orbit can be painful. My preference is to take a two engine plane with 1.0 TWR over a single with 0.55, since the latter will spend a lot more time flying in atmosphere and need much more optimisation. A high TWR can blast you through trouble zones, and multiple gimballing engines can counter a lot of instability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy general thoughts on intakes is \u0027one shock cone plus something else\u0027 per engine. The something else shouldn\u0027t be a 2nd shock cone, but could be a radial engine body or structural intake. Remember that each one you add increases the drag and slows you down.

If it was a gentle creep to the limit then it locked you there that\u0027d be fine, but - as you\u0027ve found - it tends to completely cut your pitch control whenever you go over what it deems a safe limit and you lose the climb. Much better to manage the pitch yourself and try to \u0027feel\u0027 where the tipping/flipping point is.

Some build guides suggest putting them on top of each other, but that\u0027s actually really bad for stability since it\u0027ll fly either way round just as happily, but you\u0027ll have a monster of a task actually reverting it if it does turn around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso watch out for the order that tanks drain; a common thing is that the front tank empties first so all the fuel weight is at the back - an easy scenario not to have looked at while in the SPH, since generally everyone focusses on the wet and dry CoMs only, not the intermediates. The only way I know to have a totally stable CoM at all fuel levels is to have fuel only in the nacelles, and have them dead centred on the CoM of the plane.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbove 25-30km, pretty much everything gets slippery until 40-45, and there\u0027s not a lot you can do about it. If the FAR calcs window says 25km @ mach4 is stable, the plane is respectable. 30@5 is superb, but not required. Best advice I have is make sure you\u0027ve got a reaction wheel, and if you have vernors, put some on the nose and activate RCS, because that will really help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO it\u0027s also possible for a tailfin to be too responsive if it\u0027s a canard or control surface. You can find that you tap yaw, and you end up overshooting and pointing further to the other side than you were originally off course in the other direction - which escalates in a series of over-corrections until you get a flat spin. I agree with Wanderfound that wing pieces make the best tailfins, since most of the area will be rigid with only a small control surface behind it. If that\u0027s clearly too large for the plane, you can try reducing the control deflection or yaw % that\u0027s assigned to the fins. You really don\u0027t need a lot of yaw authority, it\u0027s only for minor adjustments; for bigger turns, roll into them and let the nose come round on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for DCA - dynamic control adjustment. As I understand it, FAR will dial back the sensitivity of your controls as your speed increases. Seems to be to stop you trying to change course so fast that your plane falls apart. Seems to be some level of compensation for having lead fingers or a badly designed plane that tends to oscillate, but mostly it just gets in the way and prevents making a course/pitch change with any decent speed.
