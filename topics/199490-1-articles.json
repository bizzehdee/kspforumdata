I\u0027m happy to submit something to this challenge to exemplify that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dnbattley","CreatedById":176526,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-12T11:34:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission update: as expected, the drive type is important here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I did take your comment about \u0022orbital station\u0022 literally, and download a ISS replica from Steam workshop and put it up with some kraken drives to power it. Inevitably, the chief problem was a) finding centre of mass and b) ensuring the whole station was sufficiently \u0022strutted up\u0022 to avoid excessive flexing during the burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what happened:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aQpRWpy.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/aQpRWpy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the station. I did check the mass but appear to have forgotten to write it down. Something like 160T IIRC. You can just about see the tug I attached (in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, before cheating the whole station into orbit) in the foreground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022doRaj1c.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/doRaj1c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe zompi drive worked, but with 0.1g thrust (generated by 24 docking ports) it would be a slow process getting anywhere. It was pretty stable, however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022j76xcma.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/j76xcma.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe landing leg drive, to my surprise, worked absolutely fine (here there are two LY01 landing wheels under compression from two inflatable docking ports), accelerating the station to 0.345g. This would be fine for getting to Jool without losing too much of your life, and was mostly stable, although the screen does shake slightly disconcertingly for such a large, relatively floppy vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Y6iz5T7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Y6iz5T7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell... this got awkward. I had two vector engines tuned up via the KAL exploit. At the absolute minimum thrust it accelerated the station to 0.5g, but then I added another *miniscule* amount of throttle (see picture) and the engines took off and blasted straight through the station, cleaving it in half.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... in summary a double landing leg drive seems to be fine for the purpose, but ensuring a strong enough connection to the core superstructure is the key challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the second part of the challenge: to demonstrate how they are made, I\u0027ll direct you to my video on the topic:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/izmjZJW5nrA?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Terminal Velocity","CreatedById":209328,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-12T16:41:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncool looks great. it looks like a great attempt.
