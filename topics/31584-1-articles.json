The problem I\u0027m having now is, how do I land on then have enough delta-v to return to orbit on Laythe? Since Laythe is sort of like a mini Kerbin, it seems to make sense to test landers on Kerbin, but I can\u0027t get anything even close to a lander that can land on Kerbin then make it back to orbit. I know Laythe would require less but I\u0027m not comfortable going there with a lander that can only land on Kerbin then make it about 10,000 meters up before running out of fuel. I\u0027ve tried so many combinations of parachutes and rockets and radial couplers, even tried making the lander detach into literally just a seat strapped to a fuel tank and some thrusters and nothing is even close to anything I\u0027d attempt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone got some tips on how I get off of laythe without having to build a whole dang rocket on Laythe to do it? I haven\u0027t messed with jet engines and wings yet, they only cause massive headaches when you are trying to take off of Kerbin and transition to vacuum, and can\u0027t imagine the headache of trying to use them to exit Laythe and have something go wrong that requires restarting the entire journey from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-05T23:03:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2013 11:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by mcbmaestro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S\u1D04\u026A\u0274\u1D1B\u026A\u029F\u029F\u1D00\u1D1B\u1D0F\u0280","CreatedById":69027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T23:28:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#006400;\u0022\u003ELaythe has less gravity and a thinner atmosphere than Kerbin.

A 2 man lander can with two 360l fuel tanks can do that with an aerospike. Use the wide 360l fuel tanks, stack them under the lander can, add engine and landing legs and you\u0027ve got it. You might want to add a 3rd fuel tank to give some wiggle room, check the thrust to weight ratios though, I can\u0027t remember off the top of my head if an aerospike can lift that much on Laythe. . . I want to say it can though, if only barely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chemieglennie","CreatedById":60180,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T07:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing to think about is that you\u0027ll probably land on water, so don\u0027t make a tall thin lander like I did the first time!
