A few missions to Mun, or fewer to Minmus and the tech tree was unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make it harder, in 0.23.5 I edited tree.cfg and multiplied the science needed for each node. Top tier nodes were 7000 science each. I felt I was working for my science and every milestone reached (suborbital, orbital, munar/minmus fly by/orbit/landing and then deep space exploration) gave me the science needed to unlock new tech to go for the next milestone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.24.. how can I edit the tech tree???
