And dV isn\u0027t the problem, TWR is. With boosters, it\u0027s fine, but after that, it\u0027s ridiculously low. While it does have over 8km/s dV, it simply can\u0027t apply it fast enough for some reason. I thought about drag, because it\u0027s the highest at low altitudes, where the rocket has the most TWR.

Default Kerbin (and currently rescaled Kerbin) use a simple exponential pressure scale, known as the legacy pressure implementation. Planets can switch to using the newer system that allows you to specify pressure as a function of altitude using a curve.
