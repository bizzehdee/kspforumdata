I read some forum posts and fiddled with the Nividia Control Panal settings followinf some suggestions. Afterward I noticed a slight increase in FPS but also getting instability. Stuff like game would freeze up and then come back to life randomly but would look all foggy out at launchpad, game would stutter randomly and I would get flashing and weird graphical glitches. Once or twice I got a crash to desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI reset everything back to default both on Nividia Control Panel and in KSP settings but problem persisted. Finally I uninstalled and the reinstalled the program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought everything was fixed. The game was playing fine for about 10-15 mins then out of nowhere system blue screened on me. After restart I ran stress tested my system with prime95 and no stability problems. I then ran CineBench and some GPU heavy Benchmarks (Unigine Superpostion 1080P High) just to make sure everything was running tip top. No issues system seems to be purring like a kitten.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no mods installed. I am at a loss. I am running the x64 version. The only other thing I can think of is the new Nvidia Driver just installed today and I have had issues in past with other games after installing new GPU drivers.
