Which is where looking into the future patch conics is required for getting a closest approach for a celestial body. This of course only works when you have an encounter already, so is not a great solution. It could use the same system that a vessel closest approach would require, but I am hesitant to even contemplate this work until I can put a fair amount of time into it. As the process of iterating over an orbit in time fragments could prove very costly with large orbits. Requiring many thousands of iterations every frame if done without optimisations. An optimisation which does come to mind would be segmenting the orbit and working towards ever smaller segments, much like how a binary search algorithm works. This may sound simple to implement, but nothing is as simple as it seems and will more than likely require a fair amount of time to get working and then balance. That is if such an optimisation would even work, as there\u0027s a chance that it\u0027ll fall flat on its head given highly eccentric orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dzikakulka","CreatedById":116606,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T22:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I believe it wouldn\u0027t be worth the time spent if you say so \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for veeery simple stuff that would be mildly applicable here, once I\u0027ve wondered if I can somehow get some readings from these already diplayed in KSP, or maybe intercept them as they are initiated or something (yeah I know that sounds dumb) so I could draw a damn window open all the time and put e.g. closest approach there as I like to have stuff in one place.
