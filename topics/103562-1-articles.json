You enter map view, and you can see the side of Mun facing Kerbin, but the side opposite is a complete blur. Duna and Eve are very low resolution, and Eeloo the moons of Jool aren\u0027t even there at all. You access the info for these bodies, and much of the information (mass, gravity, atmosphere) is either unknown or an approximation.\n\nIn order to unlock this information, you have to do science. There could be a new building at KSC, a telescope, that as you upgrade gives clearer pictures of distant bodies. Orbital telescopes could be constructed that would further this. You could also attach cameras to probes and send them out to the body. Info about the atmosphere of Eve could only be obtained after sending the barometer there and using it, gravity by doing a gravity scan, etc. Imagine being able to click the info box on a body and watch as that information is filled in, as a record of what you\u0027ve accomplished. It would be a reason to keep doing science after you\u0027ve unlocked the tech tree, and to make science actually feel like science, instead of just some points you use to get tech.\n\nThoughts?"},{"CreatedByName":"CrayzeeMonkey","CreatedById":77712,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T23:44:09Z","Content":"I love this.\n\nWhen planets were first added in 0.17, i thought it was impossible to focus in on another planet by double clicking on it, and i\u0027ve always wanted to LEGITIMATELY get into orbit around one of the planets, i worked extremely hard to get these planets, building giant rockets and doing all sorts of calculations. \n\nUntil i accidentally double clicked a planet on the Tracking Station and was able to see Duna in full detail. After this I\u0027ve lost the will to explore, and i don\u0027t think the new career and science mode is very motivational (I think it\u0027s quite tedious and needs polishing). And i\u0027ve been building tanks (No, i mean the warry type) ever since.\n\nI\u0027d love to see this in the game and feel like legitimately exploring a new planet for Kerbal kind. I think these telescopes shouldn\u0027t provide too much detail, or not add them at all. If they are added, the data should be used as planning (As in, where to land)."},{"CreatedByName":"Twreed87","CreatedById":50017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T23:53:36Z","Content":"It feels wrong that I can look at Eeloo in full detail without ever having so much as sent a probe to it. Telescopes would get you only so much resolution (similar to what we have of Pluto while we wait for New Horizons to arrive), and probe cameras would increase that. The cameras could be similar to ScanSat, as you orbit above the terrain, it would be cleared up, with the resolution increasing by distance.\n\nThis would actually make me kinda wish I was coming into the game fresh. Imagine not know what planets are even out there, or what they\u0027re like. You get the telescope and discover Eeloo, but have only a vague idea how big it is, and you have no idea if it has an atmosphere or not. So you gotta send a probe first to find out.\n\nThis would a great addition to make when they get around to adding new planets, say GP2 and its moons. Then they don\u0027t realease any images of the new stuff, and wait for the community to discover it themselves (probably by just going into sandbox)"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T00:05:10Z","Content":"The one form of science I\u0027ve always felt was missing from KSP was the ability to determine the composition of a planet\u0027s soil, atmosphere and/or ocean through sample collection and statistical analysis - the more samples collected, the more accurate the composition pie chart would become.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E As may have been hinted by Squad in certain places, a resource system featuring sample collection / analysis / return as well as mining / processing / storage has been suggested for an as-yet undetermined future release of KSP.

I\u0027d argue that for replay you\u0027d also want the Kerbol system randomized (at least as an option) each game. Different size/mass worlds, different atmospheres, different orbits.\n\nScience from Kerbin would give you at least some idea of all the worlds (except perhaps very small moons). You\u0027d have masses, and gross atmospheric data, but details would need to be unlocked via real exploration. You don\u0027t even need easter eggs, just a system for creating possibly novel topographies (within reason) so that your first view upon sending a probe might be really amazing. \n\nSumghai has some great ideas, above. There was as similar discussion (not as nitty gritty) in a thread about cameras as parts a while back I posted some ideas:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Cameras could in addition provide USEFUL science. Not \u0022points,\u0022 but something you can use.\n\u003E Simple useful metric for cameras:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Add a value for the visual point of view altitude for map view. The farther from Kerbin a world is, the higher alt the *map* will be at full zoom, commensurate with what you could see from a telescope at Kerbin. Jool, Duna, Dres, for example will only \u0022zoom\u0022 in map view to about what you might see out the window of your pod at the first point the planet renders at all. Utterly useless, in other words. \n\u003E \n\u003E 2. Putting cameras near any world (SoI?) improves the POV altitude based upon the flyby distance, and camera type down to some altitude above current map POV minimum alt.\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Putting a camera in orbit drops it farther based upon the apoapsis and periapsis, and perhaps the inclination (require an inclined orbit at some level for a mapping mission, not just equatorial). With the better camera, and a high-gain antenna, the POV altitude then starts to improve upon the current situation, and at some level of mapping the map view would become as good as the \u0022real\u0022 view (allowing later players to plan landings on the Mun down to the smallest craters, for example, never really leaving map view if they like).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T12:51:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T14:06:50Z","Content":"I agree completely.

The game is presumably adding more functionality in the game for the late tech tree via resource scanning. Use it FOR SCIENCE! (and gameplay) by having scans free up map zoom down to seeing small hazards with enough data).\n\nFlyby mapping (generates less science broadly, but the amount varies based upon approach distance). With scansat-like stuff in stock, this can merely be a subset of the mapping.\n\nImpact probes combined with other instruments. (place seismometer, then impact the surface at some velocity, or impact at some high velocity and observe with an instrument in orbit (or at Kerbin, but with LOS)). This data can provide \u0022biome\u0022 info (really something other than biome for all but kerbin) as a map marker.\n\nSample return. This could mark geological markers on the map from the location taken (\u0022biomes\u0022).\n\nAtmospheric data (currently a thing, but nothing useful comes of it). Have this unlock suggestions about aerobraking? Or it might unlock trajectory paths through the atmosphere for accurate reentries (what that one mod does).\n\nScience from orbit (manned).
