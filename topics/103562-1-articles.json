You enter map view, and you can see the side of Mun facing Kerbin, but the side opposite is a complete blur. Duna and Eve are very low resolution, and Eeloo the moons of Jool aren\u0027t even there at all. You access the info for these bodies, and much of the information (mass, gravity, atmosphere) is either unknown or an approximation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to unlock this information, you have to do science. There could be a new building at KSC, a telescope, that as you upgrade gives clearer pictures of distant bodies. Orbital telescopes could be constructed that would further this. You could also attach cameras to probes and send them out to the body. Info about the atmosphere of Eve could only be obtained after sending the barometer there and using it, gravity by doing a gravity scan, etc. Imagine being able to click the info box on a body and watch as that information is filled in, as a record of what you\u0027ve accomplished. It would be a reason to keep doing science after you\u0027ve unlocked the tech tree, and to make science actually feel like science, instead of just some points you use to get tech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrayzeeMonkey","CreatedById":77712,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T23:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen planets were first added in 0.17, i thought it was impossible to focus in on another planet by double clicking on it, and i\u0027ve always wanted to LEGITIMATELY get into orbit around one of the planets, i worked extremely hard to get these planets, building giant rockets and doing all sorts of calculations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil i accidentally double clicked a planet on the Tracking Station and was able to see Duna in full detail.
