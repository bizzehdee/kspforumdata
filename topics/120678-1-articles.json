If you don\u0027t know, there was an attack on the former World Trade Center towers in New York City on this day in 2001. Many people were killed in the impact of Jetliners into the towers and the eventual collapse of these two towers. There were also a crash of a jetliner into the Pentagon and a crash into a Pennsylvania field. I\u0027d just like for you reading this to take a moment to remember these people and their families and all the firemen, police, paramedics, and volunteers that helped with rescuing people from the wreckage and that helped clean up the debris. Remember those of other nations who offered to and did help. Regardless of your religion, race, nationality, political affiliation, or belief in conspiracies, please take a little bit of time to remember everybody involved in this disaster. And please also remember that life is a precious thing, that it can be lost at any time, and that it is to be treasured and cherished every day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t get political in the discussion.
