After discovering coal and oil within their planet\u0027s crust, they used it to fuel the fires of many sorts of steam and combustion engines. They built factories, formed alliances, and eventually started arming themselves against one another. The Kerbal villages were fragmented and all had different ideas about who was the best. Finally all of the tribes went to all out war. The war lasted about two Kerbin years, destroying many buildings and using up lots of valuable resources. Finally the war ended, and the leaders of all the villages came together to unite Kerbin into a single state: The United Conglomeration of Kerbal Villages. The new system was a democratic system, where the population of Kerbin would vote for the president and governors. The villages expanded into small towns, and grew more. Railways were built connecting the towns, and life was peaceful and happy for about twenty years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut eventually tragedy struck. The coal mines at the K2 mountain range had been totally depleted, and the nearby offshore oil rig had been sucked dry. The price of oil and coal went up, and it was realized that the planet was a lot smaller than they thought it was. The President of Kerbin, Mr. Johnfitz Kerman, called for the creation of a program that would eventually lead to the exploration and exploitation of the heavenly bodies: The Kerbal Space Program. The idea behind the K.S.P. was to invest what little resources Kerbin had left into getting resources back from the other planets, exploring the interesting properties of the other worlds along the way. The old oil refinery east of the K2 mountain range was converted into the Kerbin\u00A0Spaceport Complex, or KSC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn his way home from the grand opening ceremony of the KSC, Johnfitz Kerman was killed by an ironic meteor strike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince then, many politicians have suggested that the Kerbal Space Program is a complete and total waste of resources, and have done everything in their power to sour the space program\u0027s reputation. They\u0027ve thoroughly slashed the space program\u0027s budget, and have constantly tried to limit the amount of progress they can make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNevertheless, the people of Kerbin have always looked at the dots in the night sky with wonder, and they hope they will one day be able to travel to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Szn2a0D.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022514\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Szn2a0D.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGame Settings\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAllow Quicksaves and Quickloads\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCrew Permadeath\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EResource Abundance: 110%\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRe-entry Heating: 150% (Note: This requires save file editing)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStart Funds: $9000\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStart Reputation: -3%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFunds Gain: 10%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRep Gain: 50%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nScience Gain: 50%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFunds Loss: 150%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRep Loss: 150%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMods\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nToy Solar System\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRemoteTech\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTexture Replacer and Multicolor Suits Pack\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStock Replacement Assets\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAtomicAge (which would be pretty overpowered if I ever end up using it!)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCorvus pod\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSky Tonemapper\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlanetShine\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDistant Object Enhancement\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbal Engineer\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003ETHE\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKERBAL\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027comic sans ms\u0027, cursive;\u0022\u003EWILDS\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EFlight One\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EFat Arrow Arrow Mk1\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order for Dr. Wernher von Kerman to get approval to continue with the space agency\u0027s plan to put Kerbals in space continuously, he had to prove that a Kerbal could survive the low pressure environment of a near vacuum. The Fat Arrow Mk1 was built to fly a test pilot up to a high enough altitude that he could make sure the air-tight capsule would function properly. The conical pressure vessel contains the Kerbal pilot, and to get it up to altitude, a boiler has been filled with boompowder and has been welded to a cone-shaped nozzle to provide thrust. To guide it through the air, some thin bolt-on fins are attached, and to allow it to land safely, some girder segments left over from the construction of the VAB\u00A0have been placed on the bottom. While the Fat Arrow could be given more fuel and thrust, the thrust was limited to a quarter of maximum and uses only 42 units of boompowder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002204ZTPWN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/04ZTPWN.png\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Fat Arrow Mk1 was pulled to the launchpad by a tractor, where it was put upright. Jebediah got out of the tractor and eyed the rocket excitedly. Jebediah Kerman was the chosen pilot because he was known to be one of the best race car drivers. Jebediah Kerman was able to consistently win car races due to his special \u0022Jebediah Maneuver,\u0022 a maneuver which consists of the driver of the car in question replacing a low-speed with a flattened brain by going at high speed on the inner edge of the curve of the race track. Jebediah Kerman was very capable of handling the high gee forces, and was thus the obvious choice for a rocket rider.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SrEPY24.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SrEPY24.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah took out his portable radio. \u0022I\u0027m supposed to fly that thing?\u0022 he asked. \u0022No, you\u0027re supposed to just sit there and watch it fly up without you.\u0022 Said Gene Kerman, who was sitting in\u00A0mission control. Jeb frowned. \u0022OF COURSE YOU\u0027RE SUPPOSED TO FLY THAT THING!\u0022 Gene screamed. Jeb smiled, and climbed inside the capsule. It was nearly time for the rocket to launch. The radio inside the capsule clicked on. \u0022You\u0027ve got about a minute left until launch.\u0022 Gene said. Jebediah pressed the big red button that said \u0022Do not press this button until about one minute before the launch.\u0022 The small battery that was attached to the capsule was automatically unplugged. Jeb could hear a woman in the corner of the mission control room counting down to the launch. Gene Kerman asked the staff of mission control if they were ready. They all replied with something along the lines of \u0022Might work probably, maybe.\u0022 Ten seconds were left. \u0022Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.\u0022 Gene decided there was no point in postponing the launch, as it would probably not get much better than it is now. \u0022We are go for launch.\u0022 He said. Jeb smiled even more. \u0022Three. Two. One.\u0022 Jeb heard the \u0027one\u0027 and pressed the big button that was labeled \u0022BOOM.\u0022 With a fizzle, then a crackle, then a roar, the Fat Arrow flew into the skies above the Kerbin Spaceport Complex. The rocket only fired for a few seconds before it shut down, and the vessel began to slow down. As the altimeter passed 872 meters, the mission controllers applauded themselves and roared with joy. 872 meters was the previous Kerballed altitude record. The rocket continued upward, until finally gravity had won against momentum, and the maximum height of 13 hectometers was achieved. The parachute was deployed to slow Jeb\u0027s fall. The craft smacked onto the ground, but the girders kept the craft from exploding. Jebediah got out of the ship, which had landed just a few hundred meters from the launchpad. He promptly fell off the ladder, hit his head, and blacked out...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/FvGPL/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...the next thing he knew he woke up in a hospital with three nurses and Walt Kerman at his side.

The pilot, Jebediah Kerman, is best known for his skills on the racetrack. His experience with high gee forces will definitely help in the pursuit of space advancements. This mission will pave the way for future missions into space.

She remembered the Kerbal Space Program. The K.S.P. was the reason she was fired from her job as a test pilot. After all, if there\u0027s rockets going into space, what\u0027s the purpose of flying planes higher and faster? Valentina turned off the radio set. She looked at the scale model of The Heightflier, the aircraft she used to break the altitude record. She decided to turn the radio back on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radio made a fizzle sound, then a crackle sound, then a roaring sound. \u0022The rocket is going up!\u0022 said the reporter. \u0022Six hundred meters... Seven hundred... will it break eight?\u0022 He continued. The sounds of applause and celebration crackled through the radio\u0027s speakers. \u0022We have confirmation that the Fat Arrow has made it past 872 meters, the record for the highest altitude, previously set by fighter pilot Valentina Kerman!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s heart was torn out. This was the last straw. Not only did they get her fired, but they broke her one little bit of fame. She would never get the chance to get the record back. The reporter on the radio happily explained that the ship had now reached an altitude of 1.3 kilometers. Valentina was now too furious to listen. She turned the radio off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-29T00:43:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/29/2016 12:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-27T23:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnow, this is a cool idea. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nvery nice greg!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T00:26:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next day, Valentina was still upset.

She was walking home from her work at the factory, and everywhere she looked the world seemed to be rubbing the space program in Valentina\u0027s face. Newspaper racks showed the headlines about the space program, a shop played a song about rocketships, and a little kid was running around with a toy spaceship. She walked up to her apartment complex and stepped inside the dark, cold room. She was just about to pour herself a tall glass of grape juice, when she heard a knock at the door. She answered the door. Behind the door was a young kerbal who was wearing a Kerbal Postal Service uniform.\u00A0\u0022Hello ma\u0027am, I\u0027ve got a telegraph\u00A0for you.\u0022 He said.

It was a large facility. One side of the facility sported a dirt runway, the eastern end had planted on it a small launch plate. The facility itself was made up of lots of small buildings--some looked like factories, others like office buildings--clustered around one large factory building. A medium-sized factory building on the northern side near the runway was also visible, and had a tall-ish tower was attached to it. She recognized the tower as a flight control tower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe looked around the nearly empty train station for whoever it might be that they sent to wait for her. Suddenly the door of the station burst open, and the young Kerbal who had burst the door stopped to catch his breath. He looked up and around, and saw Valentina. \u0022Mrs. Valentina Kerman. I\u0027m so...\u0022 He paused to catch his breath. \u0022...so sorry for the delay.\u0022 The young Kerbal walked toward Valentina, and held out his hand. Valentina shook it. \u0022If you will come with me, I\u0027ll bring you the Astronaut Complex.\u0022 Said the young Kerbal. Valentina followed him to a white car that had the Kerbal Space Program logo on the side (The logo was the Ernest Kerman model of the atom, a dot which was drawn to look like Kerbin, and\u00A0three black dots around the planet in ellipse-shaped paths.) and sat down inside. \u0022What\u0027s your name?\u0022 she asked. \u0022My name is Linus Kerman. I\u0027m Wernher von Kerman\u0027s\u00A0intern. He was supposed to meet you but he got held up in some important rocketry meeting.\u0022 Said Linus. Valentina nodded. Linus parked the car just outside the astronaut complex building, where Valentina was let out. She entered the lobby of the astronaut complex, and retrieved her room key from the receptionist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe very next day, a meeting was held by Wernher von Kerman in the Research and Development facility about the future of the rocket programs and space travel. Valentina and Jebediah both attended alongside flight engineer Bill Kerman and mission scientist Bob Kerman. Jebediah still had a neck collar and a cast on his arm, so it was clear to Valentina that he would not be flying again any time soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the meeting a few important points were brought up. Wind tunnel\u00A0tests done by the former Kerbin Aeronautics Council had shown that parachutes can not be made to effectively slow a large payload down when they travel at high enough speeds, because the parachute would just fall apart. They realized that if enough energy was imparted to an object to get it into space( or even an orbit), then it would probably be coming back to the ground at a high enough speed to rip apart any chute. This was at first thought to be a major failure of the program, until an engineer suggested that the problem may be solved by using rocket power to slow the spacecraft enough that it would not tear off the chute. At first the other engineers laughed at him, because the control of a decent using rocket power had never been attempted. A solid rocket engine can not be re-ignited, and carrying two just so that one could be used to slow down would be tremendous overkill.\u00A0\u0022I propose\u0022 said the engineer \u0022that we use very small rockets on the side of the capsule to slow it down as it\u0027s passing through the atmosphere, enough that the parachutes could be deployed.\u0022 \u0022Where are we supposed to get these tiny rocket motors?\u0022 Wernher asked. The engineer replied \u0022I have a friend who works at a toy company, who says they can make larger versions of their toy rocket engines for this purpose. The company\u0027s called Maxo\u0027s, and the line of rocket engines are under the name \u0022Periapsis Co.\u0022 Wernher von Kerman smiled. \u0022I like that idea.\u0022 He pointed at Gene Kerman, who was standing in the corner of the room. \u0022Gene, I want you to call Periapsis Co right now and get them to make us some of those rocket engines.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a few days of designing, the Maxo Toys Incorperated line of Periapsis Co. rocket motors now included the huge model rocket engine \u0022D6000-V\u0022 The D is a measure of size.

The landing gear on the rocket booster is gone this time, as the capsule is detachable from the booster. The capsule is the same design as the one which flew on the Fat Arrow Mk1, but with a few minor changes. For one, there have been two important biological experiment modules (which were found in a dumpster) attached to the side of the capsule.

Valentina Kerman watched as the Fat Arrow Mk2 was raised vertical onto the launchpad, and walked toward it, very much ready to become the first astronaut and break Jebediah Kerman\u0027s altitude record. The mechanic who was operating the lift machine gave Valentina the thumbs up, and she walked toward the rocket. \u0022Hot dog!\u0022 she said with excitement, and started climbing the rocket to get inside the command pod. \u0022Val, don\u0027t say \u0027hot dog\u0027, unless you want the KETA to be after us!\u0022 Warned Walt Kerman over the radio. \u0022Fine, how about \u0027Hot Rod!\u0027\u0022 Valentina corrected. Valentina sat down in the chair. The rocket was very much unlike anything she had ever flown before, but she was confident she could fly and land it safely. The lady in the back of the mission control room began to count down, and Gene Kerman asked around the control desks to make sure everyone was ready. BOOSTER and FIDO were more confident than last time, but RECOVERY was much more hesistant. In the end, he gave the go ahead, and the Fat Arrow Mk2 was ready for launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Five. Four. Three. Two. One.\u0022 With a crackle, a spurt, and a huge roaring sound, the rocket ignited with much more force than the previous Fat Arrow, which had less fuel and lower thrust. Valentina immediately pitched the rocket over to about forty five degrees to avoid a high vertical velocity on return. The rocket engine only burned for a few seconds, and once it was burned out, the Valentina suddenly felt as though she were falling. She watched as she passed Jebediah\u0027s 1300 meter altitude record, and kept going higher and higher. While she was still in the air, she pressed the green button labeled \u0022SCIENCE ONE.\u0022 The doors opened on the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMystery Goo\u2122 Containment Unit\u003C/em\u003E, and the important data was gathered. Valentina watched the altimeter. It had passed seven kilometers, and she began to squeal with excitement as she realized she had passed the barrier between Not Space and Space. She pressed the red \u0022DETACH BOOSTER\u0022 button, and took out her notepad to write down some notes about the experience, stating that \u0022It looks a lot like I\u0027m in space now. The sky seems to be mostly below me.\u0022 She also noted a few of the important experiences of zero-gee, and then took out her Miniature Box Camera to take some pictures. She also remembered to deploy the second \u003Ci\u003EGoo\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0container and recorded the results. Tracking computers at mission control plotted Valentina\u0027s course from information at the time of engine burnout, and found her Apoapsis to be 32 kilometers. Valentina was now far beyond the range of mission control tracking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFat Arrow Mk2 and Valentina were now falling back to Kerbin. Val made sure to take some more pictures while she still could, and then realized that she had better prepare for re-entry. She would have to make sure she engaged the engines at the right altitude. She judged it by eye, and fired the engines slightly too high. The engines over corrected the velocity and briefly sent the capsule going upward. She deployed the parachute while still going upward causing the capsule to flip, and then to fall back down. The parachute deployed fully, and the capsule splashed down into the ocean. It would be a few hours before the retrieval boat could locate Valentina and retrieve her, but when they did they made sure to give her some warm food and a dry towel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/EKIhr/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe post-mission debriefing allowed Valentina to describe in detail her mission, and the medical scientists were more than happy enough to run a lot of physiological tests, none of which were particularly pleasant. The materials scientists and engineers were busy for the next few days in the research and development labs, disecting the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMystery Goo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0containers and examining what they had to say about how space works. The fascinating information given by the study of both Valentina\u0027s logs and the\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0Mystery Goo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0directly related to the research into the next generation of rockets: Liquid Bipropellant rocket engines. But that would come later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, many of the politicians of Kerbin believed that the Kerbal Space Program was still a waste of money. They further slashed the payment of the space program, but they could do nothing to sour the space program\u0027s growing prestige. People everywhere were talking about the exploration of the heavens, and no amount of political badmouthing could stop it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNonetheless, with the further reduced budget of the KSP, Wernher von Kerman was unable to continue with his plan for liquid fueled rockets. Clearly solid rocket power was capable of bringing an astronaut to space, but could they reach orbit? Probably. Could the reach the Mun? As far as the politicians were concerned, it would have to. As far as Wernher von Kerman was concerned, it might.

The Circling Arrow Mk1 was a two-stage booster with a Mk1\u00A0Capsule on top. The descent ring of the Mk1 Capsule has had four extra motors placed around the side to allow for manuevering of the capsule, two engines for each manuever. The Circling Arrow is so named because it will circle (or \u0022orbit\u0022) the planet Kerbin.\u00A0Like all launches before it, the radio inside the command pod is short range, which means that after launch the capsule will be going too high and too fast to talk to mission control. The pilot, once again Valentina Kerman, will follow a set of predetermined mission objectives while in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bJInhVJ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bJInhVJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the second time, Valentina Kerman stepped aboard a rocket with the intent to fly it into space. This new rocket was almost twice the size, and would be just as strange to fly. Unlike Fat Arrow, Circling Arrow does not have any winglets, meaning that the rocket is more vulnerable to piloting mistakes flipping the rocket over. By this point, the pre-launch counts before the launch of a rocket had become routine, but this was a new rocket, and that worried the mission control groups. Nevertheless, they were all polled \u0022Go\u0022 for launch. Ten seconds later, the first stage of the Circling Arrow ignited with a hiss and a roar (the hiss comes from the four extra D6000-Vs mounted on the side) and the rocket flew skyward. A few seconds later, the first stage was used up and Valentina pressed the big DETACH button to sever the first stage from the second. After waiting a few seconds as the rocket rose further under its own momentum, Valentina ignited the second stage, and was pressed back in her seat as the mighty thrust of the Circling Arrow, unhampered by atmospheric drag, winglets, or low atmospheric engine efficiency. The booster ran out of fuel and was detached as Valentina watched the altimeter rise. This time she was not breaking the altitude record, but the speed record. At this point she was the fastest Kerbal to ever live, travelling at an astounding 700 meters per second. In the absence of onboard flight computers or calculators, she would have to wait until her vertical speedometer started leveling out in order to find her apoapsis. About five minutes later, Valentina saw the vertical speed drop to zero and she fired the first set of maneuvering thrusters to place the craft into a stable\u00A0elliptical orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbin Spaceport Complex\u0027s Tracking Station had no capability to communicate with the Circling Arrow, but it could watch each time it flew past the sky above KSC. After two or so orbits, the mathematicians and physicists could say with some reasonable certainty what Valentina\u0027s orbit looked like. They figured out that the orbit was an elliptical orbit\u00A0of a periapsis 27 kilometers and apoapsis 30 kilometers. They knew that Valentina was authorized to stay in orbit for one day plus or minus one hour, so they had several windows figured out for when to watch for Valentina\u0027s re-entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring her orbits, she had a lot of time alone to think, take pictures, write, and draw. She took lots of pictures of Kerbin from space, as well as Mun, Minmus, and the Sun. Every time she passed over\u00A0the Kerbin Spaceport Complex, she took a picture and watched for any sign of change, just in case they were trying to message her from down there. At the T\u002B2 hour mark, she ate her lunch. It was a couple of biscuits with some green paste that the packaging department claimed was \u0022gravy, stop asking so many questions.\u0022\u00A0After the T\u002B3 hour mark, she ate her dinner, a couple of cubes of what appeared to be rice and corn. At the T\u002B3:30 mark, she set her alarm clock, turned off the cabin lights, rotated the capsule window away from the Sun, and tried to sleep. Two hours later, she woke up and ate her breakfast, a packet of powdered eggs and water, and a bagged cup of coffee. She had one hour left in orbit before she was meant to return, and she took the last of her pictures before calculating the return. If she wanted to return to KSC, she would have to fire the retropack on the opposite side of the planet. She passed over KSC and started the timer, waiting until she passed by KSC once again. After finding the orbital period, she divided it by two and waited that long to fire the second set of maneuvering rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally it was time to re-enter. She pointed the Circling Arrow along the retrograde vector of her orbit so the rocket blast would slow the craft down instead of speeding it up. She was not equipped to calculate the orbit at this point, but was assured by engineers that \u0022it would probably be fine unless you screw it up.\u0022 As far as Valentina was aware, she didn\u0027t screw it up. A few minutes later, Kerbin was looking larger in the window and seemed to be rolling much faster. Valentina pointed the craft retrograde once more as the atmosphere gauge registered a thin, tenuous pressure. She could not directly see the KSC, but she did know her maps, and she could see the ground directly below her. Right as she saw the west foothills of the K2 mountains fly by the window she smacked the \u0022SLOW THE F*** DOWN\u0022 button, and braced herself against the extreme deceleration forces that brought the Circling Arrow capsule from 650 m/s to 50 m/s in just a couple of seconds. Immediately she popped the parachute open and relaxed as she knew she was finally safe. A few seconds later, the Circling Arrow hit the ground, and Valentina smiled. She waited in the command pod for a few minutes until she heard a knock on the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/P0dzU/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcitedly, she opened the door, stepped out of the capsule, and found a vehicle waiting for her with some recovery teams. Valentina posed with her capsule before riding back to the astronaut complex. She was excited to talk with Kerbals after her day of being totally alone in the strictest possible sense. Valentina had come to a knew understanding about life, consciousness, and the fragility of the small green-blue ball she called home. She knew it was her job, and the job of all Kerbalkind, to save it. This reinforced her view on the space program, and she really realized that the only way the world was going to get through the economic crisis was to get raw materials from the other worlds. She set her eyes on the thin crescent of the Mun as she walking into the astronaut complex to rest. \u0022Let\u0027s go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T02:10:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been loving\u00A0reading these. \u00A0It\u0027s really interesting to see a career mode with TSS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andem","CreatedById":155578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-02T01:41:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t want to poke any bears, but...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmoar, i guess?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-05T02:19:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222700887\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221470102071\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022155578\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Andem\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/1/2016 at 9:41 PM, Andem said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t want to poke any bears, but...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmoar, i guess?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003ENo, sorry.
