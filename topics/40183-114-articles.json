I have built a variety of SSTO spaceplanes that, for role playing purposes, I land and refuel at KSC rather than recovering and relaunching. So the SSTOs are all old vessels which makes it impossible to complete crew transfer, civilian, repair or resupply contracts with them. Which, in real life, would really be their primary purpose...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo would it be possible to change the \u0022new vessel\u0022 requirement for such contracts to instead require \u0022landed at Kerbin\u0022 before allowing any other contract objectives to complete? That way you could reuse vessels without cheating and keeping them in orbit to just complete contracts over and over.Basically the idea is to have a \u0022new launch\u0022 rather than \u0022new vessel\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you could internally track the date of last launch for each vessel (such as any transition from \u0022landed at Kerbin\u0022 to \u0022flying\u0022 or \u0022low in space\u0022) and require this date to be after the contract accept date. That should work for planes and rockets, and still allow new vessels as well. Maybe in time it could even be extended to allow launches from other planets or moons with established mining bases to resupply their orbital transfer stations...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment I\u0027m rather sad that my SSTOs are gathering dust in front of the SPH...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jd284","CreatedById":139444,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T22:46:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOops, I guess you can (mostly) disregard my above feature request.
