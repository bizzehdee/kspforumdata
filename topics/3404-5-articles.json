Did it yesterday after a few attempts. First landing was successful, but when I disengaged SAS the lander toppled over (was parked on a tilted surface). Second landing came in at just a bit too high a vertical velocity, decoupling the engine from the tank. Funny thing is, I had a full tank of RCS beneath the capsule, then a decoupler, then the tank and engine that got knocked off. So I decoupled the capsule \u002B RCS and actually managed to get back home. It was a close shave - almost didn\\\u0027t have enough. Spent almost the last of the RCS fuel setting the periapsis inside Kerbin atmo for some aerobreaking. If I had a few seconds of RCS less the capsule would have never come home. Even managed to hit water on the way back by timing my chute deployment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing after that went great. I landed on a flat surface, the lander was secure with SAS off. Had almost a full liquid tank left and full RCS. Therefore more than enough to get home. Then I decided to go for an \u0027immersive experience\u0027 and switched on time warp so they actually spend 2 days on the Mun. It used to only be possible to get 2x time warp when on the Mun surface but now I was able to get it to maximum. Everything was ok, 2 days went by, my craft stood stable. Then I switched back to 1x time warp and my ship immediately exploded. Well, everything beneath the capsule did, anyway. I only used stock parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, basically, I only managed to get my astronauts back safely once after landing on the Mun (using just stock parts, and only RCS to return), the other missions went wrong due to silly reasons.. But there was enough fuel to get them back on each occasion. At least I got a lot better at landings, I\\\u0027m having much less problems killing horizontal velocity now which results in a much higher number of safe landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\\\u0027ll see what pics I grabbed when I get back home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmiteZero","CreatedById":10862,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-16T13:19:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENewman, learn to use paragraphs, dude. 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newman","CreatedById":11547,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-16T13:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappens when you\\\u0027re doing 3 things at once \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Edited for great justice.

Needed to use the ASAS and careful throttle control due to the RCS tanks not draining evenly, but I did it. On a slope. On the dark side. Got a bit off the ground, detached the landing stage, and rocketed into a large and eccentric orbit, then a near-vertical decent from Ap into the ocean for a splashdown. There was still a good amount of fuel left, and I bet someone more skilled than I can manage to land it at the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that much of a massive challenge anymore, thankfully, but it still took some work..
