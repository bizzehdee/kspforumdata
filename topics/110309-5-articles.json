It would be nice to have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d, personally, like and enjoy some form of an aero cap that would fit over the docking port of both versions. If I made parts, it\u0027d probably be a nice domed cap, though slightly sharper than the stock \u0022nose cap\u0022 part, so a nice middle ground. There are two ways to make this happen(at least in my mind \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe super simple method.:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUse a strong decoupling force and by using part parameters in it\u0027s config to offset the mass towards one side to off balance it making it decouple towards the direction of the offset. The downside of using this simple method is that if you offset the mass of that one part and you use it on your vehicle, the rest of the craft would be affected with the offset mass of that part until it\u0027s removed. That\u0027s just how the offset parameter works.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe slightly more complex method(s), I say it that way as it\u0027s virtually the same concept, just placed in three different spots and requires a bit more work.:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHave a single thruster built into the cap that would be on the bottom to force the cap upwards, but, at the same time to the side because the thruster would be offset to one of the four corners of the cap.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe second method would be instead of having the thruster on the bottom of the cap, it would be directly on one of the four sides. This would cause the most thrust laterally, and unlike pointing the thruster towards the vessel, wouldn\u0027t cause damage to the vessel by exhaust of the thruster (plus you get the benefit of being more \u0022realistic\u0022!).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe third is a compromise, yet I feel it would be the best to way to build the part. This version would still have the thruster on the side of the cap gaining all of the same benefits as Version two above, but instead of pointing the thruster directly 90\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u003C/strong\u003E to the side, it would instead point 45\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 \u003C/strong\u003Eto the side and upwards. This would cause enough lateral momentum to get the cap out of the way, but at the same time you would also gain some vertical momentum to help keep the cap away from primary vessel since it\u0027\u0027s most likely still gaining speed. If you still want to talk about the \u0022realism\u0022 factors with these ideas, I feel this would be the best choice for the job.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last three ideas posted all have what I\u0027m about to say in common and would probably all include them, so I\u0027m listing this as a single message. I\u0027m thinking the thruster would be powered via SolidFuel. For the job of making the part, you\u0027d make one of the last three versions listed, and incorporate the thruster in the part itself. In the config is all of the typical stuff, but the main being the \u0022ModuleEngine\u0022 for the thruster and the obvious \u0022ModuleDecouple\u0022 information. If I could actually make the part (Making the model and the textures. Sadly I\u0027m just a config / MM warrior \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E ), I\u0027d chose the third, final, option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d probably set the ModuleDecouple using the bottom node with a force somewhere between the 100 - 150 mark, maybe up to 250 for the bigger cap in the 2.5m option. Thruster / thrust transform would need extremely little fuel but a big punch, For the 1.25m version I\u0027m thinking a max thrust between 35 - 45 with about 3.5 units of SolidFuel; for the 2.5 a thrust of max thrust of 45 - 55 with about 5 units of SolidFuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal little notes for full clarity if you even make this idea an actual part or read all that I typed at this point (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E), when I mean \u0022on one of the four sides of the cap\u0022, I\u0027m talking about each 90\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u003C/strong\u003E angle of the cap. With the third \u0022more complex\u0022 option I listed, I\u0027d put the thruster on one 90\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 \u003C/strong\u003Eangles underneath towards on side, or on the side. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be ideal that the thruster be orientated so that it goes either left or right after the jettison as that would provide the most (85 - 95 % sure) assurance that you won\u0027t hit the cap at all, leaving a nice, clean sep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a quick example of the third example that I talked about the most. The box with the arrow pointing towards it shows the torque value and the thrust that a sep motor placed in the configuration I described above. I used two parts used here because an AeroCap with a sep motor doesn\u0027t exist for this pack (yet, but I sure do hope so soon). I also included the information about the sep motor that was used so you could get an idea about the power / fuel needed.
