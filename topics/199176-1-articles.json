I bind the deploy angle of the rotors to the main throttle however this, i believe, seen as it is a constant input, will override any other inputs such as the translate or custom axis groups. I have\u00A0 thus been experimenting with using activation sets to change the input from the main throttle to custom axis 1 (which is mouse 4 - 3) using the \u0027Override Default\u0027 box ticked, however this seems to cause some issues in the sense that it overrides all default controls such as pitch yaw and roll in both the control surfaces and reaction wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way to fix or work around this?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
