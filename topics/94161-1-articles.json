I was thinking that for example there is some limitation of transmit from very far away planets but it seems there is no such thing. It would be interesting that they make like some limitations. For example add some interferences and other limitations in transfers so when you are maybe sending some probe far away and plan to transmit science you might be forced to use bigger antennas that are for that kind of job instead the small ones that could be weak and could hinder your transmitted data so for example you get a message from KSP that data got corrupted and lose some science points since you did that with some low tier antenna. What you guys think about this? I think it would be great and add also another level in design phase and mission conduct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T16:04:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eseaces: The main thing that stops antennae working over extreme distances isn\u0027t interference - it\u0027s that the signal disperses so much that it\u0027s indistinguishable from background noise (stars and so on also give off low levels of radio waves). I do however think a distance-based limitation would be good for stock. RemoteTech basically provides this (if you disable the signal delay) although this is probably a little too complex for stock, seeing as you basically need to launch a satellite network \u003Cstrong\u003Ebefore\u003C/strong\u003E you can really use probes for anything (they lose control if they don\u0027t have a signal connection to KSC). You can of course do this using the direct line-of-sight to KSC for the first couple satellites, but that requires a very inefficient flight path or a ridiculously high TWR to get apoapsis high enough before you lose connection from orbiting beyond the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T16:46:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the stock game all antennae have unlimited range.
