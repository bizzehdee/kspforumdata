You fly your primary payload to wherever it goes, and along the way, FMRS keeps track of anything that you drop that has a source of control on it (i.e. a probe core or cockpit). Once your payload is in a stable situation, you can jump back in time to the moments of separation, stabilize the spent stages, and then jump back to your main mission, with everything taken care of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-1-0-2-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-6-%285-15-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStageRecovery\u003C/a\u003E does something similar, but simpler: it just intercepts the deletion of a discarded stage (whether it has a probe or not) and turns it into recovery. You get science, crew, and funds back, depending on its terminal velocity (read: if it has a parachute or two attached) and how far downrange from KSC it is. You don\u0027t get any control over the recovery, but it\u0027s a simpler process, so there\u0027s less risk of anything bugging out (FMRS is pretty stable now, but I\u0027m always a bit wary of weird temporal mechanics).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t even have to choose one or the other -- StageRecovery won\u0027t recover any spent stages that FMRS is \u0022tracking\u0022, so they can coexist peacefully.
