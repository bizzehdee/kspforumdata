With the current way of playing, they\u00A0could roll out probes completely, because capsules are very overpowered in comparison to them. They\u00A0should first add starter 0.625m tanks and engines, with a sounding rocket probe core. Not starting with 1.25m capsule, tanks and engines straight away. More science experiments would be nice too.\u003Cbr\u003E\nP.S.
