I\u0027ve searched the forum and mods and haven\u0027t sussed out an answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example: If I have a symmetrical lander and forgot to tag it with an orientation marker, once it\u0027s on the ground and I\u0027ve moved the view around, I have no way of knowing in what direction that interesting crater to the left is so I can hop over to it. I have enough fuel to make it, but not enough if I first have to lift off and jiggle my craft around to figure out its orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, relative to the coordinates of the current SoI (or maybe just on the surface), a sort of compass reading on where we\u0027re looking would be convenient. That, combined with the navball heading are enough to tell you to \u0022go that-a-way\u0022. I currently have NavHUD available for the sole purpose of figuring out where north is on those occasions when I want to jump over to some interesting biome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Miro Beero","CreatedById":67935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T02:36:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYa I like this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find myself wobbling the lander trying to figure out which way I have to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice to click the \u0022mouse\u0022 somewhere on the surface in the direction I want to go, and have a new navball marker display.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T05:04:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Navball always is controlled with the same orientation keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem comes with whatever part you\u0027re using with \u0022control from here\u0022.

As you move the camera around you can lose track of which way your camera is facing. This can be especially confusing if your lander has a lot of symmetry and it\u0027s hard to remember where the \u0022front\u0022 of it is (this can get harder the more you zoom out from your vessel too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome type of optional overlay that shows N, S, E, W on the ground if you\u0027re in surface mode, or the orbital markers (prorade, normal, radial, etc.) when in orbital mode.
