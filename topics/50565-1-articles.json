This is ridiculous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou gain a lot of delta v by losing mass in the final stage. Start there, if possible, or remove stuff if if you don\u0027t ABSOLUTELY need it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, attaching your parachutes and landing legs to decouplers (with struts everywhere to hold them down!) will allow you to ditch them on take off, saving some delta v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might even want to rethink the lander and have a Kerbal on an external seat attached to a probe body with an inline reaction wheel part underneath that. All of that is still less mass than a 1 man lander can by around half a ton. It should let you get a lot more out of the final stage. You could also shoot for a smaller lander using the little 30 kN rockets. I think it\u0027s the Rockomax 48-7s. You can attach multiple of those on each fuel tank via those little cubic structural pieces, if you need the extra thrust. They\u0027re pretty efficient and only weigh .1 ton each, compared to something like 1.5 tons for an Aerospike. So, you can save a ton or thereabouts if you can find a way to strap 6 of those little rockets onto the same fuel tank. I did a similar thing but with 3 of them for a small Minmus transfer stage on a little 1 man lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I can\u0027t see the top of your rocket so I don\u0027t know the whole design.

It allows you to view stats like delta v and TWR in the VAB, and nothing else really. I don\u0027t think that counts as a mod. To me, it\u0027s just helping me make use of information more easily. It will let you see whether your craft will even take off on Eve for certain, as well as how a certain part swap or removal will affect delta v.

Those parachutes add up quickly. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if you had several tons in chutes on that craft. Although the delta v savings won\u0027t be huge since they\u0027re on an outer stage, it will help your TWR, allowing you to bring a a little bit more fuel and get out of the atmosphere a bit quicker (just don\u0027t overdo it and waste fuel by pushing too hard against the atmosphere!) Also, I think you could lose the SAS modules or at least go down to 2 of them by placing them individually. Although they\u0027re very convenient, it\u0027s extra weight! I think the 6 of them will add up to about 1 ton combined. Just use the capsule\u0027s torque for that design plus the possible 2 units if you want the extra torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, to get back from sea level with a reasonably sized rocket, I think you just have to do what I mentioned and use a probe core as the center of the craft, a seat for the Kerbal to sit in, and an SAS module to provide torque because the probe core has very low torque. You save about .5 tons with that. You could even use a Clamp O Tron Jr instead of the regular one to save that little extra bit of mass that would actually make some sort of difference in the final stage. You will at least gain something with .03 tons in savings, since the final stage only weighs a couple tons. As tiny as these revisions sound, it\u0027s things like these that you have to do to keep the size reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, I\u0027m without much more to offer as advice.

All of the TWR ratios are above 1.24 for the main lifting stages that have to deal with the thickest atmosphere. However, this design with MOAR BOOSTERS will need a behemoth (well, compared to what you need for the first one) rocket to get it there fully fueled. The lander is 85 tons, not counting landing legs, chutes, and science equipment, which mostly won\u0027t be present after lifting off, but will still need to be brought there (duh) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/y4frp7171/full/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s22.postimg.org/ld1liorf5/screenshot337.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot337.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/eytmvpe6b/full/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s13.postimg.org/s2z78e687/screenshot338.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot338.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this gives you some ideas \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-30T03:09:29Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2013 03:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spence1012\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"superm18","CreatedById":57755,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T10:19:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBy \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/90982-Spence1012\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#417394;\u0022\u003ESpence1012\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#417394;\u0022\u003E: \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Eput all of the parachutes and landing legs on decouplers so you can ditch them on launch.
