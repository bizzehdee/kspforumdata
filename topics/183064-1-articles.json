Put a space station around the orbit of Kerbol (The Sun), with all the \u0027normal\u0027 equipment like science labs, experiments, refuelling capabilities for docked craft, crew quarters and amenities. Nothing that hasn\u0027t been done before around other bodies in the Kerbol system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept that\u0027s not really the challenge:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real challenge? Put that space station you just built, as close as you can to Kerbol. The closer, the better. Screenshots will obviously be needed, but if your entire orbit is the closest to Kerbol, you are in the lead. However, I do mean entire orbit, no cheating and having your station only be near Kerbol for a short period of time, I want images showing you are in a circularized\u00A0orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, with this simple premise out of the way (simple as in you should understand, not that this is going to be easy), let the challenge commence.
