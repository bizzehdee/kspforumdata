Despite a new forum thread saying as much, every 3 months. Some players wish it were dead, or quit, because they don\u0027t like some change or other. I hope KSP will be as lucky as EVE is, to have development still going on after 10 years. It may not be the \u0022development\u0022 that some like, but it\u0027s clearly not dead. \nEVE Online changes some rules that were working perfectly fine, every so often, to break stagnancy, shake things up... depending on the change, it causes outcry in some circles. For a completely different reason, KSP 1.0 changed the Aero rules, and accomplished the same thing: gave a lot of \u0022old-timers\u0022 new things to learn and try, and gave birth to a few \u0022why is my rocket flipping?\u0022 threads. \n\nI think KSP 1.1 on Unity 5 will do it again. It\u0027s a bigger overhaul, than .90 to 1.0. The entire UI, Wheels, and Asteroids (confirmed by devnotes) are going to be completely new and refreshed. Joint strengths had to be looked at. The tiniest change has repercussions that we notice, due to how KSP craft are made up of hundreds of parts held together by the physics engine. \u0022Everything old, will be new again.\u0022 \n\nThe community can\u0027t die yet, it has too much to live for ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-21T02:39:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2015 02:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by basic.syntax**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T03:30:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Like vanamonde said, the forum seems goes through a general active-non active cycle, as shown by the dates the posts were created.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the peaks of activity occured on Tuesday afternoon/evening right after the devnotes."},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T03:32:52Z","Content":"Well, I doubt that there will be anything close to our record for a few months.

The level of physics simulation on \u0022parked\u0022 craft should be dynamically scalled. I think this is a case of KSP forgetting that it\u0027s a game and instead trying to be a physics simulator. Games fake it! So much of game design is about faking the real world, not actually trying to replicate it as it is, because that is just too computationally costly. I don\u0027t think KSP fakes it enough.\n\nI dont think that is a solution either, since that could mess up alot of interesting things you can do now using mods.

BUT there is quite a bit on the unity forms about how to circumnavigate the issues with the GC by being more mindful about the creation and destruction of objects.
