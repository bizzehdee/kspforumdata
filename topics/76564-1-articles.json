Last year I was recommended for advanced Juinor math.

I wanted to expand my knowledge of orbital physics and formulas so I could do KSP math by hand on paper. In a really nice long method he said no, I of course asked why? He claimed basically that it would take a lot of time to just jump into things like a constant which is the little S looking thing (right?) He said he would give me extra tutorial if I still wanted after my Juinor year (year I take calculus) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea what several of those other signs mean in the formula, I guess I am kinda asking for someone to show some pity upon me and maybe try to help me learn to do some formulas by hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T02:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00227499275\u0022 data-cite=\u00227499275\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHe said he would give me extra tutorial if I still wanted after my Juinor year (year I take calculus) \u003Cp\u003EI have no idea what several of those other signs mean in the formula, I guess I am kinda asking for someone to show some pity upon me and maybe try to help me learn to do some formulas by hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would agree with him.

Also, for this specific case (the delta-V formula), you don\u0027t need calculus at all - the more standard way to calculate it is: delta-V = v_e * ln(m_wet / m_dry), where v_e is effective exhaust velocity (and is equal to g * I_sp; g is the gravity at sea level on Earth, and applies in space because of what I_sp represents, which is impulse per unit *weight* of propelland at sea level on Earth; I_sp is, well, that, and is a parameter of the engine; m_wet is mass of rocket with propellant; m_dry is mass of the rocket without propellant). This is true for most equations you have to deal with in KSP: you can, in fact, calculate things perfectly well without any calculus. Now, learning calculus is nice, and lets you see actually *why* delta-V works the way it does. But if you just learn plug-and-chug, you still aren\u0027t gaining any insight - there\u0027s no point rederiving the delta-V formula if you don\u0027t understand the meaning behind what you\u0027re doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T05:24:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t consider this a substitute for learning Calculus (and subsequently Analysis) properly, but as a quick patch, and to get you started, watch\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/di_bzYD0Mkg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E.
