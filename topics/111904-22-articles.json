No other ports are available and should be closed.   Both your Zvezna and Zarya are also rotated 45 degrees for the solar panels should be aligned with the truss. Your quest Module is on the opposite side of the Unity Module,   when you fix the Rotation of your Zvezna and Zarya modules you will have to fold in the Zarya Solar panels as they do in Real Life, so not to interfere with the S2 panels. \n\n Use this pic to reference the correct orientation![Screenshot_1_1.jpg~original](http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a17/mghslowell/Screenshot_1_1.jpg~original)\n\n![Screenshot_3_1.jpg~original](http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a17/mghslowell/Screenshot_3_1.jpg~original)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-17T16:29:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2015 04:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mghslowell**"},{"CreatedByName":"sciencepanda","CreatedById":15485,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T13:36:53Z","Content":"If anyone is interested, I\u0027m working on a BEAM module for ISS.
