It comes close, but needs to abuse a rather cheaty exploit to go all the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile lifting the lander stage away from the Mun at the apokee of a suborbital flight, I discovered that rocket exhaust can send the moon part spinning away at a huge relative velocity. As far as I can see, an exhaust pushing on an object doesn\u0027t give a force, it gives an acceleration. My guess is that mass is ignored. If so, you could use a rocket as a repulsor beam to shunt huge objects around. The Mun has immense temperature tolerance, so you wouldn\u0027t need to worry about it exploding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it should be possible for a very small craft to repeatedly catch up with the Mun, position itself nearby, and then give a blast of the main engine, shunting the Mun faster and faster with each blast. Working like that might allow a really huge delta-V on a tiny fuel budget. It needs further testing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-27T01:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an interesting exploit you\u0027ve found.

So tipping objects/moving them is definately possible. Don\u0027t have any vids yet sry. GL with your idea, it should work from what I\u0027ve done to satellites.
