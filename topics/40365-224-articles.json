It also seems as though the Intake Atm resource and Intake Air resource do not scale appropriately with Intake Atm often running short far before Intake Air. Using FAR I can even confirm that the engines are getting enough air in Intake Air mode. Even though the engine is being provided with 113% the amount of air it needs to operate at full power it still starts to lose thrust as though its being starved of atmosphere.\u003Cp\u003EIf I swap out the crafts twin 2.5m Thermal Turbojets with a total of \u003Cem\u003Eeight\u003C/em\u003E stock KSP TurboJet engines, leaving the reactors with the same amount of air intakes I can get well over 30,000m before needing to use an alternate propulsion method as the engines become oxygen starved.

Although the Sabre Ms are technically attached to the precoolers (the adapter behind it is just there for show), the supersonic inlets mounted radially on the precooler don\u0027t seem to benefit from its effect and thus the engines will still show some overheating.

The middle LFO tank contains either 54 Argon or 4480 Xenon for the plasma thruster, and 480 units of (cargo) oxidizer but could also be used to transport kethane or other fuels.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Small 2m cargo bay: It\u0027s not very useful for actually deploying space probes due to its small size and the wing above blocking part of the bay.

The 8t metal can clipping through the craft hasn\u0027t been a problem on my multiple test flights.

At around 12-13 km their thrust will be optimal, so try to squeeze as much speed as possible out of this stage while climbing very slowly to 950-1000 m/s at 20km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce there thrust will start dropping sharply, so pitch up to about 30 degrees, switch 2 of your engines over to LFO mode and activate the plasma thruster, while the other 2 turbojets continue to squeeze more thrust out of their now doubled intakeatm. Once the remaining airbreathing turbojets\u0027 thrust drops below that of your LFO thrusters (you should be at 30 km now), switch them over as well, turn off your intakes and pitch up to 45 degrees for the burn to orbit. Once you break 50 km altitude you can lean down and simply point prograde until you reach your desired Ap. Depending on execution, there should be around 600 - 1200 delta-V left after circularizing at 80km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome notes on construction: If you\u0027re not using Modular Fueltanks, you will probably have to get creative to avoid bringing too much dead weight with you. You\u0027ll have to use Xenon for the plasma thruster (the only argon container is far too big and heavy for a spaceplane), or alternatively you can leave out the plasma thruster entirely, replace the 1.25m generators with 62.5 cm ones and add some more LFO, but this will have slightly lower total thrust at the critical burn to orbit stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone would like the .craft file to give it a try, let me know and I\u0027ll put it up somewhere for download.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this writeup helps some of you out with your interstellar spaceplane efforts!

Having some serious issues with the precoolers, SABREs, and DRE. Specifically running a set of non-precooled engines and a set of precooled engines causes massive overheating on all the engines with the precooler code. Whether shutdown or not the engines will handily explode spectacularly when in the upper atmosphere. To quote myself from the DRE thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What I meant by heat dissipation is that the engines never cooled down internally(?) I guess is the appropriate word. They would show nominal temps after cutting throttle (cooling down like engines should in the right-click display) but as soon as throttle was applied again they immediately went back to the temperature they were prior to throttle being reduced. In my case that was kersplosion temperatures.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the issue is twofold 1) The maxtemps are being set too high (original values) and DRE is dropping them down to 1500 from the original 3600 and 2) The heat production values are being overwritten from the DRE values to the original values (again much too high to function with DRE\u0027s increased heating scale).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how difficult it\u0027d be to expose those settings to be tweaked, but I believe it\u0027d go a long way toward making this play nicely in the realm of SSTOs.
