That\u0027s true, I hadn\u0027t thought about that. I usually add fueled nose cones these days, since an empty one is \u0022wasted space\u0022, but on SRBs you just want something lightweight. So this makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Possibly. I could do what I did in CCC, and add all the extra model information so that it case use FTPs texture sets when FTP is installed. Using FTP as a dependency means that no additional textures need to be made, just the additional mesh data that uses them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.
