I\\\u0027m quite proud of myself! I launched a heavy-payload rocket into orbit and released a satellite... nothing special... but then I decided to go back home. Not home as in Kerbin, I mean the space center! I have never been able to land back at the center, so I was just trying to get as close as I could with a re-purposed lander and a mech-jeb autopilot. Amazingly, I landed right on the road from the VAB to the launch tower!!! I still had some fuel left, so I did what any good Kerbal would do: smashed it into the top of the VAB! \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrBark","CreatedById":16489,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-07T15:12:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s cool. The closest I came was after a munar mission. I landed in the ocean to the east, but I did see the blinking lights of the space center at night as I passed over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShame about the boys, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
