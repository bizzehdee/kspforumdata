I tested a bunch of different parts. Some parts caused the rocket to turn north as in the pictures, other parts turned it south.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T22:46:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 10:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Serpens Solidus**\n  \npics"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T20:33:49Z","Content":"Fixed your pics, gotta \u0022view image\u0022 then copy the url.\n\nAll parts have drag now, even physicsless parts, this is normal."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T22:06:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Fixed your pics, gotta \u0022view image\u0022 then copy the url.\n\u003E All parts have drag now, even physicsless parts, this is normal.\n\nI thought physicsless parts applied their physics to the parent part, and if that is part of the center stack then that would make this a bug (I too need his pics to clarify)."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T22:07:00Z","Content":"Mass yes, drag no, and no it\u0027s not a bug."},{"CreatedByName":"Serpens Solidus","CreatedById":146847,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T22:50:51Z","Content":"Fixed pics, hopefully.
