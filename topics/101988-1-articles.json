My wheels don\u0027t behave consistently in regards to directional controls. Sometimes forward is forward, and sometimes forward is backwards. If all the wheels behaved the same, I wouldn\u0027t have a problem, but the rear wheels and the front wheels are not in agreement. In the latest version, three out of four wheels agreed as to direction, and the fourth went the opposite way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFile here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://1drv.ms/1G5TcnY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://1drv.ms/1G5TcnY\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T01:07:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 01:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eightiesboi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T11:15:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t load your craft, it has some mod parts on it - scansat?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is sometimes causes by having more than one pod/capsule and sometimes by the way you put the wheels on.
