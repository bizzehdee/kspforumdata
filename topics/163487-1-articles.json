I\u0027m using Ver. 1.2.2 because of a\u00A0lot of useful mods like Space Shuttle System, or CxAerospace ISS mod. Few weeks ago, I heard the news that the Squad sold KSP to another game company named Take-Two Interactive Software Inc(Under: T2). Just like other countries, KSP is very famous for spacecraft fans or space lovers because the game is easy to use the mods. Actually, Squad said it is great to use the mods in KSP. But after I heard the new, I have been worried about the available of using mod in KSP. I saw another news about that T2 blocked the modding of\u00A0\u00A0GTA5 and started to sell the DLCs instead. Thanks to the angry users of GTA5, T2 stopped blocking the modding. But now I am worried about that T2 blocked the modding of KSP. I want to use \u00A0a lot of useful mods in KSP forever:). So I hope I can continue to use the mods in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Plus) I\u0027m in Republic of Korea.
