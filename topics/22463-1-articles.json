The ship weighs about 50 tons once in orbit. It currently has 87 RCS jets and 4 large RCS tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe maneuverability is not great even with all the RCS jets. Pitch and roll is ok but yaw is not. One problem is the amount of jets stuck to the side to increase yaw authority causes the ship to look extremely ugly. It is supposed to be a sleek ship and this makes it look like it has a disease. Do these RCS jets have any real world basis anyway? The shuttle RCS is integrated and aerodynamic and looks great for instance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RCS fuel usage currently is enormous. All 4 tanks are dry in about 30-45 seconds or so. As an aside to this, the RCS and or Mechjeb are extremely inefficient with fuel usage. Are there any real world designs that have the RCS and main engines share fuel? I understand the shuttle does not since the RCS it has uses hypergolic propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship is able to maneuver to make burns just fine. Rendezvous is the problem. Specifically, there is not enough linear RCS authority to \u0022line up\u0022 when you are closing on a target and the RCS retros are too weak and the ship is too slow to \u0022flip\u0022 around so I can fire in reverse. Basically, fine maneuvering in it is extremely frustrating. Are there any low-maneuverability real world designs out there that are able to launch and maneuver for burns but not able to do rendezvous? Basically, should I resign the ship to the scrap yard for this problem or is it \u0022safe\u0022 to fly to other planets anyway?

The standalone SAS module is pretty powerful too, for a gyroscope... Kerbal RCS is very bad at conserving fuel, as you yourself have noted; most real-world designs accomplish what they set out to do with much less fuel, much less total maneuverability, and far fewer burns and touches on the throttle, both because the RCS systems themselves tend to be better built and programmed so as not to use up as much fuel stabilizing the craft, and because the spacecrafts\u0027 trajectories are thoroughly precalculated by computer tools that are also available to help when the time comes to actually perform docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP doesn\u0027t have any of those \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC at least not yet \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC and so in order to account for the possibility that inexperienced players (or those not inclined to carry out the mathematics outside of the game) will make many correction burns to sort out their trajectories, KSP affords players some leeway in the form of magic flywheels that provide much more significant torque than what is usually possible in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least in my estimation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-18T09:06:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a note, the International Space Station uses 4 gyroscopes to keep its attitude relative to Earth, and these gyroscopes are almost 1 meter in diameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, gyroscopes are indeed way too efficient, but we won\u0027t complain about that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your problem, RCS is generally supposed to be used in short bursts, to start and stop a maneuver.

The other transfer was flawless) the ship and the station had maybe floated all of an extra 10-15m further apart.

I have a little tiny one composed of a cosmetic radio dish, a since empty 1m module, some landing legs and a couple of lights that I managed to place there (it took shoving with a kerbal for about 15 minutes to get it righted though...thankfully it is light). This time I am going to get a real station placed there. It is roughly the size of Freedom Station I and I have the launcher built that should be able to manage the task, though I have to tweak the design since in testing after the SRBs had seperated and then the 1st stage dropped (cluster of 6 main sails with 4 tanks per engine) the 2nd stage was uncontrollable up around 60km. Not enough torque with no SAS modules added to prevent the left Yaw. Just barely enough to keep it from accelerating, but not enough to reverse it.
