The first option is to replace the Reliant with a RK-7 Kodiak, if you have already unlocked it. It\u0027s basically a direct upgrade to the Reliant in every way except vacuum Isp, which is actually mitigated by the fact that sea-level Isp is higher, meaning its higher efficiency off the pad cancels out the lower efficiency as it rises. This engine should easily let you launch this rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second option is to just fly straight up for longer, and tip over more gently, so that you have a much steeper trajectory. It\u0027s kind of inefficient to fly this way though, costing extra \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to fight against gravity. And if you\u0027re losing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E either way, you might as well choose option three:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemove a fuel tank.
