It needs to change the dish part in to something more like what they use on real satellites. Say like a sensor box or pod that has a door that can be opened when in use. This would keep the sat from scanning until you turned it on with an action key. A box would be used if you wanted to mount it directly to your probe body. Or use a round pod that can rotate 360 and tilt 180 as well a door that can be opened. You could mount this to a folding or telescoping arm that can be deployed after launch. Then use the box or pod and fill it with different sensors of your choosing. Want a visible light camera? Need a kethane scanner? Want to scan in infrared or any wavelength? Add any sensor you want when someone makes it. Make them in different sizes for adding more than one sensor to that pod or what your needs require. Heck, add more than one pod. Then go one step further, and have your sat keep the data until it is able to beam the images back to Kerbin before you can look at them using something similar to the RemoteTech mod. Just some ideas.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal topography scanning satellites? They either look like boring grey boxes or they look like my dish except instead of an antenna in the middle there\u0027s a radar or laser emitting bar on it like\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/SAR-Lupe.jpg/360px-SAR-Lupe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022360px-SAR-Lupe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand even that dish is normally hidden inside the fuselage. (it uses radar which just penetrates the protective hull casing iirc) and it doesn\u0027t auto look at the ground either! lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might change the design and quality of the dish model but the basic idea will probably stay. I am however going to change my method of differentiating between gps and dish which will get rid of the problems of using the dll on other parts, custom dishes etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epod animations and stuff is not what determines if the scanning code runs lol, the other way around is more likely (game code not real life \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E), The new default for scanning is off anyway. 50% want it off at default 50% want it on. So I\u0027m just picking what I prefer and I prefer to start scanning when I am finished getting into my mapping orbit lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as all the animation model suggestion go, great. But, if I spend the little time I have for mapsat on making a nicer model and model animation gimmicks I won\u0027t get work done on the core functionality of mapsat which I would guess is more important? I might do more work on the look of the thing when mapsat is up to date again and I have enough time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as all the different scanning goes, there\u0027s just nothing to scan really in ksp and I\u0027m not going to make fake datasets to scan. There essentially is only topography right now, there\u0027s no ground temperature really, I\u0027ve been playing with doing that and the temp. curve but so far nothing interesting, no magnetic fields to scan, visible light is not going to work either I wasted a few hours on that yesterday. I\u0027m not allowed to readpixels from the diffuse maps so that comes down to having no data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have an idea for old school realistic photo mapping like space agencies do in real life, but that\u0027s quite a large undertaking and probably not suited for just a feature in mapsat and mapping would be slow because to keep lighting consistent you can only map strips of the planet that are in between a few degrees of \u0022noon\u0022 when the sat passes over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can code it no problem but would it be fun? Many people think mapsat as is takes too long, this would just take \u0022forever\u0022. I will look at mapping resources when they become official though. And if they ever add anything interesting to map I will definitely check it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to sound like a downer, they are all great idea\u0027s but as you might have noticed I get way too little time in on mapsat work as it is and compared to functionality and bugs superficial models and animations don\u0027t add that much. A definitive might do though but that all depends on time and despite (or maybe because) mapsat being the usual free mod, money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the beaming goes, no sorry. It\u0027s just makes for a less enjoyable user experience, Or do you really like sitting and waiting for a at to pass over ksc to transmit it\u0027s data. never mind waiting for the one around eeloo to come into line of sight with ksc?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso this comes back to multisat mapping, pqs reading is just too heavy for so many simultaneous scans everywhere. I\u0027ve improved mapsat performance a lot lately but it\u0027s still a limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking about having a transceiver gps type part that will let scanning continue with mapsats that orbit the same planet as the vessel you are controlling so people can do stuff while mapping. Just an idea atm though. might be in 4.0 or a later incremental update if I decide to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESort of an intermediate between full multisat and having to be on the same vessel as the satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ScrawnJuan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ScrawnJuan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny ideas why my satellite is working but I can\u0027t seem to get the GPS to attach to anything?
