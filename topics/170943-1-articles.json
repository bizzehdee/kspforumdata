So you could try capping it in the system configuration in KSP. With mine uncapped, I can have FPS well into the hundreds but makes it pause every so often. Could be that if you are getting null reference errors and other mod conflicts which can cause issues, but no log. You can see them with Alt-F12 debug in game menu. In my experience I\u00A0found some parts from mods can cause this issue to occur more often, but it is hard to pin down since it depends on system config, mod order, ship builds and other issues. You can use the above mod to at least see the garbage collection occurring and play around with FPS cap, mods and other items too work on reducing the stutter. No guarantees on a solid fix that I know of though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vichard","CreatedById":185317,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-17T13:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey thanks for the tips, I had my frames capped at 60 I\u0027m running i5 4690k, GTX 1060 6Gb, 8Gb Ram, installing MemGraph I noticed the stutters are more bearable now here\u0027s a picture\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;font-size:15.3px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/Z5Lh2eF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/Z5Lh2eF\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0don\u0027t really know what I\u0027m looking for to be honest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: And another showing the intervals\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/sE1nrqU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/sE1nrqU\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:15.3px;\u0022\u003EHere is\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Ea list of the mod I have installed nothing major really, I have a feeling FMRS could be the cause of the major stuttering although I have no proof -\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/U1wh2kx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/U1wh2kx\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-17T13:35:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2018 01:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Vichard\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
