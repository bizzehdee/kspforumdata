You can use such an escape burn in niche situations. For example, if you use a transfer planning tool/mod to compute transfers to other planets, they will sometimes give you a burn that goes partially radial in order to correct for being somewhat out-of-window. And personally, I like to use a burn 45 degrees off Kerbin-prograde towards the Sun for my very first dip into solar orbit for science collection, where I just want to spend a minute or two there before getting recaptured by Kerbin.
