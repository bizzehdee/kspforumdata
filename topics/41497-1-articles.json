I just get a featureless gray matte on my part when I want a nice metal texture. I\u0027ve been able to export the model for use in KSP, and the model seems to work fine except that the texture on the part in-game is that same smooth, featureless default generic-looking texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a note, I\u0027ve really only just started model and texture editing and am quite bad at it still.

I\u0027m trying to give it a very simple texture that isn\u0027t differentiated at all across different parts of the model, so according to my tenuous grasp of the subject generating a UV projection shouldn\u0027t be necessary.

Otherwise you get the blank grey/white that you\u0027re experiencing. The UV map doesn\u0027t need to be anything in particular for just a block of colour, just use any old projection method and then your texture should work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do recommend setting out a proper UV map and texture for your part though, it can make a world of difference to how good something looks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mossman","CreatedById":1259,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T22:55:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright.
