And it becomes a real pain trying to find the location where a kerbal is sitting, to move it to another location. This is especially impossible with modules that have to air-lock and thus I can\u0027t quickly eva just to notice their location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo is there a mod that can help me? Either (preferably) a mod that allows me to \u0022move\u0022 kerbals without selecting the cabin they\u0027re in, rather by using the protrait.

However it still has a similar problem: I still need to scroll (in a very small window) through the 20-30 parts that hold crew to find that single crew I need to return to kerbin for a medical emergency contract. This mod shows which compartments have crew, but not the other way around: showing where specific crew is in the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
