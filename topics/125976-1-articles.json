The problem is that I built it before I unlocked docking ports so the only way I can change out the crew on it is to use the AGU and claw onto it (which was hard enough for me as it was). I took on that trip with me two new scientists and I also attached a docking bay to my \u0022shuttle\u0022. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI got up there, locked on, did a little crew dance to get everyone into their new homes (ie take out my scientists and rotate in two new ones, plus a new pilot to man the escape pod if needed). Thankfully I also had some fuel on the station I could transfer to my shuttle since I burned more than I expected to setting up the docking. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut what I couldn\u0026#39;t figure out was how to get my Kerbal to transfer the Docking bay and install it on the station. I fiddled around flying around it right clicking, left clicking and (I think) alt-clicking on it and never got the option to move it. Eventually I just gave up and sent my crew back to the planet for some well earned RnR.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDid I miss something? I know in a tutorial video on docking I watched a guy move parachutes onto a satellite he was trying to recover.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-20T19:09:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2015 07:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MrOsterman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T12:53:19Z","Content":"\nThis functionality doesn\u0026#39;t exist in stock KSP.

The design will entail attaching the docking port right next to the Claw, and several ladders also right there for the work crew (1 engineer and his helpers) to be on during the move, so nobody\u0026#39;s floating around in space. While a single Kerbal might be able to carry the docking port around in space, it\u0026#39;s very unlikely that he\u0026#39;ll be able to control himself with his EVA pack due to a radical change in his CoM, so you want everybody firmly attached to ships when moving heavy parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, Claw the ship with the port to the station right next to where you want to attach the docking port. EVA the engineer, make sure he has the screwdriver in his pocket, and position him on a ladder between where the port is now and where the port needs to be, with both places being no more than about 1 Kerbal\u0026#39;s height to either side of him. EVA the other Kerbals and position them on the other ladders, also as close as possible to the current and future positions of the docking port. These guys just help hold and stabilize heavy things automatically just by being close enough so you don\u0026#39;t need to do anything else with them. Then have the engineer grab the docking port off the ship it\u0026#39;s on now (using the screwdriver). Once he\u0026#39;s holding it, position it following the mod\u0026#39;s instructions where you want it and screw it in place.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsing these mods, you can follow this sort of procedure to add heavy parts to ships on the ground quite easily, without all the ladders and such.

So, you get the ships in place, they\u0026#39;re drifting, you have to quickly switch to the assistant kerbals and place them near the object, and they start drifting, too. Quickly, before anything drifts out of range, use the screwdriver to remove the part from the old ship, turn, place it on the new ship, and bolt it into place.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have to get everything set up just-so, and then act quickly.
