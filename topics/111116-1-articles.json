The difficulty is I\u0027ve completed a lot of basic science missions but haven\u0027t processed them in the MPL before. So I\u0027m just having to guess what \u0022depleted\u0022 science activities still are valuable run through the MPL. I wish I had a way to record, predict, and track what science out there (both ones I\u0027ve done simply or haven\u0027t at all) is going to provide that \u002B1 (or better) data yellow button.\n\nMy understanding (it could be wrong) is that once I MPL-ify an experiment it\u0027s used up and I have to make them unique. I\u0027m trying to get good science out of the MPL but it\u0027s hard to judge what I can and should feed it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T22:12:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Frederf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T08:33:14Z","Content":"It\u0027s not really a proper solution, but you\u0027ll know if an experiment has already been processed by the lab in question. The process button only appears if the lab hasn\u0027t seen that particular experiment before. You can also keep the previous experiment results in the lab after processing, but the current UI is dreadful for actually seeing what\u0027s there once there\u0027s more than about 10 experiment results.\n\nBeyond that, absolutely nothing in the stock game really helps you with that at present. Hopefully the replacement UI in 1.1 (all UIs have to be redone from scratch for Unity 5) might be better.\n\nOn the flip side, there\u0027s no requirement or benefit in-game for hitting 100% completion on experiments processed in a lab. You don\u0027t really even get the personal achievement type thing from looking at them in the science archives, as with traditional experiment results.\n\nI suggest forgetting about anything like completion and just moving on to a new location once you get bored with the current one. Just let that lab slowly run dry, but any exploration missions to the body it\u0027s orbiting can always stop there and process whatever experiments they gathered, on their way back home."},{"CreatedByName":"Falkenherz","CreatedById":141969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T08:52:30Z","Content":"Yeah, there is a mod called Science Alert, but it has no according option, neither. \n\nThe way I manage this is to designate a MPL to Mun and to Minmus polar orbit. Then I collect all EVA data and let them munch it up. Once this is done, I will re-collect and feed them the surface data. Then I will exchange both crafts. Just in order to be efficient, my new interplanetary vessel to Duna will also have a MPL, which will be fed around Minus before going out of Kerbin SOI, just in order to be useful during the long travel time.\n\nI suspect once I have done this, I have opened all tech nodes, anyways."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T14:09:09Z","Content":"Also, it\u0027s worth calling out explicitly (Murph alluded to this), just in case you\u0027re not aware: MPL processing is on a *per-lab basis*.

I just sent a craft with 2 labs to Bop, and no data ever goes into one of the labs. Both are staffed with two scientists each. Whenever I click the yellow button to send data to the labs, it only goes to one of them. Also, weirdly, the data stays in its original instrument, and I\u0027m presented with the science pop-up a second time. Clicking the yellow button again brings up an error that the science was already sent to the lab, but I can still transmit the data.*\n\n*The second lab just sits there idle, with no data and some hungry kerbals.*\n\nStaying in it\u0027s original instrument is by design."},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:30:16Z","Content":"I\u0027m doing a bit of empiricism now about what experiments can provide MPL data and which can\u0027t.
