The difficulty is I\u0027ve completed a lot of basic science missions but haven\u0027t processed them in the MPL before. So I\u0027m just having to guess what \u0022depleted\u0022 science activities still are valuable run through the MPL. I wish I had a way to record, predict, and track what science out there (both ones I\u0027ve done simply or haven\u0027t at all) is going to provide that \u002B1 (or better) data yellow button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy understanding (it could be wrong) is that once I MPL-ify an experiment it\u0027s used up and I have to make them unique.

The process button only appears if the lab hasn\u0027t seen that particular experiment before. You can also keep the previous experiment results in the lab after processing, but the current UI is dreadful for actually seeing what\u0027s there once there\u0027s more than about 10 experiment results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that, absolutely nothing in the stock game really helps you with that at present. Hopefully the replacement UI in 1.1 (all UIs have to be redone from scratch for Unity 5) might be better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the flip side, there\u0027s no requirement or benefit in-game for hitting 100% completion on experiments processed in a lab. You don\u0027t really even get the personal achievement type thing from looking at them in the science archives, as with traditional experiment results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest forgetting about anything like completion and just moving on to a new location once you get bored with the current one.
