I took the same design and turned it on its side as a vertical delivery vehicle for a shuttle that can reach orbit using none of the fuel in its fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, as far as ideas are concerned on improvement, I\\\u0027ll toss a few things out for ya.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, to get rid of that landing gear that looks like a hemorrhage on the nose of your rocket, use the same decoupler hard points (or pylons, I forget which ones detach) underneath the engines and the rocket to keep it symmetrical. It\\\u0027s going to give you more ground clearance, but it shouldn\\\u0027t destabilize you. Group the ones on the jets to detach after the wings so it all falls away as one piece; put the hard point for the rocket \u0027gear\u0027 in the group with the wing decoupling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as making the separation of the wings smoother, I\\\u0027m not sure exactly what you mean. If you mean the wings are running into you, then just pitch up a bit if you\\\u0027re still in the atmosphere. The wings should pull back safely from the rocket after separation if you\\\u0027re pointed near vertically. If you\\\u0027re still in the atmosphere while separating and losing control, consider throwing some of the small control winglets onto the rocket. You can move the jets out a bit to make room for them and that will serve dual-purpose as a wider wheelbase if you use the hard points beneath the jets/rocket since you will be taller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also make the entire delivery vehicle wider and throw a second stage onto it. Put some of the medium LFE\\\u0027s on there with small fuel tanks and have them activate after the jets begin to lose their power. You can mess around with staging, different kinds of rockets and engines, and fuel flow with fuel lines and activate/deactivating flow on tanks to get different mixes of power and duration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood initial concept, you have the right idea. There\\\u0027s tons of ways you can go with it and get yourself away from using mechjeb since it seems like a last resort kind of thing for ya.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Asmosdeus","CreatedById":9051,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T10:40:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWho was the person who made the video?
