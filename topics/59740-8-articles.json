Runway TWR: 9.37.QUOTE]\u003Cp\u003ENice looking plane! Will it fly if you put smaller wings on it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyeah, tried that - takeoff speed went from 230m/s(!) to 285(!!), and I couldn\u0027t throttle back even a smidge for landing... was a sod to control with the smaller wings as well. Might try static Delta wings and a pair of stock control surfaces, see if that improves things (I doubt it since they don\u0027t provide as much lift as these fellas).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Nope.
