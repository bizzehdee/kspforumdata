X and Y are the same distance from the surface of the planet.\n\nOr: Mirroring your orbit through the Ap and Pe, the two points are the same distance from the ground.\n\nIs it possible to have an orbit where the two points are **not** the same height above ground-level? For instance, can an oval orbit have the Ap and Pe 90 degrees apart, instead of 180?\n\nI don\u0027t think so, but I want to know **why**."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T00:57:59Z","Content":"Above standard sea level, or local ground level?\n\nMost orbits are measured from the center of mass of the major body.

You get some orbit after that point, however it actually looks like.\n\nNow assume back in P time suddenly reverted: because Newton\u0027s laws are exactly the same if time runs backwards, the orbit is the same as if you completely reverted your movement. And as the laws are also unchanged if mirrored in that way, your backwards-time orbit will be symmetric to the forward-time one. Thus your total orbit will be symmetrical in this regard.\n\nTherefore your orbit has that axis of symmetry if you have such a point. Now you can check that any point P of smallest distance, i.e. the Pe, works for this.\n\nOr you could just do all the work of solving the differental equations to check that orbits are conics ;-)"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T01:09:54Z","Content":"Kepler\u0027s first law (rephrased and paraphrased) All orbits are conic sections (Circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas), with the central body at one of the foci.\n\nAn ellipse is defined as \u0022Pick two points (F1,F2), these are the foci.

The satellite traces out a rosette pattern. If the exponent is slightly LESS than 2, the apoapsis moves backward each orbit, also making a rosette. The greater the deviation of the exponent is from 2, the wider is the spacing between the \u0027petals\u0027 of the rosette.
