Yes, the acting wasn\u0027t great, but let\u0027s face it, the special effects and action were overall better than the originals. Say what you want, but to me, Episode III is actually better than Episode VI, much more action and it does a really good job of capturing the fall to the Dark Side. One thing I recommend is to watch the Clone Wars TV series (although a cartoon, the actual content is not far from the type in the movies), and then watch Episode III. This makes it much more effective, because in the TV series, they truly show the extent of the bond between the Clones and the Jedi (it does a very good job of showing the clones as people with feelings, rather than mindless armored guys, like they are in all the movies), as well as explaining a huge load of plot holes left by the movies, so when you watch Order 66 in III, it has much more of an effect.
