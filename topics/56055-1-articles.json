Put your decouplers on. Then attach 4 docking ports. Then put 4 more inverted under those so that they will automatically dock when the rocket spawns in. Then put your adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not done that myself but I\u0027ve seen pictures of that setup on the forum.... so apparently it does work as described.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T21:04:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you flip it over, only one of the four parts attaches. This is due to the way KSP follows the root module outward like tree branches to make connections. If you place the adapter upside down but over your root part, so that the single-port side is toward the root and the 4-part side is away, then it will attach to all 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you can do is use struts where it failed to attach.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jank","CreatedById":97123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T07:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I could be wrong and lucky, but I found it workable (single stack to multiple fuel tank with adapter, back to single engine with inverted adapter) when I flip the adapter over...

This is exactly how the adapters work.

I have one adapter on top to connect it to the fuel tank, and decouplers on the ends of the engines (often the engine fairings won\u0027t shot up on one or two engines, but if you rotate/flip the decoupler it should work) and then add an inverted adapter to all me to attach it to the lift/orbital stages. The fuel tanks are usual 3m for most of my designs so i also add size adapters. When building these you find struts are your friend haha.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
