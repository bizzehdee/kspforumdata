Then wait until you reach that periapsis, turn retrograde again, and burn until apoapsis = periapsis. It\u0027s most efficient if you go to your settings file and set patched conics draw mode = 0, and then your projected path through Mun\u0027s SOI will be displayed right by the moon itself, and you can see how close you will pass. Wait until you\u0027re half-way there, set a maneuver node, and try moving the radial/anti-radial tabs until you\u0027ve got the periapsis you want.

For best efficiency, try to get your final Periapsis to Mun at 30km when you do your initial insertion burn. the further away you are from a point on your orbit, the less fuel it takes to change it (hence why burning at one side of your orbit directly effects the other side). Once you get to you Mun Periapsis, bur retrograde until your Apoapsis is as 30km as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want your orbit to be equatorial, make sure your have your orbit aligned correctly before doing your insertion burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarmenius","CreatedById":16990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T03:37:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may find this old topic particularly useful: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/14082-Optimal-Munar-Orbit-Insertion-Challenge\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOptimal Munar Orbit Insertion\u003C/a\u003E.
