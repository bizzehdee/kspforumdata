Can anyone make a mod that allows you to tweak the ejection force... Id like to create fairings that float away slowly (like the apollo LEM fairings).\n\nI would also love a mod that makes jettisoned fairings into persistent debris.\n\n(please don\u0027t just suggest procedural fairings! It\u0027s a great mod but I like to play stock on at least one save).\n\nThanks in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T22:49:04Z","Content":"I\u0027m in the planning stages of [my proposed SDHI AeroFairings add-on](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php?t=117465) at the moment, so details haven\u0027t been finalized.
