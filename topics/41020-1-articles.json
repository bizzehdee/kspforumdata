The scientific community is convinced that the original discoverer \u0022Ialdabaoth Kerman\u0022 may have forgot to carry over a decimal point, and that his calculations are off. The scientists are calling it The Law of Thermodynamics 2.3. JCAD looking to re-establish it\u0027s ability to run manned missions again immediately puts together an unmaned pod and launch it to test this new paradigm. While space flights were suspended JCAD engineers began development on Space planes. Dubbed Spirit of Kerbal the Mk. I-III were overly large and complicated only able to attain ballistic trajectories. In a brilliant yet counter intuitive moment of genius Toshogu Kerman declared \u0022LESS IS MORE!\u0022 and proceeded to strip the design to it\u0027s bare minimums. Spirit of Kerbal Mk.
