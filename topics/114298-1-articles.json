When you land, how much Ablator you\u0027ve left? In my tries, with a rockets I lose all my Ablator, starting from a 150/85 km orbit, so, 3400 m/s more or less."},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T07:14:53Z","Content":"I removed most of the ablator that wouldn\u0027t burn off to reduce the mass, which was like 80% IIRC. When I land there\u0027s pretty much nothing left. That\u0027s coming in from an interplanetary trajectory at about 4.8 km/s. The amount of ablator lost on each shield was reduced as I added more of them. When you increase the heatshield surface area the thermal energy is spread out, so you get lower temperatures and less ablation. At least I think that\u0027s how it goes?\n\nIt does add a substantial amount of mass tough. The lander is about 65 tonnes. The student heatshield project adds another 25 tonnes to that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T07:50:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 07:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T09:53:37Z","Content":"So, multiple heat shields are better than a single one, good find..."}]}
