When I land there\u0027s pretty much nothing left. That\u0027s coming in from an interplanetary trajectory at about 4.8 km/s. The amount of ablator lost on each shield was reduced as I added more of them. When you increase the heatshield surface area the thermal energy is spread out, so you get lower temperatures and less ablation.
