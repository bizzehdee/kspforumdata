So, with a KR-7 and a KR-14, the range is dictated by the KR-7 (90 Mm). However, RemoteTech also allows to use the \u0022Additive\u0022 model (just change that line to \u0022Additive\u0022 where \u0022Standard\u0022 was), then the range of connection is given by SQRT(RANT1*RANT2)\u002BMIN(RANT1|RANT2) (where RANT1 and RANT2 are the ranges of the two antennae, MIN is the minimum of the two), or in this case (KR-7 and KR-14) = 2,414 Gm. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI consider the Additive model much more realistic (as the range is a function of the gains of both receiving and transmitting antennae), though being much simpler that the true to life equation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, at the time the Additive model was introduced (RT2 v. 1.3.3), there was also something about a change in the settings line \u0022RangeMultiplier = \u0022 to read \u0022= 10\u0022 instead of \u0022= 1\u0022. I can\u0027t remember what that change was about, but it has the effect of multiplying all ranges of all antennae (something I don\u0027t need, so I keep that to 1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t have to worry about different SoI unless an antenna is pointed at a body instead of the other antenna (or you use the Active Vessel feature).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-11T10:59:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2014 10:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by diomedea\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Quiana","CreatedById":107476,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T16:48:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shiv\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shiv\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, that\u0027s simpler.

The range and power consumption are in need of tuning. I have another one that I can post when I wake up that\u0027s a smaller version with three turns coil that should have a 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle. The plan is to build mounting arms for them, this will give them optional ability to track as well if the code gets implemented. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it\u0027s worth mentioning that I also modeled a mount that would be seen on a large dish or telescope, its setup to track as well. It\u0027s ment for ground stations and possibly large futuristic/sci-fi style vessels if your interested let me know and I will pack and post it. If I can make it work so you can put any dish I will otherwise I will put a dish on it for now as a placeholder, maybe with a slow spin on its horizontal axis for fun...
