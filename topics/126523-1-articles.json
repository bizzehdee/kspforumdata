The place used to be a farmer\u0027s club back in the 1920\u0027s, then it was a general store, then a boarding house, then a sportsman club, and then the bar it is today. One story I heard from the Hilton was that a guy sat down in a chair and all 4 legs busted through the floor. Another one I heard was that the men\u0027s toilet broke off at the base and tipped over on it\u0027s side when somebody was sitting on it. Another story was that some guy got ahold of a kangaroo somehow, skinned it, and left the skin out to dry on the top of the flagpole. It\u0027s been a LONG time since I went in, maybe 10 years, but when I went in there the bathroom lights didn\u0027t work and there was a work light in there as a replacement. The guy that owned it was still using the mechanical register from the 20\u0027s. And if you ever go there, you can say that you survived the place and you have bragging rights that you went in there. It\u0027s pretty much my region in a building. And the only way you can get to it is by a dirt road on the bank of a river and a wooden bridge you have to cross, and not a new wood bridge either. And did I mention the fact that the food menu only consists of a 1/2 pound burger (that\u0027s probably all deer meat), a ham and cheese sandwich, and fries?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmartS=true","CreatedById":128671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T04:18:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t gone to a restaurant quite that bad yet, but there was a Burger King in Idaho that was simply horrible.
