Also working on patch changes for tank so can share. Should probably be calculated differently in the fuel switch patch as one does get free space in the mix version.\n\nEDIT to answer joeystar : Per unit mass you do far better, but per volume you do not. But, really what we care about is mass as that is what is fed into the rocket equation.

When I\u0027ve made the patch I\u0027ve compared the amount of LqdHydrogen/OX for stock tanks and MFT to the values given by Nerteas Fuelswitch patch. Nerteas assumes for stock tanks, that 10 units of LqdHydrogen equals 1 unit of Oxidizer and the resource using is half and half. \n\n Of course for MFT it isn\u0027t exactly the same, e.g. for fuelswitch there is a tank with LqdHydrogen only, but it adds just the value for Oxizider to the value of LqdH2, which makes no sense, when you assume 10x higher \u0022density\u0022. In this case MFT just doubles the amount of LqdH2.\n\nFirst you can change the default basemass to 0.000625 for balance reasons. But there are some other things I\u0027ve thought about, which I will try to explain later, when I\u0027ve some minutes."}]}
