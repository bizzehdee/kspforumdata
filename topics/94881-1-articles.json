This is true for all forms of them but particularly for the actual trajectories (which then even change their radius) and for maneuver node trajectories (which makes planning precise trajectories so fun I want to bite the heads off baby Kerbals) which also affects the waypoint on the navball - it jitters around, as does the delta-V (and if the trajectory depends on 0.1 m/s in the right direction, a flickering range of 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and \u002B/- 0.5 m/s is not acceptable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, how do I know it\u0027s not the gravity of a planet or moon affecting the trajectory?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, 1) this occurs regardless of whether I\u0027m in close orbit (but outside the atmosphere) or in high orbit and far enough away from any moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd 2) time acceleration cancels it. Entirely. No flickering on the navball or of the trajectories. And from the Space Center view, everything is nice and stable. But as soon as a I take control, it starts again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI invested two hours in placing a satelite in high orbit over Kerbin (around 10 million meters) with minimal deviation and even without the unprecise camera and moody-at-best maneuver tuning, it was a pain, but with the trajectory \u0022adjusting itself\u0022 for no reason and maneuvers being made nigh-on impossible by the flickering at the level of precision required to complete the mission, I just gave up and (thank god for my custom save files) loaded a save before this mission that has been doomed from the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I can tell, it gets worse the bigger the numbers are. For smaller trajectories, it was awful and goddamn annoying but manageable - Munar orbits are not too much trouble. But with the mission above, it was just plain not doable. I cannot even imagine the kind of torture a mission to another planet must be with this bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T15:26:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you\u0027re trying to achieve absolutely circular orbits which are never needed in KSP, and that you have a contract to place a satellite but are getting frustrated because it won\u0027t complete, not realising you are 180 degrees off (in other words, flying backwards)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing 0.1 m/s off when doing a burn for a manoeuvre node is not just perfectly fine, it\u0027s far more accurate than you need, if it bothers you that much then use RCS to fix that last 0.1 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s floating point inaccuracies with big orbits, they are projections of where you should end up but being far from the origin (your craft) they won\u0027t be perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry about it preventing you from reaching other planets though, it\u0027s perfectly possible, hundreds of thousands of KSP players manage it fine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis issue has been around forever, it\u0027s as good as Squad can make it and rather than being a bug, think of it as a feature \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you happen to be suffering from this more than most there may be a reason why, but you didn\u0027t provide any screenshots, logs or system info so there\u0027s very little we can do to help, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease see the stickies at the top of the support section.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JulienJaden","CreatedById":133726,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T16:15:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, the orbit I have to achieve is elliptic and the closest I got to completing the mission was about 1,000 meters off on either side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the contract does not ask for any kind of specific orientation (other than the angles which I got right to about 0.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or something like that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut regardless of the mission, the flickering is there and you are dismissing that as if it was just my imagination and frustration over my own ineptitude...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProviding screenshots of something that jitters is pretty much impossible, since a picture won\u0027t capture the erratic changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to my \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.file-upload.net/download-10065111/quicksave-14.sfs.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecurrent quicksave\u003C/a\u003E.
