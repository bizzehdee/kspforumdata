If it\u0027s to steer the rocket it\u0027s not meant for that. You can only stage with it as Nathan explained. That component is meant to be \u0027unguided\u0027. If you want to use it, then it should be attached to a booster, but that whole thing will need to be attached to a larger rocket which will have the larger 1m avionics/probe/controller. But once you separate from that stage it should be set so that the booster kicks in, but it\u0027s hands off from there.

Make a thrust curve for it, then change the figures.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree w/ Story - the current implementation of the AJ-60A gives problems going through MaxQ as it is since we do not have a thrust vs. time curve for this motor. The ISP and thrust level that (I\u0027m assuming) Red used when he wrote this config is most likely an average - I wonder if perhaps he got a hold of the total impulse of this motor and used an average thrust w/ the known burn time to come up with the number he did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tinkered with basing the thrust vs. propellant curve on that of the GEM-60, but its hard to know how these motors actually behave in real life...other than to assume something. Without more information from Aerojet, its hard to say how this motor should behave.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T03:09:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERothank: That page looks messed up.
