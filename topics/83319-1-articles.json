This is just a simple suggestion that camera is more zoomed in when you take a Kerbal on EVA. It\u0027s not a big deal, but would make me have to do a lot less scrolling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile we\u0027re on this subject, how about increasing the default scroll mouse sensitivity? Or maybe that\u0027s just a mouse feature, not something you can change in KSP. But really, I feel that it could easily be 3x as sensitive so I wouldn\u0027t have to scroll so much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just one of my pet peeves. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyakkidouran","CreatedById":119198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T19:07:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure everyone agrees with you. If it starts zoomed in as you suggest many people may not like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about saving the zoom level at the end of the previous EVA and attempt to use it for your next one? Maybe that would appeal to more people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it would be nice to be able to change the roll of the camera on EVA. I am always annoyed when I want to take a screenshot and I can\u0027t get the picture I want just because I landed my craft on a slope.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
