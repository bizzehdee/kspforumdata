With extremely high maneuverability and a speed of 124 m/s in level flight, the Fokker Dr.I is sure to please. It is rated for 7,000 meters ASL, and it\u0027s part count comes in at only 120 parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227qspOwT.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7qspOwT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Fokker Dr.I is most famously known as the last aircraft flown by Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron. Richtofen achieved 19 kills in his Fokker, which was painted all red. He was also killed in a Fokker, although no one knows for sure who killed him. Today, the Fokker Triplane is arguably the most famous aircraft from World War I, although is was pulled from service in July 1918 due to a series of mysterious failures of the upper wing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe following are photos from one of the test flights of the plane.
