After separating the munar transfer module from the launch vehicle, the module started spinning uncontrollable. Even stopping it manually didn\u0027t help, as soon as I stopped working against the spin, it started anew. No thrusters or RCS were running. It remains a mystery at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, the unfortunate kerbalnauts Jeb, Bill and Bob could be rescued by a mission send up shortly after. The rescue ship was untested, but performed above expectations and did not only rescue the three pilots, but also exchanged crew on \u003Cstrong\u003EAsbru Transit\u003C/strong\u003E, the station in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3.9.2013\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperts at KSC think, the side-mounted (yet balanced) munar rover was at least one reason for the disaster of the previous mission. After being shout at, the engineers started to think outside the box and came up with a new approach to the whole lander-stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imm.io/1h0Pm.png\u0022 alt=\u00221h0Pm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of using a lander with a separate ascent and descent stage, they came up with this design.

And of course, lift-off from Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the kerbalnauts will have to wait for a while and play Connect 4 (or in Jeb\u0027s version: Connect 3 leaking fuel tanks and a Mainsail) while the small Kethane satellite will start to map the Mun.
