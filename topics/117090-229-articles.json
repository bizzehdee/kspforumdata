The good news is that I think it is nearly done with the initial development and should be able to move into maintenance mode here in a few weeks.  Have also been insanely busy at work due to some... corporate restructuring... so my motivation and brain-power to do coding after work has been less than it usually is.\n\nShould likely have another small bug-fixing release this weekend with fixes for the rotation module (had improper default values in the code, can be fixed currently with config, but am fixing the defaults), and a few other minor fixes for things that I\u0027ve noticed during playtesting.  Possibly even a couple more adapter texture colors (gray and green), and fuel tank texture (silver).\n\nOne thing that is rapidly moving up my priority list is the rework on the Lander-Core parts.  The pods themselves aren\u0027t too bad, but the fuel tanks are in a sad state, and really need to have integrated landing legs of one sort or another (or at least have usable landing legs available as separate parts; the stock ones love to tip over perfectly level and stable craft; they actually destabilize things).  So the next \u0027big thing\u0027 for SSTU will likely be the lander-core revamp, which will mostly consist of creating new fuel tank models.  The integrated landing legs might be actual \u0027landing legs\u0027 using a KSPWheel setup, but I\u0027m also debating making them a standard static collider and animation setup (e.g. the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E landing leg setups; which should allow for zero sliding on most hills).\n\nEdit:  \n\nQuick preview/mock-up of the silver tank textures; more of a matte brushed silver than a \u0027super-shiny\u0027 silver due to the lack of reflection support in shaders.
