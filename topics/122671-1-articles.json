Hit caps for soft controls and this should be very similar to the XP-55 in warthunder. Which, I fly exclusively. The only other things you might want to do for realism is keep the throttle down so it can never get past it\u0027s max stats for a propeller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, use SAS for stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtiss-Wright_XP-55_Ascender\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EReal stats:\u003C/a\u003E (translated to KSP numbers.

It seems to be at a crazy angle relative to the craft, and I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s because you have so many rotated/translated control surfaces. The game gets confused when you do that too much. Turn a control surface even a tiny amount and it will jump way out of position. That can be exploited, but here it looks like it\u0027s working against you. My advice is to do a top-down rebuilt, but take a different approach to your control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you\u0027ve got the fuel budget, try throwing some vernors on there. It can do crazy things for your maneuverability, though it can really cut into your flight time. Good luck, dude!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
