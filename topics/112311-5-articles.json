Everyday temperature is close to 0C, so 600kJ (600*1) required to raise aluminium to melting point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen aswell as raising a material to melting point, there is extra energy required to melt it. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll of noticed before that water for instances in a freezer gets very cold much faster than it freezes. This is because of the extra energy needed for a phase change. The latent heat of fusion for aluminium is 500kJ, meaning it takes 500kJ to change solid aluminium at melting point into molten aluminium at melting point. So in total ~1100kJ (that\u0027s 600\u002B500, the energy to get the aluminium to melting point plus the energy to melt it) are required to melt aluminium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA heavy duty battery has 26 amp hours, an amp hour is 3.6kJ per volt. 26*4*6=100*6=600kJ contained in one battery\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etwo batteries have double the energy, 600kJ*2=1200kJ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo two heavy duty 6 volts batteries contain ~1200kJ.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BlueCosmology\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BlueCosmology\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI assume you\u0027re just a troll now, because not only did I not link a forum (I linked google) you then went onto link a different battery.
