It worked, mostly. The external tank usually exploded when it hit the ground, but otherwise it flew like a dream.\n\nSince it worked so well, I think I might return to the concept, and make it look prettier.\n\n![pozC4r3.png](http://i.imgur.com/pozC4r3.png)\n\n![siFWmF6.png](http://i.imgur.com/siFWmF6.png)\n\n![51SQ82g.png](https://i.imgur.com/51SQ82g.png)"}]}
