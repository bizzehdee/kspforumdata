In the case that you are orbiting jool, all of its moons will be calculated, as well as the major planets (including dres and eeloo), but not the major planets respective moons. One exception though, the gravitational forece from duna and ike will be averaged together first because of their relatively similar sizes. Once all the vectors for the gravitational attractions are averaged together, there is the gravity vector you apply to the space ship. This will be modeled for all ships with command pods, so calculations for debris will not bog down your CPU. Those said ships will then have their orbits calculated in advance in reasonable steps, such as every minute, in such a way as every hour, on the hour, the game calculates 60 new steps for the orbital path of non active vessels. Those trajectory points are them smoothed through a spline-like system to generate a smooth path. For time warps of higher than 1,000x, the calculation intervals will be spread out to one hour between each. Or faster if you have a better CPU (interval will be set in settings.cfg).

There are also special areas called Lagrange Points where 3 bodies that ARE close enough to each other can stay in harmony.

I don\u0027t know why people think it\u0027s this hugely complicated, CPU-killing problem. It\u0027s only very computation intensive when you simulate \u003Cem\u003Elarge\u003C/em\u003E (as in, more than a few millions) number of particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETimewarp is not really a problem either if the number of bodies is not too large. Matt Roesle already did an\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKp1M4T6z24?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E. The video shows about 80 years of KSP game time. I don\u0027t know how much time the simulation required to compute, but in my experience with N-body codes with small numbers of bodies, I bet it\u0027s small enough that it could be computed in real time at high timewarp.\u003Cp\u003EUser Mattasmack \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49121-On-Newtonian-trajectories-vs-patched-conics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eanalyzed this issue in great detail some time ago\u003C/a\u003E. He actually wrote and tried several numerical algorithms for N-body simulation and investigated what is needed in terms of computing power to accurately compute planetary positions. He concluded that N-body simulations at high timewarp are most likely possible even on modest hardware. Quoting from his website post:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThese estimates are based on conservative assumptions, and so I believe any computer capable of running KSP could also calculate an acceptably large number of trajectories at 100,000x warp.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why isn\u0027t it done? There are many reasons that I can think of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, if you look at\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKp1M4T6z24?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E, you\u0027ll see that Vall is ejected from the Jool system very quickly. In other words, with full N-body simulation some planetary orbits will become unstable. Those that aren\u0027t unstable can still wobble and precess noticeably. This would make interplanetary rendezvous much more difficult. \u003Cp\u003ESecond, think of the consequences on orbits of spacecraft around massive bodies with moons. Perturbations from the moons could likely render spacecraft orbits unstable too. You won\u0027t be able to timewarp without knowing if your huge space station will remain in orbit. In his experiments, Mattasmack found that circular orbits higher than about 7.3 Mm around Kerbin (the Mun\u0027s orbit is 12 Mm in radius) were indeed unstable. Even if the orbit is stable, it will be perturbed and thus not follow an easily predictable path, which makes planning orbital rendezvous much more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, the patched conics approach is a very good middle ground between having no realistic orbital physics and a full-physics simulator. It makes things stable enough that you can timewarp safely and reduces the game\u0027s difficulty to make it enjoyable. It\u0027s still much more realistic than most space games out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-05T15:29:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2013 03:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Meithan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T15:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdding realistic all-body gravitational effects would add a few things the game is missing now, such as lagrange points. Needless to say, most Lagrange points are unstable and bodies in them are repelled from them rather than kept in by gravitational forces. Earth probes are kept in them by applying periodical corrections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, there would be a lot of issues with orbit stability, especially in crowded systems like Jool, Duna, or Kerbin. No more you can leave a probe in orbit and return to it after 1000 years of doing other missions, all your ships would require more or less constant attention. Also preparing interplanetary transits would become much more frustrating and unpredictable due to all kinds of effects. I don\u0027t think it would add fun to the game. 2-body orbital mechanics are complex enough for most players to grasp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
