It didn\u0027t. This is where you come in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not a modder by any means, but if one of you could make a small* mod that restores the magic boulder to its rightful location, I would be eternally grateful. As far as I know, the MB is still in the game, but the game refuses to render it, because it isn\u0027t a celestial body, or a vessel, or a fixed point object. I don\u0027t know what the easiest way to do this would be, but I\u0027m thinking that you could make a tiny \u0022planet\u0022 (\u0026lt;10m across and invisible with an impossibly small SOI) and make the magic boulder a \u0022fixed point\u0022 on that planet.
