You see, since I I locked the science parts that allow me access to various sets of wheels and the rover base I\u0027ve been mystified as to how to add more than two wheels to the vehicle, seems that I can only add a pair of wheels in the center of the rover base and all other wheels come out at angles.

Very interesting!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the OP. SPH is the way to build rovers. It gets far too tedious in the VAB. Turning off angle snap can help with some stubborn wheels that show up at funny angles. just have to work at getting them level with your other wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T01:39:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Belphegor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Belphegor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eguys i think he is talking about the \u0027rover base\u0027 object.. you know, that tiny white box that most of us probably never used because it\u0027s kind of useless?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually found that part to be handy ... it bridges MOST of the distance between parts when they\u0027re connected by a Rockomax hub, and the rest you can get away with by ladder placement...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T01:44:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB the rover wheels will snap on at odd angles if you have the angle snap on.
