What you do with it after could be though, like reproducing the software or hardware, branding it your own, and then selling it. Then you\u0027re actually doing something that most nation-states have a law against.

(Just kidding, I just typically suck at navigating them and stuff.) However, your mod is absolutely awesome. It needs to be said, and said alot. I downloaded this mod one day out of boredom along with a few others to try to get the most out of KSP after I\u0027d played vanilla to death. I didn\u0027t really know what to think of all the robotic parts at first. I thought, \u0022sure, this is neat, but what can I even do with it?\u0022 So the mod stayed installed but I never really made use of the parts. Occasionally I\u0027d experiment with them a little, but ultimately decided that they were just toys and had no real practical use. As time went on, I eventually got KAS and Interstellar, and Kethane, and started a \u0027mining base\u0027 on Moho. Then I thought of Descent, and how they had robots doing alot of the mining in that game, and thought, \u0022Huh. I could build a mining robot with Kethane drills on it\u0027s arms and use the robotic parts to make it.\u0022 Sure, not very practical still, but very cool nonetheless. It wasn\u0027t until ARM that I realized just how essential this mod is to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve struggled with how to get rovers onto other planets for a while now. I mean, sure, I could just build it into the rocket in a clunky ugly way and land it down. I have made drop harnesses as I call them several times. However, I do like to try to keep my rockets aerodynamic and somewhat plausible, and eventually I thought, \u0022How did they get the rover onto the moon IRL?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It freakin\u0027 folded up. So I thought, \u0022Holy crap! I could use the hinges from Magic Smoke Industries to make the wheels fold up and I could probably stuff it in one of the stage covers from KW! Oh... MSI is incompatible at the moment. Oh well, no matter, I can do with out...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have checked the forums every day to see if this mod works yet, and I patiently wait for the day that it is fixed up, and each day without it I think of a few more ways I can utilize the parts within. In summary, this mod is epic, and you are a boss for dedicating your time to giving use the privilege of enjoying it. Please, please, \u003Cem\u003Eplease\u003C/em\u003E ignore the ingrates, the flamers, and keep this mod going. KSP just would not be the same without it.

I made that \u0022thing\u0022 below, if I start with the pod as root, then add hinge, then tank, the hinge is miss-aligned at launch but functions and moving the hinge moves the internal cockpit view of the outside world as expected. If I start with the tank as root, then add hinge, then pod, at launch the hinge is perfectly aligned, functions correctly but only the external view of the pod moves, in internal view the nav ball rotates to indicate the angle of the pod is changing but the internal pod view of the outside world doesn\u0027t rotate and stays pointing at the horizon. Further than that, if I start with pod as root, then connect the hinge backwards (the bit that\u0027s supposed to move to the pod), then the tank, the whole thing functions correctly without misaligned, with correct internal view movement but the visual model of the hinge if wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe disconnected internal view issue appears to be carried over from at least 0.23 although I\u0027ve not seen it reported, and the same parts with different root working/not working has probably been covered so this may not be so helpful, and I\u0027m not sure about reversing the hinge - In that particular case it seems to fix misalignment but obviously breaks the visual animation. And, thanks for the time and effort being put into getting this working - we all appreciate it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z12Oqo8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022z12Oqo8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
