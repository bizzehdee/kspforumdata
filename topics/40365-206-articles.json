I just built a massive science farming probe to Dres - it has an SC-9001, 4 Mystery Goo\u0027s, 3 SCANSat parts, a Magnetometer and an antenna. My previous designs for such probes usually used the LV-909 mini engines or since it was unlocked the LV-N motor. But those SCANSats in particular are truly power hungry so I started building them with generators and nuclear power ... on a whim I stuck an argon container and a plasma thruster on this one instead (all Interstellar parts on this one are 1.25m versions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only annoying thing I found is that the plasma thrusters won\u0027t let you change the fuel type in the VAB - though it automatically switched to Argon as soon as I launched so according to Engineer-Redux I had no delta-V in stage-0 at all in the VAB. As soon as I was launched though - I saw the numbers. 14600\u002B delta-V with a starting TWR of around 0.69 on a 12-ton probe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have never been able to match that with an LV-N - hell to get 14K delta-V out of an LV-N I would need so much fuel that the thing would end up weighing at least 30 tonnes, and thus my TWR would be in the 0.0x range (meaning massively long burns to get anywhere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes it, unupgraded, by far the best probe engine I\u0027ve ever had. I suppose the pure-liquid mode rocket nozzles may beat it (it will beat it on TWR - but even then not by much) but while I meant this probe to go to Dres I could send it anywhere - heck a variant of this could easily do a magnetometer scan anywhere in the Kerbol system including Kerbol itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: erm - okay - found the catch - once it started firing on the plasma thruster the TWR dropped to 0.035 - and just finishing my insertion orbit is estimated to take 11 hours of real-time. It will work, but it\u0027s going to take some careful planning and observation (nasty side effect of slow burns are they can actually take so long that you end up on the other side of your orbit and burning prograde when you started out retrograde or vice versa).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a science-farming probe this is a fantastic engine already... and it may be worth designing a mission or two around that if only to help players unlock the next tier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-04T10:01:49Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2014 10:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by metalpoetza\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdated information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shad0wCatcher","CreatedById":98819,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T10:42:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMetal: The TWR you were seeing I *believe* is based on the thruster receiving maximum power.

I redesigned my probe with an LV-N instead - so I\u0027ll just be farming up some science now to start unlocking the next tier and start writing new missions from there, I honestly can\u0027t seem to find a suitable mission to showcase the pre-upgrade plasma-thrusters since they seem to be virtually useless.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry it with Xenon, you will get twice the thrust and half the ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry using the 62.5 cm thruster as well. The only difference between the sizes is their weight and the maximum amount of power they can use. You won\u0027t cap the 62.5 cm one using only nuclear power, so that saves you 0.833 tons of weight. It\u0027s not much, but it can make a difference for your small ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, it takes a lot of power to get usable levels of thrust from plasma. It takes 820 megawatts to match the LV-N\u0027s thrust using Xenon, after accounting for the power you lose from xenon\u0027s 69% efficiency. That\u0027s more power than what you can get out of any unupgraded fission reactor/generator combo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfinityArch","CreatedById":66832,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T18:10:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m experiencing a rather unusual issue with my KSP right now: every so often (haven\u0027t been able to reproduce it reliably, it just happens on rare occasions), vessels will randomly duplicate when not focused on, leading to spontaneous explosions if you try to fly said vessel, and, given that I\u0027m playing a heavily modded game, my first response has been to start removing mods one by one and seeing whether or not the issue persists.

I\u0027m having some trouble with B9 Aero\u0027s Sabre engines and precoolers. On my prototype SSTO, I have 3 Sabre M\u0027s with precoolers attached; I can burn at full throttle to my intake limit just fine, but once I switch to rocket mode, the engines start building up heat that doesn\u0027t dissipate. I\u0027m not talking about Waste heat, either; I mean the engine Overheat bar. My engines are some distance from my CoM, so I figure that\u0027s why they\u0027re building up heat, which is fine; I can manage that. However, the fact that it isn\u0027t dissipating at all is problematic. If I comment out the lines in the KSPI ModuleManager \u0022b9aero.cfg\u0022 file that add \u0022ModuleSabreHeating,\u0022 this problem goes away; however then they overheat in atmosphere, as I\u0027m assuming the precoolers stop working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, if I right click on a precooler in the flight screen, it says \u0022Precooler status: Offline.\u0022 Is this normal?

Activating the engines in rocket mode at ALL in a vacuum causes spontaneous unplanned disassembly... i.e., overheat and explode.
