Lately I\u0027ve been pretty negative about the outlook of this game, particularly regarding realism features and UI. I\u0027ve been playing 0.90 and there have been TONS of improvement that were kept under wraps, and their silence was interpreted by me as ignoring us. So again, SQUAD, I\u0027m sorry. I pledge to shut the hell up regarding speculations of the direction of this game.
