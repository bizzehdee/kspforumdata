In the video, \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 is a bit below 1/s, \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9 for the ca. 1m string would be 3/s, which would give a maximum deviation of about 0.3 d. Looks about right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what the formula neglects, as stated, is the torque caused by z and r not being colinear. Well... such a torque is quickly swallowed up by a gyro, which reacts with an inclination change. You can observe it in that video. Watch how quickly the oscillation of the string dies down.

One string is burnt through leaving the gyro suspended, point of suspension directly above the point of attachment, distance from there to the Centre of mass d. The gyro couple transfers the reaction to support the weight and the gyro remains horizontal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gyro precesses, which means that it turns about its own centre of gravity. It cannot displace itself. There must be an external force applied in direction of the displacement to accelerate the mass from rest. As the gyro is attached externally by the string, the displacing force must be provided by the string.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the string to provide a horizontal component of force, it must deviate from vertical. This should be visible, initially the gyro stays still then gradually accelerates as the subtended angle increases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is only after the string has provided this acceleration that the gyro can move in an orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a way to demonstrate this conclusively. At some point the ratio of d to L will be such that the horizontal force will be too small to displace the mass and the gyro will remain in position with the string circling around it. So, if L then is reduced, would the point of rotation move away from the Gyro?. Would it be a gradual process? Can L be fixed at a length such that the point of rotation would be at d/2?

I took out my gyroscope. It is a pretty crappy gyroscope, because it\u0027s just a toy. And I tied a string to one end of the axis. Then I spun it up... held it with its axis horizontal and the string vertical...and let go of the other end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I saw (after repeated attempts for verification), is that when released, the gyroscope will precess and therefore rotate around its center of mass. This rotates the endpoint of the axis where the string is attached away from being directly below the support point...so the string is no longer vertical. This results in a horizontal force (provided by the string\u0027s tension). So the gyroscope started moving sideways (roughly perpendicular to the direction of its axis). It was also precessing, of course, so it continued to deflect the string, which continued to provide the horizontal push that sort of \u0027chased the gyroscope around the circle\u0027 making a larger deflection until things stabilized with the gyroscope circling the center point as it precessed, and the string providing the centripetal force needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy gyroscope doesn\u0027t run long enough or smoothly enough for this all to be pretty, but I saw nothing mysterious about what it was doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-31T22:41:12Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2014 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos and clarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T23:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the last time video 5 does not demonstrate your point.

Gravity is an external force, so it results in change of momentum. Indeed, if you drop something, it accelerates. The string on which the object is suspended, also is a force, and also results in momentum change. If the string is perfectly vertical, the two cancel each other out. Net momentum change of object is zero. If the suspended mass is swinging, then on \u003Cem\u003Eaverage\u003C/em\u003E the momentum changes are canceled. But if there is an average deflection, there is a net momentum flow. So if your system is capable of maintaining \u003Cem\u003Eaverage\u003C/em\u003E deflection, then we know that it would be able to accelerate in vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwinging back and forward, in contrast, only tells you that your system has been able to build up angular momentum. Which as I\u0027ve said, is already pretty cool when you can do it with a very simple system, but as you yourself point out, it\u0027s something little kids can do on a swing. So it\u0027s not groundbreaking. Nor does it contradict the well established principles of conservation of momentum and conservation of angular momentum. (Both are transferred via pivot and gravity, rather than created/destroyed.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M Drive","CreatedById":105619,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T05:41:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off I\u0027ll just let you have the videos I took yesterday.
