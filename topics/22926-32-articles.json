Also, the Salvage Pod has a ridiculously low \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV. What is the purpose of that thing even?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a rule of thumb, I\u0027ve placed parts a tier up from, although a fair few are at the same tier as, their stock equivalents (and with the first 4 tiers essentially untouched). I\u0027d decided against putting the lll nuclear engines with the stock one as well, so they currently unlock at Experimental Rocketry (as do the 4x2 parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Salvage tug, Gaius is right, it\u0027s designed primarily for construction and retrieval, with the occasional crew transfer/rescue. I intended it to operate from a station or mother-ship, rather than prolonged operations, as conditions are just a wee bit cramped in there. If I recall correctly the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV is \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C6\u2019 500 ms-1, which is adequate for basic orbital manoeuvres and intercepts (and the actual tanks on the side are balanced to stock volumes).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-22T09:39:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2013 09:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Lack\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"impwarhamer","CreatedById":80499,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T16:14:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso, does this acyualy work with 0.22 sandbox, or not.
