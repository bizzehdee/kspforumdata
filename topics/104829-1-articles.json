I was just bored and needed something to listen to, but down the line, I found myself looking up more paradoxes rather than doing what I was doing before. So it got me thinking, which as you all know, can be a dangerous thing. Why did I divert all my attention to this topic? As a matter of fact, why is anyone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECutting to the chase, why are we attracted to paradoxes? It\u0027s so counterintuitive. I mean, we wish to find answers to our questions.

The causality paradox states that, if you went back in time to kill yourself, you could never go back in time to kill yourself, as you would be dead. Seems like a simple conclusion, right? Alright, answer found. We can go home... guys?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven after reaching a reasonable conclusion, we still stay back to look at it. But... why? The answer is there... right? This is a bit of a paradox in itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParadoxes that have no real answer are understandably interesting, but even so. Why do we pursue interest in a question that we know doesn\u0027t have a real answer? Endlessly pondering the question, and never getting closer to another side.

Language cannot possibly describe reality to completeness, so it goes to the next best thing, which is approximation. Your thoughts are also a language to describe the world. So are mathematics. So in all, paradoxes exist only in our heads. They are interesting because they are a problem to solve, and where in reality we can use Action to create Consequence, in our heads, it\u0027s all pretty much fair game as to what follows what.

It might also have something to with the kind of brain activity it produces - I assume the brain is used to dealing with situations which have some kind of an end, so to speak, at which point it can turn off and move on to the next problem.
