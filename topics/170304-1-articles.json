The Merlin\u0027s lower isp and higher thrust is beast for getting off the ground and into orbit, but it\u0027s less useful for getting beyond LEO. However, when the alternative is a non-cryo hypergolic with even poorer isp, it\u0027s a good idea to make the most use of it, especially if you can do the TLI straight off the pad.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen again, one option would be to use an inverted version of the Earth-Lunar-Orbit Rendezvous planned with Constellation. Constellation had the man-rated Ares I lifting Orion into LEO, then using Ares V to lift Altair into LEO for a rendezvous. After docking, the Ares V upper stage would send the whole stack to a free-return, after which the Altair\u0027s descent engines would perform the lunar orbit insertion burn. Using the lander\u0027s engine for the insertion burn is slightly more efficient than going the Apollo route (using the CSM\u0027s engine), since you get to drop those tanks on your landing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe inverted version of the Constellation architecture would be to send a prop-heavy lander up to LEO on the first Falcon Heavy, then send up a Dragon 2 (with kick stage in the trunk) and dock to the lander in LEO, with the Falcon Heavy upper stage still attached to the Dragon 2. That stage then fires for the TLI, rather than the lander\u0027s terminal stage as in the Constellation plan. This allows the whole mission to make optimal use of the two equally-sized LVs rather than using one gigantic HLV and a smaller man-rated launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t crunched all the numbers, but one very interesting option would hinge on whether the Falcon 9 upper stage can be easily modified for extended-lifetime restarts. That\u0027s where things get really interesting, because you could dock both stacks in LEO, use the Dragon 2\u0027s ascent stage for the TLI, and then use the lander\u0027s ascent stage in cislunar orbit to perform the insertion burn.

The Merlin\u0027s lower isp and higher thrust is beast for getting off the ground and into orbit, but it\u0027s less useful for getting beyond LEO. However, when the alternative is a non-cryo hypergolic with even poorer isp, it\u0027s a good idea to make the most use of it, especially if you can do the TLI straight off the pad.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen again, one option would be to use an inverted version of the Earth-Lunar-Orbit Rendezvous planned with Constellation. Constellation had the man-rated Ares I lifting Orion into LEO, then using Ares V to lift Altair into LEO for a rendezvous. After docking, the Ares V upper stage would send the whole stack to a free-return, after which the Altair\u0027s descent engines would perform the lunar orbit insertion burn. Using the lander\u0027s engine for the insertion burn is slightly more efficient than going the Apollo route (using the CSM\u0027s engine), since you get to drop those tanks on your landing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe inverted version of the Constellation architecture would be to send a prop-heavy lander up to LEO on the first Falcon Heavy, then send up a Dragon 2 (with kick stage in the trunk) and dock to the lander in LEO, with the Falcon Heavy upper stage still attached to the Dragon 2. That stage then fires for the TLI, rather than the lander\u0027s terminal stage as in the Constellation plan. This allows the whole mission to make optimal use of the two equally-sized LVs rather than using one gigantic HLV and a smaller man-rated launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t crunched all the numbers, but one very interesting option would hinge on whether the Falcon 9 upper stage can be easily modified for extended-lifetime restarts.
