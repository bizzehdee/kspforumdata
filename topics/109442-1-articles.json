In my early/mid career SSTO\u0027s I end up re-purposing the named action groups (RCS, Stage, even abort) to toggle engines and on some orbital probes I use Gear (G) to deploy solar panels.

As mentioned earlier you could just exploit your way around it by building and launching rockets from the hangar and runway.

In-flight removal of action group participants (for when you dock two craft together permanently and need to deconflict groups, removes parts from action groups only, equivalent of simply unplugging a memory module; you can take it out, but you just don\u0027t have anything to replace it with.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Tier 2 real life equivalent: rudimentary transistor technology, non-writable permanent memory storage (rope core, ROM, etc.), still requires most things to be set up prior to launch but can help take task loading off the crew.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTier 3: in-flight addition of action groups (think of this like going from rope core memory in the Apollo era, could not be reprogrammed in flight, to EPROM chips that can be updated in flight) and an expansion on the complexity of logic systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Tier 3 real life equivalent: full up integrated circuitry with deep programming/scripting ability coupled with readable/writable permanent memory storage: flash, hard disk, floppy, continuous tape, solid state, etc.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-26T11:31:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2016 11:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Yaivenov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T09:06:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYES!
