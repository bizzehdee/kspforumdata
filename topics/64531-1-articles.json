One thing I have really yet to do is do interplanetary missions. not anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built this huge prototype interplanetary ship with lander in Orbit with 9 separate launches (Not including the assembler) I think i expended over 1500 units of Mono-propellent in the assembly. It has a science lab, 3 Hitchhickers, and it\u0027s current lander (with two rovers) is capable of Landing and returning to orbit from Moho. It tips the scales at 380 Tons, 680 parts, 240 struts, and has a performance of over 6000 Delta V at 0.4 TWR thanks to 22 NERVA engines.
