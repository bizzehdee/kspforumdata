Very advanced compared to Kerbal Space Program. It is where you start off with a few basic resources, with some devices found lying on the side of the road and a new editor - \u0027The garage\u0027 (perhaps implemented into the real game as a rover editor?). You can then use those to look for more resources to build some more buildings (more editors, Tracking Centre, Mission control, civil/city buildings?) and more things that you can use to get resources on other planets. The difference from KSP-original would be it as more general game - you could not even build a space centre. Just build a city or something.

It might be hard for a paid expansion to offer something compelling that the free mods don\u0027t. Worse, if Squad did have an eye on DLC, would they opt to make the game less mod-friendly? For example at the moment modding celestials is a bit of a hack; if Squad want to release new celestials in an expansion, they may see it as counterproductive to make modding celestials easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I reckon I could get behind would be a visual upgrades expansion.
