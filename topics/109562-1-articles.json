When I have multiple saved versions of one game, any attempts to load an old manually saved point in that game reverts everything EXCEPT MISSION REPORTS to the correct point in time. Failing a mission and then reverting to an earlier save still shows the failed mission report, but the effects of having failed are not applied to the older version. No loss of funds or reputation from the old save, fortunately. Maybe I\u0027m the only who doesn\u0027t delete old mission reports, but I have reproduced this about ten times now, some on Normal difficulty and some on Moderate. I\u0027m starting to feel like a beta tester. This applies to both failed and completed mission reports. If I save the game when I have completed 10 missions, then again when I have 22 completed, then reload the first save, it shows 22 mission reports when it should only show 10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe workaround is obvious: delete the mission reports. Another workaround is to rename the old save \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022 before loading it. That removes the inappropriate mission reports. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using the most recent version via Steam on a Windows8 I7 2.7GHZ 32 G RAM with 2 SLI NVIDIA 770. I believe I have the 32 bit version of KSP, but not sure how to check. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have previously reported this in the Modded Installs forum, but got no help, so I removed my mods, retested it, and am posting here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
