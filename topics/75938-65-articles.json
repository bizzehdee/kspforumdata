By the way, having some troubles with the stack nodes when using NodeHelper to tweak them. I\u0027m doing some final fiddling before publishing my tweaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: So, the only thing I can come up with, after removing Nodehelper and still getting the attach/stack nodes being offset improperly after adjusting them is the possibility that the meshes could be interfering with the nodes. Could be something to do with the editor collisions that define the click-area for the part, or something of that sort. Either way, I cannot get the nodes to get close enough to the medium track\u0027s side to make them attach to a surface and still \u003Cem\u003Elook\u003C/em\u003E like they are attached. Instead, they sit away from the surface unless you make use of the soft-attachment thing where you can bury surface attached objects within a larger object by shifting the mouse in the right direction before it snaps to another angle in angle-snap mode. Needless to say, this is simply unacceptable. Fortunately, this is only affecting the tracks so far. The RBI invertable track has a mounting bracket integrated into the model, and thus its attach node is perfectly aligned even after my adjustment. I\u0027m thinking that the tracks you\u0027ve made need something similar on them, a part of the model that is intended for attachment to the craft which is not contained within that collider. Either that, or the collider needs to be shrunk a bunch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just watched that Wired video. Awesome stuff in there. One thing in that article that I noted as being slightly inaccurate is the part where it says something like \u0022if you were closer to the black hole, it would seem like my time is sped up.\u0022 This is true, yes, but only from the perceptual angle of the person closer to the hole. By the other person\u0027s perspective, the person closer to the hole would be slowed down. That\u0027s the funky part of the time/space/light dilation effect. The other useful bit of data for that is where things seem to disappear completely when crossing the threshold where light can no longer escape. The object would not, in fact, disappear right away unless you were right next to it, in which case the time dilation would not be in effect between the two observers. Instead, since light travels at its constant speed in relation to time, and time itself is being dilated, then the image would begin to stretch back towards the threshold and would slowly fade until an image of the craft rested in a 2-dimentional plane just above the \u0022surface\u0022 of the threshold. This image would persist for quite some time if you were observing from outside of the time dilation effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing worth noting is that all that junk orbiting the hole is extremely stressed particles of light and left-over matter from the star\u0027s supernova which would have taken place just before the collapse. It\u0027s a failure of the star in producing too much iron in its core when it swelled during the end of its life-cycle. The resulting explosion throws all that matter out, which would have vaporized the planets that were orbiting at the time (which means those planets in the movie had to have been attracted to the system after the collapse, or they were originally ice-dwarves at the far-reaches of the star\u0027s SOI) and then collapsed into the black hole. The matter is then pulled back in, but not all of it at a perfect angle to simply disappear. This means that, if indeed that particular black hole was spinning at near-light speed, you have a lot of highly charged and thermal-emitting particles of star-stuff that are being pulled around it. while these particles are what made up the star, and due to time dilation they would appear to be active, the light emitted from them would be extremely low when viewed from the atmosphere of a planet like the ones orbiting the hole. The result would be a frozen wasteland with a dim light at the noon-time that would barely feed your solar calculator, and the magnetic affect on electrical system would wreak enough havoc to make a happy little EMP generator seem like candy in the hands of a child. That means your calculator is going to be spitting out martian swahili in response to your mathematical queries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that aside though, good movie and highly recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-01T19:23:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2014 07:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T19:26:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I normally just use a few GameObjects in Unity to aid with node placement.

I don\u0027t know how KSP is storing that information, cause it\u0027s not in the persistence, and there are no MM patches modifying the nodes, and the node positions defined in the part should be correct because, when using nodehelper, I can load up the part and see that the node has been shifted off its position; I can then copy the correct position from the cfg into nodehelper and tell it to reset the node to the entered coordinates and the node will visually shift to that spot. So, I know that my coordinates are correct, but still I get the wrong position when KSP loads the part. It\u0027s driving me insane.

What seems to be happening is that the node position is being set, the game shut down (LoadOnDemand mod freaks out when I do a database reload, and I can\u0027t launch without it), the part config edited to match the new values, and then re-loaded with a new launch of the game only to find that the nodes are resetting themselves to a new position each time. It only affects the tracks, and only the ones that you made. my thought is that the collider that controls where another surface-attachable object would stick to the part (if it were allowed) and/or the one that controls the clickable space around the part in the editor are interfering with the node placement. It\u0027s like trying to put a camera inside a brick wall without making a hole where the camera can sit.

I think possibly NodeHelper was giving me false data. I checked my tweaks against your configs and it turns out some of my numbers were higher than yours, when in fact they should be lower since I am mostly copying the attach node and reducing the numbers on it for the stack position so that it looks plausible when attached. I then modify the attach node to match so it consistently attaches in both ways. It\u0027s possible that the same issue encountered with the icon size is also affecting how the numbers are being worked out by the other plugin. I\u0027ve since reinstalled Nodehelper and I\u0027m going to see what it looks like with some of those nodes reverted to the default. I\u0027m not done struggling with this stuff yet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorst case scenario, I\u0027ll see if I can weld in a little I-beam into the part without messing with the rest of the wheel\u0027s functionality so that I can get the visual-connection setup properly without having to adjust the node too. I\u0027ll keep you posted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of the icon fix, apparently the fix has been posted as a potentially separate plugin, though upon adding it to my installation it stalled my loading process every time i launched. It could be conflicting with parts of that fix that you\u0027ve integrated into this project, but I\u0027m not seeing any evidence to support that theory yet. More likely it has something to do with his plugin trying to fix parts without requiring the use of MM patches to apply the fix variables. It\u0027s just a guess at this point though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: So, to answer your question... I\u0027m doing both actually.

It\u0027s rather complicated, but it turns out that NodeHelper does indeed add to the original positions of the nodes when editing them so, if you tweak based on its output alone, the nodes will be all out of whack. What I did was first take down the position NodeHelper first reports, then I tweak the position of the node and take down the new data. I then calculate the difference between the two and add that difference to the original coordinates in the part config. I had to make sure I was incrementing/decrementing the numbers in the right direction based on whether I tweaked the node positively or negatively. I then applied all my tweaks and, if my test tomorrow goes well, I\u0027ll be ready to write my report. I\u0027d do it now, but it\u0027s getting late and I just spent an hour sending that evil reaper guy a list of all of my mods (wrote it out by hand, and I have a TON of them) so he could \u003Cem\u003Emaybe\u003C/em\u003E track down a bug with his official icon-fixer mod that was causing my load-ups to stall half way through every time, and succeed every time when his mod was removed. The part of that fix that you\u0027ve integrated into KF does not affect me in this way, making me wonder if there\u0027s a conflict between the implementations.
