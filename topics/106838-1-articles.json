First I was like \u0022Thanks Obama\u0022, but then I realised it was a patch. Today I\u0027m trying KSP again, wanted to do some mission, but every rocket I build so far is very unstable, spinning even at lower speeds like 100m/s. Impossible to takeoff and killing the fun (Tried with SAS and without, doesn\u0027t matter). Do I have to do a practicum at ESA to play this game now? Since 1.02 I can\u0027t start a single rocket because every rocket (which actually have worked perfectly before the patch) is spinning like hell in lower atmosphere. Am I doing something wrong? I started a lot of rockets before patch and didn\u0027t have any problems at all, but now I am just wainting for help or another patch because that is not working in any way.![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:12:04Z","Content":"Yes, a crash course at ESA, NASA, or any aeronautics school would help.\n\nKSP 1.0 implements credible aerodynamics now.

No fins. No shakiness. 4400 m/s to get to orbit. Any stupid shape I wanted.\n\nOn Monday and Tuesday I was learning to build smaller rockets, kick them over slightly right off the launchpad, just play with the thrust and let them turn themselves, no SAS. About 3000 m/s to get to orbit. Fins were necessary. No aero forces after about 25000 m. Re-entry could be avoided just by staging chutes in space. I decided to try playing totally stock, just to see how it would work.\n\nAfter the patches, now that gravity turn isn\u0027t working for me anymore. The rockets just wobble around randomly. But SAS causes them to go all wonky, so that\u0027s not an option either. I\u0027ve been having to steer them by hand and not let them just fly themselves. I\u0027ve had to go much more straight up. Aero forces still pretty strong into the 40000 m heights. Good thing that I tried to learn the new re-entry before, because now reports are the chutes burn up if you pop them while you are going too fast.\n\nAnyway, it seems like every time I log in, the game physics work differently."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:39:26Z","Content":"Use the aerodynamic overlay, F12.

Most modern rockets have much larger amounts of freedom with gimballing, which lets you do things like launch rockets with a single SRB strapped to the side and still keep stable. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T13:07:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Use the aerodynamic overlay, F12.

Before all of the items in a stack generated drag, but now only the top item generates drag since the items behind it in the stack no longer create drag. Thus this would cause your rocket to act as if you threw a dart backwards. \n\nIf only the top of the stack is experiencing drag, such that there is a disproportional amount of drag on the top of the rocket.\n\nEven if I put a fins on the bottom it doesn\u0027t help much unless I put alot, and that only helps the first stage. After that stage is ejected, the rocket then again tumbles. It seems like a ton of fins are required to create MORE drag than there is on the top, so that when the rocket is askew of prograde there is more drag on the bottom to bring it back lined up with prograde.\n\nWhen the rocket is slightly askew of prograde in a thick atmosphere, the top item of the the stack generates drag, and the rest of the stack having no drag means that top item wants to flip to the back."}]}
