But today I brought back an entire asteroid, actually landing it gently\u00A0right in the middle of the Research and Development Department, and when I recovered the craft I got nothing extra! I just got\u00A060 points from the sample I took, but nothing for bringing home the\u00A0actual asteroid. Surely lots of science can be done with an entire asteroid brought back from space?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can\u0027t give any science points for the asteroid itself for some reason, at the very least increase the multiplier for taking a sample at any of the Kerbal Space Center biomes! The same 60 points as for a sample in orbit was kind of a let-down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T19:25:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think you get all the science you need from an asteroid sample. \u00A0I would vote for a contract to land an asteroid at KSP something about GIANT DIAMOND in space\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir_Robert","CreatedById":158111,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T17:50:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s been awhile since I played with asteroids, but isn\u0027t that sample based on the biome you\u0027re in?
