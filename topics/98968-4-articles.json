I honestly do not see why people are making such a fuss over having to time warp a short amount of time. You design a rocket in the VAB, simulate it if you choose to do so, have it placed in a build queue, and press a button to either time warp to some other thing that requires your attention (such as a correction burn) or until your new rocket is completed, then you launch it. It is not a time sink unless you really believe a few measly seconds of waiting is, which at that point 90% of the game must be one big time sink since you already have to time warp everything else.

Bottom line is that a % is recovered, and a % is lost.

The only thing that I\u0027d add to Snacks! is a power requirement. To utilize kerbal skills, perhaps if you run out of LS (or get within X% of running out) the engineering skill aboard can function as an extension (delivered by adding X days of supplies) using some improvisation (buys a couple days to get a rescue there, perhaps).

I have played with life support but never felt the need to have a construction time, if I need to warp to a window I would simply go to a ship that I wanted to monitor (or just the KSC) and time warp till I was ready to go. If it is something that can be turned on or off, which it should be if implemented, that would be fine, as long as it is done for all levels of play rather than hard coded to medium or hard (choices are often better than forced difficulty).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-08T21:25:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eperiapses (periapsises?)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s Greek, so periapsides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, I\u0027m really fun at parties \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T00:08:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GusTurbo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GusTurbo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESecret insider info: delta V readouts are in.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ikaneko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ikaneko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you\u0027re telling the truth...\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, I hope that\u0027s true.
