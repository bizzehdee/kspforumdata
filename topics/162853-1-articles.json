The idea expands on the multiple slingshot theory presented in the movie. It goes like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA mothership, housing living quarters, gravity rings, heavy radiation shielding and whatnot, launches on a escape trajectory from Earth to Mars. Several hours before periapsis at Mars, a lander (or multiple landers) with people and cargo detaches, makes a minor burn to intercept the atmosphere, and performs an aerobraking maneuver to land at the target site. Mothership, however, does not decelerate, and makes a slingshot past Mars to make it back to Earth. Upon reaching Earth, it slingshots again, towards Mars, while a rocket with new crew or cargo launches from Earth and intercepts with the mothership as it passes past Earth. As the mothership approaches Mars again, it ditches the crew/cargo landers into the atmosphere for aerobrake, just like before, while the old crew ascends to intercept with the mothership, which is bound to Earth again. Upon arrival to Earth, the crew capsule detaches for aerobrake, while the mothership continues the slingshot cycle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea is that after the initial transfer burn, the mothership doesn\u0027t perform any major burns anymore, except for corrections, and that means a lot less fuel to carry. Of course, crew/cargo that launches from Earth and Mars still needs to accelerate to escape velocity to intercept with the mothership, but they can be a lot lighter, since they don\u0027t need to carry extensive life support, supplies, or radiation shielding. Just enough to survive for a few hours or so. So all the heavy stuff that is needed for long interplanetary travel stays in motion forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo put it in layman\u0027s terms, the mothership is like a train that never stops, while people jump on and off it at each station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I haven\u0027t run the math, and I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s possible to perform regular slingshots between Earth and Mars. I know that launch window opens every 1.5 years, but I don\u0027t know how if slingshot windows are regular too. Even in the best case scenario, the crew on Mars would have to stay many years before the mothership made the round trip back. However, there could be several motherships - one is headed to Mars, while the other is returning to Earth. That would cut the wait time roughly in half. Again, I hope someone with a better understanding of orbital mechanics could say if slingshot windows are reasonably regular.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if they are, it is more than likely that mothership would sometimes have to slingshot pretty far away from either planet, so the lander would require quite a lot of \u003Cspan\u003E \u0394\u003C/span\u003EV to change trajectory to intercept the atmosphere. However, the mothership could pass closer to the atmosphere than it actually needs, and perform a correction burn to make up for the sub-optimal slingshot altitude. That would require having somewhat more fuel onboard, but still a lot less than it would need for capture and escape burns on each planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApart from that, I\u0027m not seeing any inherent flaws with this idea. I\u0027m just not sure if unlimited number of slingshots between two planets is at all possible, and what would the transit times be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would be happy if some greater minds than mine could comment on the feasibility of this idea. Most likely I\u0027m missing some practical consideration here. Or maybe someone before me has already considered and scrubbed this idea.

Afterwards, create another empty reference node for the next encounter after pre-determined X days, and use MCC\u0027s to make sure that dummy node happens to be at the periapsis of next encounter planet...

(They also start with the assumption that the orbital periods are exactly in the ratio of 1.875:1 but that is easy to compensate for.) When the Aldrin cycler, or any cycler, is simulated in an accurate solar system then course adjustments are needed to compensate for the varying motions of the planets. For instance Mars\u0027 orbit is quite eccentric so if you encounter it near it\u0027s periapsis Mars will be way ahead of its mean position. So the time between encounters has to vary back and forth from orbit to orbit. You can greatly reduce the size and frequencies of the adjustments if you can calculate the ship\u0027s motion several orbits ahead, but that takes some serious calculating chops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-06T03:37:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223112612\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162853\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221499299952\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157596\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thor Wotansen\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Thor Wotansen said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other problem with cyclers is that the second we crack fusion they\u0027re obsolete. \u00A0A fusion engine would allow trajectories similar to what you see in The Expanse (albeit with a coast period).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, sure, but we\u0027d also see huge radiators.
