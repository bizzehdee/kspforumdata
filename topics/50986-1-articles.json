However, much more of your delta-v on Eve will not be in a vacuum, so you will most likely need more fuel to take the same payload there and back. With the chart I am using (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png\u003C/a\u003E) it takes about as much delta-v to circularize around Jool, land on Laythe, and escape Jool as it does to take off from Eve. Using nuclear engines, a Laythe lander would be much cheaper on delta-v. Note that I am not an expert on these things though and I accept that these figures may be grossly wrong, use them at your own risk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ninja\u0027d\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a one way trip to Laythe is around 4km/s from LKO if you do not get lucky on aerobraking around Jool. In other words, if you went from LKO to Jool, did an aerobrake to about 200x200, then transferred to Laythe and landed with chutes, your delta-v would be about 4km/s (somewhat optimistic).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-28T22:10:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2013 10:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Orbiter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T22:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Orbiter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Orbiter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAn Eve round trip and a Laythe round trip both take around 20000 meters per second in delta-v, depending on which chart you use (assuming parachutes are used and landings are free).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe map assumes you\u0027ll circularize at a low Jool orbit and then transfer to Laythe. It\u0027s much more efficient just to go straight to Laythe: do a correction burn after leaving Kerbin SOI to make your Jool intercept have its periapsis at Laythe. Then it costs 2 km/s from LKO, rather than 3.5 km/s. All the moons of Jool are cheaper to hit directly than via aerobraking at Jool, but especially so with Laythe since you can aerobrake at Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe map suggests it\u0027s closer to 3 km/s to get off Laythe.
