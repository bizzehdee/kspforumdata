No wings, no drag items, no airbrakes. Just a fuel can with 4 thugs with a 2 seat lander on top.\n\nI hit 70K and my 3k\u002B m/s speed is right away dropping, I never hit the heat, because the vehicle is below 1K before I hit 40K.\n\nTo make it even weirder, speed keeps bleeding off, until I\u0027m down to 60m/s.\n\nAt 20ishK 60m/s is a really really slow trip down to the surface, but strangely popping a chute and the craft speeds up to 200m/s or so.\n\nEven better Trajectories actually predicts that my craft is going to bleed of speed that fast and land right on target."},{"CreatedByName":"Senormeens","CreatedById":145344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T20:55:49Z","Content":"it seems like it might just have been a one off glitch, I have never seen that happen before.

At about 16km the flames abated and I was going less than 1000m/s so I hit the chutes and landed normally.\n\nI don\u0027t think I can help you wihtout an actual picture or craft file.
