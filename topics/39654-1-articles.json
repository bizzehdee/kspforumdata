So, I thought I\u0027d try making my own landing leg for KSP. I finished creating it, not the fanciest looking thing in the world but I quite like it, and I thought I was all ready to use it in the game. However, when I loaded up the game and went to take a look at my creation, I was very disappointed. The shape of the landing leg has been totally deformed and I have no idea why. I knew I had to flip the model upside down in blender before exporting it, otherwise it would be upside down in the game. But the in-game result is bizarre. I have no idea what\u0027s going on and don\u0027t really know how to describe it, so I\u0027ll post an image of what it\u0027s supposed to look like and another of what it looks like in the game. Like I said, it would be great if someone could help me out here.
