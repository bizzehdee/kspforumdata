So I sent down my manned rover with it\u0027s reusable sky crane. The landing went off without a hitch, but as soon as I drive the rover between 500m to 1km away from the sky crane the wheels, and only the wheels, drop through the surface.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wheels still spin but gain no traction. I can barrel roll the rover across the surface using the reaction wheels.
