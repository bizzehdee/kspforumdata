Then we can help you out.\n\nSecond, there is a lot of missing data here. What other information are you given on C(OH)\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E? You might have something like pK\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E, solubility, etc. I\u0027m getting slightly different number for pH, for example, and it might be just the matter of me using tables for different temperature. So you\u0027ll need to share whatever you\u0027re given on this substance."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T00:33:58Z","Content":"Pretty much impossible without any other data... It looks like Ca(OH)2 is a double acid so you should know what couple you are working with. It also looks like it is a weak acid but i can\u0027t really tell for sure... that should be given data, along with solubility values. Then the pKa of the couple you are working with are always good to have. Then, pH=-log\u00A9 or pH=-pKa \u002B log( [base]/[acid] ) should do the job....?"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T00:50:59Z","Content":"The later question is easy - get molar mass of Ca(OH)2, then the [OH-] out of the pOH (you should know this anyway), then as Ca(OH)2 is strong base, get the molarity of Ca(OH)2. You can work it out yourself.\n\nThe former is a bit harder - you lacked the Ksp of Ca(OH)2. [One search](http://bilbo.chm.uri.edu/CHM112/tables/KspTable.htm) gives a Ksp of 5.5\\*10^(-6), you should be good to go I guess."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T01:10:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The later question is easy - get molar mass of Ca(OH)2, then the [OH-] out of the pOH (you should know this anyway), then as Ca(OH)2 is strong base, get the molarity of Ca(OH)2.

I\u0027ve gotten pretty close to the answer with numbers from Wikipedia, but not close enough to be sure that they are the same values as given for the problem."}]}
