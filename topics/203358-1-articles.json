I come here to the forums as my last resort.\u00A0 I\u0027ve been attempting to debug this install for three days now. A variety of related bugs have been solved already regarding incompatible mods, but this one has proved to be a... deeper issue. Upon loading all the mods completely, the loading script is killed with a ReflectionTypeLoadException while \u0027verifying\u0027 the Breaking Ground Expansion, the last stage of loading before the main menu. (That\u0027s a special type of fury, trust me). Anyway, I\u0027ve exhausted the KSP Discord and the Internet looking for a concrete solution, finding nothing of true use. My full mod list and KSP log will be provided below. Any help or suggestions would be welcome! Note: Reinstalls of all mods and a reinstall of KSP itself along with file verification did nothing to remedy the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP.log -\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/7kghylxc4c43cim/KSP.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/7kghylxc4c43cim/KSP.log?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod List (screenshot) -\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/7j3hfrcid03kc8f/Mod%20List.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/7j3hfrcid03kc8f/Mod List.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nError (screenshot) -\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/132503638793912320/858488305892065281/unknown.png?width=829\u0026amp;height=518\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://media.discordapp.net/attachments/132503638793912320/858488305892065281/unknown.png?width=829\u0026amp;height=518\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"epicer12","CreatedById":212452,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-29T22:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndelete\u00A0GroundConstruction it\u0027s DLL is broken\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BadModder54","CreatedById":196812,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-29T23:56:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was the issue, I\u0027d recommend for anyone having the issue to get rid of Ground Construction until it\u0027s updated to a newer version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
