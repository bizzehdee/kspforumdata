The navball is keying off of the torque stabilization, and that value is falling when the engines tail off. In essence, the navball is basing its thrust vector off of the maximum available torque, which is OK while the engines are running above a certain throttle value. But when the engines tail off, so does the maximum torque, and thus, so drifts the thrust vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tested this by using the \u0022Stock SAS\u0022 setting, but since this appears to be a dynamic action, and the torque is a calculated value based on engine power, I think it makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErr Yes.

I docked the last segment last night, topped off fuel and monoprop in all tanks and components, and then asked MJ to plot a transfer burn to Jool. MJ gave me a burn of about 1930 m/s roughly 6 hours from the time I requested. By contrast, KAC tells me the window to Jool begins in about 66 DAYS. I decided something wasn\u0027t right here so I returned to the Space Center and quit the game. I reloaded it this morning and just for grins, I deleted the planned maneuver node and told MJ to calculate it again. This time, I got an estimated burn of ~1907 m/s but in 54 days rather than 6 hours. That\u0027s still 10 days sooner than KAC\u0027s alarm but at least within the range of reasonable if we presume KAC\u0027s alarm is an idealized lowest-energy trajectory point in the window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know you guys have bigger fish to fry in the MJ world but any insight is appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BARCLONE","CreatedById":76024,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T15:21:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sarbian\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sarbian\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EErr Yes.

What if the SAS total were used as a \u0022baseline\u0022 value for a dynamically-generated total?
