I just, what?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the VERY big difference, that stuff you saw, it\u0027s only for low class Arabs (Basically richness and poorness).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a good amount of money, you can get a very good living, no, you won\u0027t find people armed with guns, it\u0027s actually very rare (At least for Jordan), BUT, never ever trust places for tourists, they always have those low class Arabs that scam money from tourists, yes, in Arabic countries, they are really not friendly to tourists. Be prepared for extreme scams (Hotels are fine, they don\u0027t scam, only those touristic places).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHigh class: You will have a very great time, you will not be stuck to those weird songs or anything like that, if you find someone low class, then, try to stay away from their \u0022join us\u0022 attempts, they will try to influence you greatly, don\u0027t let them drag you with them (that does NOT mean you shall ignore them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow what? Ugh, you won\u0027t experience it, but, normally, it happens, eh, A LOT..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is it? No, not murder or some kind of crap.It\u0027s their marriage celebrities\u00A0. It doesn\u0027t sound bad, but it\u0027s, REALLY BAD. First, women go to a side, and men go to another side, they put on this weird music, and guess what? MAXIMUM VOLUME, you will feel your intestines shaking inside your body of how loud the music is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, comes the guns and safety, the VERY low class usually has guns equipped. But don\u0027t worry, murder is rare in Arabic countries (I find it weird, since a lot of people carry guns, but they rareley use them, even when threatened). As of their religion, it is STRICTLY PROHIBITED to hurt another muslim, so, you\u0027re quite safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, is their knowledge. As you may have guessed, Arabs are quite dumb, and, if you are staying in a hotel, good luck trying to communicate with anyone, even the receptionist. Arabs have VERY little English education.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEducation now. Arabs have one of the worst education in the world, especially if you go to free schools (seriously, you are gonna want to leave right when you put your foot on the basement of the school, every single student will be jumping on desks, and make such a massive mess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrices are extremely high, can be 3 times the prices in the US.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHygene is horrible, walking on the road... You see a lot of chips bags all over the road, and plastic bags flying instead of birds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTalking\u00A0about wildlife now, HORRIBLE, first thing, you can easily see a couple of dirty kids abusing an animal, especially street cats, they throw rocks, sticks and pebbles at those harmless cats, it\u0027s seriously sad to watch. Trying to stop them? They\u0027re going to do the same thing with you. Birds are rare to find.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlants, seriously, good luck finding anything other than desert plants. Normal green plants are rare to find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRainfall? Good lord, don\u0027t think of that, rainfall is EXTREMLY RARE, even in winter. But, Jordan offers one of the best rainfall in the middle east, and sometimes snow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTerrorism, it\u0027s horrible, I really hate when:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMe: I\u0027m an Arab\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRandom Person: Terrorist!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt feels so horrible, I hate those type of people, because since 9/11, I havent seen any MAJOR terrorism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReligion, it\u0027s ruined, in the past years, our religion was seriously strong, but is falling apart now, good thing is: People still fear god and obey his rules. Bad thing is: They have mixed horrible things with god.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope I helped,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWaseem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-08T05:47:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2016 05:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Waseemq1235\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-30T18:49:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, Waseem,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, I know quite a bit about life in the Middle East, I have a couple of friends who spent almost twenty years as missionaries in Damascus, Syria.
