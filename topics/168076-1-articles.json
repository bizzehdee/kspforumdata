that KSP can be\u00A0 bit ... wonky ... about figuring out the \u0022collision\u0022 between objects resting on the surface, and the surface they\u0027re resting on.\u00A0 This can get particularly pronounced if the objects are large and complex (lots of parts joined together) rather than small and simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy totally uninformed \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eguess\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (which might be wrong) about why it\u0027s worse for big things is that there may be some physics \u0022sag\u0022 involved:\u00A0 i.e. a large compound structure sags and bends a bit under gravity as it conforms to the surface, but then when you switch back to the ship from somewhere else, it initially is placed in an \u0022unsagged\u0022 shape (before physics kicks in) which may cause pieces of it to clip slightly inside terrain, resulting in hilarity when physics kicks in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy solution for this, when building bases, has been to make sure that \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eno part of the base rests on the ground except for landing legs\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 That is, the whole base is supported on landing legs, and there aren\u0027t any other pieces that are just sitting there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy does this help?\u00A0 Again, this is just uninformed speculation, but my guess is that it\u0027s this:\u00A0 landing legs have special code handling them so that the base\u0027s stored \u0022position\u0022 is floating slightly off the ground, and the \u0022feet\u0022 of the legs \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eauto-conform to the terrain\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E rather than clipping inside it and causing a collision.\u00A0 It works because the legs have some \u0022travel\u0022 to their suspension, so as long as the positioning error due to physics easing isn\u0027t any bigger than the available travel distance on the legs, then everything\u0027s okay.\u00A0 Instead of panicking \u0022oh noes I\u0027m clipped inside the ground it\u0027s a COLLISION!\u0022 and having a physics hissy fit over it, instead the game simply raises the leg\u0027s foot until it\u0027s right at ground level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can tell you that the \u0022perch it on legs\u0022 approach has definitely helped me in a variety of cases with surface bases.\u00A0 What I don\u0027t know, though, is whether \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eyour\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E problem is the same as \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emy\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E problem, so I don\u0027t know whether this will actually help you in your case.\u00A0 For example, a lot of folks here have mentioned autostruts, and if autostruts are at the root of your problem, then the leg thing might not actually help.\u00A0 (I was using the \u0022put it on legs\u0022 solution before autostruts were even a thing.\u00A0 Big surface bases have had issues for a while.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, don\u0027t know if this will help you in your particular case, but it may be worth a shot.\u00A0 Just one more thing to try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbital","CreatedById":170602,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-01T20:54:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

I landed another ship about a km away and EVA\u0027d a Kerbal to my base. This allowed me to get it within physics range without taking control right away. I brought my Kerbal right up to it and then switched. Worked just fine. The station was under control and hasn\u0027t given me any problems since. Well, no more than anything else on Gilly, anyway.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t know if that\u0027ll work for you, but it might be worth a shot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Omaha","CreatedById":172093,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-06T17:42:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175588-cpt-kerbalkrunch/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022175588\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175588-cpt-kerbalkrunch/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Cpt Kerbalkrunch\u003C/a\u003E I did think of trying that, seeing if I could land the second vessel nearby and then directly switch over to the first one, and it certainly would be a good exercise in precision landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-06T21:20:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223236953\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168076\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221512582174\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022172093\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Omaha\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Omaha said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175588-cpt-kerbalkrunch/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022175588\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175588-cpt-kerbalkrunch/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Cpt Kerbalkrunch\u003C/a\u003E I did think of trying that, seeing if I could land the second vessel nearby and then directly switch over to the first one, and it certainly would be a good exercise in precision landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Gilly, it\u0027s more like an exercise in patience. It takes a looong time to land. And you\u0027ll definitely get better in your precision landings. I used to think 2km was close. Now I can knock my solar panels off if I wanted to. Although, in your situation, I would land outside physics range and EVA over. I can\u0027t say for sure, but I feel like just bringing a Kerbal (technically a single \u0022part\u0022) helped me to ease into physics range. Or maybe it didn\u0027t make a difference at all.
