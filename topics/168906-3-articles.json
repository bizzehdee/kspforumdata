In Rome, he used his nobility status to earn a position as the tutor of several high ranking Roman nobles\u0027 sons, including Scipio Aemilianus. He eventually became Scipio\u0027s advisor, and went on campaign with him during the Third Punic War, and was present at the sack of Carthage. His written accounts of his experiences during this time are some of the most valuable resources available to modern historians attempting to learn about the rise of the Roman Republic, as well as the organization and tactics employed by the Roman legions of this time period. Because of this, the model of a mid-Republican legion (c.300 BC - c.100 BC) is often referred to as a \u0022Polybian Legion\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/UYZsbEr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UYZsbEr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPolybius\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is launched on a new booster, the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EAuxiliary.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0It is intended to be fully modular and can fly with variable numbers and sizes of solid rocket boosters.

Auxiliary soldiers would be granted Roman citizenship and the full rights that accompanied it if they completed their 25 years of service with the army. Auxiliaries\u00A0were organized into units separate from the legions but were usually grouped together with a legion when on campaign. While a typical Roman army\u0027s backbone consisted of a base of heavily armored legionary infantry, Auxiliary cohorts were used to support the legionaries by providing capabilities not available from a standard legionary unit. Therefore, an army\u0027s cavalry, skirmishers, archers, etc. would be made up of auxiliaries. Some auxiliary\u00A0cohorts also fought as heavy infantry, similar to legionaries, but from what I can tell, this seems to not have been as common.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/gGRc6Kv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gGRc6Kv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KIvqb3e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KIvqb3e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/BwFQkAD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BwFQkAD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis model of the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EAuxiliary\u003C/em\u003E launch vehicle fires three SRBs on the launch pad, and the other three in flight, staggering the burn time of the SRBs, allowing them to propel the rocket higher and longer without causing excessive acceleration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/aDpjc6T.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aDpjc6T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe core stage continues burning long after the SRBs are jettisoned, and can nearly place the payload in orbit by itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/q8vpKok.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q8vpKok.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4bxM60r.png\u0022 alt=\u00224bxM60r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3T4yUSB.png\u0022 alt=\u00223T4yUSB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe OIS-1 is built for smaller probes such as this one but is still extremely powerful.

By the time of the late empire both foot and mounted sagittarii were much more prolific in the army. The Eastern Roman Empire continued to use mounted archers well past the fall of the Western Roman Empire and into the Middle Ages, due to their\u00A0proximity to eastern empires such as the Sassanids and later the Muslims, who used cavalry to great effect on the open desert plains of the Middle East.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dVw5BjP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dVw5BjP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter fully deploying its equipment,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESagittarius\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0turns to point its high-gain antenna towards Kerbin.

Instead of an orbital module, this Scipio Block III will have a new Mission Module, which will be stored in the fairing underneath the spacecraft during launch and retrieved once in orbit. It will be larger than the current Orbital Module and will provide much more utility in deep spaceflight.
