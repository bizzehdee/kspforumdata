The first 2 updates seemed small but trust me a lot of things are getting changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next update (try to get it this week, working hard on it) I will introduce the new Contracts system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic plan for this system is to act as a Random Mission Generator. The first stage is to introduce the new RepairMission. MCE will do some calculations and every week will make a decision on if a contract should be issued. Contracts are offered by companies (which will be represented by icons and descriptions) and you as the player will be able to make a choice if you want to accept these contracts. The first working contract will be repair missions. MCE is going to check the current FlightGlobals for vessels that contain the Repair Part (again this will be expanded more later) and if it decides a vessel is broken will assign a Contract for repair. (other planed modules are Supply, science, exploration, set up Networks, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERepairs Missions now need a resource called repair parts. You need to bring the repair parts to the vessel, dock and capture the vessel, transfer the Parts to vessel.. Go EVA and go to the Repair Hatch and select Repair. The vessel will consume the repair parts and the vessel will be repaired. You can undock and then go home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts differ from the regular missions in that they are not always available, and will take advantage of the new planned Reputation system. The higher the rep you have the more you can get payed. Also the Company giving you the contract aslo has some values to them. For instance some companies pay more cash, some science and little rep.. while others pay little cash, good science and some rep.. Etc.. Every Company is different and its a random system that selects which one is sending out the contracts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso contracts pay a lot more then the regular missions. But there is a catch. Contracts can fail. Another new feature planned in future is kerbal specialist. you can train your kerbals to be a specialist.. For intance a technician can repair satellites.. And is the perfect candidate to do repair missions.. And he has a 100% success rate for the repair not failing. On the other hand if you send someone that is not a Technician then you only have an 85% chance of the repair being a success. If you fail a mission you take a HUGE rep loss and also lose the contracts Binding Terms. In which case is most likely going to be Contract Payout * Percentage. So for instance if you have a 600,000 Credit contract and its binding Term is .23 % If you fail contract you will have to payout to the company 738,000 Credits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso Contracts are one shot deals. If you launch a vessel and explodes (no revert).... You can launch another vessel to try to salvage the situation. But the rep hit for killing kerbal will hurt and if your not sending the right specialist you still have that small chance of failing the Actual Main Goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain you still will always have the regular missions to fall back on if needed. but the contracts system is meant to make MCE more dynamic and life like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe next part of contracts system is Custom Contracts. That is You make a contract that a company can decide to fund or not for you. Want to build a base on the moon? Right up a contract and see if anyone will fund it for you. If you get funding the company is expecting you to build that base on the moon. And until that happens your contract is open for default. You have unlimited time to do it, unlimited tries (again fails will stick!). And in the end can you do it within the funding amount? the big difference in this system then the other contracts is that you can\u0027t really fail it. But you have to finish it before you can make another contract. If you decide you can\u0027t and cancel the contract you will pay a fine.. Amount paid * % again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow all this is work in progress and might change. But so far its going to happen. And when KSP gets its own version of Money, Rep.. MCE money will be converted to it and so will its Rep System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also plan on having some sort of exchange system for Money, Science and Rep. Not sure of the details on this yet though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I failed to mention. Contracts only have 1 Goal.. If its a repair mission then that 1 goal is to repair the vessel.. The company does not care how you get there, or what you do after the case. And as long as you don\u0027t say kill kerbals in the process you should be alright. So 1 Goal and only 1 Goal. Unless its a big contract to say drop off 6 Satellites in GeoSynce Orbit.. Then you have 6 Goals... But again... 1 launch, 6 launches.. 105043 launches doesn\u0027t matter as long as goal is completed and you don\u0027t fail that goal. In the case of a 6 goal mission the binding Terms are going to be based off each goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the companies.. You as a player can add your own companies. they will be based in a config file and basically the same Node system everything else works on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompany Name =\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompany Icon =\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompany Funding Money = 50\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompany Funding Science = 40\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompnay Funding Rep = 10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompany Description = Say something about me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts will be simular system also.
