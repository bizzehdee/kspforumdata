There\u0027s a problem with the design, in that there\u0027s a lot of stress on some of the key components of the structure. I got the design to work, as long as there aren\u0027t any huge lateral forces applied to the structure.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd there\u0027s a problem with that. Because each launch attempt takes almost an hour to run, at about thirty frames per \u003Cstrong\u003Eminute\u003C/strong\u003E, and it\u0027s nearly impossible to manually control the rocket under those circumstances, I\u0027ve let Mechjeb do most of the work. But Mechjeb has some peculiar notions when it comes to thrust vectoring. It thinks its a good idea to start its gravity turn by making a sharp turn as soon as vertical speed exceeds 100m/s, applying lots of lateral stress. My game pauses, the program takes a couple of minutes to think about the development, and then I get to see my ship do an extremely slow unplanned disassembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried to disable thrust vectoring in the editor - but Mechjeb doesn\u0027t seem to care. Likewise if I tie thrust vectoring to action groups: thrust snaps straight when I lock engine gimbal, and then, next frame, is vectoring again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n... O. While I was typing this, I was running an experiment with the gimbal not locked, but limited to a few percent. And Mechjeb doesn\u0027t seem to ignore gimbal limits. Currently the game is thinking about the next frame. I hope it\u0027s just staging, not a SUD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, my original question remains of some interest, I think: is it true that Mechjeb ignores gimbal locking?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nv1.7.2 64bit/Linux\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JustAToy","CreatedById":177981,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-06T23:24:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know, but it sounds to me that if you were to edit the launch profile which is a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E feature you could avoid that turn until you were past max Q removing most of your issues.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-06T23:58:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other option is to forget about an efficient launch.
