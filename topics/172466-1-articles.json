Sure a \u0022fresh\u0022 reload option should be in it as well (in cases of mod selection changes, or disk corruption), but well in simple the loading of the game could use some optimization development attention.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n(and no, disabling a single network card does not make a difference the game is just plain slow on loading, neither do i use hamachi vpn\u0027s) Loading the game takes about \u002B5 minutes, often its a reason to turn of my pc because meanwhile i lost interest in the game, kinda sad but i just hate long waits on blazing fast computers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh and its on a fast SSD too, so it completely beats me why it is so slow (multitrack video editing for example requires more IO operations and works perfectly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
