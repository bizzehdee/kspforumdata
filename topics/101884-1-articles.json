I am doubling the radius and SMA in hope of making a \u0022mod\u0022 to resize all planets without using RSS. Right now everything works except kerbin is a lot flatter and KSC is right on the beach so much so that the runway extends a down a few meters over the water. Everything is above water, but unnaturally close. Look for advice and guidance to rectify the issue as best as possible. Thank you!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T02:17:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 02:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Svm420**"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T19:20:56Z","Content":"For this problem you would probably need a Kittopia config too. If you go ingame, select Kerbin in the Kittopia GUI (ctrl\u002BP) and click \u0022save data\u0022, it will generate a file with all of the PQS (terrain) information in it called Kerbin.cfg. I don\u0027t know off the top of my head for Kerbin, but variables called \u0022deformity\u0022, \u0022heightMapDeformity\u0022, or something similar should probably be doubled if you are doubling the radius. Keeping this file in the SaveLoad folder in Kittopia will make it load every time you start the game."},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T19:53:54Z","Content":"Awesome great idea thank you! I will do this and test it."},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T02:34:17Z","Content":"That worked. I also got KT working in Linux so I can work much faster now without having to switch back to Windows. I found I will have my work cut out for me with PQScity mods like KK and kerbinside as the resizing of Kerbin and changing of deformity led to the bases being entrenched. I got some practice on the Kerbin island airport though. I had it relatively nice looking before I messed up and over wrote my work prematurely. I learned a lot though and making a custom planet would be quite fun. \n\nQuestion for further advice. Should I now setup the configs in KT to use the normal, color, and or bump maps it exported when getting the scaled space? I noticed Kerbin looked a little dull at max zoom and I think from map view as well. I export scaled space for all the planets and plan to resize them all after Kerbin. I figure though I won\u0027t need to tweak the other planets as much since it should impact playability.\n\nI also noticed when I had a plane with lander legs that they sat just under the texture of the ground. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s anything other than visual, but wondered what the cause maybe. Thanks for the help!\n\n* * *\n\nLooking for any assistance with getting kerbin right before moving to the other planets.
