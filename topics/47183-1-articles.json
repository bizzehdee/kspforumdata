I put the lander inside a 3.75m decoupler (the KW decouplers have a long, hollow cylindrical portion forward of the actual decoupler). On top of the lander, attached to the docking port, I placed a KW rocketry 3.75m - 2.5m decoupler. That is what the front half of the command module stuck out of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo assemble the munar-bound spacecraft, I set up some action groups (I never use staging, actually, always action groups, it\u0027s better for me). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Anyway, action group 5 decoupled the docking port on the top of the lander that was attached to the 3.75m-2.5m decoupler. This freed the command module from the top of the rocket. I would thrust forward with RCS, then turn 180 degrees to face the rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I use action group 6 to decouple the 3.75m-2.5m decoupler from the back of the command module, then apply RCS thrust back towards the rocket again. The decoupler would slowly drift off and away, the command module now fully free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I would approach with and dock with the exposed docking port of the lander. Once I was docked with the lander, I would activate the 3.75m decoupler with action group 7, separating the rocket from the lander. I apply reverse RCS thrust, and slowly draw the lander out of the rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the system works real well, it\u0027s tough to get good structural stability. I ended up having to put some I-beams along the sides of the rocket to keep the thing from twisting too much. It still looks awesomely Apollo like, especially since I also made an escape tower out of one of the structural trusses, a nose cone, and eight of the KW rocketry sepatrons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T20:19:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Radiokopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Radiokopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40559-All-craft-from-my-Constellation-mission-vid?p=524201\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post524201\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40559-All-craft-from-my-Constellation-mission-vid?p=524201\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post524201\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like you found my previous answer!

The fairings that I used in that are from KW and from NovaPunch. The main fairings, used on the hab and cargo modules, are the largest KW fairings. The inter-stage fairings that cover the modules\u0027 decent engines are from NovaP. The ones in the vid are from the original NovaP pack, but I\u0027ve updated them to use NovaPunch2 (you can DL the updated craft from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40559-All-craft-from-my-Constellation-mission-vid\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I just use the procedural fairings, they\u0027re less restrictive and, more importantly, take up way less memory. Removing the KW fairings from my setup reduced it by around 100mb, the procedural fairings only take up about ~5mb! But I I did prefer the texture of the KW ones and the way they separate is nicer, they are higher quality fairings but you pay for that with memory. I hope that they get optimised, in the way B9 optimised his parts as they basically all share the same textures, then I\u0027ll prob use both KW and procedural. The procedural ones are a load easier to use thou and you can get basically the same result, like having 2 sections break off first, followed by the last section on a separate stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
