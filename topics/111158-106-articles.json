As you know, I\u0027m a big fan of [@Kuzzter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/111501-kuzzter/)\u0027s Kerbfleet comics. I also enjoy [@adsii1970](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/89014-adsii1970/)\u0027s Kerny Kerman series, and [@Reddy](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/124298-reddy/)\u0027s PEGAS code.\n\nAs for favorite subforum, that\u0027s probably the Spacecraft Exchange. I am always impressed by the creativity of the posters there, and even the common things (F-16s, Saturn Vs) have all been done differently. It also needs less moderating than the other subforums. People there are almost always encouraging and supportive. I\u0027ve never seen a comment telling the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E they\u0027ve done a bad job.

My second favorite is Welcome Aboard, because I get a chance to say \u0022Hello!\u0022 to all the new users, and share the wonders of KSP and this community with them.\n\nHowever, my browsing habits have changed since I became a moderator. I tend to rely on reports to find areas of attention (***so keep them coming!***), and less on my own discoveries.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-09T08:07:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2017 08:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Dman979**\n  \nAdded more information to the answer."},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-09T18:12:35Z","Content":"Where do we put requests for mouseover definitions?
