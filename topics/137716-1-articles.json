(I saw the forum post that said \u0022Turbo Pumped Update launched\u0022). I would like to know if 1.1 still counts as a prerealese. Please tell me, because Steam calls it a prerealse and the \u0022Turbo Pumped\u0022 post says its not.

I had this \u0022issue\u0022 for three hours... everyone else was enjoying 1.1, I was still stuck with the pre-release. Opt out of the pre-release and then it should automatically update within about three minutes... And all the \u0022pre-release\u0022 tags will be gone when the game loads!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wargrum","CreatedById":2144,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T22:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArg! I wish this had been left somewhere a little more visible in the general forum. I\u0027ve been happily playing the \u0022latest release\u0022 via steam for the last few weeks, a bit bemused by the fact that the pre-release message was still visible on the main screen.

So I only finally got 1.1.2 installed last night after unticking the pre-release opt in, while trying to get a tech tree mod going.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the beta release of 1.1 should be removed from steam? The opt-in approach is a great idea, but it should not stop our games upgrading to the full release when it goes live. That\u0027s a bit silly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T11:30:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/2144-wargrum/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u00222144\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/2144-wargrum/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@wargrum\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0That\u0027s how Steam works for betas, though. The beta is a separate branch from main release, you have to explicitly switch between them. The responsibility for selecting branches falls on the user.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
