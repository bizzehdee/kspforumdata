As some background, I program a lot in R (scripted language for statistics), and have some C experience from some college classes, and some casual experience with C\u002B\u002B. I know my way around variables, methods, arguments, recursion, etc, but, I\u0027m still having issues with some of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, what\u0027s a module? It looks like a some kind of method call.

However, without seeing the code for this module, I\u0027m not sure how these get used and, therefore, how to modify these Module calls (definitions? references?) to add the parts and resources our add-on needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can get directed to \u003Cem\u003Ewhere\u003C/em\u003E the modules are defined/coded, that would be amazing.
