Took me 40 minutes to build, test, and fly successfully. Now, how to use this tin can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Use RCS on launch if you wish to rotate your shuttle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When the SRBs run out, engage RCS and separate. The SRBs will hit each other and explode, but they do not touch the shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. When you hit the point where you start rotating forwards (around 26km) use RCS and control the shuttle with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You will separate the External Tank at around 2019 m/s, and the OMS have enough fuel to circularize and de-orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When you are coming in for landing, don\u0027t pull up too hard, you WILL stall and crash (CoM drifts a little, but not too much that it\u0027s impossible to fly)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.
