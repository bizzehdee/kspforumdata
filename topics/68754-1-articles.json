In terms of speed of turning, distance of the reaction wheels from from the Centre of Mass is not important. This matches what was reported by KvickFlygarn87 and the results from Kashua\u0027s torsion pendulum setup. It is I believe contrary to actual physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHalving the amount of torque approximately halves the time for the turn, as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way in which reaction wheels act to deform the ship remains to be investigated, as does whether KSP properly implements moment of inertia. The latter could be tested with a ship like mine but with two tanks full and two empty, shifting the fuel for different tests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-09T20:59:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2014 08:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cantab\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed the typo in the 1 end, 1 middle result!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T22:26:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo convince you, I made an experiment with torque wheels on a spring. *snip*\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice demonstration.
