It\u0027s a really handy technique, is quick and easy, and doesn\u0027t require any mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, your actual time to start the suicide burn will be slightly \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E time-to-node = burn-time. More to the point, your actual ideal suicide burn time will be when time-to-node is some fraction of the burn time. Just how big a fraction it is will depend on two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Your angle of approach. Shallower angle (i.e. you\u0027re coming in almost horizontal) = you need to start burn earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Your TWR relative to the body you\u0027re landing on (e.g. if you can do 10 m/s2, and you\u0027re landing on the Mun where g = 1.63 m/s2, then your effective TWR is about 6). Higher TWR = you can start the burn later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe absolute shortest burn you\u0027ll need will be if you\u0027re coming straight down, and your effective local TWR is very high. In that case, the fraction is 0.5; i.e. if your node burn time is 20 seconds, you\u0027d start when you have 10 seconds until the node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince that\u0027s the ideal and you never reach it, you want to allow a little bit of safety margin. In practice, I find that a factor of 60-70% strikes a nice compromise; I\u0027m usually not coming in super close to horizontal, and for any vacuum world except Tylo, my local TWR tends to be pretty high. So (for example) if the node burn time is 20 seconds, I\u0027ll wait until it says 12 seconds or so before I start the burn. (And of course I do a quicksave early enough that if I\u0027m wrong, I can try it again.) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe technique doesn\u0027t work if there\u0027s atmosphere, but then, in that case you\u0027re probably using chutes instead of a suicide burn anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only real drawback I\u0027ve found to this technique is when I\u0027ve got a base on the surface, and I\u0027m trying to land right next to it. When that happens, I can\u0027t drop a maneuver node on the point of impact, because the game thinks I want to select my base instead. The workaround is to go to map settings and temporarily turn off display of whatever icon I\u0027m using for my base, at least long enough to drop a maneuver node before I turn the display back on again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T16:57:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not so much your absolute TWR but how much your TWR changes during the burn that affects how much later you can start.
