Now you might ask; \u0022How would you get the money when there are no contracts?\u0022. Well i have been thinking about it and this is my solution:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You would have to set some goals for yourself before launching like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Orbit Altitiude (with margins)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Landing Site\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Docking with a certain spacecraft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Going into a certain SOI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The list can go on and on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The amount of funds you get are defined by how hard it is to reach the goals you set and if you reach your goals, there should obviously be made a chart that says what goal is worth how much money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I see this mod working in both the science mode and the sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think, and let me know if such mod already exists?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T22:56:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, there\u0027s a mod which does something like this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102911\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScience Funding\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EVDE","CreatedById":107276,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T23:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAwesome!!! thanks, by the way; i am a belgian 14 year old kid, i don\u0027t mind bad english! \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
