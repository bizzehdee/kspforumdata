Instead, go through and cull the parts you think there are good replacements for in CMES. I tried deleting everything once, and I kept getting stuck when creating new vehicles and finding that I do in fact need an I-beam or that stock solar panel would work okay here\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a question of game style buried in this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use IVAs much, maybe cockpit views only, but they can use a lot of RAM and soak up clock cycles in rendering. It\u0027s partly large, sharply-detailed, textures, partly the mesh files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, some items have to be more complicated than others. Open girder structures need far more polygons than a simple tube and that increases the rendering cost. The rendering process is also more complicated\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthat open girder has parts blocking the line of sight to other parts of the same component.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few such parts which also switch between different physical fuel tank meshes. I am not sure if the in-flight views are using data structures that include the invisible components, and how the render-engine handles them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been doing some of the CGI stuff for a long time. I still see people using meshes that are so densely structured that, in a wireframe view, lines are so close together as to seem like a solid surface. Maybe you need that to produce a high-res picture of a Mercury capsule in orbit (there are some other techniques that could simplify the mesh for that) but it cripples the live animation for a game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, stock parts are created with an awareness of the trade-offs. Some mods use parts that get seriously over-complicated. You can choose not to use complex girder structure, and delete the particular parts. IVAs don\u0027t look so easy. The part.cfg can be modified by Module Manager to remove the references to the IVA, but you have to deal with the correct files so they\u0027re not loaded by the game. And several IVAs often use the same sub-components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also seen alternative textures in sub-folders that end up in GameData. That\u0027s grabbing a bit of precious RAM. It\u0027s the downside of using tools such as Texture Replacer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I cut down on Spaceplane-oriented Mods for my current game. Disk space is cheap, so I can have a parallel complete install without 5m boosters. And that style/theme choice could allow some of the stock wings and air-breathers to be deleted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I shall have to do such things until a reliable 64-bit Windows version is available. I hear good reports of Linux, but I still seem to need an ancient version of Internet Explorer to reliably deal with the brave new world of government IT my country is entering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince CMES is using parts from several different sources, it\u0027s a bit of a hostage to fortune. No names, but I have had bad experiences of one of the Mods, and when it reaches a formal upgrade, and likely enters CMES, life could get messy. As you say, CMES is already a heavy pack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ebphoto","CreatedById":144831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T15:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was just going through all the different launch systems in the download and I was wondering if you could tell me what the XLS Transfer Vehicle I, II and III are used for?

Yeah, I\u0027ve tried just about everything...starting a fresh install, JUST installing CMES and the newest version of RPM and it still happens, so glad to see this was confirmed. At least it doesn\u0027t seem to interfere with any ship mechanics or anything, just seems to be a weird visual bug. Today, I spotted a new one similar to this while I was sending a rover to Duna. Instead of the helmet rack, I noticed a white circle floating in space like the rack did, it just looks like a flat white plate. Usually after warping to a maneuver node, I\u0027ll see this white circle object fly away rapidly, then eventually re-appear. I just removed the ASET folder containing the props and the RPM folder because I never use IVA anyway so we\u0027ll see if that fixes it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T21:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003EAction Ticket Resolved!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously we will be doing an update, but until then you can replace \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECMES/Pod/ALCOR_Monkey_Rover/Spaces/ALCORE_Monkey_Internals/ALCORMonkeyInternals.mu with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/ba9kitfvve4x82l/ALCORMonkeyInternals.mu?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethis one\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecial thanks again to Alex Ustas for supporting Monkey exploration!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
