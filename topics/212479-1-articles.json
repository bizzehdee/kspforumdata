May the next decade be full of new space kerbalnauts!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, First impressions with the game were pretty good, aside from the bugs everyone has already said (of which im sure will get ironed out in time). Although I would like to highlight a feature from KSP1 that i would like to see in the sequel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit has to do with the abruptness of zooming the camera in and out, both in the map view and in flight. in the first game, this was a smoother transition rather than just a jump, and it made the game feel much smoother. I hope the same will be implemented for KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thundy","CreatedById":208895,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T22:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re right, I miss the smooth zoom.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdd to that, it appears that the zoom out limit is much much smaller than KSP 1, I loved zooming out seeing half of the planet for 1 second checking my location while flying a plane then zooming back in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
