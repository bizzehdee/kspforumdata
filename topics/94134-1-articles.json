Great videos, he\u0027s great at explaining things so that there isn\u0027t much confusion. Another think that I like is that most of them are things you can do with stuff around the house or what scraps you have laying around in the workshop or in your parts bin and that you\u0027ll only have to buy 2 or 3 low-cost things or 1 high-cost thing to make the project work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Here\u0027s another guy in the same realm as Rimstar, he calls himself ElectronicsNMore. Videos aren\u0027t as \u0022produced\u0022 but he is VERY descriptive, walks you through the process of doing something in the video like he\u0027s teaching you how to do it for the first time. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPv6_GljwnFHvHWcsU074qQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPv6_GljwnFHvHWcsU074qQ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-23T16:24:08Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2014 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
