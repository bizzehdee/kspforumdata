For example, doing a Crew Report in the KSC shows something like \u0022This is our space center here\u0022. However, if you\u0027re in the Sandbox mode, it only shows something like \u0022You would learn a lot more if the R\u0026amp;D was open.\u0022 For sandbox mode, it shows this same (or similar) message. For every experiment, for every situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI, personally, like to read the messages, even if I can\u0027t transmit the data or get science points. So do you guys think it would be good to just show the data, but still have no science value for doing it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T02:25:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, science data should not be available in sandbox mode. Science is the key things that divides career mode from Sandbox. If science were available in Sandbox, many players would just bypass career mode and simply get the science data from Sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this may become a non-issue in 0.24 with the addition of budgets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if science data continues to be unavailable in Sandbox, I would be in favor of fully disabling the experiment functions of science parts in Sandbox mode instead of giving me an annoying message when I try to do an experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T03:40:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsidering that I went and hacked a career save so I had all the tech already unlocked but could still go around collecting science as I pleased, yes, I reckon this would be a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T11:41:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf sandbox stays as it is, then sure. The flavour texts can be amusing, and it might be nice to find out how much science a particular experiment is worth. Call it an incentive to try career mode out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf sandbox ends up as a \u0022simulator\u0022 inside career mode, then probably not. NASA probably couldn\u0027t find out much about Mars by running Curiosity around the Mojave desert, and they probably won\u0027t find out much about asteroids by redirecting them in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T12:02:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep.

IMO sandbox should include everything in career, but without the limitations of advancement (budget, tech unlocks and the like).

As of right now that is one of the main reasons to even play Career mode at all, its for the funny messages. Maybe in the future when Career is more fleshed out, THEN we could consider getting the Science messages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at it this way there is really only 1 difference between a fully unlocked career mode and sandbox, its those messages. If you get all the messages in sandbox anyways, whats the point of career? There isn\u0027t one, at least for now. Which is why getting science messages can wait, or stay a career only thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs i have said in the past, KSP is moving foward as a Career Focused game. Every update since its implementation has been dedicated with career in mind. Giving more love to sandbox only weakens the focus of Career. Sandbox is nice when you need to test how nodes and building rockets work, but that game play is more or less set. Now it is more about extra features that are needed to make Kerbal Space Program a whole game, not just a space simulator. Having a \u0022Scientific\u0022 story is very much a part of that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KaBob","CreatedById":89839,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T22:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you guys are really overestimating the importance of those messages\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-10T03:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MKI\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MKI\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELook at it this way there is really only 1 difference between a fully unlocked career mode and sandbox, its those messages.

It all depends on your style of play, but I\u0027ve played enough that the limited parts available in career is dull. I played it once, got to where I could do most missions, and then its just drudgery to collect enough science to get more parts to build interesting rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T23:03:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I also think sandbox should be \u0022hacked career\u0022.
