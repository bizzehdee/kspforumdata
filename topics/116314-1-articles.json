I then went into the C:\\Windows\\Fonts directory and copied all fonts in the fresh install to my current OS directory. Overwriting everything. This fixed the issue with no fonts/words displaying as seen in the picture below.\n\nI hope this helps you as well!\n\n=======================================================================================================================================\n\nI haven\u0027t played in a while. Last I version played was 1.0.2. The issue I am currently happens in a clean install of KSP 1.0.4.\n\nI have a screenshot included for visual reference. Unfortunately I am getting no debug information to display so I can not tell/show what is happening on the inside. I have no other information to supply besides system specs and the included picture. At first I had thought it had to do with a mod not playing nice with Steams auto update feature. So I logged into the website and downloaded a fresh install from there to see if that would work. If i am having a crash or something I usually unload all mods and start the game to see if it happens again, then I proceed to add the mods one by one to see where the fault is at. Well this one was the base game itself. Typically if it was a mod I would just work without it until it was updated or otherwise, but this is an issue with the base game and is currently a game breaker for me. An help would be appreciated, if I need to force a crash dump, I can do so at request.\n\nSystem Specs\n\nWin 7 Professional x64\n\nAMD FX-9370 8-core Vishera CPU\n\nXFX AMD R9-270x GPU\n\nASUS Crosshair V Formula-Z MOBO\n\nOS is installed on a 256 SSD\n\nThe game is installed on a 1TB WD Black HDD\n\n\\*If any more information is needed, please let me know.\n\nOS was last installed in April of 2015\n\nKSP has worked (without Mods) Flawlessly up until this bug since version .18\n\n![UpGyLQV.png](http://imgur.com/UpGyLQV.png)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAs a side note, this bug breaks about half the mods I currently use including Kerbal Engineer.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T03:09:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 03:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NugunsKnight**\n  \nResolution Found"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T17:24:14Z","Content":"Well, I\u0027d say we definitely need the logs to start with. KSP always generates an output\\_log.txt within the KSP\\_Data directory, even if the game doesn\u0027t crash.\n\nYou can also bring up the debug log by pressing ALT\u002BF2. See if anything shows up there.\n\nTwo other things off the top of my head...\n\nTry increasing resolution slightly if you can. There is at least one other instance of a button not showing up due to resolution, but I doubt that is it.\n\nHave you had any video card driver updates recently? There have been numberous occasions where new updated drivers have cause graphics problems in KSP (or worse). One other symptom of this is that everything was working fine, then suddenly broke with no changes. Often that\u0027s fixed by reverting the driver to a slightly older version.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"NugunsKnight","CreatedById":78931,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T17:46:41Z","Content":"I have uploaded the file to onedrive and provided a link to the output log file.\n\nI skimmed through it and saw plenty of these two along with a few others. \n\n[Output_Log.txt](http://1drv.ms/1RHtOPm)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The referenced script on this Behaviour is missing!\n\u003E (Filename: Line: 1771)\n\u003E \n\u003E AND\n\u003E \n\u003E Serialization depth limit exceeded at \u0027ThermalLink\u0027.

I performed the reset of fonts via method one and started KSP, still no juice on the buttons. I hadn\u0027t considered the fonts being an issue, even though that is what is missing from the buttons, but it still had no affect.\n\nSo, I proceeded to perform the second method with SFC. This yielded some corrupt files that could not be fixed. After throwing the log into a text document it had to do with some .json files. So I warped over to google to see if there was a way to replace/fix these. That is when I stumbled upon this posting about a windows update installed on the 15th of May (I Last played shortly after 1.0.2 released on May 1st). [Fix for KB3022345](http://www.sevenforums.com/performance-maintenance/370460-corrupt-utc-app-json-telemetry-asm-windowsdefault-json.html), I followed removing of this update and rescanned with SFC, no corrupt files found. So I reboot and start KSP again. Still no juice.\n\nAfter that went through I went into CCC to check for software updates for it, It showed an update was available for the drivers where the AMD Gaming Evolved software claims they are up to date. So I applied the available update. Reboot then KSP launch. Again, no juice. I am now going to attempt to install a fresh OS on a spare drive to see if that resolves the issue or not. I will be back in touch. Any other ideas or help will still be appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"NugunsKnight","CreatedById":78931,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T22:27:48Z","Content":"Running KSP on the fresh OS install does show the fonts.\n\nI really don\u0027t feel like spending the time getting my PC reinstalled and whatnot right now.
