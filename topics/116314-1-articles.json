I then went into the C:\\Windows\\Fonts directory and copied all fonts in the fresh install to my current OS directory. Overwriting everything. This fixed the issue with no fonts/words displaying as seen in the picture below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps you as well!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=======================================================================================================================================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t played in a while. Last I version played was 1.0.2. The issue I am currently happens in a clean install of KSP 1.0.4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a screenshot included for visual reference. Unfortunately I am getting no debug information to display so I can not tell/show what is happening on the inside. I have no other information to supply besides system specs and the included picture. At first I had thought it had to do with a mod not playing nice with Steams auto update feature. So I logged into the website and downloaded a fresh install from there to see if that would work. If i am having a crash or something I usually unload all mods and start the game to see if it happens again, then I proceed to add the mods one by one to see where the fault is at. Well this one was the base game itself. Typically if it was a mod I would just work without it until it was updated or otherwise, but this is an issue with the base game and is currently a game breaker for me. An help would be appreciated, if I need to force a crash dump, I can do so at request.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESystem Specs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWin 7 Professional x64\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMD FX-9370 8-core Vishera CPU\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXFX AMD R9-270x GPU\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EASUS Crosshair V Formula-Z MOBO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOS is installed on a 256 SSD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is installed on a 1TB WD Black HDD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*If any more information is needed, please let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOS was last installed in April of 2015\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has worked (without Mods) Flawlessly up until this bug since version .18\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/UpGyLQV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UpGyLQV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, this bug breaks about half the mods I currently use including Kerbal Engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T03:09:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 03:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NugunsKnight\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EResolution Found\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T17:24:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027d say we definitely need the logs to start with.
