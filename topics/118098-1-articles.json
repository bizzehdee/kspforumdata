As I have ALWAYS wanted to created one, I hopped on my KSP save (All stock, Always wanted to try mods but eh) and gave it a shot. \n\nThe result was this:\n\n![OuZP1](http://imgur.com/a/OuZP1)\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/OuZP1](http://imgur.com/a/OuZP1)\n\nSorry for the unnecessary showcase of the station. Stay with me, there is a point. I created the two rings separately, and then docked em together with two Nuke probes, which are the main point of this thread. The last 3 pictures show the probes. After docking the rings together, I deorbited one of the probes. This is when it happened. The probe body burned up as usual, and I expected everything to be obliterated, as I had no shield and it was a 300km orbit to land, in a very deep descent. However, two strange parts survived. The last one in the album. I\u0027ve never seen it before. Anyone know what it is? Bug, glitch, kraken, or do I just not recognize it? Thinking now it might be part of a radiator, but i\u0027m not sure.\n\nWell thanks for reading this ramble about one\u0027s reinvigoratation of KSP and the strange part he discovered.\n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T05:18:25Z","Content":"Can we have a look at what\u0027s in your GameData folder?"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T05:30:31Z","Content":"Thats actually the base of the radiator, it\u0027s what remains of it after it gets torn apart in the re-entry fires (or through explosion) and gets separated from the rest of the craft after the parent part explodes."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T15:38:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...
