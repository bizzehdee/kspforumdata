I\u0027ve been lurking here since I got the game a couple weeks ago, and figured that since I can now get to the Mun, it would be fun to try some more challenging targets. I have found several ways to calculate phase and ejection angles for planetary travel, but I\u0027m not entirely sure how to use that data... Could someone kindly either explain these terms or point me to a source that can? I\u0027m pretty comfortable with finding the right phase angle (I think... Jeb and I will find out soon enough \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ) but I can\u0027t find a solid answer for the ejection angle. Help is muchly appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T00:29:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi ravenhawk82, welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis is a pretty good tool\u003C/a\u003E for working out when to burn, I hope it helps you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ravenhawk82","CreatedById":54491,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T00:34:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, I was using that page, but for some reason last time I opened it the image explanations weren\u0027t showing up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Thanks muchly!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mustwinfull","CreatedById":41681,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T05:25:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, ravenhawk82.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget your old friend Minmus on the way to different planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike sal_vagar suggested, that is a good website and if you have a look around in the add-on section there will be add-ons that tell you the information required like ejection angle, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun playing KSP and go blow up some rockets! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
