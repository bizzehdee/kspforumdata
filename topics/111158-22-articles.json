I later saw a thread in the Kerbal Network discussing HTML tags, so I made a post saying that marquee definitely worked and attempted to demonstrate but it didn\u0027t work there. In the interest of science, I went to the thread I had seen them in and edited one of my posts to include some marqueed text, just a test to see what I was doing wrong. The post was the last on the page, and when I submitted the edit I saw to my combined horror and amusement that the entire bottom of the page, from my post downward, was marqueeing across my screen (text, frames, buttons, images and all). I tried to edit it to remove the tags but it didn\u0027t seem to be working (and it was hard to hit the moving buttons).\n\nI was in the #kspofficial IRC channel at the time, and a while later sal\\_vager joined so I figured I should fess up:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sep 16 14:52:39 \u003Cred5\u003E Hey sal_vager, are you able to edit forum posts through some interface other than the standard one?\u003Cp\u003ESep 16 14:52:45 \u003Csal_vager\u003E hello Red5\u003C/sal_vager\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESep 16 14:53:06 \u003Csal_vager\u003E Red5, i can do weird and slightly scary things to posts\u003C/sal_vager\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESep 16 14:53:56 \u003Cred5\u003E Can you fix this one, I think I broke the forum a bit: (Link to post redacted)\u003C/red5\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESep 16 14:54:18 \u003Csal_vager\u003E oh dear\u003C/sal_vager\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESep 16 14:54:36 \u003Cred5\u003E It was an innocent experiment, I swear.\u003C/red5\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESep 16 14:54:45 \u003Csal_vager\u003E OH DEAR!\u003C/sal_vager\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESep 16 14:55:13 \u003Csal_vager\u003E SO MUCH DEAR RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A NATURE RESERVE RED5\u003C/sal_vager\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/red5\u003E\n\nsal took me to PM to figure out exactly what I had done, and his clever solution was to add \u0022\u003Cmarque.e\u003E\u0022 to the forum profanity filter to strip it from the post.

Some of them are cases where we need to discuss amongst ourselves whether or what action is appropriate; sometimes it gets reported when there are few or no moderators online to take care of it.\n\n- The reported post was deemed not worthy of moderation. Sometimes people report posts for petty reasons, other times the reporter is more sensitive about a rule than we are.
