NASA\u0027s looks a cross between my sisters coffee table on laundry day and what one expects to find under the airbag cover in the steering wheel of a car. Yours gets style points for representin long forgotten diners, I would be polite since the fuel tanks give a salt and pepper impression and say that if condiments were the inspiration for the WWII pulse jet (v1) program, this might have been result. Although clearly a step above a coverted 1959 cadillac pretending to be a interstellar space craft might I make the following recommendation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout to much trouble you can flatten stock parts, including fuel tanks. the volume equation is pi r ^ 2 * h. Second is that you could do the same for heat shield, and convert it into a tank. In the second example stretch the y axis of the heat shield. Its not appreciably difficult to use size3 fairings into space, you could launch in two phases, on with drag breaking device that is elevated by Jet craft followed by a final rocket into space jettisoning the jet when the cease to provide lift. The \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPL and fuel could be delivered and ported with the first in space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I would do this quite differently I would have very low density sheild in front of PL and 3 behind to feather th craft. possibly 5 meters off axis. the middle fairing would be ejected by rocket thust and channeled off in two half circles. Once chute deploy speed is achieved I would release drogue chutes from the inside edge of the feather devices. The would be followed by oversized chutes on the outside edge that gradually extend the radius as the craft gets closer to ground. As landing thruster come online the extensions woul reach a distane of 15 meters from central axis. Finally i would have landing struts capable of stopping a craft going 30 m/s. much like the energy absorbing part in the front frame of modern cars.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T21:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis thread has been moved to the Science Labs. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T03:25:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfavorable conditions have led to successive postponement of the LDSD launch and the next launch opportunity is Thursday, June 4 no later than 7.30am HST. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, Kerbal Space Center is debating whether to recover two of their LCSD burgers after they soft landed near populated areas to the north.
