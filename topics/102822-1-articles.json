I just play with them to keep gameplay interesting) and I\u0027m playing science mode prepping my armada for Duna. So I have 3 science landers currently in orbit in the mun (well two, did I mention that I also play with kerbal engineer and kerbal alarm clock so I can tell when launchwindows are coming up). There\u0027s this question that I have that I\u0027ve tried to find the answer to online but failed. Do some biomes provide more science than others? I need to know because I have explored 3 craters on the mun but have not been to the high lands or mid lands, or the canyons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-28T01:39:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2015 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Solarapple\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T01:25:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes they do.
