I just play with them to keep gameplay interesting) and I\u0027m playing science mode prepping my armada for Duna. So I have 3 science landers currently in orbit in the mun (well two, did I mention that I also play with kerbal engineer and kerbal alarm clock so I can tell when launchwindows are coming up). There\u0027s this question that I have that I\u0027ve tried to find the answer to online but failed. Do some biomes provide more science than others? I need to know because I have explored 3 craters on the mun but have not been to the high lands or mid lands, or the canyons.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-28T01:39:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2015 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Solarapple**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T01:25:57Z","Content":"Yes they do. The body on which the biome is located has a science multiplier value as shown on [this wiki page](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science). On a given body, all biomes yield the same science value for the same experiment.\n\nOf course, you want to do each experiment at a new biome for maximum science. Repeating the same experiment at the same biome yields little or no additional science.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nHappy landings!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-28T01:31:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2015 01:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starhawk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Solarapple","CreatedById":137606,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T01:39:51Z","Content":"Thanks!

This will show a very colorful overlay on a planet or moon where each color represents a different biome - it can be useful for finding good landing spots on the Mun and other places. It\u0027s also handy to let you see where you are going better if you are on the dark side of the body you are orbiting as these colors show up independent of sunlight."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T20:17:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Correct.\n\u003E 42 might seem ludicrously high but that\u0027s including the 33 biomes that can be found at KSC itself.\n\nI just don\u0027t get why they thought that was necessary... or even a remotely good idea.
