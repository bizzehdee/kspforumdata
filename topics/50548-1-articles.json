It took me a long time to grasp the concept of these angles in the first place, and longer still to comprehend why in the heck they mattered (or more to the point, why they mattered more than the relative distance between e.g. Kerbin and Duna, as it seemed to me that one would want to leave the former for the latter when the two are at their closest, i.e. a relative angle of zero), so hopefully I\u0027m explaining them in an understandable way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lando","CreatedById":57894,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T03:41:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi everyone, I am glad you find this usefull!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022patrickcanttype\u0022 data-cite=\u0022patrickcanttype\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is a super helpful map for anyone not using Mechjeb or Engineering Mod.
