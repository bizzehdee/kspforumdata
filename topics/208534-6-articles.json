If slightly stretched, and fully filled, it would be able to transfer enough propellant to LSS for another surface sortie (LSS from LLO to the lunar surface and back is \u0026lt;200t of props), AND bring the crew propulsively back to LEO (saves fillings if it can aerobrake at all). So 1 crew ferry this first year, and every flight is 8-9 tankers (7 the first time because of residuals).
