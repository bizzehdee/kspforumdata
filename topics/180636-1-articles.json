As an example situation, let\u0027s say I\u0027m going to Duna and want to have some detachable boosters on the side of the first stage. If I just attach them to the side of the ship by the side decouplers, they will wobble all over the place because they are attached by a very small point. That\u0027s not an issue, right? Just go back into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and attach some struts going from the booster\u0027s nose cone to the first stage fuel tank. Easy. But then something strange happens when I am placing the struts - I\u0027ll stick the first point onto the nose cone, and then the second point on the fuel tank. But when I place the second point, it just teleports right next to the first point. Then I\u0027ll have to try over and over again to find a spot where this doesn\u0027t happen. It\u0027s starting to bug me. I have some mods installed, but this problem started before I had installed any of them so that\u0027s not the issue. I thought it might be that the struts were clipping through the nose cone, but it still happens if there is no possibility of clipping. Is this a bug or am I just doing something stupid?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-16T17:50:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPics, pics, pics!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure you\u0027re attaching to the fuel tank, and not an engine shroud?\u00A0 Also, it\u0027s usually much easier to attach to the fuel tank first, in the same symmetry as you attached the boosters, then pull it out to the nosecones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can have too extreme an angle, and you may also be trying to pull them too far.\u00A0 It\u0027s impossible to say what\u0027s going on without seeing what you have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-16T18:12:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223505863\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022180636\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221544982637\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179753\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geonovast\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 minutes ago, Geonovast said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... it\u0027s usually much easier to attach to the fuel tank first, in the same symmetry as you attached the boosters, then pull it out to the nosecones ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure of that?\u00A0 Not at my computer today but I always go from nosecones to tanks because - maybe it\u0027s just an old thing that got changed - struts would never attach \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E nosecones, only \u003Cem\u003Efrom\u003C/em\u003E them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-16T18:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223505874\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022180636\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221544983952\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002296332\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pecan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, Pecan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure of that?\u00A0 Not at my computer today but I always go from nosecones to tanks because - maybe it\u0027s just an old thing that got changed - struts would never attach \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E nosecones, only \u003Cem\u003Efrom\u003C/em\u003E them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never had problems either way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-16T18:45:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd anyway, autostruts are always easier than struts to \u0022attach\u0022 (since you only have to click a button).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-16T23:03:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t checked this recently, but I\u0027m pretty sure the \u0022mass\u0022 of the strut attaches to the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efirst\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E part you click.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt isn\u0027t a huge difference, but if you\u0027re trying to get rid of excess mass by ditching boosters, you really want to ditch the strut mass too.
