Been playing KSP since whatever the version before 0.9 was. Met a Swedish guy on a plane to cape town and he showed me KSP. Looked interesting. Tried it. Hooked. I\u0027ve only been able to spend 60h with it over the last year or so, but with the limited time I have that means all I\u0027m playing when I have a chance to play at all is KSP. Started two career games. First one pre 0.9 got me to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus. My current career in 1.0.2 got me to these two places plus taught me how to rendezvous, dock and do satellite contracts. Great fun so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently playing around with airplanes and gearing up to launch my first space station. Been lurking for a while, reading posts, watching videos and scouring the Wiki. Very helpful community.
