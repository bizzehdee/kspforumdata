Going specific instead of going wide. We don\u0027t plan on stopping work at 1.0 at all, so we\u0027re maybe better off leaving some stuff for 1.1 and getting to work on the specifics of what can make the existing stuff in the game truly shine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve decided that the next release will be 1.0 because it accomplishes the goals we\u0027ve set up with the development of KSP from the very beginning, my question to you is whether you\u0027d prefer we try and add more features, or focus more on things like the aero overhaul, bugfixing and balance?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Tiddles","CreatedById":124560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T04:16:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d probably like a bit of 60%-40%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd the stuff you want to add first, and then fix it up.
