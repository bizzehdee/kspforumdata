I am relatively new to making SSTOs but I noticed that some of the planes have a hard time going into orbit even with enough fuel. I\u2019m curious if it\u2019s my ascent profile or my angle of attack and I was wondering if there is a preferred profile for certain types of space planes.

reach a minimum speed of (GM/R)^(1/2) = 2,296 m/s for a 70-km circular orbit. Though lower speeds are required at higher altitudes, the overall delta-V cost will always increase the higher you go, so engineer for 2,296 m/s minimum in orbit. A minimum delta-V for getting to 70 km is (2GM(1/r - 1/R))^(1/2) = 1,109 m/s (not accounting for losses due to drag). If you fly to the east, you have some \u0022free\u0022 delta-v due to Kerbin\u0027s rotation equal to 2*pi*r/T = 174.9 m/s. Flying to the west means you need that much more.
