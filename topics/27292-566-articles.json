First of these was to put a satellite into a tundra orbit - that was fun; getting the low end of the orbit to an acceptable tolerance was tricky work but I was finally able to get it there after a few tries. Made some pretty good coin on that mission, especially considering the probe used was a Barn Owl (i.e. delivered to LKO initially via spaceplane). Next up was the landing of a new ground base on Minmus. That one nearly met with disaster; I got the distance for the suicide burn a little \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E good - touched down at 2 m/s and I didn\u0027t reduce the throttle because I thought I was about to crash, and by the time I reacted the craft was already heading back up. Luckily I got the engine shut off before it picked up a good deal of velocity, and about a minute later it touched down safely. Got the pilot out and planted a flag - three missions complete.
