The KSP folder itself, in a typical install, will be located in:\n\n~/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Kerbal Space Program\n\nand inside the \u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022 folder there will be a folder called GameData. For most mods, all you do is move the folder containing all of the mod files to GameData. Even if a mod has a more complicated procedure to follow, generally the first step will be locating the \u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022 folder anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"Scubapink","CreatedById":135736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T14:40:24Z","Content":"Brill, thanks - will give it a try ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T21:14:44Z","Content":"It\u0027s also worth noting that the contents/organisation of mods\u0027 zip files does differ from one to another.
