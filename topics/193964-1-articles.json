Many older mods that haven\u2019t been updated (some deliberately, some because their maintainers haven\u2019t had time or are no longer maintaining them) might still work in 1.8.x or 1.9.x, but they\u2019ll probably work best in the version they were updated for\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want the newest releases of everything, 1.9.1; if you want to use most of the new stuff but also use planet packs, 1.8.1; if you want to use specific mods that won\u2019t work in 1.8.x or later, then try 1.7.3. The earlier the version, the fewer new features it will include and this can include DLC compatibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m using 1.8.1 right now with the JNSQ planet pack, many 1.9.x compatible mods still work fine although craft files that come with them do need to be tweaked to make them work in 1.8.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
