Should something go wrong, you can simply stage twice to separate from the body of the aircraft. After this, a set of parachutes on the cockpit can deploy, bringing you in for a soft-aborted landing on any type of terrain! In the best case scenario, you should only have to stage once, to deploy horizontal drag chutes upon landing.\n\n***DOWNLOAD***\n\n[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/76061308/Agent%2086%20Space%20Plane..zip](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76061308/Agent%2086%20Space%20Plane..zip)\n\nRemember, this is a SPH craft, so you\\\u0027ll have to import it into the SPH folder in your ships, and it\\\u0027s only for version .15.\n\n**Here\\\u0027s a nice photo of it while in the space plane hangar.**\n\n\u003E ![index.php?action=dlattach;topic=12638.0;attach=20172;image](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=12638.0;attach=20172;image)"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T18:24:36Z","Content":"I forgot to mention that this plane usually reaches a maximum altitude of only 20KM, but it could be pushed higher.
