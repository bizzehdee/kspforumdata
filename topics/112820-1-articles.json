I noticed it seemed to be something like that. What would be nice is a way to set the cutoff, so if I had enough storage to last half the night I could say only charge when below 5%, and half as much fuel would be used. As it stands I only have enough storage for like 1% of the nighttime, so it does\u0027t make much difference either way. But they do need to be turned on to do that, I really hate how it costs 1,000,000 to unlock custom action groups, that was tedious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, some imperial evidence. I did manage a tiny hop to a vein 1% higher, so the numbers should be a little off, but I seem to be generating ore many times faster than I use up fuel. I don\u0027t know if the wiki is off, or I just screwed up a decimal place somewhere. But the fuel cells do no seem to use a significant amount of the generated fuel, and a single night time seems long enough to completely fill the miner and then some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good point Sharpy.
