From what I have heard there is 70320 seconds of consecutive darkness on the mun (apparently a Kerbin eclipse adds a few minutes).\n\nA drill takes 15/s, and the converter takes 30/s. With 4 drills, that is 90/s.\n\nSo 4 gigantic solar panels cover it during the day, but I would need about 6400 1K batteries to hold it over night......\n\nOr 60 of the first level fuel cells. OK, slightly more doable. They have the same conversion ratio as the big ones 0.0016875/s\u002B0.0020625/s=\u003E1.5/s or 0.10125/s\u002B0.12375/s=\u003E90/s\n\nWith a lvl 2 engineer, on the richest deposit I could find (most of the surface seems to be covered with an identicle %), if I know what I am doing (it is entirely possible I do not) I am getting 0.034/s\\*4 = 0.136. So something like 95% would be used to run the machine....\n\nAnother strange thing \n\nI am using ScanSat. And have been running the narrow band scanner. And really only saw a few numbers. Half the surface was 6.xx%. Now That I have landed, and turned on that surface one there seems to be a more diverse array of numbers. Only up to 10%, as far as I can tell. Is there a way to search for high numbers? So presumably, I could get up to 50-45% efficiency, if I move over to the 10% vein. but then, those were invisible before I landed.\n\nAlso, how do these fuel cells work? They will automatically turn on when I run out of power and the ship is inactive? They would be pretty useless otherwise, but it doesn\u0027t say.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T17:23:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wisnoskij**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T09:43:31Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know enough about the details of mining to comment on most of this, but:\n\nFuel cells throttle themselves when the vessel is reaches 95% energy storage.

I noticed it seemed to be something like that. What would be nice is a way to set the cutoff, so if I had enough storage to last half the night I could say only charge when below 5%, and half as much fuel would be used. As it stands I only have enough storage for like 1% of the nighttime, so it does\u0027t make much difference either way. But they do need to be turned on to do that, I really hate how it costs 1,000,000 to unlock custom action groups, that was tedious.\n\nOK, some imperial evidence. I did manage a tiny hop to a vein 1% higher, so the numbers should be a little off, but I seem to be generating ore many times faster than I use up fuel. I don\u0027t know if the wiki is off, or I just screwed up a decimal place somewhere. But the fuel cells do no seem to use a significant amount of the generated fuel, and a single night time seems long enough to completely fill the miner and then some.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nA good point Sharpy. At this point, sort of, if at all possible, as I am trying to fuel an expedition of the Mun. So a suborbital hop of two and then back to the refueling station. But that is something to think of. Are the weight of fuel cells worth the difference.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T13:27:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 01:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wisnoskij**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T14:02:57Z","Content":"A few ideas:\n\n- Some would consider this an exploit, but... If you leave focus from your miner (i.e. go back to KSC or whatever), then the resource harvesting goes on in the background, but electricity consumption does not. So you can keep running through the night if you\u0027re just careful not to *look* at it during the night.\n\n- Consider moving the operation to Minmus. Much shorter night, plus there are other benefits too, such as lower gravity.\n\n- Follow the sun. Have a few good mining spots scouted out around the globe. Whenever sunset approaches, just hop a few hundred kilometers to the west.\n\n- Reduce power consumption at night, for example add lots of ore tanks and just shut down ISRU conversion while you keep mining, and maybe shut down some of your drills.\n\n- Leave the refinery in orbit, where there\u0027s more sunshine. You ship ore up. Maybe even put a lot of batteries on the ore tanker and bring electric charge down."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T14:29:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Another strange thing \n\u003E \n\u003E I am using ScanSat.

Every biome has an average density and that\u0027s just what you will see at first: entire biomes in the same hue. After you have run the surface scanning module in a biome, the picture will become much clearer. In principle, you need to do this in every biome -- in practice, you will soon figure out which ones you may as well skip.\n\nc) your vessel needs a narrow-band scanner in order to see resource data when zoomed in.

The trouble with Munar poles is, of course, the extremely rugged terrain makes it hard to land safely. If you happen to have a good deposit at a polar location, consider that a very lucky break! Otherwise, the poles are great for the MPL.\n\nA simpler solution would be simply to let the drills stop at night.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T18:50:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 06:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zephram Kerman**"},{"CreatedByName":"wisnoskij","CreatedById":143705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T20:17:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve never found one on Mun, but Minmus has at least one spot on the south pole with full-time sunlight.\n\nWow, I always wondered if we got any strange seasonal/polar sunlight. I guess it only makes sense. The planets all rotate perfectly on their poles and seem to have fairly flat orbital planes. SO the very top/botton of a planet should be pretty static. That said, I think the poles in my game have by way the lowest concentrations. Not sure exacly how averages work tho. Can a 1% biome contain 99% 0% and 1% 100% ore levels?"}]}
