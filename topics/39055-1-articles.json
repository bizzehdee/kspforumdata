Now I must advise you the devs have an idea of what they what for multiplayer, this thread is where you can post what you think would be awesome if added to ksp multiplayer. One last note multiplayer feature is a long ways away from now so don\u0027t think I am hinting that it will be in the next up coming patch because I am not a rep of squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are on a multiplayer server instead of having to make a space program you can become an astronaut. What I mean by this is one person could be mission control viewing the rocket from the outside guiding the astronauts on the inside what to do for example pitch up, yaw right, if this feature would be added to multiplayer it would change how players interact with other people on the server instead of competing they will have to communicate in order to complete the goal(This would make the first person view very useful and change the way you experience the mission) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this could be flawed in many ways I just thought when multiplayer came out it would be cool to work together on one mission. Leave your comments below on what you think would be a cool feature that could be added to multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MR4Y","CreatedById":66897,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T09:29:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is on the \u0022What not to suggest list.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T09:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed it is. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThread locked, have a nice day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
