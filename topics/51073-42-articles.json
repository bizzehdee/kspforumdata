In Kethane (and probably also in SCANsat) the scanning mechanic is separate from the display mechanic. For users who prefer 2D maps, SCANsat could indeed display Kethane\u0027s data, and this is an addition I\u0027d like to see (but it would need to happen from SCANsat\u0027s side). Making the Kethane scanner behave like SCANsat\u0027s is something that would happen on Kethane\u0027s end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisplaying SCANsat data in 3D is interesting. In theory, SCANsat should just do that, but Kethane already has a lot of the facilities in place (including \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i4.minus.com/iInmAVClPhA8J.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esome unreleased WIP stuff\u003C/a\u003E). If there\u0027s interest from damny, I think it would work nicely for the Kethane overlay to support displaying SCANsat data if the user so desires. Difficult problems like mouseover detection on non-spherical bodies have already been solved, and it would allow players to use either a 2D or 3D view for all the scan data they need to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EI hadn\u0027t planned to do much work on that in the near future, but damny could potentially change that.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ser","CreatedById":104207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T20:02:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne more suggestion, if anyone hadn\u0027t posted it already:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to have some bearing tool in GPS map because its general usage is to know the direction to go (to make a good way around an edge of a crater for example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay be even setting a waypoint on the map and showing the distance and direction towards it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T21:16:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Majiir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Majiir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...except Squad\u0027s lawyer directly contradicts you on this point.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen that\u0027s Squad given you special dispensation.
