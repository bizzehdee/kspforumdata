The plugin has been updated for 1.0 and various things have changed, including saving new planet data in the persistence node, rather than a separate config.\n\nIn addition, Kerbin will attempt to be placed inside the habitable zone so that planets will appear in both higher and lower orbits.\n\nNote: Rarely, there may be a bug in which your vessel spawns in deep space. If this occurs, revert or return and time warp a bit from the space center.\n\n[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/27OdA#0)\n\nDownload from [KerbalStuff](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/768/PlanetScrambler)\n\n[Source Code](https://github.com/CelMech/PlanetScrambler)\n\nThis work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T01:58:50Z","Content":"Glad someone is continuing metaphor\u0027s work."},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T02:04:16Z","Content":"If this could be changed to generate Kopernicus configs, I would use it to make a new Alternis Kerbol-like mod, as KillAshley gave me a red giant Kerbol config."},{"CreatedByName":"CelestialMechanic","CreatedById":63925,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T03:20:25Z","Content":"It\u0027s interesting that you should be the first reply, I spent a lot of time ensuring that the mod would work smoothly with mods like Outer Planets that add new bodies.\n\nAs for Kopernicus, I really have no idea how to use it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T03:37:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CelestialMechanic**"},{"CreatedByName":"Trainzack","CreatedById":100807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T06:10:21Z","Content":"Edit: More pressingly, it seems to keep forgetting the planet setup, maybe related to crashes (or that joystick bug where it forgets the axis?), offering the dialog to enter a seed.
