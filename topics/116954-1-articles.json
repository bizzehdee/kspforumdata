Don\u0027t adjust stages first, don\u0027t tweakables something, save first, THEN make further adjustments. CTRL\u002BZ will undo your last action but this can also bug up your action groups on occasion, and I don\u0027t like nasty surprises midflight. Basically if I make a booboo and pick up a whole segment of my build with lots of things attached to it, I reload the \u0022safe\u0022 save rather than risking errors creeping in. If I lose a part I swore I just had, I reload. No screwy struts, no nonfunctional action groups, no 1\u002Bx staging.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T17:04:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECtrl\u002BZ can be very buggy. Please use with caution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I find the best way to get to hidden parts is to keep practicing with the camera. Also, using shift\u002Bclick to move the whole ship a little can help see into those small parts if you have problems with the fine placement of the camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also recommend saving right before you pull off something if you are having difficulty.
