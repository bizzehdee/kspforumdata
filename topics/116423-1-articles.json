Unlike Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere air breathing seems to be possible up to 36k with RAPIERs, yet the atmospheric height is only 50k and the pressure at sea level is well under that seen at Kerbin. The latter caused one of my recent SSTO builds to fail after I worked off a (what I believe to be reasonable) assumption that an air breathing height of 36k would mean the atmosphere would be at least equal to that of Kerbin\u0027s at sea level. Unfortunately this turned out to be false, with the atmosphere being considerably thinner... resulting in one of my SSTO builds to crash due to insufficient lift to land at a low enough speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to the point, how much additional lift (preferably as a ratio for a given mass) should I probably expect to land horizontally on Laythe near sea level when compared to Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FalseKing","CreatedById":148400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T18:58:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt isnt much.
