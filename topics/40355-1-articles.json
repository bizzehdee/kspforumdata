When I click on Undock, nothing happens. That is, when I try to back away from the station with the command module (I\u0027m in Docking mode, so I\u0027m using translation key commands), I see all the jets across the space station fire.

FYI, between the command module and the docking port, there is a parachute. In previous flights, I\u0027ve docked to something, undocked, and deployed the parachute. so the chute should not prevent undocking from the space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried the \u0022Control from here\u0022 option on both docking port context menus and the command module menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do I need to do?
