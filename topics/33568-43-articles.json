VOID gives you a celestial catalog window that presents all kinds of orbital data for bodies, including true anomaly, mean anomaly, RAAN, LPE, etc etc. So, I went into the RMS and copied to the clipboard the orbital data for Minmus. Then I made a copy of bodies.ini and deleted Minmus from it. Then I loaded the new bodies data and opened MA, plugging in Minmus\u0027 orbit for the initial state. I then progressed the mission up to the current game time, to the second, and took a screenshot of the game data and the MA data.

Wrong (Nooooooo my fabulous mission plan!!!!!). And I checked Ike. Wrong. Anyways, leveraging the power of arithmetics I calculated the offset value and added it to the mean anomaly setting for the body in the bodies.ini file.

So I go and load my Duna mission, the one I posted earlier that is supposed to encounter Ike after initial Duna Pe if I don\u0027t circularize there, and there was still no Ike encounter.

Not sure what to do about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo next I gave Minmus the orbital data update treatment, changing its mean anomaly and LPE. When I checked for alignment I didn\u0027t get a match, but then I changed the LPE back to 0 instead of setting it to 38 like the game said and then I got a match for mean/true anomaly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TCFad6v.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TCFad6v.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1i7LxG6.png\u0022 alt=\u00221i7LxG6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever when I reloaded MA with the new bodies.ini data and plugged in the current orbit of my Minmus probe straight from the game, MA still didn\u0027t have things right. It told me my probe was going to have a Pe of 918km at Minmus yet when I warped ahead and hit Minmus\u0027 SOI the game showed me I had the 1,500km Pe I had originally set up a maneuver node in the game for. Once again, I took a look at the orbital period that MA was giving me: 1077311 seconds plugged into a UT window in KSPTOT spits out 13d:11h:15m:11s when the game is telling me the orbital period of Minmus is 12d:11h:57m:52.1s. So then I took it to the wiki which tells me Minmus\u0027 orbital period is what MA says it should be. So maybe VOID is wrong in this regard but that doesn\u0027t explain why MA is telling me my Pe (altitude) is 918km when in the game it ends up 1,500km (really it\u0027s 1,498 something like that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo rats, I thought I had things solved but although I got a step closer it seems something is still amiss...

I decided to plan a maneuver in MA and import it into KSP to see how it would look, so I optimized my MA plot to intercept Minmus with a Pe of 900km. I uploaded the resulting burn to KSP and ended up with a Pe of 713,206km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kUSr8UD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kUSr8UD.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kvgKO4a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kvgKO4a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried updating Mun\u0027s mean anomaly and seeing how that affects mission planning.

I\u0027m not sure what the margin of error is with KSPTOT, or if there is any. Should this be considered an acceptable value? I think so - it\u0027s certainly more usable than the almost 300km difference shown in the Minmus example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo double-check the offset I took the current trajectory and added a Dv maneuver, then optimized a solution for 1,000km Pe and uploaded the burn into KSP.
