I\u0027m not much of a reader of this forum and probably I won\u0027t be much of a writer either. Or who knows...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been playing KSP (sandbox only) since the release of 1.0, although I \u0027ve heard about it around 2 years ago, I think. The first month was pretty intense, thanks to Scott Manley (bowing my head) and \u0022Docking Port Alignment Indicator\u0022 mod. I was playing from around 2PM up to 10AM the next day, going to sleep when I couldn\u0027t keep my eyes open for a few hours and then going at it again. Before falling asleep, just one more Scott Manley tutorial. Soon I couldn\u0027t even look at the damn screen, I had to go on a trip in the mountains for a few days to clear my eyes. I cleared my eyes, but my head was full of plans for a space station, a SSTO plane, a refueling station orbiting Mun with a refinery on surface or a base (with a refinery of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter resuming the adventure, as things started to get more and more complex, the framerate dropped to 1-5 fps and continuing to play was simply frustrating. It was a pain in the \u0022aft\u0022 to put together the base on Minmus and the cherry on top was after it was all done when some of it exploded right after loading from the KSC tracking facility. I had already used HyperEdit mod to erase the debris and auxiliary landing equipment that was parked near the base hoping for an improvement in framerate, but that was no help. So I \u0022cheated\u0022 and put back the exploded module and never touched that base again. Good thing it wasn\u0027t manned yet when it exploded. Or \u0022Kerbaled\u0022, I think is the proper term? I\u0027m thinking of sharing some images of my concepts, but I need to summon the strength to play at 1 fps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is pretty cool, apart from a few things like \u0022rubber\u0022 parts (especially the big batteries), not being able to use a triple or double adapter at both ends of a structure (it only attaches to one of the 2/3 ends, the need for struts even when parts should be \u0022welded\u0022 to each other, parts not attaching even when they really should, lights not rendered if there are too many lamps, no options for rescaling/resizing aerodynamic parts or changing tanks contents to other substances and ratios etc. I know there are mods to solve some of these problems, but it\u0027s annoying having to update them every damn time so I\u0027m playing almost stock, the only parts mods are BDynamics, Aviation Lights, SCANSat, Tarsier Space Technology and Mk2 Stock-a-like Expansion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I\u0027m playing a few hours a week, just trying out a few ideas now and then, waiting for 1.1 and hoping for a major performance improvement. I didn\u0027t see any release date or maybe I was reading too much between the lines? Anybody knows when it\u0027s coming out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EP.S. \u0022Sodot A Aloh!\u0022 is Kerbish for \u0022Hello everybody!\u0022.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T19:27:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerformance in itself is not scheduled as an aspect of the next update, but the move to a newer version of Unity may help somewhat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the game is continually being tweaked and improved, though I also would like to see optimization made an emphasis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T19:32:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Ursu Mare, and welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s quite a bit of writing for somebody who thinks they probably won\u0027t be much of a writer. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood to have you aboard, and I hope you manage to get your frame rate higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ten Key","CreatedById":123319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T21:25:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ursu Mare\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ursu Mare\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E. . .not being able to use a triple or double adapter at both ends of a structure (it only attaches to one of the 2/3 ends. . .\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the large docking ports when I want to use an adapter on both ends of a structure.
