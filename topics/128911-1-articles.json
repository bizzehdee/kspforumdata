Notably, keeping the stupid thing full of data is really annoying. By the end of the mission, I had 170\u002B individual pieces of data, so I\u0027d need to click through every single one to try to find something that fit in the data buffer, and clicking the green button to keep, which of course bounces up and down depending on if you\u0027ve analyzed it or not. Sometimes the window would shift slightly, and I\u0027d accidentally delete a result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, my ideal mod would just look at my potential data pile, find one with the correct size to fill the data tank, and auto-keep the rest. It\u0027d also be neat to be able to set accurate KAL reminders to transmit the science tank, based on current production and expected falloff in the data tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould anyone else be interested in such a thing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
