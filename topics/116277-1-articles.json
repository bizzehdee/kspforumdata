Frankly, it\u0027s only because I\u0027m waiting for a ship that got into an on orbit just scraping teh top of teh atmosphere (with no propulsion left) to de-orbit) that I\u0027ve notice teh thing much. Been playing since 0.23 and just really noticed the thing now. My best guess is that it might be temperature-related, but if so, temprature of what? exterior of capsule? interior of capsule?
