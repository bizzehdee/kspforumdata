(Might as well use hyperedit?)\n\nOk, relative to the Sun, I suppose, but direction also matters. My speed **vector** and the target speed **vector**, I need the difference in m/s between them. Similarly when you are making an intercept maneuver you get the speed relative to target. I want basically the same thing, but with another planet being my target.\n\n When you use warp drive for direct travel you usually end up near your target with circularization maneuver costing you 12-25 km/s of dV (you retain your initial momentum after the jump). If, from the other hand, I can move to a certain point within the system and wait there for the right moment (when our speeds are nearly matched) and then make the transfer to the target. It\u0027s not by any means cheaty. It requires very careful navigation and the mistake is measured in km/s of dV.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If you\u0027re using a warpdrive, I think you\u0027re basically out of luck-- the game\u0027s not designed for that, the UI doesn\u0027t really offer any help.
