The timing of the code updates means that you can run out of power while fully supplied in some cases. It\u0027s more of an issue in modding: Life support running out kills your crew and electricity running out makes you lose your probe. Mods also create more situations where these resource issues are likely to occur."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerb Johnson","CreatedById":91188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T14:43:39Z","Content":"Pre-mission planning maybe?
