However, the potential of this game seems to me far from as good as it should be (even though, it is really good).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough there are plans to improve the user interface, there wasn\u2019t anything about assisting new players, which is in my opinion, the biggest issue on this game. I know there are dozens of tutorials but they required a lot of time to understand what to do, and how to do it right. I think that assisting a player with suggestions and mistakes of the player during the creation of a spacecraft would be a tremendous help and would bring new players. I\u0027ve seen friends who really liked the idea behind the game, but once I\u0027ve told them my experience about what I had to know to create a spacecraft, they stepped back. This is where the game could expand the game community and it doesn\u0027t as much as it could. For the current players, a situation which I believe it is common, it is when you build the spacecraft, you launch it, you\u0027re nearly doing the objective, but then you realized you made a mistake either by putting a piece in the wrong way, or because you forgot something... This shouldn\u0027t be happening and it happened to me quite a few times, and it could be fixed with the game assistance when building a spacecraft. Even if there are mods for that (which I admit I didn\u0027t look for it), I don\u0027t want to rely on mods as they tend to crash the game and not be as much reliable as what a game usually offers, since they are made from enthusiasts and not from hired professionals...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stability is another issue. I know, mods can screw up the stability of your game, which brings the next issue I would like to discuss, which is the graphics...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe graphics of this game really look outdated. The menus, the parts... They look as if the game was released 20 years ago. I\u0027ve seen parts that look really good as you can see in this video: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/8I7t-SrTRms\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/8I7t-SrTRms\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy improving the graphics, if the visual mods are really the issue behind the stability, then it wouldn\u0027t be a problem anymore...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease, take this in consideration. I really like this game and it is sad to see the game with such potential to have these issues...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy holidays!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T23:34:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell there are plans for a graphic overhaul for the rocket parts for the 1.2 update, and by stability what do you mean?

I didn\u0027t go into details because I assumed people would know what I mean, as Laythe apparently did. There should be a sticky news thread about these things that I\u0027ve mentioned because they have such major impact in the game, that fixing should be part of the next iteration (or if you want, for the 2.0 version). What made me come into the forums to post this was because the iterations are slow and I wanted to see if this would be addressed asap, which means they should increase their team (in my opinion).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if moving to Unity5 solves the stability, like I said, that kind of information should be in a sticky news thread.
