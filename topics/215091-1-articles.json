You should add a craft file converter to the game, so players who created vehicles in KSP 1 would be able to use them in Kerbal Space Program 2. I have previously suggested this feature as a mod for the game, but now I think it might work better if it was a standalone feature included in stock KSP 2. As for how you could implement it, I gave an idea in this post along with some UI concept art:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/214938-idea-ksp-1-craft-file-converter/#comment-4259514\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/214938-idea-ksp-1-craft-file-converter/#comment-4259514\u003C/a\u003E. A feature like this would be useful for players coming from KSP 1 who want to use vehicles that they spent a lot of time making or have a high part count in the original game and don\u0027t want to waste time trying to recreate the vehicle part for part in KSP 2. From my many hours of experience in KSP 1 (over 600!), I know how tedious it can sometimes be to create a vehicle that works and functions the way that you want it to, so having something like this in the game would be very much appreciated...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvNjY1MDAwLzExNTkxMjQxLnBuZw==/original/4MCu/f.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/187334-johnster_space_program/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022187334\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/187334-johnster_space_program/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Johnster_Space_Program\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T18:16:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not going to work without adding all of the KSP1 parts to KSP2. Some of the KSP2 parts are really similar to their KSP1 counterparts, but if any are identical it\u0027s by chance, and some things work totally differently -- notably wings. Also lots of parts simply aren\u0027t there and I don\u0027t know if they have plans to ever add them. There are changes to the aerodynamics and structural rigidity and strength too, so even if you were able to convert a craft, it might not even work!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it might be feasible as a mod where somebody did port all the KSP1 stuff over, but not very likely for stock!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-15T18:18:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2023 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Periple\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kicka55","CreatedById":227402,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T19:46:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that effort just because you are too lazy to build the same rocket twice. lol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst answer the question: Should we do it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbefore you move to: Can we do it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-15T19:46:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2023 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by kicka55\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnster_Space_Program","CreatedById":187334,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T21:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the idea was worth a shot, but I guess I\u0027ll just have to recreate my KSP 1 rockets in KSP 2 for now as it probably would not end up working without a lot of changes being done to the parts system in the game...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-15T21:42:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2023 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Johnster_Space_Program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
