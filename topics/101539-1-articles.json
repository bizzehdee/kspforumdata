Thought I\u0027d have some fun trying to make a super heavy missile carrier. I might have gotten a little carried away already. So far the Carrier it\u0027s self is nothing more then a rolling chassis. Ok, to be honest, it\u0027s not just a rolling chassis. I have a fully implemented custom suspension installed on it that lets each wheel move up and down freely, more then the wheels suspension would allow, using heavy landing gear as the shock absorbers. It has a row of short trusses for each wheel that can flex freely letting each wheel move independently. This lets it contour to the ground nicely, improving stability. Only issue is the wheels want to twist while steering at the moment and I don\u0027t know how to fix this, yet, without reducing the flex of the suspension. The wheel assembly twists/rotates clockwise or counterclockwise while steering, causing them to bind up a little. Usually just the front or rear wheels do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/zackmissilecarrierchassie_zps5aimvji0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zackmissilecarrierchassie_zps5aimvji0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the wheels are in full contact with the ground in this pic.

And it can cross most terrain with little trouble. Due to it\u0027s mass, it acts like a battering ram and can take out any building in the KSP with just a \u0022love tap\u0022 at 4 m/s. It\u0027s only issues are the wheel twist while turning and the trouble it has with crossing the \u0022rails\u0022 between the VAB and the launch pad(due to the wheels twisting instead of climbing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanned weaponry:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: a single massive F.R.E.D multi-missile(added, but it\u0027s so large it becomes dangerous to maneuver the Zack, might remove it...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: 2-4 Arget, guided anti-armor missiles(added)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: at least 4 heavy M-Beam missiles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: 2 racks of 12 light M-Beam missiles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: possibly a ramming prow of some type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas on how to fix the wheel twist would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfo:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF.R.E.D = Fragged Radiated Exploded Demolished.

The small girders have no reinforcing so are able to flex quite a bit. Struts are connected from the small girders to the wheel assembly to reduce twisting. The struts also connect the girder arms to each other, but only at the end, reducing horizontal movement. The heavy landing gear goes from the upper XL girders, which are reinforced, to the girder segment right next to the wheel assembly, pushing it down. The weight of the vehicle compresses both the suspension on the wheel assemblies and the heavy landing gear.
