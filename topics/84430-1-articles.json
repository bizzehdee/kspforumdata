Goodspeed is the better of the two; the only problem with either of them is that they make fuel lines redundant and remove some of the engineering challenge when building. And designing on the assumption that Goodspeed/TAC-FB will handle things makes the design dependent on those mods, which can be a problem when sharing designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the engineering solutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Spread your fuel load laterally around CoM rather than longitudinally. Getting CoM to dCoM offset to \u0026lt;1m isn\u0027t too hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Arrange your fuel lines to make the tanks drain in the order you choose. On multi-engine planes, I normally have forward-mounted lines running from the lateral tanks to the core, and rear-mounted lines from the core to the lateral engines. This makes the tanks first drain from rear lateral to forward lateral, then forward core to rear core. The CoM stays roughly centred throughout, and any weight shift is initially towards the nose, avoiding the \u0022CoM behind CoL\u0022 issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Use right-click tweakables to lock off the fuel flow from a forward tank. This will stop it draining prematurely, as well as enabling you to designate a tank as \u0022emergency reserve\u0022. You can fine tune this by doing things like locking off LF but not O on certain tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T11:49:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERather than having a whole separate part for this, I would think that it would be more logical to have it as a module that is included in the cockpit part.
