I have a college-level understanding of physics, so I figured that for a supersonic flight one will need longitudinally longer wings to maintain control. Hence my first SSTO Craft, the Hyperion pictured below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/m7eyz8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022m7eyz8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E During initial tests I\u0027ve found that the yaw stability was much too low, so I increased the height and length of the two tails, as seen above. However, as I approach 20k the stability of the aircraft is even worse now. In my latest disaster of a flight I could\u0027t even pull out of a manic spin where I both rolled and yawed uncontrollably, despite fighting it with rcs the whole way down. After the sad demise of Edwise Kerman. I checked the FAR Static graph to see if I had messed up the design somehow.

You really want the Cm (moment coefficient - yellow line) to have a lower-magnitude slope for easy pitch-control; which means that you want to push the CoL further forward. Make sure that you do your static analysis at a variety of Mach numbers because the physics change a lot with Mach number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem is that the sudden increase in Cm as stall begins indicates that your vehicle can\u0027t recover from a stall. The solution to this is to make the canards have a larger span or to reduce the span of the main wing; this will cause the canard to stall first, forcing the vehicle to pitch down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve also got a lot more wing there than you need, you can get rid of quite a bit of it and still fly fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo help with yaw stability I\u0027d say to try shifting the fuel tanks forward so that the vertical stabilizers you have there can be more effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that as you go higher and faster the aerodynamic damping on your aircraft will decrease, meaning that you will probably need to use some active control inputs to keep in under control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T05:03:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you do a shot with your CoL \u002B CoM balls? and just to check, what are the jobs of both pairs of horizontal control surfaces? eyeballing it suggests that you have too much wing aft of the CoL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went digging around my designs - this one seems reasonably similar to yours ( perhaps less fuel ) and is obviously hypersonic given it\u0027s a spaceplane.

I\u0027ve edited my design and here is the new Hyperion: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/2hmh7ae.png\u0022 alt=\u00222hmh7ae.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see I\u0027ve ditched the extended wings at the end and sides while keeping the twin tails due to stylistic choice. I\u0027ve also extended the reach of the advanced canards by smacking them on a tail fin which I then pitched one notch downward. Both of these things helped reign in my CoL towards the CoM and hopefully will aid in it\u0027s flying (Ignore the fact that I\u0027m now missing yaw control surfaces as I realized that fact as I was writing this post xD).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition the Cm now has a delightfully smaller negative slope as shown below. It still splits as my angle of attack gets around 20 at subsonic speeds but both the deviancy of the split is smaller and the split disappears much quicker as I approach Mach 2-3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i42.tinypic.com/2uids1u.png\u0022 alt=\u00222uids1u.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for before Van Disaster, the CoM was around the center of that second Mk 2 Fuel tank with the CoL being a little bit in front of the center of the third tank. A great distance more than what it is now. Unfortunately removing fuel is out of the question as I aim to use SSTO\u0027s to refuel my space/gas station that\u0027s currently in orbit, although if it comes down to it I\u0027ll cut the extra. I\u0027m going to try some test flights now and report back my findings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Van, I believe that having the wing jutting out past the shock cone results in the outer parts generating much less lift than the inner, moving the center of lift forward and destabilizing the plane a bit, at least with swept or delta wing designs. Quite a problem, but thankfully not simulated in KSP (yet...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Sooooo adding more lift to the front was a horrible idea, as it brought the Center of Lift pretty much centerline with the CoM. So I removed the tailfins while keeping the advanced canard, and now it flies much better. Still possible to get into an unrecoverable stall but only if I work towards it. On it\u0027s own it won\u0027t do it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It\u0027ll need a little bit of tweaking to get the heavier LV-N on the back, but I\u0027m sure with some further testing I can do it.

That is why conventional aircraft use horizontal tails most of the time, even though it provides a negative lift, decreasing the efficiency of the craft.
