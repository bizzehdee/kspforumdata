Granted, this can be made even better using mods (like kerbtown to place custom structures or KAS to enhance the spectrum of possible tasks), but even the vanilla version should be enough to produce some interesting plots. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get the ball rolling, heres a quick idea how a story arc could look like, based on something similar like the Alien franchise (since KSP could really do spooky stuff - sometimes even driving a rover on the mun at night can feel unnerving \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract 1: The host company (Weyland-Yutani) gives you a simple task of transporting some fuel to a station around Jool (hey, if the system can spawn kerbals in orbit, why can\u0027t it spawn whole stations...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract 2: The host company detected some strange readings on Vall during your last mission. It now gives you some scanning equipment to test in Vall orbit (can be stock or a new modded part)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract 3: Your scanning equipment found a wreckage on Vall surface. Land with 3 Kerbals at it\u0027s coordinates (or something like that) (the wreckage could be pre-modelled and then positioned with KerbTown)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract 4: Examine the wreckage and collect a valuable item (let\u0027s say exomorph pod - this could be again done with the \u0027rescue Kerbal in orbit\u0027 mechanic, just replace the Kerbal model with something else. Or KAS could be used to pick up a pod-looking part and later attached to the lander for retrieval).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContrack 5: Land at the KSC. Obviously there would be some catastrophe during the trip, making sure only 1 Kerbal returns (like a scripted event).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand so on, there are a lot of movies to cover \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, i\u0027m no expert at KSP modding, so i\u0027m not sure how much of this particular story would be possible, but you get the idea. If anyone is interested in picking up the ball and make a mod out of this, i\u0027d be glad to help (i have 4 years Unity experience and am a hobby 3D modeler, plus professional software developer), but i don\u0027t have nearly enough time to pull something like this myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
