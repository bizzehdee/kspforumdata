It\u0027s a description of how a first time player reacts to the game when playing it. With the player being me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found this game in a reference in \u003Ca href=\u0022http://what-if.xkcd.com/68/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EXkcd\u0027s What If #68\u003C/a\u003E. It describes how a planet the size of Little Prince with 1 G gravity would behave. In particular, the very small orbit would cause strong tidal forces that would send bodies spinning in all sorts of weird ways. This was describes as \u0022This is KSP on nightmare mode\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt caught my interest, and soon enough I had the demo running on my computer. I looked for \u0022tutorial\u0022, as it was my impression that this was the kind of game that would be brutal to anyone who did not have a decent understanding of the mechanics. Calling it training confused me a bit. But soon enough I had completed all four training missions. It gave me some directions as to how to control orbits with prograde and retrograde burns at the apoapsis and periapsis. It had some basic rocket designing too. But it left me clueless as to how to get a rocket into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bought the game shortly after, and the leap from the demo to v.22 was a pleasant surprise. And with the availability of career mode, I figured it would be a good place to start. Only the parts that matter for a basic spacecraft would be available, and I could learn the game progressively as new stuff would be available. And there would be a clear defined goal, with good directions as to what I was supposed to do. Or so I thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat presented me was a few beautifully modeled buildings, with functions that was self explanatory. I looked at the Research and Development, and saw 2 nodes. One of which I could research using 5 Science points. Okay, so I need Science points to get better stuff. Makes sense, there was however no indications as to how one could get science points. So I carried on. The first thing I tried to do was to launch a rocket. The logic being that since the demo had some pre-built rockets, the career has too. Nope. To the Vehicle Assembly Building then. And whoa, you start with only 7 parts. There isn\u0027t even an decoupler ring in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built my first rocket, the V-Explorer 1 (V is for Vertical). Consisting of a command module, a parachute, a fuel tank, a rocket engine, and an antenna. I had no clue what the antenna was for, but guessed that it could be used for science. I launched it. It flew a bit up in the atmosphere. I clicked around of the craft and found out that you could do a crew report by right clicking on the command module. The fuel ran out and I deployed the parachute, and watched in horror as the engine and fuel tank exploded as soon as it touched the ground. How am I supposed to recover the rocket when it explodes as soon as it touches the ground? I don\u0027t have a link decoupler, so I can\u0027t drop the engine. I thought the solid fuel rocket would be stronger, and proceeded to make V-Explorer 2 with a solid fuel rocket instead of a liquid one. \u0022LaunchPad not clear. V-Explorer 1 is already on the LaunchPad\u0022. Huh? My previous rocket exploded, I\u0027ll clear the launch pad then (at this point, the process of recovering of a rocket was an unknown to me). I launched my V-Explorer 2, it descended and Bang! Same result. I was dumbfounded. I could make landing struts with the Modular Girder Segment, but I had a parachute to slow down the decent. Making linkages that break to simulate a decoupler would be more of creative bypass of the rules given. (I don\u0027t fancy abusing the game physics to achieve something that you don\u0027t have the tools to do. It\u0027s career after all)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched yet another V-Explorer 1, and watched as it exploded when it hit the ground. Wait, the command module actually survived. Cool. But still pretty silly. Okay, I then pressed Esc and clicked on Space Center. My two crew reports had given me enough Science points to get Basic Rocketry. And with it a stack decoupler and science part. Yes! Finally some progress to be done. And thus V-Explorer 3, with 2 stages, Mystery Goo containers and a decoupler on the command module to make for a landing without explosions. Launch! It flies high up, I do some crew reports, study the mystery goo and sends the result with the antenna. But the scientific returns was abysmal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Keep report option confused me, as it appeared to do nothing. At around V-Explorer 5 I managed to add two and two together. You could send the results with an antenna or recover the craft and the goo container to get the science points from the studies. Recovering of the space craft was both logical and intuitive, yet I had no clue how to actually do it. In the tracking station I found 3 of my former rockets listed up as in progress. And there was button called Recover. Bingo! The most important way of getting science points, some 10 rockets launches into the game. More so I figured that there had to be a way to recover a vehicle while controlling it. I found it pretty quickly. Hovering the mouse over the center top UI element and a button with recover vessel appeared. How the heck was I supposed to find that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this in mind I created V-Explorer 6. With the goo module attached to the command module, so that it could be recovered. It flew high up, but I couldn\u0027t get it to orbit. It was not a goal, but it did not even come close. It went straight up and then straight down. But worse still, the Science points gained by it was even more abysmal. The diminishing returns of experiments prevented me from getting anything more out of it. Worse still I had no idea what kind of experiments and reports that I had done, or what reports and experiments that I could do. It was clear that in order to progress I would have to make a vessel capable of orbit. And I would have to figure out how to pilot to orbit as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thus the O-Explorer series was born. (O for Orbit). The first, O-Explorer 1 carried a whooping 4.5 t of \u003Cem\u003Edead\u003C/em\u003E weight. Needless to say, it did not reach orbit. But with the discovery of EVA, surface samples and crew reports on the ground of Kerbal having great scientific value I managed to get enough points to get a radial decoupler and a large solid fuel booster rockets. Two of \u0027em and a simple 2 stage rocket should be sufficient? I still had no clue how to pilot a rocket into orbit. I flew straight up until I reached about 10.000 meters and rotated gradually towards the horizon. When I was out of fuel the trajectory was an parabola going almost straight up, and the straight down again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I doubt, more boosters. Eight of them. O-Explorer 3 was bound to have enough power to reach orbit. It flew straight up and then fell straight down. I was already browsing up several pages to find some explanation of what I was doing wrong when I realized that my parabolic orbit was actually elliptic. The part that stuck down into Kerbal would actually go around the center of the planet had there not been a planet in the way, and the periapisis would be there as well. I remembered form the tutorial that the best way to raise the periapisis is a prograde burn at the apoapisis. So I did just that in the next Launch. Traveled some 5,000 meters up in the air and started turning. I waited until I got to the apoapisis at 10,000 meters and did a full throttle. Success! My orbit was circular at 10,000 meters. A few drops of fuel left and, eh oh, red flames from air compression on my rocket. I looked at the atmosphere indicator. Half way to frictionless vacuum. Ouch! I watched helplessly as the rocket dropped back into the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatching the Kerbal Rocket School I learned about booster configurations, calculating delta V and a lot of other useful things. With the knowledge I designed the Orbiter I to reach an orbit around Kerbel with the Science Jr. It achieved that goal with 1500 m/s delta V to spare. That might have been enough to get to the Mun and back again, but just to be sure I made the Orbiter II to do the job. It made the trip with a few overshots and mises, getting back to Kerbal with a full stage worth of thrust to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to sum up my experience as a first time player:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe rocket I made with tier 1 parts exploded upon touching the ground.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECareer mode gave absolutely no directions for what to do.

Mouse over the small glowing green triangle you see over the altimeter and it should expand and display a button marked \u0022recover\u0022 or somesuch. Click it, and mission complete!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) To recover a vessel without having to manually switch to it, you can go to the Tracking Station (the building with the big radar dishes) and find the vessel in the list.

You can also self-destruct vessels from this screen, if they\u0027re out of reach of the recover function (i.e. not on Kerbin\u0027s surface). IMPORTANT to note: You can recover debris as well, including science-bearing parts like the Goo Canister, if they\u0027re splashed down or landed safely (emphasis on safely--it doesn\u0027t work if you just drop them, since physics unloads past a certain limit, at which point they are considered to have crashed).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lheim","CreatedById":62665,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T06:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s very much a game in progress.

It certainly comes to prove that you greet newcomers with a helping hand, keep up with it. To all of you that have come with suggestions regarding things such as the pod surviving when my initial rockets exploded, how to do a recovery of a space craft and getting into orbit. Thanks, but as I said in the original post, I managed to figure out how to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe journey past those initial troubles have been a lot more rewarding and fun. After the success of the Orbiter I, I made the Orbiter II, which I made a flyby of the Mun (or is it M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn? I keep seeing both in use). I overshot, took an extra obit, messed up the return, but got safely back to Kerbal again without even using the final stage (which I calculated to have 1475 m/s delta V). With the science and experience I gained from it I made the Mun Lander I.

The landing was the most nerve wrecking, I didn\u0027t know about the Quick save/restore feature when I did it so I genuinely believed that it was a land or bust operation. I didn\u0027t explode when I hit the surface, but my lander tipped over. Thanks to the magic angular power of the pod I managed to roll it upright again. At which point the fuel gauge said \u0022just enough\u0022 to get back to Kerbal. The fuel left on the lander when I entered the atmosphere of Kerbal was about 5%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all the game is very well made. The thing that would have to be greatly improved however is how the game introduces itself to new players.

A list of science wanted such as \u0022conduct an EVA on Kerbal\u0022 or \u0022Report from the upper atmosphere\u0022 could improve this.
