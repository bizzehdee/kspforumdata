The mod support will also alleviate some confusion with the \u0022Station Systems\u0022 objective. ARM contracts got a practical overhaul internally, as they were not functioning. Please keep me updated on if you are able to complete these contracts or not. I am in testing, but the more feedback the better. Also keep me updated if they complete for no reason, and when they do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo more than two contracts of any given type by Fine Print will appear on the contract board at any given time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerial waypoints now appear in the same general area. It is still a decent range, but they will be in the same hemisphere. Aerial rewards reduced by 25% to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERover waypoints now appear in much smaller areas, and there are less of them. To compensate I have doubled their rewards. Still looking for feedback on these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can now click on waypoints in the main map, this will cause a navigation icon to appear on your navball to assist you in completing your contracts. If you have a navigation waypoint set, you can click the same waypoint to disable it, or it will disable whenever you complete an objective at that waypoint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStations and bases will now occasionally request a cupola viewing port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlightly increased the rate at which exceptional station contracts will ask to be built into new asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGave significant station contracts a very rare chance to ask to be built into new asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlightly increased the rate at which exceptional base contracts will ask for a mobile base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGave significant base contracts a very rare chance to ask for a mobile base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerial contracts should not appear until later in the technology tree, as I don\u0027t think Kerbals can flap two canards fast enough to make it to the south pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.52a: Corrected an erroneous message that was thrown by unrelated mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod already verified entries of the save game and initialized them to default values if they were missing or invalid, which would happen any time the save game was manually modified by a player or a program, or after a patch that added new things. This would prevent crashing, but not weird little glitches, which would occur until the game naturally generated new missions, or until you refreshed the board manually. Now, whenever the mod detects one of these, it will automatically refresh the board for you. This means that any active contracts will be cleared sometimes after a patch, but it also means that you will not be experiencing these glitches. Please complete any active contracts that you care about before patching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded new logic to control when contracts are handed out on the board. Asteroid Retrieval, Station Building, and Base Building can now only have two contracts out at any given time, and you will not receive duplicate missions to build or retrieve the same things in the same locations, to prevent contract stacking. Aerial and Rover missions can have four active and two on the board. New contract types are coming soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EState tracking has been vastly improved across the board. You should no longer have missions randomly completing on their own. This makes station and asteroid missions much more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsteroid contracts were overhauled. The tracking on \u0022new\u0022 asteroids is now much more solid, you will be asked to retrieve a specific classification of asteroid, and you will receive feedback messages every time you claw an asteroid to let you know what the agency thinks about your choice of asteroid. The classification request also applies to the rare station side objective, so you may be asked to build your station into a Class E for that Death Star look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tracking station now shows waypoints for all current contracts, including ones you have not accepted. This gives you an opportunity to check out where a contract is going to take you before accepting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaypoints were not evenly distributed over the surface of a planet, due to the geometry of a sphere, there is much less distance per latitude near the poles than there is at the equator, causing the generator to put more waypoints on the poles than intended. This has been fixed, and waypoints now spawn uniformly over the planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoved default values of infinity from any variables, as it was rarely causing terrible things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed a typo that resulted in aerial missions only spawning above land on planets with water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETightened up higher difficulty aerial waypoint ranges slightly. Rewards remain the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Navigation activated\u0022 and \u0022navigation deactivated\u0022 messages were reversed, causing some confusion as to what was happening with navigation waypoints. This has been alleviated, and our previous navigations engineer was tied to a Class D asteroid and thrown at the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERover waypoint ranges can now be reduced (or increased) by the gravity of the target planet. The ranges from last patch apply to Kerbin, and can go as low as half of what they are now depending on how low the gravity gets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsteroid Retrieval rewards were increased by a significant amount. Station and Base rewards were increased slightly, and made more malleable by their side objectives, meaning having to integrate a research lab will boost science gains, integrating a cupola will boost reputation gains, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to thank everyone that has been giving me feedback and reports. It\u0027s really helping build this into a decent mod. I will continue to listen and implement as many of your thoughts as I can, so keep on submitting them to my thread. Perhaps we can drop the \u0022a\u0022 off the version soon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded orbital waypoints that show a ring and are animated to show you which direction the orbit goes. These show up in the tracking station for all currently posted contracts, and in game on the map for any that you\u0027ve accepted, just like normal waypoints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded satellite deployment contracts. They do not show up until you have technology for probe cores, power sources, and antennae. These contracts will ask you to build a new unmanned probe with an antenna and a power source, then put it into a very specific orbit, shown on the map with the new waypoints. The mission will ask you to put it into a certain deviation of the orbit shown, and the deviation gets smaller as the difficulty goes up. You need to match everything: apoapsis, periapsis, inclination, eccentricity, the whole nine yards. The orbits also get less kosher as the difficulty goes up, more eccentric and inclined, and the burns required to hit that deviation window are very minute. It\u0027s challenging, but the pay goes up as well. This mission type prefers Kerbin, but can go to other planets as well, especially at higher difficulties. On Kerbin, the reputation and fund rewards are tripled, but the science is cut to a third. This is to emulate a commercial space program on Kerbin putting up satellites for clients. That doesn\u0027t mean it will pay as well as putting a satellite around Moho, it just means it will be comparable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded new \u0022neutralize controls for a period of time\u0022 objective. This objective requires you to cut your throttle, and turn off any controls, such as RCS or SAS for a certain period of time. This was added to asteroid recovery missions, base building missions, station building missions, and satellite deployment missions to prevent the mission from completing before the situation has...stabilized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdjusted the way that distance calculations to waypoints are calculated, specifically in regards to altitude. For aerial waypoints this means that you can now fly anywhere within the height envelope shown on the contract and still complete them. For rover contracts, it means that if a waypoint spawns at an odd height, it doesn\u0027t matter, as you just need to drive to the general area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrastically reduced the distance required to trigger rover waypoints. This was made possible by the previous change, and means that you now have to actually drive around within a rover cluster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed the cupola objective plaguing some station missions, a big thanks to Burkitt for helping me track this issue down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApplied vigorous OCD to the usage of the word \u0022the\u0022 before the words \u0022Sun\u0022 or \u0022Mun\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERewrote cupola parameter to be more generic and now look for any specific part on a vessel, this allows me to use it for cupolas, or sensors, which I used in the satellite missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed rover contracts taking over the contract board occasionally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight and rover waypoints will no longer appear in the tracking station when their contracts have been completed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed random satellite deployment orbits extending beyond the sphere of influence of their planets, thus having impossible to reach orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded much more constrained orbits to the satellite deployment mission, which now includes random orbits, in addition to equatorial orbits, polar orbits, geosynchronous orbits, geostationary orbits, Molniya orbits, and tundra orbits. These are given out at appropriate difficulty levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the aforementioned cupola change, satellite missions can now request part additions to the satellites. Harder missions have a higher chance to ask for this, and for now it includes any sensor type and the goo, as the goo is reminiscent of our fine frisky Russian gecko satellite friends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESatellite missions will pay more as they get harder, they pay more based on location, they pay more based on how many parts they ask for, and what kind of orbit they ask you to deploy into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERemoved references to \u0022geo\u0022stationary and \u0022geo\u0022synchronous orbits of anything other than Kerbin.

This lets users balance each contract\u0027s functionality and rewards in a highly customizable fashion. The inputs are sanitized and if you choose an input that is invalid, it will choose a default value for you, so for the most part it is unbreakable. Do note however, that this level of control can allow you to create some weird behavior if you choose to do so.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDue to the changes required for configuration, there was a full balance pass. You will notice that rewards in general have changed significantly, generally in the upwards direction. I did get second opinions on the balance pass, but as always, your opinion may vary. If this is the case, I encourage you to play with the balance by using the configuration file and let me know if you find something better on the official thread. If people find a more agreeable setting, I will incorporate it as default in future versions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded In Situ Resource Utilization contracts (resource harvesting). Because these contracts require other mods, these contracts are disabled by default. To enable them, open the configuration, go to the \u0022ISRU\u0022 section, and change \u0022MaximumExistent\u0022 to something other than 0. I recommend 2. This section also allows you to customize what type of resource you want to harvest, and what technology unlocks cause the contract to start showing up. By default this is set up to utilize the Karbonite mod, but you can set it up to use any resource mod you want (Kethane, Extraplanetary Launchpads, etc). You can even set it up here to be able to use multiple resource types, if you change \u0022Karbonite\u0022 to \u0022Karbonite,Kethane,Metal,Water\u0022 etc. You can also forbid certain planets or celestial bodies from being the target of this contract.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EISRU contracts will ask you to extract a certain amount of material from a certain location. Sometimes the contract ends there, but frequently you will also be asked to transport that material to a nearby location. Most of the time this will be planet to moon, or moon to planet. Delivery raises the rewards greatly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EChanged how the patch reset works. It now only targets my contracts, rather than all contracts. Stock contracts and contracts added by other mods are no longer affected. It is also not not automatic, but rather, manually set by me in the configuration file if I feel like one is necessary. This gives the user a chance to opt out of the patch reset by changing PatchReset to False immediately after patching. This can cause undefined behavior, so I do not recommend it, but it is available if you wish to use it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded low altitude contracts.

These contracts still have a cluster of waypoints, but the waypoints each ask you to do an experiment on the ground, at low altitude, or at high altitude. These restrictions are very loose, and there are no restrictions on the player\u0027s vessel. This gives the player much more freedom in deciding how to approach each objective. High altitude waypoints can even be passed over in orbit if desired. Each waypoint might be at a different altitude, with a different experiment - even within the same contract, though generally the surveys are themed. Right now there are five \u0022themes\u0022: temperature scans, visual surveys (crew reports, EVAs, surface samples), gravimetric scans, seismic scans, and atmospheric surveys, which include atmospheric analysis and pressure readings. Certain themes can only happen at certain altitudes, so atmospheric surveys are very similar to aerial surveys, and seismic surveys are very similar to rover contracts. Each objective completes the moment you initiate an experiment in the correct location. You are not required to transmit it, giving you the option of keeping the data and returning it to Kerbin. Overall, the system is much more robust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u0022Neutralize Controls\u0022 objective relaxed significantly.
