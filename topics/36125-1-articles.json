If your empty game object is off-center, you can re-center it before importing your object by zeroing the values in Unity. If your object is not zero coming from Blender, it may be offset, but showing \u00220\u0022 in the translation, rotate, and scale info boxes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I saw an older post from a few days ago in another thread, if you haven\u0027t figured it out yet, the way I do colliders is to export the collider from 3d program as a separate object, then set as child of main object in unity. Add a mesh collider, tick convex, and turn off mesh rendering to hide it from view. You can also remove the animation component from the collider if it is not animated itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
