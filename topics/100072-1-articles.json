That being said, your landing must mean the craft survives to the point of being reused. So no losing half of the plane and calling success. You must be capable of taking off again after landing, not that you have to take off but you must have the ability. There is to be no use of the debug for this challenge with the exception of clipping parts for those I know like to get fancy with their design, but no infinite fuel, hacked gravity, indestructible joints, etc. This challenge is considered quite simple in design to complete but can be incredibly difficult when going for particular titles such as:\n\n- Fastest Time\n- Smallest Craft(Parts)\n- Lightest Craft(weight)\n- Largest Craft(Parts)\n- Heaviest Craft(weight)\n- Flawless Completion(nothing broke)\n- Lowest Altitude\n\nNow on a quick note, the Lowest Altitude Title can be achieved by flying as low to the waters surface as possible. To achieve this simply take a screenshot in flight as proof at the altitude. Now being as you can go as low as 1 before hitting the water and breaking apart all those who achieve this will be put into the category together once they hit that magical number.\n\nQuick recap of the rules:\n\n- No debug(unless clipping parts)\n- No mods that essentially control altitude or fly your craft for you.\n- and thats it\n\n**Mods may be used** just list what mods were involved in your craft and modded craft will be put into their own category. \\*Also as long as the mod has no control over the flight, ex: autopilot mods.
