Basically, stick a few quick-firing autocannons or pulsed laser emitters mounted on a turret, designed to shoot down any incoming projectiles and/or ships that comes within range. Trying to get through this kind of defense would require either lasers, particle cannons, huge swarms of ASATs, or a big, armored space battleship, like the Orion example posted. The first two can be countered by ablative armor (can be made lighter than solid, anti-kinetic armor) and ship-generated magnetic fields (strength depends of available power, only works against charged particles, neutral particles are unaffected), respectively, while the latter two are quite expensive in terms of material.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, if there\u0027s something worth defending in space that can\u0027t be easily replaced, it would probably have CIWS.

This kind of battle would take hours, but it\u0027s doable since at theses kinds of ranges you would have to take into account relativity as well as your opponent\u0027s speed. I see the possibility for ships to target one another first with passive systems such as a radio-telescope fine tuned to detect ships and then for sighting the target for laser fire 3 telescopes could be used, then finally onboard computers could generate a firing solution for pinpoint accuracy using the 3 telescopes to trigonometrically deduce target location, heading, speed and distance.
