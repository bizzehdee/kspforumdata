Burn retrograde at periapsis until you are no longer on escape trajectory, then dip your periapsis just into the top of the atmosphere. Over time your orbit will decay. Wait until its at the level you want and then circularize at your desired apoapsis.

Just don\u0027t risk your Kerbals ending grilled and do it the much safer and, if you\u0027re planning your maneuver well, even less fuel-costly way by performing a Gravity Capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a reverse gravity assist which will send you from your interplanetary course onto a elliptic Joolean orbit for free, achieved by a Swing-By on a moon. You want to use Tylo for this when going to Jool though it should also work with Laythe and Vall. This also works fine with the Mun when returning, as well as Ike, only Gilly will be quite useless and Eve stay challenging. An advantage is, that, as you are not doing anything inside an Atmosphere, you can pre-calculate your way exactly when still in Kerbin orbit using maneuver nodes, though not quite neccessary.

I would still recommend the new radial drouge chutes for laythe/kerbin entry, if you wanna fly on after re-entering, don\u0027t forget to bind \u0022cut parachute\u0022 to an action group if you use several and simply press that button when at about 10 000 - 15 000m.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
