Obviously the most dV-efficient solution is to intercept at the periapsis of ellipse, but that requires a specific, narrow launch window. If you can make it into orbit with enough dV available to the rescue craft, you can drag the navigation node along your orbit to easily find intercept solutions at any point in time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen once you intercept within a few kilometers it\u0027s simple to gradually kill relative velocity until you\u0027re in matched orbits and a few meters apart.
