Will it share the same design or will we have a new planet to explore? Though I am in favor of both options (a new Kerbin could offer a vastly more interesting world to explore- but I am attached to Kerbin1 for reasons I\u0027m about to explain). I have been part of many external Kerbin nation roleplays (of which I will not discuss) so I\u0027ve become fond of the planet in it\u0027s current design (Kafrica... what a wonderful place). And what of the other planet\u0027s and moons? Are we getting an expansion to the planets or a full overhaul? Both sound cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what is the dev\u0027s current thoughts on planet design?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeparately I\u0027d like to suggest the idea of adding caves, tunnels- and that water isn\u0027t always 0m. Because of that design choice in KSP1, waterfalls, rivers and literally any water based geological features were impossible- but with varying altitudes of water- that can be solved. Besides you can\u0027t mention colonies (especially not making them the focal point!) and not address the ideas of using the moon\u0027s and Mars\u0027 lava tubes to make shelters and underground colonies!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust one of many ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-26T04:37:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope it\u0027s between the two.
