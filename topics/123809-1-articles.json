If you get a blowup, add more radiators. I\u0027m guessing your 7 consist of one in the middle with six around it in sixfold symmetry? If I had to guess, I\u0027d say putting on 6 of the medium radiators (the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eactive\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E foldable/unfoldable ones, not the static panels) would probably be plenty.

They are currently very slow at ramping up after being turned on. However, once they are turned on, you can still throttle them effortlessly between zero and maximum power, so there\u0027s literally no downside to just keeping them on forever. Therefore, just timewarp a bit before setting up a burn, until the reactor has completed its initial startup procedure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Actually throttle the thing up. When coming fresh out of the VAB, the reactor is set to 50% throttle, exactly like engines are. If you never touch the power setting, you\u0027ll only get half the rated performance even after the reactor has finished spooling up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Provide sufficient cooling through active radiators (Thermal Control Systems in stock KSP, or suitable mod parts). An insufficiently cooled reactor will overheat and lose more and more power output the higher the heat level grows. Each reactor lists a recommended radiator setup in its description, but keep in mind that some of the very large electric engines also produce large amounts of heat. This can cause reactors to start overheating a few minutes into the burn if you didn\u0027t bring enough radiator capacity for both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you checked off all those points and still don\u0027t get the output you expect, please come on over to the Near Future thread with some screenshots and we\u0027ll suss it out for you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(Reactor and heat behavior subject to change in future versions as the stock heat system evolves.)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-27T08:25:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2015 08:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climentina","CreatedById":152399,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T09:44:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Euse can use alt\u002B\u0026gt; to open the physics accelaration, if you think the argon engine takes 4ever\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xuixien","CreatedById":149208,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T18:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the help everyone!
