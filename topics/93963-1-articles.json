Maybe someday the other classes will have more benefits at higher levels but for now, this is all we need to worry about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E2. Amount of KXP\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to level 3 requires 16 KXP, and it\u0027s 32 for level 4. Because KXP per planet doesn\u0027t stack (Kerbals only earn up to the highest single value for the planet), the most KXP a Kerbal can earn within the Kerbin system is 13: 2 for orbiting Kerbin, 5 for planting a flag on Mun, and 6 for planting a flag on Minmus. This will only get them to level 2, although they don\u0027t need much more for level 3. In fact, if they just poke their heads out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI and come right back, they\u0027ll get another 6 KXP, which will do the trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E3. Earning KXP\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main catch with KXP seems to be that KXP earned during a mission only takes effect after the Kerbal is recovered on Kerbin. Apparently they have to be debriefed. Which I suppose is necessary to prevent sending rookies to Laythe and have them arrive there as level 4 (2 orbit Kerbin, 6 orbit Kerbol, 9 orbit Jool, 20 plant flag on Laythe).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E4. Benefits of KXP\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t find Pilot experience \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ethat\u003C/span\u003E at all useful. Even a rookie pilot can use SAS, which is pretty much all I pay them for. I suppose the ability to hold the ship pointing various directions is technically useful but I\u0027ve never had that ability before 0.90 and have been flying along just fine without it. So I would say you don\u0027t need to worry about leveling up pilots at all. In fact, you shouldn\u0027t recruit any. You get 2 to start with, both of which become superfluous the moment you have the OKTO core, and that will almost certainly be long before you land on Mun the 1st time. So send your scientist to Mun with a probe core so you can get more science for the trip, instead of having to build a 2-seat rocket with low-tech parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s very different with Engineers \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eand Scientists\u003C/span\u003E. All the Engineer abilities are useful, almost essential for mission safety, and the one mostly to be used (repairing wheels) is the last trick they learn, so there\u0027s a real incentive to get them to level 3 ASAP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EAnd the science point buff of the Scientist only becomes significant at higher levels, but by then he\u0027s going to places with high location multipliers so it\u0027s of real benefit then. Also, a maxed-out Scientist in a Mobile Lab can transmit 75% of the return value of any experiment, which could be useful at times. So again, it seems desirable to get the Scientists leveled up as much as possible.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(NEW)\u003C/strong\u003E Scientists fall somewhere between pilots and engineers in usefulness. They\u0027re useful, in a limited way, right up until the tech tree ends, at which point they become nearly redundant. They\u0027re only continuing practical value after that is in that you can get a small amount of extra cash out of them by using a strategy that converts most of your now-unnecessary science points to funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is thus little reason to have more than the 1 scientist you start with, and no real incentive to waste fuel leveling him up. The main benefit of a scientist, which all 0-level rookies can do, is resetting Goo and Material experiments. So now you can build a biome-hopper with just 1 of each for a smaller, cheaper ship, and no longer need to waste time or fuel returning to a Mobile Processing Lab to reset these experiments. This easily enables totally pillaging Minmus a couple mission with small, cheap landers, and the points from that will amount to about 1/2 of the tech tree\u0027s total value. Then you can do the same on Mun in 1 or 2 trips with a slightly more expensive ship and be done with the whole thing, and also any further need for scientists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, scientists also let you get a little more science per mission but at low levels, their buffs to earned science points are not large enough to make any real difference except on the 1st couple tiers of the tech tree where nodes are cheap. Beyond that, having a scientist on the mission or not will not make or break being able to unlock 1 more node afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 1.x, scientists can now also generate extra science points by processing data in the Mobile Processing Lab. However, at low levels, the processing takes the better part of a year and then only results in far less science than you could have gotten in far less time doing conventional science return missions. With a couple of low-level scientists you are, in effect, trading money (in the form of savings from NOT doing the conventional missions) for large amounts of elapsed game time. If you try to speed the processing up, you waste the money you would otherwise save because you have to hire/rescue a bunch more scientists, send them on missions to level them up, and then build a big lab complex for them to work in. And then, when all that science does come in and unlocks the rest of the tech tree, you now have a bunch of useless scientists and a big useless lab complex. So I consider the feature, in its current form, a complete waste of your time and money, especially given the ability of 0-level scientists to reset experiments. \u003Cstrong\u003E(NEW)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E5.

Try to tweek orbit for mun intercept, burn just enough fuel ot achieve orbit instead of flyby and turn back around and head to kerbin. 2k would be tight but might be possible 2500 should be relitively safe. probably wouldnt be too difficult to make a flying tourbus out of hitchhikers, a command pod, some 2.5 fuel tanks and a poodle.

One of today\u0027s contracts involved creating a 5-man base on Mun, with only the bare minimum of parts (no wheels, no lab, no specific science gear). So, I took my light SSTO spaceplane, replaced its 3-ton probe\u002Bcargo bay with a 2-ton crew pod, stuck some landing legs/antenna/docking port on it, and sent it to Mun (after refueling in LKO). Not only did this complete a very lucrative contract for me, it also let me train five rookie crewmen up to level 2. I can do the same again later, going to Minmus with a quick detour outside the SOI, and that\u0027ll put them all at level 3.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T12:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, a maxed-out Scientist in a Mobile Lab can transmit 75% of the return value of any experiment, which could be useful at times.
