When I started to really use Remote Tech, I became tired of all the \u0022napkin math\u0022 I was doing to figure out the correct orbit elements needed to place my satellites where I wanted them, so I created said Python tool. This tool unfortunately was using hard-coded information from the wiki for the planets\u0027 physical and orbit characteristics, so if Squad were to make any changes to the planets, I wanted to play a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E scaled version of the game, or I wanted to add planets such as those from Outer Planets Mod, I would need to manually make these changes.\n\nI wrote this plugin to solve the above issues, and also to be a good way to learn modding for KSP. This not only is my first mod in KSP, it is also my first time dealing with Unity and first real project in C# (more familiar with Java and Python). Although I wrote this mostly for my personal use, I release it to the public in case anyone finds it as useful as I do.\n\n**Instructions for the orbit calculator**\n\nYou can access the calculator by clicking the AppLauncher icon (or Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar icon) with the image of \u0022SOC\u0022.\n\n1. Select the celestial body on the left.\n2. To the right of the celestial bodies, select two orbital elements (you cannot select both semi-major axis and orbital period; it would create an ambiguous case). The other elements will be disabled from input at this point.\n3. As an option, you can use either apoapsis/periapsis as altitudes above sea level of parent body or as distances from the center of the parent body. Just toggle the *Use Altitudes for Apsides* option near the bottom under Options.\n4. Enter your target values. The *S* button on the same row of the orbital period will set the orbital period to the parent body\u0027s rotation period (useful for synchronous orbits).\n5. Click the *Calculate* button, which will fill in the other elements and display below more in-depth information of the calculated orbit. Any errors will be reported.\n6. Optionally, if you are currently in a flight scene, you can click the *Use Current Orbit* button to use your current orbit or click the *Use Target Orbit* to use your target\u0027s orbit.\n\nBecause the calculation will fill in other elements that you did not choose, you will be free to use those easily in other calculations. Just de-select the elements you do not need, and select the new ones. This is very useful for calculating Hohmann transfers.\n\n**Instructions for the Hohmann transfer calculator**\n\n1. Once you have calculated an orbit above, click either Save as Orbit 1 or Save as Orbit 2.\n2. When two orbits are saved that have the same parent body, the delta-v for the transfer will be calculated and displayed below.\n3. Click the C buttons to clear their respective orbits.\n\n**Instructions for the info mode**\n\n1. Select the celestial body on the left.\n2. Toggle on *Celestial Body Info Mode* from the options on the right.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/fSUT7)\n\n**Current Features**\n\n- Will automatically detect all celestial bodies known to KSP and their properties, including changes/additions by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E or Planet Factory like mods.\n- Allowed inputs include: Apoapsis, Periapsis, Semi-Major Axis, Eccentricity, Orbital Period.\n- Other information displayed after calculation: Orbital Speeds at Apoapsis and Periapsis, Mean Orbital Speed, Launch Delta-V (the minimum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E required to launch to or land from the orbit), Max Darkness Length (useful for Remote Tech satellite electric charge calculations).\n- Can use your current vessel\u0027s or target\u0027s orbit as input.\n- Can save two orbits to calculate the delta-v required for a Hohmann transfer.\n- Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar support.\n- Celestial Body Info mode will display orbit and physical characteristics of the selected body, similar to that found on a wiki page.\n\n**Upcoming Features**\n\n- A better UI! (I\u0027m still getting the hang of Unity scripting, so please forgive the current state of the UI).\n- Possibly more input values.\n- Ability to save orbits for re-use across saves/installs.\n\n**Thanks**\n\nMuch thanks to Ferram, MOARdV and stupid\\_chris, whose source code on various projects helped me work out the AppLauncher code for the plugin.\n\n**Links**\n\n[Download from GitHub](https://github.com/stevehead/ksp-SimpleOrbitCalculator/releases)\n\n[Source Code on GitHub](https://github.com/stevehead/ksp-SimpleOrbitCalculator)\n\n**\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E**\n\nLatest build not added to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E yet\n\n    ckan.exe install SimpleOrbitCalculator\n\n**Changelog**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E v1.5.0  \n\u003E \n\u003E - The revival of SOC!  \n\u003E \n\u003E - KSP 1.2.2 compatibility update.

There are so many variables to consider such as gravity loses due to various TWR, how steep or shallow your ascent is, how aerodynamic your spacecraft is for atmospheric launches. It would be best to just check out one of the delta-v charts people have made (e.g. [stock scale and aerodynamics](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png)). Say for example, I wanted to launch into a 500km x 500km orbit around Kerbin, I know I would need ~4500 m/s to get into a 80km parking orbit; using my calculator, I can figure I need about 480 m/s to transfer from the 80km to 500km orbit with circularization; so worst case scenario, I would need about 5 km/s to get into the 500x500 orbit, but I also know it would be more efficient to launch directly into the 500km without getting into the 80km parking orbit first.\n\nMy next goal is to have the calculator automatically calculate the delta-v between the two orbits. Right now, that can be manually done by using the periapsis and apoapsis speeds that my calculator outputs, but requires three separate orbits calculated (the original orbit, the Hohmann transfer orbit, and the final orbit) and some \u0022napkin math\u0022.\n\nEdit: Also, I would like the mod to have the ability to use your current active vessel\u0027s or target\u0027s orbit in the delta-v calculations.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T00:33:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 12:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stevehead**"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T01:57:58Z","Content":"Ah! - could have used this earlier today ... for Remote Tech orbit calcs.
