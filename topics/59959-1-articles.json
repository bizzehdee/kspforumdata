It uses an upper-stage (Fregat, Briz-M or the Ariane EPS/ESC) as a tug to take it from LEO to GEO. These tugs go up with the payload, are relatively light, and standardized to reduce production cost. Once they have done their job, they are jettisoned and that\u0027s it. For example, the Ariane EPS weighs 1.25 t empty and carries 9 tons of propellant to put two comsats into GEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you wanted to reuse one of these as a reusable tug, you want need to add some sort of standard docking interface, RCS, and a more complex avionics package, similar to the ATV for example. You would also need to bring it back to LEO for the next mission, which means that it would need twice the delta-v, and therefore over 2.5 times the propellant to do the same job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to refuel it between two jobs, you would need to send up a tanker with 25 tons of propellant to refuel your 1.25t tug. However, your tanker itself needs propulsion, docking hardware, avionics and attitude control, to be able to dock with the tug, so basically it will be quite similar to an expendable upper stage itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo your reusable tug saves you 10 tons on the comsat launch. However, it requires a separate 25 ton to launch the reusable tug, and another 25 ton launch to refuel it for each mission. In addition, your comsat still needs attitude control, propulsion, and docking hardware to be able to rendez-vous with the tug. You\u0027ve also introduced a lot of mission complexity, mission control work, and lots of possible failure modes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T16:40:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, and ULA has a proposal to develop the ACES upper stage into a tug/fuel depot infrastructure, which is cool.
