Antimatter is essentially just regular matter, but in an opposite state. Negative matter behaves very, very differently from regular matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing about negative mass is that it reacts oppositely to applied forces from normal mass. In other words, If I try to push on a piece of negative matter, it will try to fly \u003Cem\u003Eback into\u003C/em\u003E my hand. If you were to launch a piece of negative matter into a wall, it would\u003Cem\u003E accelerate\u003C/em\u003E towards the wall (And most probably destroy it.) Therefore, to safely hold a piece of negative mass, you would need some kind of magnetic box that can apply forces in whatever direction is needed to keep it still inside the box.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for the diagram. The purple ball represents a negative mass. The little hook on the bottom represents a magnetic \u0022trap\u0022 that can hold the negative mass on the wheel (or else it would fly off into space if it hit the physical top or bottom of the trap). However, the box only applies forces in the up or down direction, allowing the mass to be pushed to the left side of the trap. Since the negative mass applies force in the opposite direction as the force being applied to it, it continues to push to the left, applying ever-increasing force and causing the wheel to turn. If you don\u0027t attach some kind of generator to the center of the wheel to disperse the ever-building momentum, the device will eventually tear itself apart due to centrifugal forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I explain it good enough?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the OP, we don\u0027t build an energyless flight-to-orbit system because we don\u0027t actually \u003Cem\u003Ehave \u003C/em\u003Eany negative mass.

Antimatter is essentially just regular matter, but in an opposite state. Negative matter behaves very, very differently from regular matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing about negative mass is that it reacts oppositely to applied forces from normal mass. In other words, If I try to push on a piece of negative matter, it will try to fly \u003Cem\u003Eback into\u003C/em\u003E my hand. If you were to launch a piece of negative matter into a wall, it would\u003Cem\u003E accelerate\u003C/em\u003E towards the wall (And most probably destroy it.) Therefore, to safely hold a piece of negative mass, you would need some kind of magnetic box that can apply forces in whatever direction is needed to keep it still inside the box.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for the diagram. The purple ball represents a negative mass. The little hook on the bottom represents a magnetic \u0022trap\u0022 that can hold the negative mass on the wheel (or else it would fly off into space if it hit the physical top or bottom of the trap). However, the box only applies forces in the up or down direction, allowing the mass to be pushed to the left side of the trap. Since the negative mass applies force in the opposite direction as the force being applied to it, it continues to push to the left, applying ever-increasing force and causing the wheel to turn. If you don\u0027t attach some kind of generator to the center of the wheel to disperse the ever-building momentum, the device will eventually tear itself apart due to centrifugal forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I explain it good enough?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the OP, we don\u0027t build an energyless flight-to-orbit system because we don\u0027t actually \u003Cem\u003Ehave \u003C/em\u003Eany negative mass.
