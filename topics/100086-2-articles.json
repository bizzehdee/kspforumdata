A thankless task, but somebody has to do it. And if I have to do it, you get to hear about it. Also, I\u0027ll introduce the Duna mission crew as I go along in this episode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn episode 1, we got the Duna Base payload boosted into orbit and mated with its Big Advanced Nuclear Tug, BANT 1. There was also a little refueling going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis episode I\u0027m starting with some Double BANT Adapters, which are used to tie two Tugs together into one ship. I do this to cut down the number of ships that have to be handled separately during the transfer of the armada between planets. I previously launched this kind of adapter oriented horizontally, with the parts hanging out in the breeze, but in the spirit of this mission (\u0022try to make payloads that would fit inside launch fairings\u0022) two of the adapters were oriented with their long axes along the longitudinal axis of the rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gT9YEzr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gT9YEzr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese adapters contain fuel (since the old-style Reusable Rocket had the lift capacity anyway) and a probe core and reaction wheels so the adapters can be oriented for easy docking. They do not have propulsion built in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q3AYQQq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Q3AYQQq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in orbit, the adapters were separated from the core (they were attached by Standard docking ports on their center tanks, and with struts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4nj9Y3l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224nj9Y3l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn\u0027t clear how the long boom on the front would affect the stability of the sustainer stage when it was returned to KSC, so the sustainer\u0027s parachutes were used to augment the engine during landing...which was successful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JgwQROv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JgwQROv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA double adapter, of course, requires a couple Tugs. So the next two launches (which I\u0027m scheduling roughly two weeks apart) were of the Kerbodyne Launch Consortium\u0027s BARR lifter, each with a Big Advanced Nuclear Tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EcaOslO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EcaOslO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tugs were each docked to the adapter in turn. Ooops...I see that while being very careful to align the Tugs so that they fit well, I cleverly faced both of their high gain antennas inward toward each other. Well, at least there will be excellent communication between the two Tugs. And their payloads will have high gain antennas, so it really doesn\u0027t matter (not that the antennas really matter anyway, but I like to consider such details in a cursory way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lm13T03.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lm13T03.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6Go95Ce.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226Go95Ce.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next payload lofted is an important one indeed (next image below). The stack fits within the 6-meter diameter I\u0027m imposing with the BARR lifter. From the top down, below the aerodynamic nose cone we have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Standard-to-Senior Port Adapter Mini-Tug (hiding in the shadow of the nose cone). This can be docked to one of the BANTs (which all have Senior ports) in case the Nuclear Tug is needed to haul around a ship with only Standard docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Interplanetary Transfer Habitat, with a 2-kerbal control cabin, and two Hitchhiker modules -- designed to comfortably house a crew of four for trips between planets. One of the Hitchhikers is surrounded by fuel tanks to provide a \u0022radiation cellar\u0022 to shelter the kerbals in case of any gigantic Kerbol-flares -- and the sleeping quarters are in there for general protection against cosmic rays (we don\u0027t want our four kerbals suddenly developing super powers...that would be too fantastic).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Duna Space Stations compact core. This has one Hitchhiker module, two large RCS storage tanks, and two tiers of interdigitated docking ports...Standard and Senior. Large fuel tanks from the BANTs (which have docking ports at both ends) will be docked to the Senior ports once in Duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Communication Satellites (4) surround the Station core. These will be deployed in Duna orbit. Again...I don\u0027t mess with the details of a communications mod, but I like to have a reasonable number of comsats in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Gas Station module that can be landed on the surface of Duna wherever it may be needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2IQdpjC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222IQdpjC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y8v0dVO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022y8v0dVO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: After dumping the Duna Station payload into orbit, the BARR\u0027s sustainer was deorbited for landing at KSC. Then the Double-Tug maneuvered to intercept the Duna Station payload and dock it to one of the double-adapter ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/agblTob.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022agblTob.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next payload launched was the Duna Landers ship, although it also has another Interplanetary Transfer Habitat (so that all eight of the Duna crew members can be on the same Double-Tug ship). The Landers will serve as reusable transportation between Duna orbit and the surface. They also will serve as exploration hab/lab outposts that can be hopped to various locations on Duna in support of rover exploration teams. All this is enclosed in a 6.5 meter fairing (you can see it if you squint really hard with your imagination).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OpxLhsj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OpxLhsj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are a few random pics from the flight: Separation of the \u0027recoverable\u0027 boosters just before turnover; separation of the payload into orbit; return of the sustainer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aufX3Ek.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aufX3Ek.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, the Duna Landers payload was \u003Cstrong\u003E NOT\u003C/strong\u003E docked with the Double-Tug. It did not seem efficient to try to maneuver the currently-unbalanced Double-Tug around...so another workhorse was called into action (which was going to be needed for multiple jobs). There was a old-style (2.5 meter) Double-Tug named \u0022SP Tug A\u0022 that had previously been used to haul a spaceplane to Laythe...after which it was returned to Kerbin. It was mostly empty of fuel, so the next launch in this mission was by an old Reusable Rocket with a Tug Refueler payload (this launch was subcontracted by Kerbodyne to the Rockomax Launch Alliance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ou4dgjl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ou4dgjl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tug Refueler rendezvoused and docked with SP Tug A, and then transferred almost all of its fuel to the Tug (which was still not fully refueled at this point). The Refueler saved a little bit of fuel for its deorbit burn...but it turned out to be not enough, so I had to complete the deorbit burn using RCS. Then the Refueler successfully landed at KSC, ready for re-use, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eVtv9ka.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eVtv9ka.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe partially refueled SP Tug A then headed off to rendezvous with the Duna Landers payload, docked with it, then tugged it over for a rendezvous with the Double-BANT Tugs. Good little tug! Have a cookie!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kJE6cZZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kJE6cZZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen our plucky tug lined up the Duna Landers payload with a Double-BANT docking port, and then separated from the payload and moved off to the side. The Double-BANT then eased forward to dock with the Duna Landers payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eE89FoV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eE89FoV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, its current mission completed, SP Tug A fired its engines to move off to a safe orbit. Note that the Double-BANT ship is still not quite ready to go to Duna -- you may recall from last episode that the BANTs are launched with less-than-full rear tanks (because of the payload capacity of the BARR), so some topping off of the tanks is going to be needed. Also, a couple tons of fuel was transferred from one of the Rockomax X200-8 fuel tanks of the double-adapter (the one under the Landers payload) into the two Tugs to balance the masses of the payloads. The adapter structure connecting the two Tugs may look kind of flimsy, but if the payload masses are balanced, the structure really doesn\u0027t do much except keep the Tugs in lockstep, so the structure is sufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u9akETY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022u9akETY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ECrew Casting 1\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut let\u0027s leave the rest of the payload launches for later while we meet some of our Duna Mission Crew. The Mission Commander is \u003Cstrong\u003E Thompbles Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E (first kerbal to land on Bop; first Commander of Minmus Base; Commander of the Laythe Expedition; circumnavigated Pol). Let\u0027s eavesdrop on the conversation he\u0027s having with Bill Kerman in the KSC Astronaut Complex:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ekKS3CI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ekKS3CI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Bill, I want to talk to you about our launch dates...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Yes, yes...I know. You had the launch dates scheduled for months ahead of time...but Jebediah\u0027s new mission to Eve has an earlier transfer window, so he needs some of them. You\u0027ll still have time if we bump yours down six weeks.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Barely. Assuming nothing goes wrong. Why the big rush about getting Desdin back from Eve, anyway? Can\u0027t it wait?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Oh, well...the whole Blutonium refining thing is apparently a bust. And the new Eve Return ship apparently has some problem with the 48-7S engines. Those were some of the first 48-7S engines off the line, and Rockomax says it may eventually be unsafe to use them at full thrust...so we want to use them while they\u0027re still good.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Fine. But Jeb\u0027s mission plan is inefficient. He doesn\u0027t need all those launches. Elon had his boys look over the plan, and they say it can be done with a lot fewer launches...especially the refueling launches.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Eh? It takes a lot of fuel to refill that Eve Lander after it boosts into orbit.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022I know. But look...at this modified plan. First, the Eve Lander itself doesn\u0027t need to use the main pad. It\u0027s designed as a stand-alone ship. We can prep it in the SPH and launch it from the runway.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FcXRtWx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FcXRtWx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Also, this is just a simple mission to pick up Desdin. Jeb doesn\u0027t need a new Hab ship launched for that...he can use one of the Hab ships from our Laythe expedition. Just grab it off from the Grey Havens Express. And all the Tugs he\u0027ll need are sitting in orbit.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Hmmm. Yes. But that will need consumables refilled...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Do it with flights of the Passenger Pigeon spaceplane. It\u0027s built to haul ten kerbals...just haul up the snacks and transfer air, water, and scrubbers.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022But what about all the fuel for the Eve Lander and the Tugs?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Use the stores we already have in orbit in the Space Station and the old Tanker Station 1.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022But that fuel is up there for contingency purposes...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022And this is the contingency we need it for. It\u0027s been sitting up there for years...it\u0027s time we used it. Elon says he\u0027ll provide rockets at discount prices to carry your replacement fuel up next year when there will be plenty of open launch dates.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Yes, it could work. But why don\u0027t YOU guys use the fuel in orbit instead of all these refueler flights you have scheduled?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Elon says that would be fine with him...but these refueler flights were subcontracted to Rockomax to keep them happy about Kerbodyne getting the bulk of the lift for this mission. I don\u0027t think you want to mess with that political can of worms.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Ah. Yes. OK, I\u0027ll talk to Jeb. I think we can do this.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch is the life of a Mission Commander. Also, there was a problem that the Space Station is somewhat old, and has no Senior Docking ports (it was built before those came out), so it would be difficult to refuel newer Tugs or the Eve Lander, which have Senior ports. But it turns out (below) that a Standard-to-Senior docking adapter can be mounted on the back of the Passenger Pigeon for upgrading the Space Station, so that problem was solved as well. So the Duna launches could keep to the original schedule (and I get to do my Eve Return mission before 48-7S engines get nerfed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E9r8Ies.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022E9r8Ies.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Deputy Commander for the Duna Mission, by the way, will be \u003Cstrong\u003E Adly Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E (Commander of the first Moho mission...where he got stranded in Kerbol orbit for years; visited Magic Boulder; only kerbal so far to RETURN from the surface of Eve; and, until recently, Commander of the Guardian Asteroid Redirect project).

We\u0027ll skip that picture and get on to the payloads. The next two launches had identical payloads: Two Fuel Stations (top and bottom) and two Fuel Fido rovers (in the middle). All of which fits inside the 6-meter limit...so you can picture the 6.5-meter fairings there, if you\u0027d like. Hopping all around Duna is going to require lots of fuel, and these Fuel Stations (and the orbiting Space Station) will provide that fuel. And the Fuel Fidos are how the fuel gets moved around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TjqtDvj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TjqtDvj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs before, the first Fuel Fido/Fuel Station stack was hunted down and grabbed by the second set of Double-BANTs...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1pbUXk1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221pbUXk1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the second Fuel Fido/Fuel Station stack was retrieved and tugged around by the plucky SP Tug A, which brought the payload to the Double-BANT, lined it up for docking, then separated and scooted itself off to the side so that the Double-BANT could slide in for the final docking (below).

Don\u0027t be a sore loser.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe overhead view shows that although these rovers use my favored eight-wheel design, they have be radically reshaped so that they can be part of a 6-meter diameter payload stack. I could have put my older, rectangular arrangement rovers in the 6-meter fairing by standing them up on end...but that didn\u0027t pack nearly as well. Below, the rovers can successfully traverse the crawler-way tracks...although Nelemy did blow a tire by driving too fast there. The Duna Fido has all those tanks, engines, parachutes, and RCS quads because its designed to be a \u0027hopper\u0027 as well as a rover, and can even fly from Duna surface to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/prEhsxz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022prEhsxz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe months of rover testing were very stressful to everyone at KSC...at least until Kurt and Nelemy got banned from driving around the buildings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YUkFH6Q.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YUkFH6Q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt proved to be a very skillful and relatively careful driver.

That bug (be it memory leak or whatever) really sucks the fun out of the game for me. But...I was looking forward to the next payload. First, some more crew...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ECrew Casting 3\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the Laythe Expedition, the real workhorse for exploring that moon was the BirdDog rover/plane. With the BirdDog (and its associated GasStations to refuel it), you could fly to areas of interest, rove around to explore the surface in detail, and fly off to a new spot when you got bored. The plane handled well and could reliably land in all sorts of Laythe terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut would aircraft be useful for exploring Duna, which lacks the substantial atmosphere and lovely, lovely oxygen of Laythe? Engineering studies were not promising. Rocket engines just don\u0027t give you much range. And landing is a nightmare. But Elon\u0027s boffins came up with something that just might work: The DunaDog rover/rocket-plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore we meet the plane, lets meet the pilots:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Aldner \u0022Buzz\u0022 Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E (second kerbal to land on Dres; first Minmus Base crew; BirdDog test pilot and primary BirdDog explorer of the Laythe Expedition; explored Tylo and Bop). Aldner is unusually popular with female kerbals who want celestial landmarks named after them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Emilynn \u0022Hawk\u0022 Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E (KSC flight instructor; Commander of the Vall Expedition; addition to Laythe Expedition; explored Bop and Pol). She was a female kerbalnaut back before it was cool to be one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the plane, two versions were designed. One was a tri-plane (bi-canard) version of the BirdDog with rocket motor and ion thruster power. The other was the same plane, but with a mono-wing of equivalent lift in a high aspect ratio, which was designed to fold up for transport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe high aspect ratio wing varient is something you\u0027d see in reality...Just like you can see fold-up wings in reality. Unfortunately, KSP does not provide us with fold-up wings...so I will be using the compact tri-plane version. Both designs performed the same in testing. Both float like butterflies in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hR1slLD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hR1slLD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe DunaDog has a downward-facing engine on its belly to assist with take off and landing. Horizontal landings MIGHT be attempted on Duna...but the DunaDog is equipped with a parachute-augmented vertical landing system, which is expected to be its primary mode of landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are some pictures of one of Aldner\u0027s test flights of the DunaDog prototype on Kerbin. The idea was to fly up above 8 km altitude where the air pressure on Kerbin is the same as the air pressure near Duna\u0027s surface, then see how the plane handled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Take off was at 38 meters per second. Rocket engine and four ions working good. I resisted buzzing the tower.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn (CAPCOM): \u0022Roger, Buzz. Good boy.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Climb rate ten. 50 meters per second airspeed. Altitude 400. A turbojet would sure improve this bird.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Roger. But it wouldn\u0027t be useful where we\u0027re going.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u00222500 meters. I\u0027m cutting the rocket engine. I\u0027ve used about half that fuel. Speed dropping. So slow.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: (14 minutes later) \u00224,400 meters. Still doing the big lazy spiral climb. Airspeed is increasing with altitude...but still so slow. If I got out and walked it might be faster than this.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022I doubt it. If you do a good job, we\u0027ll take up some K-38s later to satisfy your need for speed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: (35 minutes after takeoff) \u0022OK, Hawk...I\u0027m up over 8,000. Xenon down to 59%. The speed got up to a blazing 102 meters per second for a while there. Be still, my racing heart. I\u0027ll see how slow I can get this bird to fly.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ApjCfjV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ApjCfjV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappily, I spent less than 35 minutes flying the climb, since I was doing it at 2x physical time warp. The problem with landing horizontally on Duna is that the plane will need to be moving fairly fast to maintain lift...and tests had shown that the plane is very unstable rolling along at 80 m/s on the ground, and would likely flip out and crash. So Aldner was trying to \u0022land\u0022 as slowly as possible at the 8,000-meter level to see if the fears of the engineers were true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Whoa. OK, I stalled and she rolled. Falling now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Hang on to her, Buzz.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: (30 seconds later and 1,800 meters lower) \u0022OK. I\u0027ve got in a stable dive. Pulling up.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Roger. I knew we could count on you, Buzz.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Bottomed out at 6,000. Arrggh...now I have to do the slow climb again.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8XLkj5k.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228XLkj5k.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so the tests continued. Using the belly rocket engine during \u0022landings\u0022 at 8,000 meters looked promising...but you have to be careful, or pitching up can bleed off too much speed as the engine\u0027s jet points more forward. This led to another flip out...from which Aldner recovered only because he was high in the sky -- not something you\u0027d want to happen when you\u0027re trying to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner landed the DunaDog in the hills West of KSC, then did some roving tests. Like the BirdDog design, when the nose gear is raised, the two rover wheels at the front settle onto the ground and the plane makes a passable rover, reaching speeds of over 40 m/s on the drive back to the hanger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RI0ygjd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RI0ygjd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EPlacing Payloads 4\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoosting the DunaDog into Kerbin orbit proved to be a bit of a challenge. For the original BirdDog (and its later bi-wing Airedale variation), the plane was simply put on the top of a rocket and boosted to space. But engineering tests showed that the DunaDog, with all that wing and canard area, could not be launched that way because it made the rocket unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the DunaDogs (two of them) were launched on the sides of the rocket, Space Shuttle style. Because the masses of the planes were low, a special two-booster version of the old-style Reusable Rocket was used:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AkXTuM6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AkXTuM6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe side booster separation went well (the positions of the sepatrons had been changed to prevent them from causing any damage to the DunaDogs. The press to orbit on the sustainer went fine, and the rocket reached orbit with more than enough fuel left for returning the sustainer to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5AlT1Ya.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225AlT1Ya.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9CdZ7jY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229CdZ7jY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original idea was to have the DunaDogs attached to the sides of the booster by docking ports, and to carry up an adapter structure on the nose of the rocket. The DunaDogs would then separate and dock with the adapter, which would later be docked to a Tug for transport to Duna. But the DunaDogs have no RCS system (they are not spaceplanes), and this would leave the planes attached to the Tug via wobbly docking ports...so the method below was chosen instead:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe DunaDogs are attached via separators and struts to one of the X200-32 Fuel Tanks of the sustainer, which was connected to the top and bottom parts of the sustainer by Senior docking parts. Once in orbit, the ship was aligned Normal, then the front part of the rocket separated (it had RCS) and moved forward. Then the tank with the DunaDogs separated and moved forward (the tank had RCS mounted on it), and then slid off to the side. Finally, the front part of the rocket moved back down to dock with the bottom part (which had a probe core with SAS to keep it stable). Voil\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1! The two DunaDogs were still firmly strutted to their tank (which even had some fuel left in it from boost) that could be docked to a Tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w8YQVUF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w8YQVUF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe re-connected sustainer had a full rear tank, and returned to KSC without any problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pzR5gAc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pzR5gAc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe job of pushing the relatively light DunaDog payload to Duna would go to our plucky SP Tug A, which rendezvoused and docked with the DunaDog stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Suq2a26.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Suq2a26.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK...we are almost done with the payloads...we just need to top off the tanks of the Tugs and the armada will be ready to go.

The second Refueler went to the BANT 2 \u0026amp; 3 ship, topped off its fuel, and then returned to KSC. The third Refueler docked with the BANT 4 \u0026amp; 5 ship, fed it yummy propellant, then returned to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W8w4rSZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022W8w4rSZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy this time I had gotten pretty bored with routine rendezvous and dockings, so I was trying out MechJeb\u0027s automatic rendezvous autopilot. If a Hohmann transfer to the target will not be available soon, MechJeb boosts the ship into a higher orbit, circularizes it, then waits for a Hohmann transfer back to the target orbit. This seems wasteful compared to what I normally do. If I need a phasing orbit for rendezvous, I boost the ship into an elliptical orbit, tweak the periapsis of the ellipse to the target orbit, then wait the necessary number of orbits until intercept (perhaps adjusting the apoapsis on the last pass to make intercept). This saves delta-V by not bothering to circularize the phasing orbit. But one can tolerate some silliness for the convenience of automation, I suppose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is painful to watch, however, is MechJeb\u0027s docking autopilot at work: wandering the wrong direction, then retracing steps...all the while wasting RCS rotating the ship (when there are perfectly good reaction wheels on board). I only use the RCS for translations during docking, not for rotations. Ugh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was one more refueling to be done. In episode 1, a Refueler had been sent to the first payload (Duna Base, etc.) and had used a little less than half of its fuel topping off the Duna Base ship. That Refueler was moved to the BANT 6 ship with its Duna Fido payload, and it topped off the Tug...then the Refueler returned to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2orfXcc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222orfXcc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ECrew Casting 4\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Duna Armada was complete!

She has a Ph.D. in Geology (or whatever Kerbals call that science, since they wouldn\u0027t use the Geo prefix that means Earth).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Kelby \u0022Rockhound\u0022 Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E (first docking test missions; first kerbal to land on Duna; long duration flights in Kerbin orbit). Kelby was one of the \u0022New Nine\u0022 class of kerbalnauts, and he later took up the space agency\u0027s offer to send any kerbalnauts to University for advanced science degrees. He always had an interest in geology, so he got a Ph.D. in that, hoping to use his new skills on a return mission to Duna -- and that time has finally come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than put all their kerbalnaut eggs in one basket and have the mission get messed up at this late date in case of an accident, the Mission Controllers decided to launch the crew on two flights. The basic mission could be handled by four of the main crew (with four backup crew filling in). So Thompbles, Aldner, Kurt, and Hellou were sent up in a Crew Carrier 6d SSTO rocket piloted by Bill Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xpltvg1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Xpltvg1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPardon me while I make notes on this boost for my future reference: Pitch over to 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 from vertical at 5 km.

Ludger nursed the plane along through several flameouts and lowering of the throttle until it was over 40 km going 2370 m/s at 1/8 throttle. Then he kicked in the rocket engines to push the apoapsis up above 100 km. A few additional bursts of the engines later resulted in the plane coasting out of the atmosphere with an apoapsis of 95.8 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GLpcxO5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GLpcxO5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sEpx2nb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sEpx2nb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Passenger Pigeon required a 55 m/s burn to circularize at about 95.7 km, and had 533 m/s of delta-V remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5LWVJgy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225LWVJgy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Passenger Pigeon rendezvoused with the Duna ship and docked to one of the Duna Station hub\u0027s Standard ports.

Not having the wheels out at the corners makes a big difference in their cornering abilities (although it may be the larger collection of the propellant tanks raising the center of mass that is making things worse...or, more likely, both effects). But I think they will be stable enough. The challenge of fitting things in a 6-meter diameter was interesting, and gave me a chance to use the new offset tool more than I had before...but in the end I think it makes me unsatisfied by emphasizing KSP\u0027s lack of any folding structures that we have in real life for dealing with the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe BANT was designed before the 6-meter diameter restriction, but it would not be effecient to put a big fairing around the whole thing when the four nacelles are fairly aerodynamic in themselves with just their parachute and radiation shield hanging out in the airstream. The radiation shields could be shaped more nosecone-like to help. But putting a fairing around the whole Tug would give the BANT a lot more frontal area than simply streamlining the four nacelles. I did move the RCS tanks and other stuff in under the main nose cone to get them out of the breeze. Short cylindrical fairings to enclose the gaps under the front nose and between the tanks would be nice, but I don\u0027t know if we are getting \u0027interstate\u0027-type fairings from Squad. Also, to make the nacelles really aerodynamic, you would like to have rear-pointing fairings around the nukes with their wide end attached to the bottom of the radiation shields to give the nacelles a teardrop shape...but I don\u0027t expect rear-pointing fairings to be an option we get. In any case, I\u0027d be surprised if the new aerodynamics model takes into account such attempts to reduce base drag...it will probably just calculate the drag based on the frontal silhouette of the ship at whatever angle of attack it\u0027s flying.

Sure, the burns were only about six minutes each, but some of the payloads (especially the crew ship, fuel ship, and rover ship) are very laggy...so one second in game time was up to three seconds in real life. Also, some of the ships did not tolerate physical time warp well at all, wobbling around above 1x. Other ships could tolerate the warp, but too much warp caused the nuke nacelles to splay outward, wasting fuel with angled thrust. So things took a while. I only mention this so you\u0027ll feel sorry for me and tell me that I deserve ice cream for doing this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022O7EXVRc.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O7EXVRc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can see the preliminary orbits after the first parts of the TDI maneuvers below, with the five payloads spaced out nicely along their ellipses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Re6HGGK.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Re6HGGK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022Take a good look at the planet, boys and girls.

Hmmm...I don\u0027t recall that the clouds looked this impressive when I left for my first Duna mission.

When I sent my first armada of ships out to Jool, I didn\u0027t have KAC, and keeping track of all the things happening at once was nerve-frazzling. Also, I recently began using the KAC feature where it will automatically set an alarm for any and all ships that are going to be crossing a Sphere of Influence boundary, and I highly recommend this (because carefully-planned trajectories can get messed up (sometimes wildly messed up) if a ship crosses an SOI boundary at high time warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plot below shows all five ships heading away from Kerbin on hyperbolic trajectories...with those wonderful automatic SOI-Change Alarms set. You can also see that I was following the two ships of Jeb\u0027s Eve mission at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228SbJgB8.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8SbJgB8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs each alarm went off for a ship leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI, I clicked the Jump to Ship button and then carefully nursed each ship across the SOI boundary at 1x speed. Once each ship passed out into interplanetary space, I had KAC set an alarm to warn me when the ship would approach the Descending Node of its trajectory relative to Duna\u0027s orbit. KAC is my friend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QKezXM1.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QKezXM1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the Descending Node, a maneuver was plotted that would not only match planes with Duna (which typically took 10 to 11 m/s of delta-V), but the fine targeting of the Duna intercept was also done by tweaking the prograde and radial components of the burn as needed. Below we see my important tools of the trade for doing this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use the Precise Node mod to allow fine tweaking of the burn. I also would get MASSIVELY frustrated without Precise Node\u0027s feature of being able to reopen collapsed maneuver nodes by pressing the \u0022o\u0022 key (since the damn things always collapse on me at the most inopportune times). I REALLY hope SQUAD makes this a standard keystroke in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use Conics Mode 3 (which is happily the default nowadays) and focus on the target (using the Tab key repeatedly) to zoom in and see in detail what the trajectory is doing there. In the plot below you can see that I\u0027ve shifted the original trajectory (that orange line in the bottom-right corner...I think it\u0027s orange) over close to Duna. My other vital tool when I\u0027m targeting planets with atmospheres where I want to aerocapture is MechJeb\u0027s \u0022Show landing predictions\u0022 setting of its Landing Guidance feature (part of that dialog box is shown in the image below).

Lucky!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first of the ships to reach Duna was the ship carrying the Duna Base payload, targeted for an equatorial orbit.

This was not desired, of course, so at apoapsis a small 1.34 m/s prograde burn was made to raise the periapsis a little so that the post-aerobraking orbit would have a 120 km altitude (see below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ships were initially captured into elliptical orbits with high apoapses in order that: 1) aerocapture heating would be minimized (good practice for KSP 1.0), and 2) if an orbital plane shift is needed, it\u0027s cheapest to do far from the planet.

When plotting the ship trajectories into the Duna system, I avoided Ike encounters by adjusting the prograde and radial components of the targeting burn as needed to arrive at times when Ike was not in the way.

First, as the ship was headed out to its 1500 km apoapsis, a tiny plane-shift burn was made to be sure its orbit was equatorial. Then, at apoapsis, a prograde burn of 9 m/s was made to raise the orbit\u0027s periapsis completely out of Duna\u0027s atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FmrfBHm.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FmrfBHm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKurt: \u0022Burn complete...the periapsis it out of the atmosphere.

Then a 48.6 m/s prograde burn circularized the orbit...and all five ships (and four comsats) were safe a sound in Duna orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SG3PaQQ.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SG3PaQQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the first comsat came back around to its 1500 km apoapsis, a 172 m/s burn by its 48-7S engine circularized its orbit, and it took up station as Duna Comsat 1. The other three comsats were allowed to continue coursing along in their elliptical orbits until one of them reached apoapsis when Comsat 1 was about 120 degrees around the planet from there...and then that comsat circularized its orbit to take up station as Duna Comsat 2. Similarly, Duna Comsat 3 was placed in the same 1500 km circular orbit 120 degrees from the first two comsats. Voil\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1! A perfect three-point communication satellite arrangement. Well, it could be better if it was out at synchronous orbit distance, I suppose...but then I\u0027d feel like I owed royalties to Arthur C.

This big maneuver nearly depleted the propellants from the comsat\u0027s four Oscar B tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uRFoaR4.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uRFoaR4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is the completed Duna comsat constellation. There are several other orbits there that you might be wondering about -- those are ships and transfer stages from various previous missions to the Duna system (including Kelby\u0027s old Duna lander, and Adly\u0027s ship around Ike from the Magic Boulder mission). Also note: I don\u0027t employ any communications mods because that\u0027s a level of detail I don\u0027t want to bother with...but I like to have a realistic set of communications satellites in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dhltBvL.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dhltBvL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EDown to Duna!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna operations began with rearranging some of the components of the Duna Explorer ship into the basic structure of Duna Space Station. First, the RCS mini-Tug/docking port adapter (with a Senior port on one end and a Standard port on the other) was moved from the top of one of the Interplanetary Transfer Habitats and docked to one of the four Standard ports in the top tier of docking ports of the Station core (just to get it out of the way). Then the two Duna Landers separated with the other interplanetary Hab and docked it to the top of the other Hab. These Habs will eventually be used to return crew members to Kerbin...but for now they are part of the long axis of Duna Station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UZiroS5.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UZiroS5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, the two big Tugs were separated and docked butt-first to opposite Senior ports of the Station core\u0027s bottom tier of docking ports. When the Tugs eventually leave, their rear tanks will be left behind as part of Duna Station. This has the advantages of: 1) giving the Station lots of volume for storing propellant, and 2) providing Senior docking ports further out from the hub of the station to make docking easier (the tanks have docking ports at both ends). Also, these tanks have some Junior docking ports on their sides to accomodate craft with only Junior docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NpnoDJC.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NpnoDJC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is the start of Duna Space Station. Other Tugs will drop off additional tanks and fuel before returning to Kerbin for re-use. One of the Tugs still has the Double-Tug-Adapter (currently empty) hanging off of it in an ugly way...but that adapter could be useful in tying Tugs together in the future. Also, there is still a Surface Fuel Station docked to the bottom of the Space Station that will be dropped to some handy location on Duna when needed in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vyBWfnG.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vyBWfnG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut let\u0027s start the actual landings! First down will be the Duna Base. But before that, there is a rack of Small Science Landers on top of it that needs to be moved. These COULD be simply left floating free in equatorial orbit, but keeping them with the Tug would keep more options open. The rack of Science Landers was separated, and then the Tug flipped around and docked them to the rear end. All this freed up the Duna Base to separate and move away (well...the TUG moved away...the Base doesn\u0027t have RCS).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wyIXdV4.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wyIXdV4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo 48-7S engines on the underside of the Base drew fuel from two FL-T100 tanks on the top to perform the retro burn, and the Base headed down. In the past I have included little heat shields to protect rover wheels on ships...but I decided to take the amazing temperature resistance numbers listed by SQUAD as given (and I expected entries at Duna to be mild anyway), so no heat shields were included.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor you fans of flaming entries, I\u0027m sorry to have to disappoint you again...but there were no entry flames visible during any of the Duna landings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gmkGwCr.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gmkGwCr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, the eight parachutes deployed in the reefed state and the landing legs deployed after I figured any serious heating would be over. Then the chutes opened fully, and the Base descended gently with a little rocket engine braking before touchdown, depleting most of the remaining fuel. The landing legs are there to protect the wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not used to landing on Duna, and I was kind of surprised how easy it was to land things because the atmosphere and parachutes do a lot of the work for you. Surprised, because I was thinking in terms of Mars, with its much thinner atmosphere. (I saw a video where a Mars entry and landing engineer was saying that Mars\u0027 atmosphere is the worst of both worlds: Too thick to ignore when dropping in at interplanetary speeds, but too thin to be useful in landing. NASA would LOVE to have Duna\u0027s atmosphere to work with.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ecfIbWb.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ecfIbWb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow: Duna Base, which can easily accomodate the whole expedition crew in its four slightly-overlapping Hitchhiker modules, safely down on Duna. The base has docking ports on the sides to allow for future expansion. The elevation of the Base landing site is 640 meters. I was aiming for 42\u00B0 East longitude, just south of the equator...so not bad. Besides...it can be moved around, if desired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LcAoEHC.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LcAoEHC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, the Fuel Fido 1 surface refueling rover was separated from the Tug and sent down to the Base site. It has two 24-7S engines on its bottom for the retro burn (those four other things tucked onto the underside are Xenon tanks, in case you didn\u0027t recognize them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gPWblCe.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gPWblCe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, no flames as the Fuel Fido descended into the nice, \u0027thick\u0027 air of the lowlands.

Mmmmm...cake. With ice cream. Mmmm. The rover landed 280 meters from the Base...but that credit goes to MechJeb\u0027s targeting during retro burn (MJ isn\u0027t used for the actual landing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xggdyZg.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xggdyZg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third item off the stack was the Surface Fuel Station, equipped with four 24-77 engines, eight parachutes, and a whole mess o\u0027 propellants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FxnVpqd.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FxnVpqd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, this payload is pretty heavy, so the engines do important work in soft-landing it. The Fuel Stations will provide propellants for the Landers, hopper rovers, and DunaDogs. It is used in conjunction with the Fuel Fido rover that actually moves the propellant to the thirsty vehicles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KDpJmoa.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KDpJmoa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now for the kerbals! They would be my first kerbals to land on the sorely-ignored Duna in 25 game years (those are Earth years, since that\u0027s what we were using way back in the days of KSP 0.18 when I started this savegame). The expedition has two redundant teams...just in case...and each team would land in a separate lander. Gold Team in Duna Lander 1 consisted of Thompbles (commander), Aldner (piloting), Kurt (engineer/pilot), and Kelby (scientist/pilot). Duna Lander 1 separated from Duna Space Station and used its two Rockomax Mark 55 Radial Mount Liquid Engines to perform the retro burn. I used the long-ignored Mk 55 engines because they have recently gotten a buff...and I\u0027m hoping they won\u0027t be hit as hard by the Nerf Hammer when KSP 1.0 rolls out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zTI42Yp.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zTI42Yp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Oooo, the view out the window is fun...zipping along so fast and low.

How much lead is required? If MechJeb\u0027s Landing Guidance is turned on, it will display a red marker at the target point you specify, and a blue marker where the ship will land (the position of the blue marker ACCOUNTS for rotation of the planet). So you just need to line up those markers. The Fido is equipped with RCS, so that can be used for fine tweaking of the targeting after retro burn. If the target is NOT going to be right under the ship\u0027s orbital plane when the lander gets to that point, the ship would need to do some normal or antinormal burn in its orbit 90 degrees away from landing site to shift the trajectory plane as needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XdPfUvf.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XdPfUvf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Fido exploration rovers have two 48-7S engines and four parachutes to assist in landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Zi332qe.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zi332qe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe targeting wasn\u0027t as precise on this landing, and the Fido touched down about 400 meters from Duna Lander 1 and Duna Base (which were visible because they are on top of a low ridge...the other ships were beyond the ridge).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fwGOqxC.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fwGOqxC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut a little distance doesn\u0027t matter for the Fido because it\u0027s a ROVER...so the control point was switched from the top port to the cockpit, and rover was remotely controlled the drive it over to the Base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of the lower traction available with the chosen wheels in Duna\u0027s low gravity, it\u0027s necessary to disable the SAS (if you drive with it normally on...which I do) to make tight turns.
