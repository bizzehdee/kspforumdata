Some (be honest, most) science fiction uses all three, some uses only the first two, but KSP as it stands now uses only the first: technology that has either already been used (most of it), or is within one technological generation of being used (Rapiers, NTRs, etc.).

For instance many of KSP\u0027s \u0022game\u0022 shortcomings have been replaced with more realistic physics. Take the ISP inversion. For years engines maintained constant thrust, with fuel flow changing with atmo pressure. Many called that a compromise for \u0022game\u0022 over simulation to make launches more consistent in different atmospheres. In reality it seems that whomever wrote the original code simply did not understand ISP. So now with 1.0 it has been \u0022fixed\u0022 and replaced with more realistic physics. If KSP was only a \u0022game\u0022 there would be no reason to fix such errors, or at least not replace them with more realistic physics. Therefore KSP is something more than a game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s only a game\u0022 is the battle cry for those who once said \u0022It\u0027s still alpha\u0022. Virtually any argument can be dismissed with \u0022It\u0027s a game\u0022 because it places the whims of the devs above any and all other opinions. It means that the devs can do no wrong because KSP has no basis in the real world whatsoever. Such arguments boarder on fanboyism. I have some respect for the Devs, not total adoration, but enough to deffer to them on how to define KSP. And they have for years stated repeatedly and consistently that KSP is no mere game, that \u0022simulation\u0022 really is its defining trait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/XT5YGF2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XT5YGF2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XT5YGF2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T08:21:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 08:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sandworm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T08:41:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFoxster is right that the game has many hand-waves and concessions to gameplay.
