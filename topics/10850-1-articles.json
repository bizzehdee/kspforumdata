I can\\\u0027t seem to build a space plane for the life of me. Most of my attempts have resulted with the craft capsizing and blowing up at high speeds while still on the runway. After 20 or more attempts, i finally built one that was capable of flight, however it was not capable of leaving the atmosphere, and I built it in the Rocket VAB, not the hangar. Even then it is still prone to losing control and becoming unstable in flight if you turn too sharply. Does anyone know of some type of guide to the basic concepts of aeronautics/flying machines?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anomalous_Matter","CreatedById":24939,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T22:54:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding most of your wings behind the center of gravity does wonders for handling.

Having the center of pressure behind the center of gravity helps too, and this usually comes naturally as a result of the wings being far back as well.
