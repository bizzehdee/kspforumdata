I can\\\u0027t seem to build a space plane for the life of me. Most of my attempts have resulted with the craft capsizing and blowing up at high speeds while still on the runway. After 20 or more attempts, i finally built one that was capable of flight, however it was not capable of leaving the atmosphere, and I built it in the Rocket VAB, not the hangar. Even then it is still prone to losing control and becoming unstable in flight if you turn too sharply. Does anyone know of some type of guide to the basic concepts of aeronautics/flying machines?"},{"CreatedByName":"Anomalous_Matter","CreatedById":24939,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T22:54:54Z","Content":"Building most of your wings behind the center of gravity does wonders for handling. As for leaving the atmosphere, there are two types of spaceplane engines: Lower atmosphere and upper atmosphere. Were you using the upper ones?"},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T02:25:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Does anyone know of some type of guide to the basic concepts of aeronautics/flying machines?\n\nThat is a very very good question.

I assumed that the centre f gravity was too far back, but moving bulk forward makes it worse. Moving weight even further back also makes it worse."},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T22:06:30Z","Content":"I suggest placing engines on top of the wings to generate a bit extra downforce."},{"CreatedByName":"xclusiv8","CreatedById":20567,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T22:19:30Z","Content":"This is the most stable jet i have been able to produce.

Having the center of pressure behind the center of gravity helps too, and this usually comes naturally as a result of the wings being far back as well. But I don\\\u0027t blame you for troubles getting into space, I\\\u0027ve only sent one horizontally launched craft into orbit, and it was more rocket that plane when it got there."}]}
