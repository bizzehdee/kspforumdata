I know from past experience, it takes the Zoology lab and Station Lab 30 hours to make Bioproducts and Eurekas. Therefore, I \u0022start\u0022 the experiment and set KAC for 30 hours. At the end of that period, I consider the experiment completed (if the mod were working). I then return and recover at Kerbin. Upon recovering, I use ALT-F12 to complete the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor experiments that require Kibbal, I bring a couple loads of Kibbal to the Zoology lab as i normally would.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly downside, is that I do not get the Science that the experiment itself provides. I do get the Science that the contract pays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI previously modded the Zoology and Lab attachment nodes for KSP 1.0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T12:48:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 12:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Apollo13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"no2ironman1100","CreatedById":118320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T07:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been kept as of yet waiting, I will start a career save as soon as this (And my custom parts, Which Is not a mod, Just some modified and retextured parts) Will be fully updated !
