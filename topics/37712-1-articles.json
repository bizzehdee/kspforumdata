Can you anchor lets say some 1,000,000 lb thrust engines to the launch pad, aim the rockets at an angle so the thrust goes up or at an angle and use this as a thruster to speed up or slow down the planets rotation? I made a rig with 3 X 1.000.000 lb thrusters but have no Idea how long I would have to leave them running to see any change in planets rotation speed. If that is even possible in this game. I know we would be pushing against the atmosphere, but maybe the game does not pick up on that in this case. Any Ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T09:00:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo you can\u0027t every planet is anchored in their orbit sadly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T09:03:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo you can\u0027t every planet is anchored in their orbit sadly.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou say sadly...but I bet all the Kerbals who don\u0027t go into space today are thankful!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pursuedtank","CreatedById":50078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T09:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile The Planets may be on rails, think of how long it would take to get everything into the right place.
