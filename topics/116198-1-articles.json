And in fact you could probably just use solar panels as triggers without messing with anything more - generating power, sun is up! so now all you need is a charge sensor.\n\nThere is ( or was ) a background processing mod that handles electricity depletion somewhat - TAC life support also handles resource depletion for remote stuff somewhat."}]}
