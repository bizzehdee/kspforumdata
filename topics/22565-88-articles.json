I mean look at the thing! Same general design, same intended purpose, same launch profile, same transport system. It had RCS pods in all the same places, and even relied on the same thermal tile re-entry protection system, but where it differed is that Russia didn\u0027t have access to the main engines the US Shuttle used, which were the most efficient engines on the planet at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuran was a knock-off of an already-working design as surely as the Chinese i-Pone.

I think what Russia didn\u0027t know at the time was how hugely expensive the Space Shuttle program was, because at its core, the Space Shuttle was initially designed to be a showpiece. It was never intended to be placed at the center of the space program as its main workhorse; it just turned out to be much more effective than anybody had anticipated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, look up Space Shuttle Enterprise. It wasn\u0027t exactly a complete unknown by the time they did the glide tests. That shuttle went through a LOT of ground and \u0022piggy-back\u0022 tests to determine its general characteristics before anybody got behind the stick and tried flying it independently. Still, it was a huge risk, and the pilots deserve all the credit for taking it on and seeing it through, as surely as Chuck Yeager swallowed the lump in his throat and broke the sound barrier in a prototype rocket plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-29T21:26:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2013 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Deadweasel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T21:30:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022War Eagle 1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022War Eagle 1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEther way I wish they had a good mod of the Merican shuttle\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIronically, the only realistic means of having any shuttle design working would require the use of... *gasp* Mechjeb.
