This reflects the real-life difficulty of engineering these reactors, and makes Career Mode games with Interstellar isntalled a little less of a mad dash to the most advanced reactors- while also realistically reflecting some of the engineering difficulties of more advanced reactor designs. Of course, the cost increase shouldn\u0027t be TOO great- I\u0027d imagine that part of the science to practically implement these designs would be figuring out cheaper ways of solving some of the technical barriers. \u003Cstrong\u003EThat being said, all space-grade nuclear reactors should be highly expensive.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhich gives me one more idea- maybe you\u0027d also consider introducing an (extremely heavy, but cheaper) more \u0022conventional\u0022 fission reactor, not intended for use in space?\u003C/strong\u003E (and thus built with much less concern for mass) I would think such a part could be much cheaper than the other nuclear reactors, and thus make Microwave Beamed Power liftoffs from the KSC \u003Cstrong\u003E*MUCH*\u003C/strong\u003E more affordable- especially if the space-grade reactors were extremely expensive...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch a reactor could even have built-in radiators optimized for atmospheric use, to avoid the need for design of a separate line of high-mass, low-cost radiator; and a built-in generator as well, to avoid the need to design an ultra-heavy but low cost generator, and prevent people from using the reactor for rocket propulsion as it wouldn\u0027t be designed for it... Both would also reduce part-count. Finally, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe ground-based reactor should be in the 5 meter size range or larger\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E: both to push cost-efficiency (bigger = more cost-effective power production), and the reflect that nuclear reactors become exponentially harder and more expensive to build (for their power production) the smaller you have to build them...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would certainly beat building a \u0022train\u0022 of 3.75 meter fission reactors for Microwave Beamed Power launches from the KSC, at least from a cost and realism perspective (and a 5 meter reactor would still be small enough to reasonably move one or two at a time outside of physics-range from the KSC rover-style)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-20T02:38:49Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2014 02:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meltafire","CreatedById":89236,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-20T05:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe final significant issue to resolve was the EletricEngine update to ModuleEnginesFX which I\u0027ve had waiting ready to take over from the old system for quite some time.\u003Cp\u003ESwitching over to ModuleEnginesFX means that I can actually change the visual effects when you change propellant.
