Since the air is thinner the higher your go this in turn lets you fly faster with the same amount of thrust from your engines. For a spaceplane, since jet engines are vastly vastly more fuel efficient than rocket engines this lets you get to orbit using less fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T22:51:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Air hogging\u0022 simply provides air longer to the jets. An engine can only use so much air, but at some point the supply starts to dwindle. When the supply dwindles, the engine doesn\u0027t produce as much thrust (until it eventually quits due to air starvation). Air hogging increases the minimum supply, so that the engine runs at a high rate for longer. But it doesn\u0027t affect the maximum thrust or efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, the ability to air hog simply a byproduct of how the game is mechanized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jake9039","CreatedById":122602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T23:15:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok. thank you\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T03:53:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes air hogging a craft still do anything in 1.0.4?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T04:11:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESort of.
