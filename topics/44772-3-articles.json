The net result was that the teacher (who, as an extra bonus, had worked in the industry for a number of years and was, if I recall correctly, independently wealthy enough not to need the money from teaching) was able to design the curriculum and the semester as he saw fit. And he saw fit to arm us with a few basic concepts, a set of tasks, and set us to exploring. I learned more about the Java language (and programming in general) from the \u0022free-range\u0022 format than I ever could have from poring over a textbook for days at a time. No exam, no tests, nothing but a set of (incredibly broad) assignments. Simultaneously one of the most difficult and most rewarding courses I took in my entire high school career.

Define a syllabus using primary readings (articles form the peer-reviewed literature) that addressed major themes pertinent to the course, have weekly quizzes to keep students on task, require students to lead the class 2/3rds of the time.

Once upon a time, education was not institutionalized but 95% of people were illiterate and received virtually no education apart from learning to perform some sort of physical labor in service to a lord or property owner. Here we see the more paradoxical point: the fact that education is in virtually all modern nation states institutionalized and subject to governmental standardization is from an historical standpoint a reflection of reforms to promote equality, upward mobility, and individual empowerment. Ironic that it seems to \u0027feel\u0027 oppressive, hierarchical and stifling for so many people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEducation works well when a relatively small number of students are afforded an opportunity to interact with a teacher, someone who knows about a topic, and has a sincere desire to facilitate learning about that topic by others. Here we see additional features of modern education that lead to shorcomings: too many students relative to teachers; teachers who are not actually very expert; teachers who are burnt out or apathetic, even malicious; teachers who either do not really care to help their students learn, or actually are more concerned with establishing their own authority and power than with facilitating learning; related to this last bit, a disturbingly widespread belief among teachers that they as an expert are there to \u0027dispense\u0027 knowledge into the \u0027empty vessels\u0027 of students\u0027 minds. Even when someone IS a true expert, this model of how learning or education works still could not be further from the truth. Effective teaching always involves more activity on the part of the student than the teacher, even when the curriculum design is much less open-ended and self-guided as the one you describe above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fear that for various reasons, none of these problems are going to really be addressed at any time in the near future, perhaps never.

Even it is a bummer, it is worth finishing it, and indeed moving on to college may well reveal that education isn\u0027t so bad after all. The best way to learn is to explore something for yourself, but that requires true curiousity and engagement with a topic.

One of the more interesting ones I have come across is the Finnish system, as apparently their culture doesn\u0027t put much importance on academic performance. No standardized testing, no awards, no scholarships. One of the things you see coming out of this is that, with all the competition out of the way, and worrying about your GPA, it really free\u0027s people up to actually learn things. Things like bird courses no longer being a thing because people don\u0027t need an easy class to shelter in, or boost their marks with, instead going out and taking something that would be useful to them. It\u0027s the situation I find myself in, in University.

I suppose that, as we get older, our memories are now processed through the eyes of adulthood. We lose our perspective, or at least a good portion of it, and are left with perhaps a few memories that we don\u0027t really understand, because they no longer make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I wish that perhaps I had more freedom in school? Perhaps, though I think there is a balance, especially for people like me who will take advantage of the system if they can. When doing things like papers, I never really liked being told what to do them on. I would much rather come up with some ideas, get them approved, and then be researching something I am really interested in. I did a couple papers on nuclear technology in high school. My first year of university I took the only history course I have ever enjoyed in my life (because there was next to no emphasis on dates, just culture and technology), and wrote my paper on the effectiveness of Gothic and Maximilian full plate armour (spoiler alert: really effective).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the most fun I have ever had was my grade 12 art class, where we had one assigned project, which was a reproduction of a famous painting. I did the penrose triangle for that, and then spent most of the year making wireframe skeletons for plasticine sculptures (my favorite was a dragon, which was also a pretty difficult one with all the thin bits on things like the wings). Made for a nice offset of the maths and sciences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I definately have an opinion on are some more practical things. I got a bit of this from economics, and also from my parents and older brother (my brother in particular has been fantastic at making sure that I understand things like insurance, mortgages, bills, how much money I will probably be making and how long it takes to save up and so on). But there is other stuff, and if I can quote a cracked article:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI.

I\u0027ve seen people who weren\u0027t sheltered, people who learned much younger than most how to organize their entire life, and how to advocate for themselves because they had to, and I think it definitely robs you of some of the joy of being a child. Why should a 14 year old kid have to worry about the bills and what not? This is the part of his life where he is still learning, and still learning how to deal with people.. Maybe there is a best time to start bringing them into the real world, perhaps in proportion to their responsibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me to one last point, about removing the social aspect of school, and here I would have to disagree. I\u0027m not sure what I have to say to bullying, but what I can speak to is that people need to learn to compromise, the skill that our society is based on. I have to imagine that most people have met someone who largely lacks that skill, the \u0027my way or not at all\u0027 attitude (I think everyone goes through it when their young, as part of the brains development. Without social interaction, you never grow out of it). Another way to put it is that the world is run by extroverts, and like it or not, us introverts need to be able to play the game too if we are to one day rule the world \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T05:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Diche Bach\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Diche Bach\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHowever, it would NOT work for many subject matters, it would not work for all \u0027levels\u0027 of course work and it would not necessarily work for all students.

Even it is a bummer, it is worth finishing it, and indeed moving on to college may well reveal that education isn\u0027t so bad after all. The best way to learn is to explore something for yourself, but that requires true curiousity and engagement with a topic. While school might actually drain your curiousity about any given topic, try to find those things that you really take an interest in and pursue them and educate yourself, perhaps even find teachers or friends who share those interests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t hate high school, but that\u0027s mainly because I found a niche and filled it nicely. Decently high-performing in classes that caught my interest (programming, the sciences, history), OK at classes with an open-ended format (English), abysmal at everything else (math, French). Not much of a social life, definitely not a \u0022typical teenager\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealistically, high school is what you make of it. You can let the awful format and occasionally awful teachers get you down, or you can seek out the interesting teachers and get to know them, even outside class time (join a club they run, or something to that effect). I didn\u0027t mind it, but I know a lot of people did and still do. Do what you love, and at the end of the day, nobody can tell you that you\u0027re wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Randox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Randox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like the point about driving yourself. One of the more interesting ones I have come across is the Finnish system, as apparently their culture doesn\u0027t put much importance on academic performance. No standardized testing, no awards, no scholarships. One of the things you see coming out of this is that, with all the competition out of the way, and worrying about your GPA, it really free\u0027s people up to actually learn things. Things like bird courses no longer being a thing because people don\u0027t need an easy class to shelter in, or boost their marks with, instead going out and taking something that would be useful to them. It\u0027s the situation I find myself in, in University. Do I take something that I think could be really interesting, and perhaps useful, yet is outside what I know I can excel at, or do I find something less engaging and get my easy A?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI constantly have to avoid this temptation. I hate the idea of a bird course, but I wouldn\u0027t mind a boost to my GPA to make prospective employers a little happier. I\u0027ve found, though, that the primary limiting factor for me isn\u0027t the difficulty of the material, it\u0027s the \u0022boredom factor\u0022 - if I\u0027m bored with a professor/subject, I switch off, and my grades go through the floor. I\u0027ll do work that falls into \u0022difficult but interesting\u0022 without a second thought, and enjoy it. Difficult and boring... I\u0027m more likely to pitch it in the trash than do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Randox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Randox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo I wish that perhaps I had more freedom in school? Perhaps, though I think there is a balance, especially for people like me who will take advantage of the system if they can. When doing things like papers, I never really liked being told what to do them on. I would much rather come up with some ideas, get them approved, and then be researching something I am really interested in. I did a couple papers on nuclear technology in high school. My first year of university I took the only history course I have ever enjoyed in my life (because there was next to no emphasis on dates, just culture and technology), and wrote my paper on the effectiveness of Gothic and Maximilian full plate armour (spoiler alert: really effective).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds about right. My programming class is a perfect example - for a final project, we had to create some sort of large (for a beginning programmer) piece of software using the techniques and skills demonstrated that semester. That was literally the only guideline. I decided to be really ambitious, and wrote a two-player command-line chess game. Looking back, it was an anti-pattern-y monstrosity of a program that would make coding style guide writers cry, but it was well beyond what the teacher expected from a student project, and something I would likely have been reprimanded for if I had tried it in another class (too ambitious). I had a history class like this, too - final project was a proper academic research paper, open topic as long as it related to the class material. I decided to do a comparative study of ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian architecture (architecture being one of many subjects in which I have an interest), which was WAAAAY outside the scope of the class, the project, and the school library. After the appropriate bureaucratic wrangling to get access to the local university library, I dug up a few books, did my research, and turned in what the teacher later said was one of the best papers she\u0027d seen in a long time. Open-ended education, in areas where it can be applied, is an amazing tool to motivate students to learn and seek new knowledge. And it seems to surprise the teachers what the students will do and accomplish if given a little latitude - far more than if they were confined to a straight-and-narrow textbook/exam paradigm, it seems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-05T05:46:50Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2013 05:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NGTOne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M.Wolfy","CreatedById":76904,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T06:49:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehmmm, maybe there should also be a thread called Work AKA Prison for the adults as well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KOCOUR","CreatedById":37749,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T07:25:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deadpangod3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deadpangod3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut I\u0027m pretty sure you don\u0027t have to get up at 6:00 AM to get ready, then be tired as hell while teachers are screaming at you\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow iam laughing.

I suppose it really is the holy grail of schooling though, hence the highest level of education involves becoming a world expert in something new (this would be a doctoral degree).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for education methods, that can still get interesting. This is the one I hope to see start to change in my lifetime (hopefully really soon, because right now it\u0027s going backwards and I want it getting better before I have kids of my own). Things like cutting back recess and lunch are things we already know have a terrible impact on learning, and yet we do them anyway in the vain hope that you can just shove more things into a persons brain with brute force (see: Studying with Osmosis - How to Absorb Knowledge by Sleeping on a Textbook, because that\u0027s how much sense that line of thinking makes). What actually happens is that kids become restless and bored, stop paying attention, and disrupt the class thus ensuring that children with preternatural attention spans don\u0027t learn squat either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother one is rolling things back into earlier years. The human brain has very distinct stages of development, again, this is all stuff we know pretty well. The human brain even transitions from stage to stage very quickly, before plateauing in the next one for some time, which makes it really easy to have a good idea where someone is at based on age alone. Perhaps the most important one is the capacity for abstract thought, the ability to comprehend a hypothetical scenario inside your own head, a capability that is fundamental to algebra among other things. What has been observed is that for children where algebra was first taught before age twelve (in grade 7 instead of 8 if I remember correctly, maybe it\u0027s 8 and 9), their math scores plummet and never recover, probably because you just spent a year frustrating them with concepts their brains weren\u0027t equipped to handle and teaching them that math sucks, and they suck at math.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and NGTOne, same thing about the bird courses. I still have to stick with things that interest me, or my marks will crash and burn. What I have found is that things that are interesting and things that are easy tend to go hand in hand. I suppose part of that is people naturally enjoy things they are good at, things that come easily to them, but it also works the other way, people will work hard to understand things that interest them. Oh, and looking at the program I did for my first Java class still makes me want to crawl under the desk. I was experimenting with multiple classes before I really understood Object Oriented Programming, I was still treating them a lot like subroutines and sub-programs from my self taught procedural days, and the results are hard to read and pretty horrific, though it worked just fine. The one I have been thinking about is doing up an AI for cribbage. It\u0027s a game where I could easily write my entire strategy on pen and paper, and it would be an interesting way try different strategy tweaks and see how they perform. Would certainly top teaching the computer to play Bingo. For me, so far open ended in computers has mostly meant that you are at lest semi-free to decide how you want the program to work under the hood, and with a lot of flexibility for additional features.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T16:23:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022M.Wolfy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022M.Wolfy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehmmm, maybe there should also be a thread called Work AKA Prison for the adults as well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso an \u0022Unemployment AKA Hell!\u0022 thread too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deadpangod3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deadpangod3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGuys, don\u0027t let this thread get out of hand, or I\u0027ll ask a mod to lock it\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhaaa??
