I applied the locomotive brake best I could but it didnt do much.. the only option was to push forward.. the next summit wasnt too far ahead.. now doing 0.5 m/s her wheels were slower than a seconds hand of a clock.. but with everything considered.. still making progress and something to be thankful for..\n\nI switched to the cab momentaryly to get a better reading.. the locomotive shook as both generators detonated at the same time in a shower of sparks and fire... thankfully not harming much else.. 4408 II now had no power at all.. \n\nfor a diesel electric locomotive that depends on electricity for everything from propulsion.. lights.. and...the ability to reverse engines dynamicly.. she was now just an unwilling passenger in her own demise..\n\nFor a time I considered if I could save the train.. I\u0027d simply get another locomotive and stable 4408 II at the bottom of the mountain.. to be retrieved later by a shunter and parked in the carpark of KSC with honour..\n\nsadly like mentioned previously.. with the steering at the back on the locomotive. .no dynamic brakes.. and a fuel train behind the locomotive still 3/4 full.. there was little I could do at all except sit by and watch everything unfold..\n\nThe first few changes in terrain were handled wonderfully.. by a mircle the train stayed upright and together... hope again was possible she\u0027d make it through this in some form recoverable..\n\nsoon after though all hope was lost as the train gained well in excess of 40 m/s in reverse.. with the train starting to dance around.. \n\na sudden drop in terrain ment the entire train went airborne.. backwards..

The sight of those heavy tankcars forming a \u0022rope bridge\u0022 across the crawler track, suspended only by docking ports, and getting the whole thing across without even a flat tire, is just amazing.\n\nAs to your problem with turning, if only the engines\u0027 wheels can steer, turning necessitates bending the train, and there are 2 forces that resist this: the rigidity of the docking ports and having to skid the fixed wheels of the tankcars sideways. It seems that before, the absence of the former overcame the latter but now both are working together to impede steering. I don\u0027t think putting the tankcar bogies on free pivots would really improve matters given the new rigidity of docking ports, plus would probably cause problems with shunting in the absence of rails. Thus, it might work better if you put the 2nd engine at the rear of the train. That way, you\u0027d have steering force at both ends that would increase the bending force or at least help rotate the whole rigid thing like a plank."},{"CreatedByName":"Overland","CreatedById":119812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T03:07:17Z","Content":"greetings ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) im on my ipod at work so i cant copy and paste your ungodly challenging name as usual G-man so youll have to settle for less on this occasion ..\n\na big thanks for the explaination i actually never considered the skid factor and it makes perfect sence.\n\nI did originally have the loco on the other end but being on the end tempts destruction..not that a yard shunter centrecab could handle the train alone but she made a viable addition up front..\n\nperhaps ill have to look into making a guardsvan on the end thats a steering car too..traditionally trains with rear and front steering didnt turn as sharp but at this point anythings an improvement ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nill update once im home tonight from work.. seems torque settings were adjusted too.. even light engine D4002 and 3703 dont have alot of power with the same numbers as previous generations..branching into the above 500 torque now..starting to worry and steep shifts in rpm might pull the train in half and snap couplings in the field.."},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T01:46:25Z","Content":"Just found this series; I love it!
