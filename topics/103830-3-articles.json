It seems that before, the absence of the former overcame the latter but now both are working together to impede steering. I don\u0027t think putting the tankcar bogies on free pivots would really improve matters given the new rigidity of docking ports, plus would probably cause problems with shunting in the absence of rails. Thus, it might work better if you put the 2nd engine at the rear of the train. That way, you\u0027d have steering force at both ends that would increase the bending force or at least help rotate the whole rigid thing like a plank.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Overland","CreatedById":119812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T03:07:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egreetings \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E im on my ipod at work so i cant copy and paste your ungodly challenging name as usual G-man so youll have to settle for less on this occasion ..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea big thanks for the explaination i actually never considered the skid factor and it makes perfect sence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did originally have the loco on the other end but being on the end tempts destruction..not that a yard shunter centrecab could handle the train alone but she made a viable addition up front..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eperhaps ill have to look into making a guardsvan on the end thats a steering car too..traditionally trains with rear and front steering didnt turn as sharp but at this point anythings an improvement \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eill update once im home tonight from work.. seems torque settings were adjusted too.. even light engine D4002 and 3703 dont have alot of power with the same numbers as previous generations..branching into the above 500 torque now..starting to worry and steep shifts in rpm might pull the train in half and snap couplings in the field..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T01:46:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust found this series; I love it!
