Having a unique ammo box for each caliber with the option to make it hole different types of rounds such as HE AP INC etc sounds like a good plan in my opinion though I think several universal boxes working like modular fuel tanks works just fine as long as the performance improvements justify the increased complexity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA new feature to add that might be cool would be if you could add a material property sort of system to parts through module manager that dictates how the object is affected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel tanks like the big orange would be foam as a primary material (external) which would make them weak but less likely to ignite whereas fuselages could be metal which would be stronger but could cause sparks to ignite fuel more easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECome to think of it having a mod to let you select a part\u0027s armor level would be cool with higher levels costing more and weighing more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just came up with a part idea\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeapon bays!
