Has anyone else experienced a similar performance drop like this?\n\nSadly yes....\n\nI used to be able to spawn 3 ~300 part capital ships and shoot at em with some stutter but nothing that made it difficult to actually aim.\n\nNow, i spawn in 2 of them and i get roughly the same stutter as i had before. Its not unplayeable with ~1000 parts, which was my 0.90 limit too, but it sure aint enjoyeable either. I seem to get far better performance at lower part counts then i did before at lower part counts, and less lagginess near the ground, but i seem to have slightly worse performance when i have more parts spawned as well. Now i have no proof of this, and its just a gut reaction (i dont exactly test FPS or anything), but it does FEEL slightly worse with high part counts, and feels slightly better at low part counts.\n\nAlso, capital ships break apat too easily with 1.0, you can nolonger reenter a 500t ship and survive the thing!"},{"CreatedByName":"M3Man03","CreatedById":59863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:35:42Z","Content":"I\u0027m seeing about the same as I had previously.

I even sucessfully launched a Stanford Torus (from Michaelhester07) from the pad, and got it to the ground on Minmus (back when I used to do Kethane) It had 4 biodomes and the near VAB diameter torus part (the one with the forest and stream inside, and I think, a 44 Kerbal crew capacity). I discovered that fuel lines have a length limit when I built that... Had to hang oscar tanks from girders, and run fuel lines from one asparagus stage, to and oscar, then another fuel line from the oscar to the next asparagus stage. I think I had 12 peripheral stacks of Kerbodynes, and one central stack, plus a set of ejectable tanks and engines that didn\u0027t stick below the landing gear... SO. MANY. LANDING. LEGS!!! Each of the 12 peripheral stacks was either a fuel tank or a kethane tank, and I either had 3 or 4 sets of octo-symetrical landing legs on each stack... The center had the drill. I think that\u0027s at least 288 landing legs alone?\n\nRight now... My VAB is still stuck at the 255 part limit. I haven\u0027t upgraded. I spammed R\u0026D on science modules, but I\u0027m still stuck on the first liquid rocket engines, and the first three SRB sizes... I need to spam KSC science to get some bigger engines, as i\u0027ve only been to orbit once so far. I had to get creative with the heat shield flipping bug (before the fix was figured out). I launched a ship with 5 heat shields attached to cubic struts and used 8 nosecones (to shape the aerodynamic disaster that 5 heat shields made), and 8 small torque wheels to keep it oriented. 2 service bays worth of batteries and science gadgets, and three command modules (for increased crew experience)...

Note: do not attempt this in real life.

You might gain some performance by backing down your texture quality and terrain scatters in the settings menu. Outside of that, Active Texture Management is 1.0 compatible now."}]}
