Its not unplayeable with ~1000 parts, which was my 0.90 limit too, but it sure aint enjoyeable either. I seem to get far better performance at lower part counts then i did before at lower part counts, and less lagginess near the ground, but i seem to have slightly worse performance when i have more parts spawned as well. Now i have no proof of this, and its just a gut reaction (i dont exactly test FPS or anything), but it does FEEL slightly worse with high part counts, and feels slightly better at low part counts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, capital ships break apat too easily with 1.0, you can nolonger reenter a 500t ship and survive the thing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3Man03","CreatedById":59863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m seeing about the same as I had previously.

I even sucessfully launched a Stanford Torus (from Michaelhester07) from the pad, and got it to the ground on Minmus (back when I used to do Kethane) It had 4 biodomes and the near VAB diameter torus part (the one with the forest and stream inside, and I think, a 44 Kerbal crew capacity). I discovered that fuel lines have a length limit when I built that... Had to hang oscar tanks from girders, and run fuel lines from one asparagus stage, to and oscar, then another fuel line from the oscar to the next asparagus stage. I think I had 12 peripheral stacks of Kerbodynes, and one central stack, plus a set of ejectable tanks and engines that didn\u0027t stick below the landing gear... SO. MANY. LANDING. LEGS!!! Each of the 12 peripheral stacks was either a fuel tank or a kethane tank, and I either had 3 or 4 sets of octo-symetrical landing legs on each stack... The center had the drill.
