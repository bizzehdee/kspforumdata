Is there something I am missing to do with what needs to be facing z\u002B? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also tried making an empty in unity and parenting it to a panel and changing its local orientation and setting that as raycastTransform with the same result, always the same edge points to the sun...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eok I have done this over and over now, remade it from the ground up making sure everything is lined up the same as the set i made that work, no matter what happens they just point edge on! really confused, thought maybe it was the config because that is the only thing that has remained the same over the multiple version but i can\u0027t see anything in it that could possibly cause this so I am stumped.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T12:02:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 12:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T16:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf raycastTransform is the object that rotates dynamically in the game then obviously rotating it in Unity wont work, right?
