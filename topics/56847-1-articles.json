I am suggesting adding an idea they use for thier tech tree. Efficiencies. For certain tech throughout the tech tree, why not add some efficiency bonuses, in addition to parts? This will give us something else to look forward to. For instance, when you get Stability, you should get a \u002B1% SAS efficiency (1% increase in control). When you get Fuel Systems, you should get a \u002B1% in fuel efficiency. These bonuses would be stackable. So if you got a 1% fuel efficiency 3 times, you actually have a 3% savings in fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just a suggestion and something additional to look foward to in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richiespeed13","CreatedById":96460,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T12:31:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis idea sounds nice, but I would say it should be done in a \u0022science!\u0022 kind of way. Rather than magical bonuses in the tech tree, maybe we can pay money/allocate budget, (in future versions), into technology development, which can improve things such as fuel efficiency, SAS control, and many other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as this game never stops evolving I think the future is very bright and full of potential for cool stuff like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jalapen0","CreatedById":9056,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T12:44:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I think I get it. Instead of adding to the current tech tree, we could have a Parts Tree, and then a seperate efficiency investment area. We can choose to spend our points and get more parts, or we can choose to spend points on efficiency. Maybe the first 10 points buy you 1% efficiency in an area. Then the next 1% would cost you 15. The 3rd time, it\u0027ll cost 22, etc. So a 3% bonus would cost 47 points and continue on a reduced return on investment, forever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T14:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to see something like this.
