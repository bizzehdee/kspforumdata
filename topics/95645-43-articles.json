This assumes that the radiators are the best for the job because they don\u0027t use EC and are better at getting rid of heat than the heat sinks. This is not balanced with other mods with radiators / heat management systems like Interstellar Extended or Deep Space Exploration Vehicles, which I am not using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E//------\\\\\u003Cbr\u003E//---SETI-CTT---\\\\\u003Cbr\u003E//------\\\\\u003Cbr\u003E//---Tech Tree changes for Heat Management---\\\\\u003Cbr\u003E//------\\\\\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E//---Small Radiator Panels\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[Radiator125]:NEEDS[HeatManagement]:FOR[SETIctt]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\t@TechRequired = specializedRadiators\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E//---Large Radiator Panels\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[Radiator250]:NEEDS[HeatManagement]:FOR[SETIctt]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\t@TechRequired = specializedRadiators\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E//---1.25m Heatsink\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[Heatsink125n]:NEEDS[HeatManagement]:FOR[SETIctt]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\t@TechRequired = heatManagementSystems\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E//----2.5m Heatsink\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[Heatsink250n]:NEEDS[HeatManagement]:FOR[SETIctt]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\t@TechRequired = heatManagementSystems\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E//---3.75m Heatsink\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[Heatsink375n]:NEEDS[HeatManagement]:FOR[SETIctt]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\t@TechRequired = heatManagementSystems\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E//---Active Heat Management System (1.25m)\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[IAHMS125]:NEEDS[HeatManagement]:FOR[SETIctt]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\t@TechRequired = advHeatManagement\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E//---Active Heat Management System (2.5m)\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[IAHMS250]:NEEDS[HeatManagement]:FOR[SETIctt]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\t@TechRequired = advHeatManagement\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E//---Active Heat Management System (3.75m)\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[IAHMS375]:NEEDS[HeatManagement]:FOR[SETIctt]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\t@TechRequired = advHeatManagement\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
