Except in the game things don\u0027t actually work as in the tutorial. I added ASAS to my rocket to make it fly upwards. In the tutorial video the ASAS is indicated in the menu (lower-left side of the screen, orange bars). I cannot in the name make the ASAS appear in the menu thus it would not work. When I launch the rocket, it starts yawning and pitching in the wrong direction and starts turning towards mother Earth... I\u0027m using the demo and willing to pay for the full-version but only if I can manage to do a successful launch. So far I\u0027ve spent more than an hour trying to figure out how to do it and no success. Any ideas what am I doing wrong???\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T10:43:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you turn it on?

Pitching and yawing from launch should not happen unless it\u0027s a really crap design or something with decent size/weight to it. But, typically, if the first thing is does is want to flip over and hit the ground, the rocket design is bad, and SAS/ASAS is not going to save you from that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I can\u0027t believe there wasn\u0027t a \u0022no matter which way I try to steer it still smashes into the ground\u0022 kind of sentence in your post...

It is caused by flexing at the joints. This can be countered somewhat by fins and struts. It will require some redesign if that spin is rapid, or learning how to make a gravity turn that stays on course when that spin is very slow. You can also use thrusters to stabilize spin but do so manually as the current ASAS setup will waste fuel like crazy while under power flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorse case scenario for deep space missions, launch straight up with no gravity turn. Launch at dawn to visit the outer planets and at dusk for the inner ones.
