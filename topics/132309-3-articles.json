So much misinformation. Where to begin...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, there are a bunch of pyramidal chemical charges with\u00A0detonators inside nuclear weapons. At least, there were in the earliest spherical implosion warheads. Later designs used more advanced two-point\u00A0implosion. But in all these cases, the role of the chemical explosive was to precisely implode the fissile mass with enough inertial confinement to allow supercriticality to be reached. Once the actual nuclear chain reaction was triggered, the chemical explosives were utterly\u00A0useless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChemical shaped charges and nuclear shaped charges serve the same function, to a degree, but they use completely different and unrelated mechanisms. A chemical shaped charge uses an explosive material molded into the form of a concave lens. When the explosive is detonated the combustion takes place on the surface of lens so that the supersonic, superheated gases from the explosive are inertially focused into a thin, penetrating stream that cuts through pretty much anything.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast, you cannot really shape or mold a\u00A0nuclear\u00A0explosive to produce\u00A0a comparable\u00A0effect, because the nuclear explosive depends on a particular geometry in order to achieve criticality. A nuclear device can only be spherical, as in the case of a fission warhead,\u00A0or cylindrical, as in the case of a Teller-Ullam thermonuclear fusion bomb. In either case, the explosion is so viciously energetic that it will\u00A0smooth out any inhomogeneities into a gigantic spherical plasma death ball every time. No way to shape that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it is possible to use a portion of the energy from the exploding nuke - usually the xrays - to redirect momentum in a particular way. That is how a Teller-Ullam\u00A0device works,\u00A0after all. Something very dense, like tungsten, will be able to absorb a large portion of the x-ray spectrum energy even though it isn\u0027t going to be able to physically confine the explosion.

Nuclear reactions don\u0027t stop the moment the fusion reaction reach thier peak, they continue on depending on pressure and temperature and also neutron density. So the area of the reaction where this is the highest will push out in the direction where it is lowest. The idea of shaping nuclear weapons came about for he following reason, as the pictures show a nuclear explosion occur in largely a three dimensional space, but all the targets lie essentially on a two dimensional plane, therefore have a 100 megaton bomb is not 5 times more useful than a 20 megaton. So the basic idea was to steer the explosion so that the blast wave moved primarily in the X,Z directions and not in the Y. The problem has basically been solved by other methods, namely just making more smaller weapons and clustering their detonations. This is not to say it has not been done or no-one is doing it, its just that have a Tsar Bomb in your arsenal affords certain bragging rights, but the Russian have tended to focus more on multiwarhead missiles than on making directional super bombs.
