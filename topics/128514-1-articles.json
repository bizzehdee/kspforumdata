I can see it on the counter of unknown objects in the tracking station. But they disappear with a much lower rate. That means, after a couple of ingame days, I have hundreds of asteroids. That would be a problem in itself, but it leads to massive drop in performance while playing, fps going below 10.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is either a bug in stock ksp or the New Horizons Mod, I guess...\u00A0 any help would be welcome to get rid of this behaviour .... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T18:20:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only ever have a handful here, ten at best after 2-3 years of kerbaltime gameplay, so it might be mod-related.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
