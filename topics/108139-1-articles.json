Probes are cheaper, lighter, and come pre-trained so past the point of unlocking solar panels on the tech tree why would I use a pilot kerbal?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with this not sitting right with me in much the same way every mod that has played with kerbal skills has given the formerly useless engineer a job I\u0027m wondering if anyone out there knows a mod that that gives you a reason to use a pilot?(besides remote tech I don\u0027t want to add comsat micro management to the list of things career makes me grind)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
