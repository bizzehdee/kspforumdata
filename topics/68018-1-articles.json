Except when you run out of batteries.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHandy tip if transmission is an issue: when an EVA kerbal does a \u0022gather data\u0022 from a command pod containing a crew report, and then \u0022stores data\u0022 back into the pod, the crew report is moved from the \u0022report\u0022 slot to the general experiment pool. This lets you do another crew report (from a different location, otherwise it\u0027s redundant) on the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do that in my RemoteTech modded save when my Kerbals are in communication blackout but a new crew report opportunity presents itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T14:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo like sciguyCO stated with the crew reports. If you did another crew report then you override the existing report in place of the one you just created. So you replaced one of your experiments. As long as you have a transmission dish and solar panels, you should be able to always transmit your crew reports for 100% science value and that allows you to do many of them in one mission without having to transfer the data to the kerbals. Other than that, I believe that all other experiments that are stored in the command pod should always be there and there\u0027s no actual limit to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KyleofKerbin","CreatedById":96229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T18:38:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of 0.23, Capsules had a maximum number of crew reports added. This maximum was(I think) 3 DIFFERENT reports or 1 SAME report. If you have 2 of the same report, it asks you to dump one. You can store up to 5 science experiments inside the first capsule in Career mode. You can store a lot more as you progress through the tree. As far as other experiments like Mystery Goo go, you can only have one of the same report on those if you want lots of science; otherwise, you get your science amount reduced substantially. Also, even with the Mobile Science Lab if you have a 0% Transmission Rate and it says \u002B10% if it\u0027s put through the Lab, you\u0027ll still have 0%. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T05:47:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KyleofKerbin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KyleofKerbin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can store up to 5 science experiments inside the first capsule in Career mode.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure this part isn\u0027t so.
