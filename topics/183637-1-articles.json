The reason being is that Eve keeps traveling at it\u0027s orbital velocity around the Sun so that it will drift away from the encounter by the time you meet it. Think about leading the target like in a ballistics game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe result when aiming ahead (leading the target) that you would just end up with a eccentric solar orbit that has no target encounter but would just continue to circle the Sun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome ION craft of mine have 40K\u002B \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E.
