It was far more maneuverable then previous X craft and had sufficient performance to change runways before landing at Dryden. The X-24\u0027s concept would lead to the direct development of the ISS X-34 project (which was cancelled) and later the US Air Force X-37 spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022X-24B_zpsm2tjhczt.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u243/TheSpaceballs/X-24B_zpsm2tjhczt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMSP T-5B \u0022Top Flight\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDevelopment of the T-5 spaceplane began with initial concept of a runway launched aircraft which would \u0022skip\u0022 over the atmosphere in sub-orbital hops, without the use of a carrier aircraft, or the use of a large rocket launch platform. Once the air frame design was finalized, a number of aircraft were produced under the T-5B designation. These aircraft were not optimized for space flight, but did reproduce the general handling characteristics of the space plane. The aircraft were powered by the J-404 \u0022Panther\u0022 Jet engine, and featured simple\u00A0airbreaks. Some engineers and test pilots questioned the \u0022nose up\u0022 additude of the aircraft while sitting on the runway, but this feature proved to be advantageous to the aircraft\u0027s handling characteristics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002270dc0faa-2701-445e-be01-03282f8758bf_zps\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u243/TheSpaceballs/70dc0faa-2701-445e-be01-03282f8758bf_zpsclz9ovro.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMSP T-5G \u0022Top Flight\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter several developmental models and wind tunnel tests as well as Test Pilot feedback from the T-5B and T-5C programs, Matagorda Space Program rolled out the rocket takeoff assisted T-5G model, which was powered by the CR-7 Rapier Engine, and boosted into the air by the RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 solid rocket booster. This novel approach allowed the T-5G to quickly gain lift and speed as it cleared the runway, saving the aircrafts external tanks and internal fuel for ascent, and powered landings. After leaving the atmosphere, the CR-7 engine will switch to LOS, and the external fuel tanks can be jettisoned to gain additional speed for a sub-orbital flight. Upon re-entry, the T-5G would rely on a series of six air breaks to slow the craft sufficiently to keep it from burning up as it decelerated to less than 500mps. At this point, the CR-7 engine can be re-started and the aircraft flown to a safe landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226cd71ce0-0223-4b6b-9735-67bc89886bf1_zps\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u243/TheSpaceballs/6cd71ce0-0223-4b6b-9735-67bc89886bf1_zpsq4fy7qew.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is enough interest, I\u0027ll gladly produce the flight profiles, ship files, and a bit more information about them.

They were roughly the expected weight of the sub-orbital flight article. Once these initial wind tunnel tunnel and static article tests were completed, the MSP Aeronautical Division produced a flight article model based around the J-404 \u0022Panther\u0022 jet engine. The aircraft did not feature the re-entry systems intended for the craft. Early models of the T-5B also included dual drag \u0027chutes and an ejection system, but these systems were removed when the aircraft was certified for serial production as a Astronaut and Test Pilot training aircraft. Early test pilots reported that the T-5B was very graceful at slower speeds, but more than capable of high performance speeds above Match 2. The external fuel tanks produced noticeable drag on the aircraft, and jettisoning them significantly increased the aircraft\u0027s performance. The T-5B will lift off from the runway around 120mps or faster with a gentle nudge back on the control stick.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFlight Profile:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTest Pilot \u0026amp; Astronaut Training Aircraft (Free Flight)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u243/TheSpaceballs/2015-12-12_00016_zpsxqjrl0at.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222015-12-12_00016_zpsxqjrl0at.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u243/TheSpaceballs/2015-12-12_00021_zpshxesdhm1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222015-12-12_00021_zpshxesdhm1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFlight Notes \u0026amp; Performance\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Once we got the aeronautical data from the full sized fuselage mock-ups, some of the junior members and test pilots suggested we try a powered flight. Converting one of the T-5A mock-ups for the task wasn\u0027t too difficult. What surprised us though, was just how well it really flew. We knew the aircraft was going to be impressive enough, but when we passed her off to the test pilots we couldn\u0027t believe the agility the advanced canard design offered. We put those there to increase lift during a sub-orbital ascent, and when the aircraft was flown conventionally it ended up being something of a sports car.\u0022 - \u003Cstrong\u003EDouglas Lee (Project Leader, T-5B)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I knew when I first took off from the runway that the T-5B was going to end my career. I was already close to fifty years old at this point, but my level of experience was such that I couldn\u0027t get out of it. The damned thing almost popped my neck, the turn radius was so good and I was used to adjusting my body around to counteract the g-forces. I had to retire after four missions, because I tensed too hard on a hard bank. Had to tell my buddies about it so they wouldn\u0027t repeat the mistake.\u0022 \u003Cstrong\u003E- John Old (T-5 Program Test Pilot)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDownload the Craft File Here:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByygDcuGFHYPN1RWajhlTEJmcm8/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByygDcuGFHYPN1RWajhlTEJmcm8/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
