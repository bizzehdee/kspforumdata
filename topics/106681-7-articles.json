Please don\u0027t do this. The discussion is about how the atmosphere interacts with our craft.

I have been testing things. I am glad to here that other people are having good luck with fairings, gives me hope when I get to larger craft where a extra .1t won\u0027t matter so much. On the other had, heat shields were valuable in 1.0, but in 1.01 even craft which are heavy for their size slow dramatically in the upper atmosphere in my experience. It really does not matter to me how much the slowing is exactly. It is the fact that much like nose cones were wasted tonnage before, now heat shields seem to be in the same category that bothers me. I do wonder if the drag from radially attached parts slows the craft quickly enough to save them from temperature problems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am going to give things a week and see how they develop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was under the impression that heat shields were only expected to be needed in extreme situations...not for typical reentries from low orbits on Kerbin, Laythe, or Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoToH","CreatedById":68428,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:22:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was under the impression that heat shields were only expected to be needed in extreme situations...not for typical reentries from low orbits on Kerbin, Laythe, or Duna.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 6Km PE from near out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI (79Mm AP) is not what I would call \u0022low orbit\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KBFckYM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KBFckYM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T22:27:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DoToH\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:56:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd just how high was your surface speed at 70km?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:57:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeatshielding is always going to be a bit weird as long as the planets stay small. There are two main directions the game design can go. One is to just follow realistic heating, which is likely to mean heatshields are rarely needed unless perhaps you also make regular parts burn up extra-easily.
