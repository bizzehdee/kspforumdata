There was absolutely no change in the atmosphere from 1.0 to 1.0.2. There was a considerable increase in dragcube (i.e. not wing) drag, but a slight decrease in wing drag.\n\n2. 1.0\u0027s (and thus 1.0.2\u0027s) atmosphere is thicker than .90\u0027s, and so to compare drag at a given place between .90 (presumably with FAR) and 1.0.2, you need to compare density altitudes. 0.5kg/m^3 occurs around 14km in 1.0 (and thus 1.0.2). **Note: In FAR, set density to ABS mode, it starts in REL mode.**\n\n3. 1.0 had much, much less drag than FAR (on .90) did. Terminal velocity for the Mk1 pod was ~100m/s in FAR in .90 near sea level, and 170\u002Bm/s in 1.0. Up high, say at density-altitude 0.1kg/m^3, you could get an extra 500m/s off the same thrust on the same craft. Delta V to orbit in FAR was about 3400, minimum, 3600 average; in 1.0 it was 2800 and 3300 respectively.\n\n4. Even in 1.0.2, there\u0027s less drag up high. Top speed at 0.1kg/m^3 for the same craft with the same thrust is ~100m/s higher in 1.0.2 than in FAR-0.90. Down low, however, drag is much higher in 1.0.2 than in FAR.\n\nI encourage people to stop speculating and stop going off perception and to *actually test stuff.*"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T20:52:53Z","Content":"After doing some research and listening to other people, the problem is that the parts were not rebalanced for new drag.

In 1.0 I took a ~$35k rocket, shot straight up to 100 km and then turned 90 degrees before achieving orbit, and it was no huhu... In 1.0.2, that rocket mysteriously has a TWR of 0.62 in the second stage, and can\u0027t get past 16 or 17 km. But since no masses increased or thrusts decreased, as far as I can tell, and drag alone isn\u0027t capable of giving it \u003C1 TWR, I can only conclude there was a mass-hiding exploit with the service bay (Eliminated all other possibilities), and that the utter lack of any informative statistics in the VAB enabled me to create a super-efficient rocket that abused it without even realizing that I had found and was using an exploit to enable it to be so efficient. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nEdit: Maybe heat shields are for returning from other planets.
