That is going to cause debugging issues at some point due to bad installs. CKAN is pulling the right data from Kerbalstuff. Where version 22.2 is stored. What it is not doing is assigning Firespitter as a required download. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how it is supposed to work in a way. Module Manager for example does not appear in there because it is used by so many mods. It is better to keep one master copy elsewhere on CKAN and have it downloaded as a requirement. Firespitter appears to work the same way. Trouble is pulling Firespitter out of the SXT download also takes away the sounds folder. The code .dll and resource configs are available elsewhere but that does not replace the sounds folder. The .wav files look like they are bundled with the Firespitter folder in version 22.2. Perhaps they need to be in the SXT folder?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry that is the best explanation of what I am seeing in my game. The solution appears to be a manual download and copying of the sounds folder into the CKAN version of the Firespitter core folder.
