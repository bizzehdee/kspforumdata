Collective changes the pitch of the rotors - more pitch, more drag (fuel consumption could go up), more lift. For a given collective, you\u0027d have a given atmospheric/velocity curve. Change the collective, the curve changes too. I envisage this as a modifier variable multiplied by those values.

The rotation is just an illusion. After the engine has spun up, it maintains a constant rotation speed that\u0027s tuned to look OK at 60fps. You wouldn\u0027t be able to notice a change in rotation speed expect for changes in the glitchy way it displays on screen (Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll get the blur disc in there later).

When you increase throttle (or collective if you will), the engine responds immediately, just like blade pitch would.
