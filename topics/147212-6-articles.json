And what they don\u0027t like they can switch off\u0027, rather than an attitude of \u0027why are we introducing this feature? How does it enhance existing features or make the game more fun as a whole*.\u0027 It actively \u003Cem\u003Edetracts\u003C/em\u003E from having game elements that interact in meaningful or interesting ways - how can you do that when\u00A0your game elements\u00A0are intended to be stand-alone features that can be switched off as required?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFine, you end up with a very customizable \u0027game\u0027.

The options screen would have more buttons, knobs, sliders and assorted doohickeys than the Apollo command module and you\u0027d spend more time setting the game up than actually playing it. Seriously, \u0027make it optional\u0027 and \u0027there\u0027s a mod for that\u0027 are the two most common answers to anything on this forum and (in my personal opinion), the two most irritating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Edit.

But the fallacy you seem to be making is the whole to parts fallacy. This is basically assuming that because too many switches are bad, therefore (the unspoken middle term\u00A0that this syllogism implies) most if not all switches are bad, therefore this switch in particular is bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo matter how anyone tries to slice it, the fact that too many switches are bad\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Edoes NOT and never, ever will\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0mean that this switch in particular is bad. Ever!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo illustrate, I\u0027ll take this assumption and put it in a different context so you can see just how absurd it is. Too much water will kill you, right? This assumption would be like saying that since too much water will kill you, therefore this particular glass I\u0027m holding will kill me, so I better not drink it. Whoever uses that assumption will end up very wrong and very dead. Now you can go to town and present all kinds of evidence that this switch in particular is bad, but please do not say it follows from the fact that too many are bad. My argument is not directed at ksk, it is directed at his unfortunately faulty logic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt really annoys me when people badmouth the dev team in front of everyone else. I believe that we ought to start off by appreciating the fact that KSP is here to play at all. I, for one, did not install those mods because I heard\u00A0they had been stockified in 1.2. I am looking forward to the release, and I think that remote tech will add a great deal of realism to career game play. Has anyone thought that the toggle feature might be because remote tech would be annoying in Sandbox? I mean that would majorly suck if remote tech had to be used in Sandbox mode.

That I don\u0027t want. I personally think that the toggle is a very wise decision on the part of the dev team. It satisfies the demands of both sides (the realism and fun sides). It\u0027s just that a third side decided to form since they \u0027didn\u0027t like the toggle\u0027. People find problems with everything others do, no matter what anyone does. Somebody always finds SOMETHING to dispute. Now if you actually want my personal opinion, I just think that the toggle is a wise idea, just please don\u0027t try to compromise too much.
