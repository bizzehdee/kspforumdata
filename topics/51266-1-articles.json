It was designed to beat the Americans to the moon. We here at NASI did the same thing. Except there was no \u0022America,\u0022 only the United Provinces States And Territories of The Federal Democratic Republic And Confederation of Kerbin. And we got there first. Anyway, the Soi Ooze 7K-LOK comes fully equipped with one Kerbal, enough snacks for 7 days, enough RCS to allow constant mishaps while docking, and over 1600m/s of dV to achieve a, but not limited to, Munar circularization burn with a lander, a burn to land back at Kerbin, a burn to get back into orbit around Kerbin, or several burns to achieve a Munar flyby. While there are some bugs, they are minor and can be fixed by a simple switch between the space center and back, or a simple restart depending on the bug you encounter*. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of its patented Kerbal-In-A-Fuel-Tank\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 clipping technology, there may come a time where you do not empty all of your fuel out of the command pod area. Because of silly safety regulations, it was required that we add something more than a single parachute to soften the landing. So we added some somewhat-controlled explosives, otherwise known as a Sepraton I. The MSRB (miniature solid rocket booster) is enough to slow down the landing from 10m/s to about 1-2m/s depending on how early or late you activate it. And if you need to, it is also capable of picking you up just in case you landed on that krabbit that had looked pretty tasty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*There are two bugs, one where the 1.) craft will not turn at all after undocking, and another where 2.) the craft will flex at the docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) This can be remedied by restarting the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.)
