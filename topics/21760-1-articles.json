But this is difficult to eyeball sometimes, and depending on where the two planets are in their orbits when the phase angle is right to start the transfer burn, I might not actually cross that point until after I should have intercepted the target planet. I hope that makes sense, and that I\u0027m using the terminology correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a better way to do this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kiershar","CreatedById":40861,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T15:37:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESay you just did your transfer burn and your orbit is reaching the target\u0027s orbit.

Another question: I\u0027m using the protractor mod, and it was several degrees off on predicting the right duna phase angles for me. If I started my burn when the phase angles were at zero, I got to Duna\u0027s orbit several degrees ahead of it and missed it by a few million miles. Is this a common problem? Eve worked fine for me once I figured the inclination part out, so I\u0027m a little surprised. I guess I\u0027ll launch at 355 instead of zero and see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elmach","CreatedById":28977,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T21:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a subtle difference between rendezvousing with a spacecraft and rendezvousing with a planet -- the planet has gravity and a visible SOI marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, when aiming for a planet, it is not best to do your orbital inclination change at the point where your orbits cross.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is best about ten days before you meet up with the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere, do burns to meet up with the planet\u0027s SOI, then do burns to lower your planet-periapsis and change your planet-orbital plane.
