I have completed the plant growth experiment then returned it to the surface, recovered it and got 50 science. However I have completed the experiment for a second time and I have got no science at all, according to the report. If I don\u0027t remember it wrong, we were able to repeat the same experiment for several times, but for less science gain.

In fact, it seems that contract objectives are reset when you stop pointing the ship embedding the experiment. For example, there is the same issue if you go back to the space center during the experiment or if you switch between the ship and the space station during the docking maneuver. I didn\u0027t have time to try it yet, but i think if you right click to the command pod of the ship and choose \u0022control from here\u0022 before undocking, the focus will be set to the ship and not to the station after undocking, and the objectives will be preserved\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
