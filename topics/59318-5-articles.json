I was chatting to a particle physicists, fact is we can get fusion going easy enough but the problems are sustaining it (Reactor burns out) or geting a positive energy return on it, well with a engine those problems are non issues really as you not trying to sustain it with pulses which takes the temeprature burden off and allthough a postive energy return would be nice its not essential as you can have another power source on board that makes up the energy deficiet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T11:18:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Klingon Admiral\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Klingon Admiral\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAerospace engineers most certainly do great work all the time.
