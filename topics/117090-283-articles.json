The poor support for animations is perplexing, but yes I\u0027m sure you\u0027re right that that would be a pain. Is there any reasonably easy mechanism where we could have an attachment node at the end for the probes/satellites that could extend out of the bay?\n\u003E \n\nThe limitation in KSP is that you cannot move other parts or any attach nodes with an animation, you can only animate the mesh of the part.  About the only option for a probe-carrier is to add decouplers with 0 force.\n\nIf you did want to model such a part, please keep in mind that the PartModule that runs the system expects the models to be constructed in a specific fashion.  Each \u0027length\u0027 of the modular part needs to be its own distinct model / mesh, and the plugin switches between these prebuilt models at run-time.  So from a modeling perspective it is best to build the base model in a modular fashion -- one end piece that is mirrored for the other end, and one central piece that can be duplicated to extend the length (that is all you would need to model/texture; from there I would do the duplication/etc to create the unique lengths).  This is the setup I use as it allows the end-pieces to have a different AO setup from the repeated middle section, while still allowing for re-use of both the end and middle sections, all while keeping texture size down to a minimum.\n\nA 1x length part would be setup like: End - Middle - End  \n\nA 2x length part would be setup like: End - Middle - Middle - End  \n\nA 3x length part would be setup like: End - Middle - Middle - Middle - End\n\nReally though anything will work as long as each \u0027length\u0027 of the part has its own model.  Technically you could even export just the \u0027pieces\u0027 and recomposite them through config (e.g. you export just the end and middle, and put them together to form the finished model through the equivalent of MODEL nodes); might actually be easier from a modeling program/Unity perspective as there are fewer models to deal with.  Hmm... could actually reduce memory use (both distro size and RAM use) a tiny bit by doing that as well..."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-23T16:41:08Z","Content":"[@Mike](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/22132-mike/) [@T-10a](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/176203-t-10a/)  Adjusting the thrusts is no problem, that is a one line thing for every part with the EngineFX module.

Yeah, I\u0027de say that is pretty efficient use of textures, considering stock might use ~2mb of textures for a single part.  It is slightly less efficient looking when you start adding in more texture sets -- until you consider that in stock each of the new texture sets would be the equivalent of adding 104 new unique parts.   For reference, the existing LC tanks use a total of ~12mb of textures, for a single texture set.  The new layout will only add \u003C2mb per additional texture set (the diff/met/nrm maps are small and minimal, and only a single one is needed across all variants).\n\n(not done yet on figuring out the texture layout; might be able to trim it down more, or it might end up needing more/larger textures....)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-23T22:01:29Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2017 10:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-23T22:50:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, T-10a said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Lining up a even moonshot to test out a kickass moon rocket took a looooong time thanks to the inclination change.

To help out myself, I send up a probe first to 1000km and align that with the moon orbit. This gives a line in mapview in a LEO which is easier to line up when launching. When your launch site passes under the line, launch into either a \u002B28.36 or -28.36 degrees and you can do an easy hohman transfer after getting a circular orbit.
