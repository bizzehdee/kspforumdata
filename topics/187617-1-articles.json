Dont know a better way to communicate.\u00A0If anyone else wants to spark off this or chime in please do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP1 Kerbals gain\u00A0experience rank by missions which enables better abilities but a second mission within the same rank-range avails\u00A0zero experience.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI always thought it would\u00A0be nice if there was experience to be gained by Kerbals becoming an old hand and running many missions within the same experience rank-range, so gaining a prestigious flight time record.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe suggestion I have for this is to add another dimension to kerbal experience, lets call it proficiency, plus add training to the Kerbal astronaut complex, where experienced Kerbals can pass on their skills to new recruits in training facilities.\u00A0The idea is, as Kerbals fly they gain proficiency points in the same way they would get experience points but they keep on getting them with every flight even if it is to the same location. Proficiency levels require significantly more points though. Then when they have a high enough proficiency they can teach other Kerbals some of what they know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince no amount of theory can prepare astronauts the way actually flying does, it might be more credible if Kerbals who become trainers can only raise recruits to one rank less than the level of their own experience and only when they have enough proficiency and adequate facilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo simplify it to mathematical language, max training rank is the smaller of (experience rank -1) or (proficiency rank).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ne.g. A level 3 pilot with level 2 proficiency could train Kerbal pilots up to level 2.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nA level 5 scientist with level 2 proficiency could train Kerbal scientists up to level 2.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA level 4 engineer with level 3 proficiency could train Kerbal engineers up to level 3.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA level 3 engineer with level 3 proficiency could train Kerbal engineers up to level 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNaturally a trainer cannot be flying at the same time as training, so experienced Kerbals would only be able to train while assigned to astronaut\u00A0complex duties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile time can always be warped in KSP it would also make gameplay sense if training rate was related to Kerbal recruit \u0022stupidity\u0022 and trainer proficiency. So a trainer with higher proficiency would train Kerbals faster than a trainer with lower proficiency and Kerbal recruits with low stupidity would rise in experience rank while training faster than Kerbals with high stupidity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also seems like a valid idea that adding (expensive) training facilities to the Astronaut complex would enhance the speed of training and perhaps raise the cap on the highest experience rank a Kerbal can reach through training alone. So a level three complex can train Kerbals to level 3 max for example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther to this, it might be nice if proficiency rank can raise experience rank as well and enable better skills, meaning\u00A0a Kerbal can never have higher proficiency than experience rank, but will take a lot of missions in the same rank-range to gain a proficiency rank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that makes sense, hope you like it \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0watjafink?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-28T15:16:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2019 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ebecause I cant spell !\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-26T09:46:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther to the above, given what is known about KSP2 colonies, proficiency mechanics would need to work with the scenario of colonies as well as the ability of the space lab to update kerbal experience rank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that if a kerbal gains proficiency with every mission then unlike experience which is a one off bonus per activity type, proficiency would be added with every repetition.\u00A0If a kerbal is in a space lab or similar training related building which can update proficiency far from Kerbin, then if the proficiency is calculated like experience (relative to Kerbin) then the kerbal could add proficiency for just sitting there and updating repeatedly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if proficiency is updated at a remote location then that location becomes the new home location and further proficiency would be calculated for missions relative to that location (even if the building which allows the update moves from the location, even if it moves with the kerbal). The resulting mechanic, while logical and representing an advantage of colonies/labs/training facilities\u00A0means\u00A0a doubling of proficiency points since a trip to Minmus and back to Kerbin for example could result in twice the proficiency if there is a proficiency update facility on Minmus. So\u00A0the proficiency point requirements for ranks (which IMHO should scale geometrically with rank to make higher ranks harder to get) would need to take that into account but it is another reason why such facilities are worth having. Such an advantage can be considered to represent\u00A0effective\u00A0debriefing and mission planning at the facility, not to mention a coffee machine and snacks dispenser.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis problem of mission value relative to other locations besides Kerbin needs to be solved anyway for kerbal reproduction at colonies based on accomplishments. (Sounds like it must involve some pretty wild parties.) Doing the same for proficiency would not add this development task but would make the most of something\u00A0which needs to be developed anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-26T09:54:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2019 09:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-26T20:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis whole idea of kerbals training kerbals comes into its own when you consider how\u00A0kerbals can help the space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are already pilots of course and\u00A0the scientists and engineers can place surface experiments, run space labs making science and ore digging and refining machinery making fuels.\u00A0Which is why I think they could help with operations in KSP2 as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example a\u00A0colony \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E might be able to build cheaper or bigger or with more parts with better engineers overseeing operations and giving them a %\u00A0bonus depending on their skill rank.

Considering colonies are likely to have the more\u00A0experienced scientists, due to\u00A0the way\u00A0distance increases rank they might be able to send their more advanced construction technology\u00A0to the rest of kerbalkind by developing\u00A0blueprints which can be sent as\u00A0data (either transported as documents by interstellar couriers or transmitted if powerful enough tranmitters can make a connection)\u00A0to other colonies and back to Kerbin adding the % bonus from the research conducted elsewhere to those facilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a few ideas for why it might be fun to have highly trained steely eyed missile kerbals on the job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nikokespprfan","CreatedById":136115,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-26T20:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat made you come up with this.

I also recently watched First Man which may have something to do with it, as the film follows Neil Armstrong through the training program for the Apollo 11 moon landing.

This is because all the useful attributes/skills for kerbals are currently linked to experience rank, so rather than reinvent the existing mechanics,\u00A0proficiency does what you are suggesting by improving experience rank, for both very proficient pilots who can raise their experience\u00A0rank via gaining proficiency and trainees who can raise their rank before gaining further experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are absolutely correct about experience providing diminishing returns. In fact returns from experience diminish\u00A0to zero after\u00A0one trip. The whole\u00A0point about proficiency is it would continue\u00A0to accumulate and so it is worth sending experienced pilots out to gain more proficiency and it creates a choice dilemma between sending noob kerbals out to gain experience and raise their rank or setting up a trainer kerbal to train\u00A0them first so that when they do eventually gain experience they get even more rank, which adds skills and\u00A0can become a virtuous circle\u00A0because that increases the rank they can train other kerbals to (if they have enough proficiency).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts worth pointing out that with this mechanic as it stands, if noob kerbals go and get experience they cannot train later*, as they sooner reach a rank their trainer cannot surpass and have to go further afield to gain more experience the hard way, whereas if they train first then they start with an extra rank and can then add to that with experience from local expeditions which are quicker to do as they have shorter flight times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if this* is entirely a good thing since it suggests training is useless after experience is gained which is not always true since\u00A0further education like refresher and specialist\u00A0training and the educational interaction it entails is\u00A0often valuable and is why many good employers invest in continued\u00A0training.\u00A0Adding training after gaining experience would\u00A0be a minor mechanic which allows instituting a program of\u00A0further education among kerbals whereby the trainers could impart proficiency rather than simple experience rank. i.e. A further education kerbal trainer would be able to add\u00A0proficiency to kerbals once they have experience rank but again only a limited amount, probably the lesser of\u00A0the trainers\u00A0own proficiency level -1 or\u00A0the trainees experience rank -1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-27T10:00:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2019 10:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaerbanogue","CreatedById":189143,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-27T10:54:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think there will be a training system in the exact way you think it\u0027ll be.

Yes devs implied\u00A0its not good game design to solve colony growth by doing the timewarp\u00A0until our colony is bulging at the seams with baby kerbals, the other side of the coin is that in KSP time means something because of the way missions take time to fly and have to be planned around mission windows. Time is intrinsic to orbital mechanics and\u00A0a rocket sim, this is why they dont want to use magic tech like warp drives, because it would wreck the subtle illusion of the rocket simulation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLogically though, just because devs want more than\u00A0timewarp for colony growth does not mean they are against timewarp or time related gameplay. The point of timewarp is flights take time because they emulate reality and timewarp is there to make them more fun because they would take too long. In real life, training takes time, so that is part of the subtlety of the sim, which is why training absolutely cannot be instant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComparing colony expansion with kerbal training, the two objectives are on a different scale in terms of game goals, making the colony grow is a macro game goal whereas training a kerbal is a micro game goal. The question is the kind of gameplay each encourages. Will players while away the game timewarping to get better kerbals or\u00A0respect and work with\u00A0the training mechanic because of the advantages it can offer?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving a kerbal in training for a year really does make a difference to what missions they can go on because of mission windows but in KSP I find I have rescued many kerbals by mid game, plenty, too many, because they are lot cheaper than hiring but also I like the idea of saving kerbals, so\u00A0I have enough to do some training to provide advanced crews for an interstellar mission and dont need to screw up my mission timing\u00A0to\u00A0do it. So\u00A0I think using time is OK with training a kerbal just as it is with\u00A0with spaceflight, spacelab research and ground experiments because I think players will play with it and not make sim breaking short cuts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMHO training kerbals would add\u00A0to the subtlety of the sim and make choosing our crews a deeper more strategic decision, giving\u00A0us something\u00A0to play with which would remind us of NASA in \u0022First Man\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-28T09:45:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223658672\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187617\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566666395\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00226572\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022boolybooly\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/25/2019 at 1:06 AM, boolybooly said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile time can always be warped in KSP it would also make gameplay sense if training rate was related to Kerbal recruit \u0022stupidity\u0022 and trainer proficiency.
