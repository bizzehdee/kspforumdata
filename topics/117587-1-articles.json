I never installed a particular mod for this purpose, it just came along with some other mod. I wondered why it wasn\u0027t done that way stock. It was not the 0.23.5 mod that states this is it\u0027s purpose, it worked through 0.90 I believe, and again - was not a mod for this specific purpose.\n\nI don\u0027t use as many mods now in 1.0.x, and don\u0027t have this highlighting.\n\nDoes anyone know what mod does or did this?"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T13:36:22Z","Content":"Uh, that sounds like the stock highlighting:\n\n![4WuqjiW.png](http://i.imgur.com/4WuqjiW.png)\n\nMake sure you have \u0022edge highlighting\u0022 turned on in your graphics settings."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T13:38:00Z","Content":"Anti-aliasing needs to be on as well."},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T13:49:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Anti-aliasing needs to be on as well.\n\nTHAT would explain the \u0022HighlightingSystem : Edge Highlighting requires AA to work!\u0022 warnings I get throughout KSP.log - thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"0Kev","CreatedById":69511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T04:49:48Z","Content":"Hmm.
