The Air France crew decorated the jetway for Bastille Day, put on berets and handed out flags to the kids. One of the gate agents even got on the mic and sang \u0022La Marseillaise\u0022 to entertain us while we were waiting to board, and of course we all joined in. it felt kind of like that great scene in Casablanca, except instead of singing over \u0022Die Wacht am Rhein\u0022 we were competing with the boarding announcements for other flights.\n\nAnd here\u0027s a vacation photo I took especially for my friends on the Forum: \u0027Eve\u0027 and \u0022Jool\u0027 over the rooftops of Paris!
