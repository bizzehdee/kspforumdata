Totally been there. This doesn\u0027t quite sound like the simon says glitch I\u0027m aware of, but I\u0027ll mention the specifics just in case it helps. If you\u0027ve activated trim (alt\u002Bwasd), leave \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on and switch to another craft, the original craft will move in tandem with the new one. As far as I\u0027m aware it doesn\u0027t work on throttle though, so I\u0027m guessing your case is something different. A sure-fire sign it\u0027s the \u0027simon says\u0027 glitch is if the other craft always turns the same direction in response to your craft turning either left or right\u00A0 (same for up/down and CW/CCW). Trim can be accidentally activated by turning on physwarp (alt\u002B\u0026gt;) while maneuvering. It\u0027s reset to the off state by pressing alt\u002Bx. I hope this helps, but in case it doesn\u0027t feel free to make a quicksave and send the save file my way. We could atleast tell if it\u0027s a nuance of your setup or KSP in general causing the mischief!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like a cool glitch if you know when to expect it.
