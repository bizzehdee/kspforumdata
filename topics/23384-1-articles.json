E.g., it\u0027s invisible in the menu except for the hatch handle, and is a non-reflective black when rendered in real world. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought this must be because of a mod, except I ain\u0027t installed any mods between the time when the pod was normal and the time when it weren\u0027t. None of the mods I\u0027ve added change textures, either, so I don\u0027t know why they\u0027d be having an effect. Any idea on which ones might be responsible, or this just some other issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*edit* Fixed! It changed on reboot; I guess the game fudged the texture when loading files on start-up.
