As an American historian by trade, I can tell you he was \u003Cem\u003Every much\u003C/em\u003E into space exploration and even wanted to fully fund NASA even more than it was. His love of space and space exploration comes from a couple of things - he was an avid reader of what we now consider the \u0022classic\u0022 authors of science fiction. To be quite honest, and from what we know about his interests in space exploration, if he were alive today, he would probably support the surge of private corporate development of space travel as a means to make it more practical and affordable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure many a president, senator, and representative has had passion regarding spaceflight in their personal life. That doesn\u0027t automatically translate to policy action though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not to say Kennedy would have somehow been worse. I just think it would have been similar to what Johnson did. Perhaps if JFK was more of a space advocate for personal reasons, it could be said Johnson was motivated by the economic benefits it brought to the south (including to Texas).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, I\u0027ll bet Johnson would be on the side of SLS and against Commercial Crew if he were alive today lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003EJFK was fully behind Von Braun\u0027s vision of LEO stations being a permanent gateway to the Moon and beyond. Even some of the NASA historical archives support the view that had JFK been able to complete his first term, the Apollo program would not have abruptly ended (Apollo XX would have been the last mission, if the program ran to its conclusion). The Apollo missions were only a small part of what could have been. Had JFK lived, been elected for a second term, then it is quite possible the STS program would have been realized a full five years earlier than what it was.

It had to do with Congress\u0027 attitude after the Apollo 1 fire and who was president in 69-72. Apollo abruptly ended long after he would have had influence in decisions of the government.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think Kennedy would have been any more enthusiastic for post-Apollo plans than Johnson was. Johnson still pushed for full funding of Apollo Applications even after the Apollo 1 fire made it untenable, and it still didn\u0027t get through beyond Skylab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it could be said other factors played a role in NASA\u0027s existence and the path it took in the late 60s, but the factors at play in Apollo mainly related to JFK\u0027s memory, insofar as it was he who said the US would be the first to the Moon \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E do it before \u002769.

But NASA and America\u0027s space exploration efforts had a lot more enemies than LBJ. It also had a young but powerful senator, Walter Mondale (who, later, as Vice President under President Carter, would try to gut NASA and delay/de-fund the STS program), who was able to do a lot in Congress to cut the budget and restrict what NASA could do with its remaining budget.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLBJ was not \u0022anti-NASA\u0022 at all. As mentioned earlier, he requested quadruple what Congress ultimately gave AAP in FY 1968. I don\u0027t think this really amounted to either anti-NASA sentiment or actions \u0022to cut back its budget\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA themselves chose to cancel Apollo 20 in favor of using the Saturn V to launch Skylab. Congress did cut the budget, but they didn\u0027t play much of a role in what NASA decided to do. The responsibility for those decisions fell on the Nixon administration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSources-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.whitehousehistory.org/lyndon-b-johnson-forgotten-champion-of-the-space-race\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.whitehousehistory.org/lyndon-b-johnson-forgotten-champion-of-the-space-race\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/why-apollo-11-wouldnt-have-happened-without-lyndon-johnson/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.texasstandard.org/stories/why-apollo-11-wouldnt-have-happened-without-lyndon-johnson/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Apollo could not have been saved.
