The PC can be endlessly customized, can have better performance than a console for an equal or less amount of money, and can run more games. The games are also cheaper, especially during a Steam or GOG sale. PC\u0027s get free online access, you don\u0027t have to pay anything beyond what the phone company charges you for internet service. You can build your own computer to match the specs of the games you want to play, can make it look almost exactly how you want it with a wide selection of cases and LED modifications, and can generally do much, much more than a console. You can also work on your computer, clean it to help it run cooler and better, can add any parts you want down the road, and can upgrade it and make it better as you get more money for higher-performance parts. With consoles you\u0027ll break the TOS of your console if you crack the thing open, and on the XBox you an have your console banned.
