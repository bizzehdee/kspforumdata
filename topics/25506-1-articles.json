The only engine i found that would be perfect is the aerospike rocket but it has no gimbaling so control in atmosphere would need something else on it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joppiesaus","CreatedById":57698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T16:11:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn orbit construction is the easiest thing I guess\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erendrake","CreatedById":57164,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T18:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIMO if you want to have a refueling, planet hopping lander with Kethane. you should look into a slightly smaller lander and a larger craft that stays in orbit.
