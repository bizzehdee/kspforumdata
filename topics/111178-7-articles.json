This version will also include a fix to the Soyuz 4/5 issues. If I get time I will try and also make some re-balances to missions (since it is obvious that people are now progressing further into the pack!). Since this release will be 1.5.0 I am hoping to bring the number of contracts in the pack up to the big 500 (just for the record of the most contracts in a pack...ever... -- I have far too much time on my hands!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Talking of time, soon I will have little to spare for KSP modding what with University starting and all, (or I might have a lot more time... hmmm...) but things will certainly be changing around here.

I just tested the A-3 contract again to be sure and it definitely works; must be something wrong on your end? I checked my config file for Ranger-3 as well and the ReachState parameter for Escaping Mun is properly parsed, at least on my end, and it\u0027s not available at start in my test game. Well spotted however in the Luna-1 config file; \u003Cstrong\u003EWhitecat\u003C/strong\u003E if you could fix that in the master file I\u0027d be grateful!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you enjoy the whole pack, Sparco!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
