I did read that you need to install firespitter BEFORE installing B9 and overwriting everything, however, the version that comes with B9 is out of date and there is a newer version of firespitter available, so there is much confusion as what to do in order to get this working. Also what of the displays that do work are blurry as hell thanks to ATM and I can\u0027t figure out how to make ATM not screw up the MFD quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond issue I am having is relating to fuels. Tanks change texture happily, however no fuel gets applied to them whatsoever. I am certain that a mod may be overriding this, I know that the RCS tanks have no mono in them either. I did have Modular Fuel Tanks installed but it doesn\u0027t add LFO in the correct ratio and its a pain to manually add the fuel according to the correct LF/O ratio. So that is why I removed that mod, this is now where the tanks never have fuel in them now even though I selected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/9sxaidl2ba78meo/screenshot6.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/9sxaidl2ba78meo/screenshot6.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/upv3j53lp0ooxkj/screenshot7.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/upv3j53lp0ooxkj/screenshot7.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6pha8mv8o2n0pi/screenshot8.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/l6pha8mv8o2n0pi/screenshot8.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/581orbikcqf245a/screenshot9.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/581orbikcqf245a/screenshot9.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/1bevpdp2x5g1o00/screenshot10.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/1bevpdp2x5g1o00/screenshot10.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Horus","CreatedById":99705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T20:16:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to add a variant for MK2 Cargo Bay with doors opening to the bottom?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
