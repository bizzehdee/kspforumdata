From surface, the difference is about twice the body\u0027s surface rotation speed (sidereal rotational velocity) which can be found on Wiki. For instance Kerbin has surface rotation speed 174.53 m/s so to launch into retrograde orbit you need about 350 m/s more than to launch into prograde orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
