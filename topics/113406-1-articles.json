First, starting at the nose of the X-15, you will note the location of the pitch and yaw thrusters. These are powered by passing hydrogen peroxide over a catalyst and turning it into a high-pressure, high-temperature gas that is expelled through a nozzle producing a thrust of 40 to I 10 IN There are eight of these thrusters located in the nose. There are two of them located on both the top and bottom of the nose for pitch control, and another pair are located on either side of the nose to produce the left and right yaw control.\n\n[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/x15conf/design.html](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/x15conf/design.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"Justicier","CreatedById":89671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T22:57:17Z","Content":"Very cool!

They saw the obvious problem that it\u0027d take just one bullet (Or a \u0022well-aimed bow and arrow\u0022, as the Army put it) from the enemy and then the show would be over. The entire thing came, engine and all, in a 1 1/4 cu. Meter box, and was designed and built in 12 weeks, which is impressive considering what you get. Took only 5 minutes to blow up, you\u0027d start the engine (that would force air into the plane to keep it blown up) and on 20 gallons of fuel you got 6.5 hours or 390 miles of range before it quit.\n\nI certainly wouldn\u0027t mind having one.
