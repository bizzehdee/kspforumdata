I can get that sucker to glide forever. Problem is that I can\u0027t get it to glide where I want, yet. I need to actually try to learn how to de-orbit into an angle that lines up with the runway or close to it, even though I can land pretty much anywhere that\u0027s flat. Even the RCS works good on the first go around with them. A little more tuning and you\u0027ve got a darn good shuttle mod. Good job [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/). This is going to work very well. I haven\u0027t tried the engines yet, but it says in the engine description that it will cause your stage to become unstable. Works in progress tend to not work the way you want them to the first, second or third time around, even though these are brand new engines. There are a lot of things to work out on them. \n\nIn regards to the empty shuttle and configure your own parts - that\u0027s totally up to you. But as you say, it\u0027s still to early to decide on that. But as I tested, the darn thing flies great with a touch of instability. But, what can we expect after just starting on this thing, right?
