It has a Mk 3 cargo bay opening on the ventral side, rotates at about 60 m/s with a built-in positive angle-of-attack during ground roll. It includes lots of airbrakes and the large landing gear is configured to maximum braking force. Flaps are also included, with an inboard and outboard set.\n\nCanards were also added mainly for low speed handling on landing.\n\n![oScwKZc.png](http://i.imgur.com/oScwKZc.png)\n\n[Great Condor Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/QS9Lo#0)\n\nLink to stock only .craft file soon... ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"}]}
