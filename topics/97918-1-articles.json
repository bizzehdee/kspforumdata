It\u0027s the mix of light and dark combined with that magnificent central peak that does it for me. I\u0027ve been getting competent at missions to the Moon with the Realism Overhaul set of mods, and I finally was able to land a mission in it. Here it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/qeR1i\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

And with the real Moon you also don\u0027t have to worry about the orbiter\u0027s orbit being unstable over time, if you want to spend more than a few days on the surface. So as my Kerbals continue to explore and develop the Moon I will go exclusively with direct missions. And they\u0027re only about 10-20% heavier at launch for the same cargo on the Moon as a LOR mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m using all of the required RO mods, as well as most of the recommended ones except for Engine Ignitors and Remote Tech. And about 3/4 of the suggested mods as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T21:04:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice!

When I first touched the atmosphere I had the lift pushing down because I used a vacuum perigee of 65km, the highest I\u0027ve yet tried. I made sure the 1st perigee would get down to about 58 km before rotating the lift to be upward. I stay upward until around 65km then try to stay between 70 and 60km as long as possible. I took that picture while in the middle of an up-down switch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I keep trying to lower the maximum gees during re-entry, my best is about 4.8 gees so far. Though I think the real astronauts took a less complicated path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I love the descent mode, it\u0027s yet another nice touch of realism.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
