People can complain all they like but all studios care about is how folks vote with their wallets.

From a technical standpoint, the team appears to be doing exceptionally well, albeit moving a bit slowly. The For Science update was incredibly well-executed and very well received. While there have been some noted complaints of missing or incomplete gameplay aspects, the technical execution was nearly flawless with only a few minor issues refined in 0.2.1. They nailed a lot of the core gameplay aspects, improved performance yet again, and knocked out more bugs in the process while introducing virtually none.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you are describing sounds more like what may have happened with Star Theory and led to the current situation the team is in currently where they are having to devote a lot of time and effort to cleanup past mistakes to get the code base into a good state... but that does appear to be happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarren\u00A0shared on discord some of what they do for testing and it is the full suite of best practices for the industry and likely a major contributing factor to both the smooth release of For Science and part of why development seems slow.\u00A0 It\u0027s because it is by some view of it. Given the long-term development plans for the game, heavy focus on testing is a very smart move as it ensures the work they are doing now will continue to work through the long development life of the title. I suspect a lot of effort is still needed to clean up past mistakes and is why many of the older standing bugs have not been resolved yet... because they are doing it right to ensure unit and regression testing will prevent reemergence through future updates. I suspect this all comes from a change approach in the development process, likely when moving from Star Theory to IG.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem does not appear to me that they are doing a poor job at the technical level, the opposite in that regard. The root problem is as this whole thread has been created for is that they, for whatever reason, don\u0027t want to speak to any of this and are keeping everyone in the dark about just about all work that is actually happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t disagree with the facts you\u0027re saying but I do disagree with their interpretation.\u00A0 I think they have ground to a very slow pace because that\u0027s the only pace they can produce relatively bug free code.\u00A0 This in itself would not be a bad thing, but the problem here is that in addition to being slow, the content they do produce is not really that complicated or difficult. If you look at the science system, it\u0027s incredibly simple. The design is mostly just lifted off from KSP1 and given a small QOL update, but they didn\u0027t really have to think about any new systems or gameplay. Everything else is copied over too, all the way down to majority of parts and even the stock crafts. Don\u0027t underestimate how much time they should also have saved just because absolutely everything was already solved once (for better of for worse) by the KSP1 team, all they have to do is figure out the technical part of how to copy it over to the new codebase and new version of Unity.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this goes throughout the whole game. They spent a lot of time pondering about the wobble situation and ended up with just repeating KSP1 solution because they couldn\u0027t figure out anything better. They already know how the maneuver nodes should work, but they don\u0027t seem to know how to make them work. They already knew that the KSP1 science system is kinda meh, but they couldn\u0027t figure out anything better so just took the old one anyway and just implemented a feature to allow you to basically bypass the entire thing.\u00A0 They\u0027ve admitted the UI is not good, but apparently changing a font is too hard. They know the part manager sucks big time, but they can\u0027t figure out anything better. They know the delta-v display is incorrect but they can\u0027t seem to figure out anything better.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree the science update was of good technical quality but you\u0027re giving them a lot of credit for producing a simple thing and then fixing some major bugs. I\u0027m not so experienced with Unity that I could argue about their technical competence more than this though, but I can say with confidence that their game design skills as a team are on the level of cash-grab mobile game developers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis in turn comes back to the communication. I think Dakota and Mike seem to be doing a fine job all things considered but it\u0027s very very hard to keep the community engaged and interested when the dev team hands you stuff like the eclipse thing which amounted to \u0022we turn down the lights a bit.\u0022 I\u0027ll happily come back to admit I was wrong if it turns out to be so, but if the dev team is actually cooking something interesting then we\u0027re back to having poor communication. When colonies finally do come, I\u0027m fairly sure they will be exactly as the science was. They will work, but it will be a very basic and empty feature which amounts to a build menu where you are able to spawn in crafts at some other place than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Even bad PR is not a problem for most as long as they can push sales somewhere else to compensate. Examples are plentiful in the game industry where screaming has helped. Creative Assembly refunded a whole bunch of copies of Total War: Pharaoh and made other amends but only after a month of screaming, review bombing and boycotting them. Before that it was the usual tone deaf \u0022you\u0027re wrong\u0022 message. End result is now we have a properly priced game and actually good DLC. Cyberpunk had to be fixed because the uproar was so big that Sony ended up pulling the game from their store.\u00A0 We can\u0027t know if polite advice would have worked but I dare say it would not have worked as well as \u0022your company will sink unless you fix this now.\u0022 End result is that we now have a good game.

But this too ties back to the communication. We\u0027re being fed quite a lot of smiles and hype while all the feedback and constructive criticism and ideas that have accumulated over the last ten years is summarily being ignored. And I repeat my point from my previous post, the reason is not that the community managers are doing a bad job, it\u0027s because they have nothing to work with. That\u0027s why I\u0027m kinda defending them here because we need to roast the people responsible and those people are collectively the dev team and more precisely people like Nate who are ultimately responsible for the poor performance of their team.
