In the past month I have had lots of problems getting KSP to recognize it during game play. Then two days ago it gave up the ghost. I could not get any functions to work and I could not reassign any functions. So I assumed that the stick was dead. I purchased a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro today.

Nothing. Then with my Logitech still plugged in, I plugged in my SideWinder. Now KSP would see button presses of the SideWinder. I tried the Logitech, and now KSP can assign those buttons as well. But the axises of both sticks are still not seen. I cannot get KSP to see any axis of either stick. Pitch, Yaw, Roll, Throttle, and strangely, the hat buttons of both sticks cannot be assigned in KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still have some of the Sidewinder axises assigned from before, but it is not seen during game-play, and non functional.

I even removed all my mods (hence me posting here).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing I have tried will allow either stick\u0027s axises to be seen by KSP anymore.
