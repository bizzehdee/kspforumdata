With the use of docking ports, the Hypatia II has shifted to a modular science-pod system, and packs a rover in the cargo bay capable of transporting the pods to an interesting biome and back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith LV-909s, it is both Munar and Minimus capable. The airframe can handle Duna as well, though I only tried the landing, and not the flight, so I suspect you\u0027d need additional fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a fair bit of clipping (especially the rover), but I still managed to keep it to 350 parts, so it shouldn\u0027t be \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E CPU-melty. Moderate airhogging at 5 ram intakes per engine, but I added them in careful order, in order to distribute the air evenly among the engines and minimize flame-outs. Unfortunately, when they do eventually happen, the wide positioning of the engines imparts a lot of yaw, so pilots must be vigilant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn-atmospheric flight, the Hypatia II will not turn on a dime, but it\u0027s solid and well-behaved. One thing it does have going for it is perfect balance. There is zero distance between the center of mass, and the dry center of mass. Additionally, fuel is drawn evenly from front and rear tanks, so its handling characteristics are stable throughout flight. RCS is perfectly balanced as well, with virtually zero torque when translating (thanks RCS build aid!). The cargo bay is located at the center of mass, so you can leave the rover behind if you like, and it will still handle well. I would advise against ditching the science pods, however, as that \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E shift the balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Hypatia II has a robust crew-escape system, capable of zero-zero, high speed, and even some extra-kerbin saves, thanks to the monopropellant thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wz2iZpFkHC4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/xmEla\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
