So even if it is not possible to send a string of bits (as it was done in this experiment), it should at least be able to send exactly 1 bit (e.g. a timer or alarm signal). This could be useful for a superlumious warning of a solar flare or something like this. This 1 bit should be challenging enough with our technology (high failure rate, therefore many repetitions required to get a statistical significant statement) on anyway longer than lab distances. But with good enough equipment it may be possible to get a superluminoius communication channel that could transmit short meassages (the longer the message the longer the distance between sender and receiver has to be to give you any advantage to a classical channel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea why this seems to work (against the statement that information cannot travel faster than light). My best idea to this was that each experiment itself has less information than 1 bit (the smallest information unit). Only with statistical effects of some (many) repetitions you get that information summed up to 1 bit (or more). A bit like the difference between signal velocity and group velocity (the latter can get to superluminous speeds, but is no \u0022real\u0022 velocity).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"heretofore","CreatedById":123451,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T00:01:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven the known constraints, you\u0027re not going to get FTL communication ability without warping spacetime.

But depending on his velocity he can see a comletely different distance, and a completely different time intervall before observing Event1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI havent done the math, but lets assume he sees a distance of 10 light-minutes, and a time intervall of 5 minutes.

Thats the thing about relativity. You can\u0027t say that two distant events are happening at the same time.

If he uses the same FTL communication technology, he may send us a picture of Event2.
