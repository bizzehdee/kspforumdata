Before the community acknowledges it, though, i must point out that \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ei know that the science system is still in development.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E These are my current criticisms based off the model being used in version 0.22, which i shall voice to hopefully give Squad some feedback or ideas on how the community perceives this system, and where it should be headed. I \u003Cstrong\u003Ewelcome\u003C/strong\u003E discussion and debate on this topic, as it can only bring a more accurate model of the community\u0027s perception of science. Please do also note, these criticisms are only from about tech 2 or 3, based on my own save file. (\u003Cstrong\u003EFor those don\u0027t want to read the entirety of my argument, the tl;dr points are in bold\u003C/strong\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, congratulations, Squad. I\u0027m astounded at the pace of development that gave me the 0.22 update at least 2 months before I thought it would be released. I laud this achievement, and cannot say you left anything half baked. The new parts, systems, and subassemblies are wonderful additions to the game. I also do appreciate this early career mode release, and the Research that goes with it. But i most come to terms with a few minor grievances i have against it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E Lack of a Kerbal \u0027Space\u0027 Program\u003C/span\u003E: The system of mapping biomes to facilitate experiments for each of Kerbin\u0027s biomes is a wonderful achievement. It provides a diverse base of science to work with (and segway into the resource system with), and encourages exploration. The issue that comes to mind, though, is how the current balancing encourages rocket based exploration of those areas. In one situation, i noted a community forum discussing the best methods to acquire science points while in the Kerbin system. Many users suggested landing in the different biomes, as each gives a full science project for you to recover, and advance the space program with. It makes sense - early on, at the tier 1 or 2 tech, we have neither rovers nor aircraft, and we don\u0027t have good enough rocket parts to get to the Mun, but we can make suborbital hops to each biome with our rockets. However, i do think that this encourages a different kind of gameplay just for points. I feel motivated to go on missions exploring the void, looking to divine the secrets that the Kerbals are just uncovering in the wonders of space. But, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethere is only 1 set of experiments for Kerbin\u0027s orbit/near space, whilst there are many different Biome reports once you land.\u003C/strong\u003E This encourages a \u0022land program,\u0022 where space quickly dries up its science in the infant stages of the tech tree, and we\u0027re left lobbing Kerbals to different parts of the planet to gain science. \u003Cstrong\u003EBut, if a space program (ex. the Mercury Program) is developed to look into the final frontier after we have explored our home planet, why is there more to discover on Kerbin than in the unknown void?\u003C/strong\u003E The Mercury program brought an infinite number of experiments and questions to light about space, and in KSP we can cover that all in one flight. So, until we go to the Mun and beyond, we\u0027re stuck lobbing kerbalnauts into \u0027new\u0027 biomes. I know that it\u0027s a balancing mechanic, and flooding the tree with science points would create issues, but we can try to encourage a variety of experiments in exchange for larger science point requirements. I want to spend a series of flights learning all i can about everything in orbit rather than everything that\u0027s on the ground when i land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ELimited Methods of Research\u003C/span\u003E: As noted in the previous point,\u003Cstrong\u003E i think that the range of experiments (at least early on, i\u0027ve only seen the Goo and Crystal Lab in my save) is too narrow\u003C/strong\u003E. Perhaps there should be a wider range of \u0027space-only\u0027 experiments to conduct in orbits, as i feel the experiment system is too generalized to encourage an avid exploration of each frontier. Some might complain that flights would get repetitive, but i contrast by saying that a\u003Cstrong\u003E space program ought to be a journey rather than a 3 flight rush to the Mun if you are in Career mode\u003C/strong\u003E; if you want that kind of gameplay, play in sandbox mode, as you likely aren\u0027t interested in science either. I saw another thread discussing whether or not the Career mode was too \u0027fast,\u0027 that player was likely forced to rush to the pace due to the lack of science in orbit. It can leave \u0027pitfalls\u0027 in science where i can\u0027t get to the Mun, and i must exhaust science on Kerbin to get parts to get there, or when i can\u0027t reach interplanetary missions but have exhausted most of the science on Kerbin, the Mun, and minimus.\u003Cstrong\u003E So, i think we should have a wealth of experiments to choose from, mapping, more encouragement of late-tech satellite play, perhaps a comms relay\u003C/strong\u003E. Maybe we can build Science stations that generate a slow but steady Research rate via a Science Lab onboard. \u003Cstrong\u003EWe can leave behind what experiments we don\u0027t want, and move forward with our campaign\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ENeed for a Diversity of Experiments\u003C/span\u003E: This is a subpoint of the above, as i note that \u003Cstrong\u003Eeach experimental module is sort of a one-trick pony kind of deal\u003C/strong\u003E. I think we should have variety of assignments to give our Kerbals in science, perhaps involve them more in it personally. \u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027d love to see something akin to the crew system where we can load science bays up with certain experiments just like we can elect crew members for a mission\u003C/strong\u003E, where the experiments you can take aboard are based on what science modules you\u0027ve equipped, and the you can unlock new experiments as you progress in overall tech level. For example, if i\u0027m carrying the Science Jr., rather than \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E studying crystal growth of one arbitrary crystal type, we might be able to test different kinds of crystals, or study how other materials react in space, or even look into how other organisms (like that little octopus in the .22 trailer) react in space. That would brighten up the science aspect and encourage players to build spaceships around new experiments that they want to conduct, rather than making ships solely on reaching the next destination where their \u0027one trick pony\u0027 can repeat itself for a different result due to the change in enviornment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers everyone, and i\u0027d love any feedback points you can offer. I know that my career hasn\u0027t advanced far enough to definitvely determine if any of these points are dissuaded, but i\u0027d like to know if they are at some point later than where i\u0027m at. Thanks to Squad in advance for paying attention to the community, and for being open to players\u0027 opinions of your product.

I fully trust that every planet and moon will have multiple biomes (well maybe not Bop and Pol but I wouldn\u0027t be surprised) when they get them done. The range of available experiments being narrow is also due to this being the first iteration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think encouraging landing over orbiting is fine. We learned a lot more about Mars from Viking than we did Mariner, though they used what they found from Mariner to plan Viking. I want to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t feel any pressing need to eke out the full science value of any single biome or planet, though admittedly I\u0027m going slowly and only progressing through career for my YouTube series. In said series, I\u0027ve just gotten back from a Minmus flyby and am preparing to land for the first time on Mun. I also am limiting myself to one tech tree node per successful mission so I\u0027ve just unlocked struts and have yet to attain a probe core. However, I have hundreds of science points available and could unlock probably 4 or 5 nodes right now, after only a few missions. From what I\u0027ve read, that will tighten up eventually but I\u0027m more looking forward to that than dreading it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the idea of mapping. I\u0027d love to show up at Laythe with a satellite and map it out, showing me where the biomes are so later on I can send a few landers to check them out in full. Something like the Mars Global Surveyor, paving the way for our own Sojourner Rover (and Constellation program) would be really, really cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of a generic science bay that you load with specific experiments sounds pretty cool. I\u0027d be nice also to have a space station that you don\u0027t have to bring up a \u0022goo container\u0022 and then be done with, but instead bring up specialists or experiments with mass but no part, that just work when you get to the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, good ideas but I think this is like suggesting cruise control to Henry Ford.

To me this is as much a facepalm for science as it is a soft sigh of disappointment for missed opportunity for wicked game design. As has been pointed out by previous posters, it reduces science to an economic unit which, quite frankly, leaves a slightly sour taste in my mouth... but that\u0027s just me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I had my way and was designing the science aspect of the game, I\u0027d have gone a different route... please keep in mind that this is just an ad-hoc idea that I\u0027ve put about 2 minutes of thought into, so don\u0027t be surprised that it lacks depth and breadth in its explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore launch:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Player selects \u0022mission goals\u0022 - a mission goal would be to achieve an orbit/apoapsis of a certain height or to land on another body or to achieve a certain velocity in an atmosphere; these represent the technical challenges to be overcome. The research accumulated while attempting to achieve those objectives (using accelerometers and other measurement devices) accumulates to unlock technologies (read: new parts). Once it has been achieved, it stops rewarding technical research for reaching that goal. A milestone system could even make this invisible to the player, or at least give the player the option to select a mission goal, for those that prefer the seat-of-your-pants style of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Player selects \u0022science goals\u0022 - these are objectives such as measure gravity at lowest point of the Mun or its magnetic field, etc. As data is accumulated from the closest celestial bodies (thus making repeating the experiment pointless), it unlocks more mission goal options. Now, I should also add that data for the other celestial bodies would be \u0022observed\u0022 at the start - estimates of temperature, gravity, etc. so the player would have an idea of what to expect - and that the data would change as it became \u0022confirmed\u0022 once the experiment was successfully applied. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Experiments would be a mixture of data that should \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E be transmitted (gravity, temperature, etc); and sample/goo/core analysis which \u003Cem\u003Erequires\u003C/em\u003E the experiment to be returned. Now, surface analysis could be transmitted with advanced science parts that are unlocked down the road, but I leave that to the realm of speculation and player preference as a mixture of the two requirements would continue to give good reason to send kerbals to the outer reaches of the Kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, it\u0027s a feedback loop: the need to do science further and further out drives the technical research (mission goals) to make new materials and new propulsion/ancillary systems; it even does exactly what the current system does in limiting the player where they can go, but with an educational twist that not only gives a better sense of what science is and what it\u0027s about, but also the technical side of space programs and the research into materials and physics required to make better and better rockets that go farther and farther out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, in closing, I just want to say that I agree with the OP and the other posters, and I can\u0027t wait to see where Squad takes the game next.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T23:01:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe problem with the \u0022science point\u0022 system (SPS) is that neither does science nor does it work as an in depth game mechanic designed to encourage growth of the player\u0027s experience\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not intended as either.

New players CAN NOT land on the Mun with tier1. The tree is designed for new players to introduce them to everything slowly. And it does that just fine.

There is nothing in career pushing someone forward, which the tree does little to help. You have to crawl before you can walk, and walk before you run.

You don\u0027t have to finish the tree to do everything, and that kinda defeats the purpose don\u0027t you think? People are landing on Mun before they have landers, so why research them?

If a concept is not being taught efficiently, then you need to look at the curriculum. 3 Math Teachers can teach the same subject 3 different ways, if one\u0027s students are always asking about basic concepts, that doesn\u0027t mean the system as a whole is flawed, it is the presentation that isn\u0027t covering all the bases. You are assuming that people know what the parts are, what they do, how they interact, when the game tells you very little, and does not do anything to give you direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at actual space programs, there\u0027s a logical flow. For an oversimplified look it went Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, Shuttle, Rovers, future. Went from getting a man into orbit, to getting a man on the moon, to doing studies in orbit, to reusable space craft, to sending unmanned missions, and the future of sending man to Mars, etc. KSP could easily go from getting a Kerbal into orbit, then to Mun, figuring out space stations, and then getting to the far flung reaches. Throw in probes and such along the path and voila.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can look at the career mode with rose tinted glasses all you want, but it needs work, and there is no getting around it. Considering it is the first iteration of it that we have seen, we all know it needs to be tweaked and refined, so I do not know why you are rushing to the defense of something that isn\u0027t even finished yet. If you want more new players to enjoy the game, you gotta make it so that they can understand the concepts better. There are some great science moments in KSP, namely the crew reports when doing a flyby of Mun and Minmus, they comment where a good place to land is. THAT is what needs to happen more often. Imagine if that revelation led to the parts for landing, instead of something generic, or wholly unrelated? Doing x reveals to the player how to achieve y, without even really taking the player out of the game. Even the first Apollo Mission didn\u0027t straight land on the Moon, they observed, etc. Then they actually did it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
