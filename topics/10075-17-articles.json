None of this 48 thrust/.something consumption. It will be slightly less than LFE\u0027s, but not to the level of cheat parts. Thrust is capped on my engines now at 42. \n\nThe batteries have been cut way down as well. The real number I\u0027m having an issue with is where to put the reactor. Current mass is 4 and it holds a lot of power, but the recharge is slow enough in 1x. The issue I\u0027m getting to is that when you\u0027re waiting for injection, the damned thing refills back to overcharge very quickly at 4x\u002B -- I don\u0027t really want this. There are also some smaller RTG models I\u0027m sitting on. Is it possible to have a mission timeout for them in a future version? Or, if possible, an internal fuel supply to sip off until dry? I managed to set a reactor to eat liquid fuel, but nothing else. I gave up on it a while ago.\n\nAlso: planned panel efficiency somewhere around %13."},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T17:35:39Z","Content":"\u003Edishycourier\n\nI\u0027ve been playing around with numbers a bit, everything has to be rebalanced, I\u0027ll give you the numbers once I\u0027m happy with the thing.\n\nI also fixed the part resource consumption for the reactors (used function wrong -.-), so you could make them finite.\n\nI\u0027ll probably add the possibility to block generators off-rails, the heat system doesn\u0027t work then and you\u0027ll run out of resources too fast anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"kyle.mk.howard","CreatedById":22844,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T20:06:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ekyle.mk.howard\n\u003E Are you trying to make a part be an ion engine?\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you."},{"CreatedByName":"Serpentine","CreatedById":25422,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-04T00:16:30Z","Content":"It seems with every attempt, there is always one mistake or problem.\n\nIt\u0027s me again (probably don\u0027t remember), and this time, the Solar Panels in the DynaSat fix aren\u0027t working.

Modern high end solar cells (as might be found in cutting-edge space systems) can have up to twice that efficiency.
