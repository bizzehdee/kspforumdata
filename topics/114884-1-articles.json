From there, level out to 15 to 25 degrees and hit full throttle-ness, the whiplashes give up around 22/23k, flip on the chemical eating terriers (\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Erelease the hounds!...or terriers\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E) and stay that way until the weasel is heading sub orbital going almost 2k per second. At 70\u0027ish km our engineers report that they are still going fast enough that they have to spend minimal fuel to make a pretty circle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is completely different to how the previous Farnsworth SSTO\u0027s flew pre 1.03. It took our engineers by surprise to see space easier to reach by not heading directly towards it. We have finally reached the conclusion that space can see you coming unless you sneak up behind it and wack it with something going very fast.
