The first stage was 3 boosters placed with the symmetry tool around an empty body section. When I went to the launchpad, I could see the rocket go downwards a bit, jiggle, then settle off-vertical with one of the 3 boosters slightly below ground. It was slightly different each time I reverted to launch, and once the rocket just completely tipped over and exploded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried putting launch stability enhancers in 3-symmetry around the first stage. That kept the rocket straight on the pad, but as soon as they let go, I took off at a 70 degree angle with some minor rolling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI solved it accidentally by reverting to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and relaunching (after removing stabilizers). Somehow it settled and launched straight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, why did it settle off-vertical?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-13T15:11:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s been that way a long time.\u00A0 Basically, what happens is that when you launch a rocket, there\u0027s no physics at all for the first few moments; then they turn on the physics, and there\u0027s some collision-detection finickiness that can cause behavior like what you describe.\u00A0 Would love to see a fix for it, but I assume it\u0027s not trivial to do or they would have done it already.\u00A0 It\u0027s been on a lot of players\u0027 personal wish list for a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnecdotally,\u00A0 it seems to me that rocket design can make a difference-- it\u0027s been my experience that rockets that sit on multiple points (e.g. radial boosters) are more prone to this, compared with rockets that sit on a single point (e.g. the central stack\u0027s engine, with radial boosters not quite touching the ground).\u00A0 YMMV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re having a lot of problems with this, one way to address it is with launch clamps-- you can use them to hold your whole rocket so it\u0027s not quite touching the ground.\u00A0 Generally you\u0027ll be rock-solid stable if you use this technique.\u00A0 I very rarely use them myself, mainly because I don\u0027t seem to get bitten by this much (maybe it\u0027s just something about how I tend to design my rockets).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kBob","CreatedById":102132,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-13T15:11:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you move the rocket while in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u00A0 This happens to me sometimes I move it over from the center of the circle marked on the floor for whatever reason\u00A0and then\u00A0forget to move it back then when you launch and\u00A0it will be offset from the center of the launch pad by the same amount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-13T15:25:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222674299\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143718\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468422666\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnecdotally,\u00A0 it seems to me that rocket design can make a difference-- it\u0027s been my experience that rockets that sit on multiple points (e.g. radial boosters) are more prone to this, compared with rockets that sit on a single point (e.g. the central stack\u0027s engine, with radial boosters not quite touching the ground).\u00A0 YMMV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my experience too.
