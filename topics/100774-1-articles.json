I built this.\n\n[![llrB5J5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/llrB5J5.jpg)](http://imgur.com/llrB5J5)\n\nIts supposed to be a Jet that flies slowly over areas where I need to take temperature readings (or any readings actually) and deploys one of two probes equipped with scientific instruments that descend slowly to the ground via chute so that I can then later activate them through the Space Centre and get the required data.\n\nBut for some reason they disappear when I deploy them. I see them detach and the chutes open but after some time they just disappear. What am I doing wrong?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T13:26:26Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 01:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Keepbro**"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T13:18:42Z","Content":"Anything in flight between 0 and 20,000m altitude on an atmospheric planet, that\u0027s not your active vessel, will get deleted as it\u0027s assumed to have crashed.

If you want to drop things off, you need to be very low and very slow, so that they touch down before you\u0027re outside of that 2.3km. If you literally skim the treetops it might be possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T13:20:06Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eddiew**\n  \nclarity"},{"CreatedByName":"Keepbro","CreatedById":17686,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T13:22:44Z","Content":"So fly very low and wait till it hits the ground.

It might be easier to outright land the plane, but I\u0027ll be interested to know if you can make it work with an airdrop!\n\nOutside 2.3km of the active craft, all other things are \u0027on rails\u0027 meaning that the game is only aware of its orbital trajectory, not of anything like parachutes or engines or control mechanisms - which is why anything getting too low in the atmosphere while not being active gets cleaned up."},{"CreatedByName":"Keepbro","CreatedById":17686,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T13:57:12Z","Content":"So in testing at the Launch base I deployed the probe and circled in a 2km radius while it drifted down (which due to my crappy plane design was quite hard but still...). Once the probe was landed I then circled away and landed back on the runway. \n\nSo I can confirm that if you circle in 2km radius whilst the probe lands then it works in optimal conditions. Now I\u0027m going to try this in the field. I have an artic mission to take scans so I\u0027ll see if it works in an actual mission."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T14:03:21Z","Content":"Good stuff - you just found a way to make non-space-planes more useful ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nOh, and if you haven\u0027t encountered the [Waypoint Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104758-0-90-Waypoint-Manager-v2-0-3-2015-02-12-%28Formerly-In-Flight-Waypoints%29) mod, I heartily recommend it to help you bullseye those drop zones ^^"}]}
