That\u0027s obviously trickier, and you want to get through it fast so as not to burn too much fuel, but it\u0027s basically an identical problem, logistically, as trying to land on a small platform on a world with similar gravity - you are effectively performing the same maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder real world conditions, the fact that this leads to a very narrow margin for error is what makes the timing requirements so much more strict and leads to a need for precise automation. But that\u0027s a matter of safety. In KSP, if you fail on the first attempt, you reload a quick save. People do far more reckless landings in the game than what this would require.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you are vastly overestimating how much help quicksaves are for a task that is literally best suited for a robot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can dock a spaceplane to a rocket that\u0027s travelling through the atmosphere at supersonic speeds and accelerating upwards at 2g, and maybe post the recording here for everyone to witness, next drink is on me\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0I will take the idea of a manual skyhook docking seriously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-13T12:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224231676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212006\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221676288792\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257801\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/13/2023 at 3:46 AM, magnemoe said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst challenge is hitting something in orbit with an suborbital rocket is hard, its an anti satellite weapon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnti-satellite weapon has a huge relative velocity on impact and full orbital speeds in absolute terms.

Stock parts, airbreather jet plus 100m/s or so of orbital for maneuvering and docking sounds good enough? And I\u0027ll be using straight up save file hacks to create a skyhook I can actually dock with and probably some mods to extend the physics range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m anticipating about 1km/s in suborbital just above Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere where I\u0027m meeting the hook, and that\u0027s going to require a 200km arm to give me that 2g difference. On release, I should have escape from Kerbin plus about 400m/s, which is enough for a number of interplanetary missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nManual flight, using only stability assists available in the game, but I reserve the right to have some external calculator tools running to make quick estimates for corrections I\u0027m going to need both for the rendezvous and the actual docking. It\u0027d make for a tight departure window and some precise flying, but so long as I have a list of known checkpoints along the route, not harder than other missions I\u0027ve flown before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I\u0027m realizing that modding a sky hook into KSP is not going to be this straight forward. Even with extended physics ranges, 200km\u002B is going to be troublesome for a physics object. I\u0027m trying to make a fake \u0022planet\u0022 for it with Kopernicus, but that has issues too, since I don\u0027t want to alter gravity in the area, and trying to make the hook be a landed part far outside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E is not going well. I might have to find another way to fake this. If anyone has ideas, I\u0027m open to suggestions. All I need is a docking port in the correct trajectory that I can actually interact with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-18T09:51:47Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2023 09:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
