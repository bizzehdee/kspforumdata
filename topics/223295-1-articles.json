For a game mode called \u201CExploration\u201D, you don\u2019t seem to do much of it. The kerbolar System is stunning in this game, they should show it off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the primary missions could benefit from shifting their focus from lore to exploration. This shows off the beauty of the Solar system, while making the lore feel more rare and special. Each planet and moon should have a dedicated primary mission, exploring what makes each respective body unique. Each and every body has a different set of challenges associated with it, so exploring those challenges teaches the player how to design crafts for specific destinations, a very important set of concepts and skills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would slow down the pace of the alien story line, and make each discovery feel more special, unexpected, and immersive; as you share the emotions of the kerbals. Currently the primary missions send you only to places that have a monument, making them lose their sense of unexpected adventure. When it sends you to minmus/duna/jool straight after the last monument discovery, you are already expecting to find another one. You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re discovering these for yourself, and they take away from the experience of landing on these bodies for the first time, as they are overshadowed by these discoveries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you go to duna as a testament of the kerbal spirit, becoming a multiplanetay species, and then finding a strange signal/interference after the fact, you feel like you\u2019ve discovered this for yourself, in addition to landing on another planet for the first time. Going to jool should start off as an expedition to explore joolian moons, not to find the source of a signal for the 4th time in a row.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the mun monument, the missions shift from \u201CKerbal firsts\u201D to \u201Csend probe, land at monument, repeat\u201D. Each time you go somewhere you already know you\u2019ll find something, so it doesn\u2019t feel as special.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be \u201Chey let\u2019s land on duna, the first interplanetary mission!\u201D Then after landing there, you get \u201Chey while we were at duna we picked up some strange interference, send a probe into a polar orbit to search for this interference\u201D, then \u201Coh hey we found the source, it appears to be up north, go send a rover to investigate\u201D etc etc. Sending the probe into a polar orbit could also teach players about how polar orbits are useful for precise landings, as you pass over everywhere on the planet as it rotates under you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final primary mission should be an eve return mission, doubling down on its \u201Cfinal boss\u201D reputation. You\u2019ve got all the experience of the rest of the kerbolar system under your belt, everything has been leading up to this. You want to prove that you can conquer your own solar system before you venture out into the stars, where the monuments have been leading you. You want to prove to your celestial cousins that you are ready.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis exploration focused primary mission set would also compliment the secondary missions, which focus a lot on doing precise landings, sending cargo, large crews, etc, all things that people tend to do after initial landings. The primary missions mean players are already familiar with all the celestial bodies\u2019 characteristics and challenges, allowing them to better plan missions to these places with the skills they have developed throughout their save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall I think a more exploration focused primary mission set would feel more fulfilling as you complete them, showing off the full kerbolar system, teaching the player all the skills they need to visit these bodies on their own or in the secondary missions, while also making the lore story line feel more immersive and exciting. It\u2019s called \u201CExploration mode\u201D after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-27T08:35:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2024 08:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 27\u0022\u003EJanuary 27\u003C/time\u003E by Suppise\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaypeg","CreatedById":228190,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-27T06:52:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts fine at the start, but I think maybe there should just be more filler between the mun and duna and etc\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DibzNr","CreatedById":212219,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-27T17:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, after the Mun monument it does feel like the primary missions completely shift away from general progress altogether, it\u0027s very jarring going straight from the Minmus monument to the Duna monument with no general \u0022land on Duna\u0022 mission in-between.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-27T18:13:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd sure enough but... You can just test the ground, if your current tech and skill even allows you to land there - and only then attempt the mission.

The main missions don\u0027t lead you anywhere because they don\u0027t have to, their rewards are big enough to give you the required technology for the final one, which is Tylo.
