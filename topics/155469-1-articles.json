(I think). I was wondering if anyone can give me some help on creating a landing leg, I have the item in game but it will not animate and I do not know if I have it properly setup in unity. Any help or being pointed towards a newer tutorial will be appreciated. This is the landing leg as well, just simple up and down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NnIeOuZ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NnIeOuZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-24T15:39:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi have you extracted a stock landing gear and examined that?\u00A0 If not I think you\u0027ll find most of your answers there, even though the transforms will be messed up the hierarchy will be pretty much correct and if legs are like landing gear, getting that right will solve most of your issues\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
