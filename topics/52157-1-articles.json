This allows for a more efficient way of addressing memory addresses larger than 32 bits as Ruedii said above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason there is usually more memory used by 64 bit application is memory pointers are now 64 bits (8 bytes) vs 32 bits (4 bytes). Also if we are using both 32 bit and 64 bit libraries we must load both libraries into memory which usually constitutes the bulk of the memory increase. I am not sure what the root language is for KSP but if it is C based than any \u0027long int\u0027 data types would now consume 8 bytes vs 4 bytes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill be interesting to see what the performance differences would be for KSB but I think .23 is supposed to have some engine optimizations as well which would be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr_jt","CreatedById":58149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T14:07:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OrtwinS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OrtwinS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor stock players 64-bit won\u0027t do that much (64 bit programs actually use a bit more memory).\u003Cp\u003E There is also a trick to allow 32 bit programs on 64 bit OS to use more RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will not increase accuracy, a 32 bit OS can do larger-bit-number calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just check the KSP executable and the flag for using greater than 2gig is already set so the trick will not do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Surefoot","CreatedById":89084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T14:13:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OrtwinS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OrtwinS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Though THAT kind of hardware doesn\u0027t exist even now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENitpicking mode: it does, ask Cray..
