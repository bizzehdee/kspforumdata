To create one I have to emulate it in code. I decided that this just adds unneeded \u0022overhead\u0022 to the program, and just slows things down since they have to be rendered each frame (update / onGUI). The radio button as you call it is actually called a Toggle in Unity. So it is treated as a check box. If you look at what the control tabs look like, those are toggles as well, and any or all can be on or off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Settings window, what I did was to enable/disable options as other options are turned on/off to prevent you from changing settings that would have no effect. SOME of the options are treated like a radio button, such as the highlighting options. Source/Target only turns off CLS highlighting, as it is unneeded in that case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the special case for CLS is this: Since I detect whether or not CLS is installed, I automatically disable CLS in the settings if it is not installed. If it is subsequently installed, I cannot \u0022assume\u0022 you want it and automatically turn it on, as you may have turned it off \u0022intentionally\u0022 with CLS installed before the previous save. SM does not know if you had CLS before, so it has to \u0022assume\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo overcome this, I \u0022could\u0022 create an \u0022Is CLS Installed\u0022 flag in the settings to remember if it was installed or not. If it gets installed and I detect the change, I can automatically turn it back on as a \u0022default\u0022 setting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had also looked at creating color dropdowns for choosing the highlight colors (those are hidden settings editable in the config file), but dropdowns are not native to Unity either. So I have to create a chunk of code that then gets run for each dropdown and also \u0022slows\u0022 things down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hoping with Unity 5, and the new GUI tools, I can make improvements in the gui.
