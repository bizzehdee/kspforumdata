I am having two problems - upon descent to Eve, if I move the camera around too much, the game will freeze unrecoverabley and I will have to reload the game to continue. As in I\u0027ll try to land one thing four times and it will be successful once. I can sort of live with it, but I have at least 4 more craft to land on Eve, so it will get annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second problem is this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3HVKFBy.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3HVKFBy.png\u0022 style=\u0022min-height:410px;\u0022 alt=\u00223HVKFBy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nThis is daytime, as bright as it gets.

The problem was that the default \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E clouds and the SVE clouds were both trying to display at once.
