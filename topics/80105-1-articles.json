I completed the tech tree with Minimus/Mun landings \u002B one Gilly landing. But I think, I know how to solve it. Below is a list of some feature, that could improve the game play:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You need to hire scientists for money. They give you very small amounts of science per day\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Science node will be unlocked over time - when you choose your node and click unlock, progress bar will appear and it will consume your science with time. You will be able to research max 3 nodes at time. Also scientists\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- will have their specialisation, for example my kerbal will have 12 of \u0022electronnics\u0022 and will research all nodes related to electronics with rate of 12 science / day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Experiments give you science over time. Example - I collected a surface sample from the Mun. I brought it to the KSC and now my scientists are analysing it and give me 10 science/day for 9 days. Better scientists make this process\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- faster with small science boost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. More types of experments and biomes on every planet/moon, but less science per each experiment. Below is list of some new devices you could use for science:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Mgnetometer - nothing special to talk about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Telescopes - those wiil give you science over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Cameras - planet surface mapping and survey will make experiments automaticaly after a flyby above new biome. Will also make maps of planets (height and biome maps), that you will be ableto put on your planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Different types of spectrometers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Radiation and solar wind detectors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Antimater detectors?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-30T12:11:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2014 12:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by bartekkru99\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3tal_Warrior","CreatedById":116603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T13:10:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe got that discussion in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88145-A-much-more-logical-science-system\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eanother thread running\u003C/a\u003E and I\u0027ve went lengthy about that in a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/1610-Kerbals-science-and-management-The-shrouded-catacombs-of-KSC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eblog post\u003C/a\u003E.

As an example i could think of the impact-probe-experiment from interstellar. So maybe condense the Data-Readout-Experiments (Temp. Pressure, Gravioli, Seismic) into one single experiment calles Physical-Data or something, which you can do everywhere by the click of a button, but change the others and add new ones where you have to do something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome Ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The described Physics-Data-Readout-Experiment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- an Impactor Experiment (like the changed accelometer in interstellar) requiring an impactor on the surface\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a long term observing experiment (needs to run a certain time on the surface maybe 100 days before yielding the science)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a ground behavior Experiment (needs to drive for a certain distance on the Surface of that biome before yielding science)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a dive explorer Experiment (can only be done in \u0027splashed down\u0027 and needs maybe one day to finish)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a drill core Experiment (as above, only in case \u0027landed\u0027)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a big scale observing Experiment (can only be done in space low and high and requires time, like the long term observing)(so a proper use for sattelites)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a Kerbal life endurance Experiment(certain time in a Lab on the Surface of the planet)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(- maybe a weather baloon experiment, but we would need a helium baloon part, which can only be done while flying or while in high atmosphere. And would yield more science if brought back so getting the data out of the baloon again is the next challenge) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way we would have more to do, and actually required to perform some of the expirements. Also i would suggest a decrease of science with more biomes on the body, so first you visit yields most science, 2nd only 50 % , 3rd only 40% , 4th 30% and so on, which would encourage to explore new worlds but not punish if you want to stay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat could also be the beginning of \u0027more to do\u0027 on the surface as rovers and Bases get a value and you\u0027d need different experiments for different locations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with such a change there would actually be more gameplay instead of just waiting longer for science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do ya think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T13:50:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of science being done at a constant thing over time, testing parts helps develop them. Returning science experiments grants boosts to your science team (They love learning new things) As for the timewarp, well if the scientists cost money then you would run out if you just time warped. Personally I think you just reduce the rate of science proportional to the timewarp. x10 speed? you get 1/10 the science. it would give you a reason to do part test contracts that i personally find rather annoying currently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T13:56:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis topic \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86267-Science-Collection-Revamp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86267-Science-Collection-Revamp\u003C/a\u003E - has a very similar idea, though notably better and more refined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyRex94\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SkyRex94\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs good as the idea may be there are some problems: Timewarp, everything that is related to time can simply be timewarped away (If you\u0027re not RP ).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s already addressed in the topic I linked to above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3tal_Warrior","CreatedById":116603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T14:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs for merging experiments, I do that with action groups - works like a charm, even though I even use just a single ship to do all gravioli readings from both HO and LO of Minmus/Mun on all biomes (yields tons of science when brought back, but it\u0027s quite expensive).
