Shock Cone Intakes and Ram Air - Intake Air 0.275 vs. 0.25 respectively, with the shock cone being a tad heavier than the ram air intake(negligible difference). Are shock cones getting more drop in intake air when the craft is pitched up farther up than the actual prograde vector? For example my cargo SSTO is quite heavy, and as result I get a significant difference between prograde vector and the actual orientation of the plane, which is always higher by atleast 10 degrees - does this mean that i have to use Ram Air Intakes instead of shock cones? If not - if both types of intakes get the same drops when pitching higher/lower than the prograde vector - what is the incentive to use ram air intakes anyways?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. TurboJets and RamJets - this one i think I understand - you have scaled all jet engines to suck proportionally less air (more ISP on the ramjets than on the turbojets), but the RamJets provide very low thrust until you pass 1200 m/s. Which makes them useless for main jet engines. So my cargo craft is subsonic - my expectations are for it to get to about 23-25 km and speeds of about 1000-1100 at that point, before firing the rocket engines. Which means TurboJets for my craft(and any subsonic craft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess you made the Ramjets with the idea of being used on supersonic atmospheric craft, not SSTOs. The simplest example that comes to my mind would be a central Turbo-Jet engine \u002B 2 Ramjets on the sides, for the supersonic stage of the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taverius","CreatedById":11815,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T14:58:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@smunisto:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cones have slightly larger area, but the intake vector in the model which defines the direction in which they get peak airflow points down slightly, like the cone. The IntakeAir numbers youre citing are the size of the \u0027tank\u0027, which as little to do with actual performance, by the way. Due to an oversight by the KSP devs, the area numbers for intakes are so small they all show as either a string of 0s ending in a 1, or as 0. You have to look at the .cfg to get the real story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately there is no other way to differentiate the intakes right now in KSP, so yeah the choice is generally simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your case, since you\u0027re travelling at 10 AoA most of the time, the cone would be better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were you though I would tilt the main wing up 5 degrees with shift-QWEASD - this is called angle of incidence, or rigging angle, or a number of other things in different countries because when you get 3 engineers in a room you\u0027ll get 3 incompatible opinions. Like its done in the D-175 B9 example craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would put your craft\u0027s AoA at 5, which is far more manageable.

They let you travel fast for not a lot of engine if you\u0027re high up, since they use a relatively air-poor mixture, but the TWR is too low to be worthwile as an intermediate stage in SSTOs. Incidentally if you learn how to transition properly you don\u0027t need more ramjets than turbojets, the same number or less (4x small = 1x medium) can easily sustain a craft up high if you can get it to the point where it actually creates more thrust than the intakes create drag \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: 1.3.3 is out.

Especially the new wings and gear. However, the massive fuel capacity of the space plane fuselages makes things a lot harder. My SSTO below was originally designed without this mod and weighed maybe 28 tons on launch, excluding the 5 ton capacity payload. With this mod it weighs nearly 36 tons before payload due to the ~1750 unit jet fuel capacity in that Mk3 fuselage.
