One makes declining easier, the other auto declines things to make others more likely to appear.\n\n[QuickContracts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95168-#QuickContracts)\n\n[Rejector](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108316-Rejector)\n\nNote if you are actually unable to get offered the contract, it still won\u0027t work.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also what are the requirements for the revert button to grey out ?

You can travel to Jool and back and then revert so long as the ship was being controlled by you the whole time. If you hop back to the space center to time warp or check a contract while you\u0027re in LKO, however, you can no longer revert. If you like to test a lot and are always wanting to revert but can\u0027t, I suggest [Holodeck](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118575-1-0-x-HoloDeck-Sandboxed-Flight-Simulations)."},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T11:41:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I want to take Kerbals to Duna, yet I have no contracts to go there.

So you detach your satellite and then botch the reentry/recovery of your launch stage, you can still recover even if you were piloting the satellite for a minute or so, as long as you switched back to the launch stage before the satellite left its physics bubble."},{"CreatedByName":"Inquisition","CreatedById":26362,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T22:34:29Z","Content":"Thanks for all the answers."}]}
