Surface drilling and refinery is not affected.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSecond issue is that the visible target marker with distance in normal game view is missing, you always see an circle at target and distance to it, you also see markers for non targeted ships and other stuff.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is gone both in Eva and in ship.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy mods are pretty common: Mechjeb, KAS/KIS, alarm clock, hyperedit, Tac life support, DockingPortAlignment,\u00A0Kerbal Planetary Base Systems,\u00A0kerbal-research-development, weirder I had not added any mods then this happened.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat is I tried\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/97537-11-ose-workshop-kis-addon-v0130-20160426/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/97537-11-ose-workshop-kis-addon-v0130-20160426/\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut that did not work then I tested in my sandbox test game.
