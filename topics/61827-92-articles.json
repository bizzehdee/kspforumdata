As with an awful lot of the maths involved, the answer is \u0022It doesn\u0027t have to be a circular orbit, but it makes things much much simpler\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You can get the true anomaly from the orbital parameters, and translate between the two orbits (a lot easier if you match planes first).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. This sounds right - for a circular orbit, where the SMajorA == r. I\u0027d assume it\u0027s possible for eccentrics, but you are no longer orbiting at the central point so it might be harder. Since you need the initial and final radii to calculate the velocities anyway, probably just easier (and less error prone) to use a_xf = (r_i\u002Br_f)/2 (remembering to account for body radius).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

Equations 4.43-4.45 are probably what you are looking for here, but again - with a circular orbit it is much simpler - the velocity and altitude are constant across the entire orbit. It might be worth getting the script working in the simplest case (circular) first, then elaborating it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. You only need to use iterative et al methods to go from mean -\u0026gt; eccentric anomaly, which you don\u0027t need to do because you have the true anomaly available. The above reference only gives the cosine part, which isn\u0027t enough to get a full value (arccos only gives the result in one quadrant). Following \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentric_anomaly#From_the_true_anomaly\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentric_anomaly#From_the_true_anomaly\u003C/a\u003E, you can get the eccentric anomaly E from E = ARCTAN2(SIN(E),COS(E))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Don\u0027t completely understand the question, but if you have a maneuver node set up you can pull it\u0027s vector from kOS? Or, the blue handles that hang off the node? They are radial burns, so 90 degrees to prograde, in the plane of the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.

(i.e. \u0022fly due north for 20km, keeping your altitude between 3500m and 3505m the whole time.

If you have no probe cores, and no manual pilot capsules, and just the kOS computer, then KSP considers the craft to be debris. Probe cores can be made into kOS computers with ModuleManager rules, but going the other way and making a kOS computer into a probe core is a bit messier as there\u0027s multiple PartModules that a probe core has to have to function like a probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get what you\u0027re saying with a \u0022don\u0027t touch the controls\u0022 condition being way too easy to fail by mistake: \u0022Oops I forgot that the terminal window wasn\u0027t focused when I started typing, now those key presses count as manual piloting and I failed the mission\u0022, or \u0022my fat fingers pressed the \u0027z\u0027 key when I meant to hit \u0027alt\u0027 ... now I failed the mission because that counts as manually controlling the throttle\u0022. There would need to be a better way to avoid that problem, you are correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the way to avoid it would be to provide an actual manual lockout button on the terminal or in the KSP app launcher panel? As long as it\u0027s enabled then kOS will suppress all attempts to manually pilot until it\u0027s turned off again?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, alternatively, since we\u0027re bundling ModuleManager with kOS now anyway, maybe we can turn our kOS computers INTO probe cores with our own ModuleManager configs we ship with the mod? That way people would no longer have to include BOTH a probe core AND a kOS computer on their craft. Then the rule could be that you have to complete the mission using ONLY a kOS computer on the craft with no stock probe cores.
