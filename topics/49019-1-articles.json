You can easily test this out yourself by running (for example) goo in the same situation on the same vessel multiple times. It will always show \u002210 science\u0022 for Goo low kerbin orbit if you haven\u0027t done that yet, but if you recover a vessel with 4 goo canisters (which all showed 10 science as their value) it will recover as 10, 4.4, 2 and 0.9 respectively. So it also doesn\u0027t matter when that rocket gets destroyed as another one would\u0027ve also shown 10 per can. Only once you transmit the data or recover it will the value of future experiments be adjusted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
