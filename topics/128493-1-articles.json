difficulties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really like upgrading the Astronaut Complex first for several reasons.\u00A0 First, it\u0027s a cheap upgrade.\u00A0 Second, it allows EVAs (the only EVAs allowed prior to the upgrade are on the surface of Kerbin).\u00A0 EVAs are by biome for \u0022surface\u0022, \u0022flying low\u0022, and \u0022in space low,\u0022 which gives\u00A0ample opportunities to collect science.\u00A0 And third, the upgrade to 12 kerbonauts\u00A0makes it possible to conduct a large number of \u0022rescue\u0022 contracts, allowing\u00A0expansion of the kerobonaut corps while collecting\u00A0all-important funds.\u00A0 We can also perform \u0022plant flag\u0022 contracts.\u00A0 All things considered, I think the Astronaut Complex gives the biggest bang for the buck as a first building upgrade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T20:20:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

challenging, so I\u0027m fine with reducing financial rewards a bit (like down to the 80% or so that \u0022Moderate\u0022 career brings), but reduce it below a certain critical level and the game becomes (for me at least) seriously un-fun.\u00A0 It turns into a relentless financial grind where I have to do endless contracts to finance the actually interesting missions that are the reason I
