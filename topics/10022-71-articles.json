Soon, however, they notice that the distant galaxies do not appear to be getting any closer, despite being strongly blueshifted. No amount of power the bionicles put into their Alcubierre bubble seems to make them go anywhere, and all attempts to use teleportation cause them to materialize in seemingly the exact same position as before, although the targeting computer registers a displacement of millions of light years. The bionicles are trapped in intergalactic space. \n\nI trim the fingernail on my left thumb, removing the bionicles and the scalar field treadmill containing them from my universe-body. I place the cosmo-nail clipping in jar, where it becomes a black sphere of infinite space containing the bionicles at its center. Eh, I\u0027ve seen better paperweights.\n\nI reduce the sphere\u0027s strong nuclear force constant for a moment, dissociating the bionicles into hydrogen gas, then raise the gravitational constant by three orders of magnitude, forming the hydrogen into a tiny star-forming nebula only a few meters across.

You mutter something about a tiny nebula that came out of a broken jar. Your interrogator narrows his eyes, stares up through the ceiling, and mutters an oath under his breath. \u0022Oh, sweet moons of Sentar, it\u0027s *her* again, isn\u0027t it?

He opens the door to the interrogation room, at which point you rush out, grab your tiny contraband star, and make a break for it, burning people who get in your way with the star\u0027s overactive chromosphere. You jump in your getaway ship, speed off to Jool, and throw the star into it, where it absorbs hydrogen and helium from the atmosphere, turns into a very short-lived blue microgiant, and explodes in a tiny pair-instability supernova, leaving behind nothing but a black scorch mark in Jool\u0027s atmosphere.

Because of some slightly iffy small changes I made to my ship\u0027s systems, the supercriticality neutron pulse from the fission reactor sets off fusion in the deuterium-tritium fuel supply, and the ship explodes in a bright sphere of fusion plasma. The wave of expanding plasma catches in my dress and slows me down from a high-speed impact with the surface.\n\nUnfortunately, the massive explosion cracks open Vall\u0027s ice, and I fall straight through a fissure, splash into the subsurface ocean, and start sinking straight towards the distant bottom below.
