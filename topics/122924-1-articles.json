The other third?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe barn tier as shown to us is poorly designed. There were parts that do not look like they were built for kerbals, with scaling issues that mean that doorways are twice the kerbal\u0027s height, windows and railings that aren\u0027t very useful, as they\u0027re too high for them to be useful. There are parts which made no sense at all, with roads leading to a wall of sandbags... with a gap a road\u0027s width away.
