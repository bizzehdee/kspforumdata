However it has issues when I tried to use it. The view was inverted as was control. There are no internals either. It was suggested to modify the part cfg file of the Millennium Pod, so as to point to the Cupola visuals. I never got around to it and it made a lot of sense. I began to play with a cockpit using stock parts, with 4 seats for Kerbalnauts. I may revisit this, however, there is no in-flight view when controlling that way (I think?). Overall this model is probably slightly too flat, I will try to correct that. I may be forced to re-scale stock parts so they will look right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Millennium Pod by BONUS\u0022 have to google it this forum is not working at all with publishing http links like it used to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CRAFT I distributed used no mods (UbioZur is used during construction ONLY - not needed on target systems).

I might try welding wings myself tonight, but is it known to be broken in particular ways?
