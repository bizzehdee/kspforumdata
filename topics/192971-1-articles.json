In particular, it\u0027s a geo-synchronous orbit, but the moon, Ike occupies the same orbit. While this isn\u0027t inherently a problem, it orbits above the spot the mission requires me to be. So i end up getting into a slightly smaller orbit, waiting for the spot to catch up, but before I can satisfy both requirements, Ike throws my orbit around. I\u0027ve attached a screenshot if that helps, thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/vSQhEDD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/vSQhEDD\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-07T20:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch your satellite to the right altitude but on the opposite side of Duna. If it\u0027s a normal contract, you only have to meet the conditions for 10 seconds, so it doesn\u0027t matter if it is disturbed by Ike after that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-07T20:39:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EYeah, that contract type (stationary orbit around duna) likes to come with issues like this but in this case, you might be able to work around it. You already got the checkmark for \u0022Reach stationary orbit above Mermon\u0027s Bluff\u0022 so the contract should be complete once you can complete the last missing step, which is just ANY stationary orbit. Just wait until Ike is out of your way and put the sat back into the required stationary orbit and you should be fine. If it doesn\u0027t work, you can still use the cheat menu to complete this contract. Would be just fair to that, since you pretty much did everything you can do.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003Eedit: \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:ph34r:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ph34r.png\u0022 title=\u0022:ph34r:\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-07T20:41:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2020 08:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by 4x4cheesecake\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epicsockzebra22","CreatedById":203845,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-08T01:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe checkmark sadly goes away the moment I leave the approximate area above the location on Duna.\u00A0 I\u0027m thinking the cheat menu might be the only way to do this one \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn response to Vanamode, will it count me as being above if I\u0027m opposite the spot (i.e. on the wrong side of Duna)?
