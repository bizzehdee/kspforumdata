Not only does this help boosters not get shoved into your central core, but staging tends to be a critical point in rocket flipping because you\u0027re usually discarding something with low mass but a lot of surface area, meaning your CoM won\u0027t move much, but your center of pressure does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen in doubt, post asking for advice.

This spinning thing is something we all initially had trouble with in the new 1.0\u002B aero until we learned to engineer and fly new rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpinning out of control essentially comes down to a contest between drag and control. When the drag overcomes your control authority, you go for a spin. You can decrease drag by staying closer to prograde and building a more aerodynamic rocket. You can increase control using engine gimbals, stabilizer wheels, and control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that drag increases significantly right around mach one (340 m/s), so you should stay pointed as prograde as possible at speeds around 290-400 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a rocket, any control fins should be as low and outside as possible. If you are using control fins on more than one stage, the CoL needs to stay below the CoM at all times, even as the tanks empty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T20:18:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to be aware of is when you stage away the first stage, your thrust usually changes, as does your TWR and often your ratio of frontheavy to backdraggy alters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are spinny just after staging, add some draggy bits to the back of stage 2 as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a craft that would do a flip after dropping the SRBs and I found that strutting up the boosters meant less flexing so when they staged there were less weird forces and my craft remanined stable.
