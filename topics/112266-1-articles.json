But it is easy to fix. Make sure that your rockets are AERODYNAMIC!! This is sooo important now. So put a fairing over your hardware that you are launching into orbit, while also putting a significant amount of control surfaces/tail fins, on your rocket to keep it stable.\n\nAnd lastly, don\u0027t turn too drastically while inside the atmosphere. If your rocket is not \u0022very\u0022 stable, then don\u0027t deviate more than 5 degrees from your prograde vector! And stability modules can help quite a bit too.\n\nIn the beginning I had a lot of issues too in 1.0. But following these steps, it has become quite easy again.\n\nAlso note, that with the new aerodynamic model, you will have to make your gravity turn earlier, and now you only need aroun 3500-3600 D-V to get into a stable low kerbin orbit! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T16:44:10Z","Content":"Post a picture of a rocket you\u0027re having trouble with, and we could give you some specific advice.\n\nI just launched a little torus space station, I wasn\u0027t able to do a full gravity turn, but by putting the regular delta-fins on my center stack, and on each of my boosters, I was able to keep control.

The amount of the pitch maneuver needed will depend on the TWR of the craft and when you do it. Higher TWR or higher altitudes mean having to be more aggressive with the pitch maneuver.\n\nComplete your pitch maneuver before going near Mach 1. Because of how aerodynamics work, the flipping tendancy is at its worst near Mach 1, and I find trying to punch through Mach 1 before doing the pitch maneuver leaves me having to make a very aggressive pitch maneuver.\n\nTry to be pointing straight prograde during staging events. Not only does this help boosters not get shoved into your central core, but staging tends to be a critical point in rocket flipping because you\u0027re usually discarding something with low mass but a lot of surface area, meaning your CoM won\u0027t move much, but your center of pressure does.\n\nWhen in doubt, post asking for advice. Include screenshots of the craft in question, a basic description of your ascent profile, and at what point the flipping happens. Probably the only thing more frustrating than trying to help someone deal with a flipping rocket when your own attempts at launching that rocket fly with no problems because you\u0027re not recreating the situation accurately enough is being the person with the flipping rocket."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T19:36:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Heavy bits at the front, draggy bits at the back, gimbal is good. That\u0027s really all there is to it.\n\nHaha, I really like this summary!\n\nFor the OP, here are my general tips for old players:\n\nYou are not alone. This spinning thing is something we all initially had trouble with in the new 1.0\u002B aero until we learned to engineer and fly new rockets.\n\nSpinning out of control essentially comes down to a contest between drag and control. When the drag overcomes your control authority, you go for a spin. You can decrease drag by staying closer to prograde and building a more aerodynamic rocket. You can increase control using engine gimbals, stabilizer wheels, and control surfaces.\n\nAlso note that drag increases significantly right around mach one (340 m/s), so you should stay pointed as prograde as possible at speeds around 290-400 m/s.\n\nOn a rocket, any control fins should be as low and outside as possible. If you are using control fins on more than one stage, the CoL needs to stay below the CoM at all times, even as the tanks empty."},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T20:18:16Z","Content":"One thing to be aware of is when you stage away the first stage, your thrust usually changes, as does your TWR and often your ratio of frontheavy to backdraggy alters.\n\nIf you are spinny just after staging, add some draggy bits to the back of stage 2 as well.\n\nI had a craft that would do a flip after dropping the SRBs and I found that strutting up the boosters meant less flexing so when they staged there were less weird forces and my craft remanined stable. Similarly, restricting thrust 5-10 seconds before staging can help sometimes."},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T07:23:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E have a simple tutorial of how to flight stuff now...\n\nWait, the tutorials that come with the game have not been updated?"},{"CreatedByName":"Lukaszenko","CreatedById":95776,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T08:35:20Z","Content":"Maybe slow down, too?

MechJeb has some funky bugs in it right now. take for example, the pre 0.90 like say .26 for example and its compatible mechjeb, IT could use launch to rendezvous, now? its just a button taking up GUI space if you ask me, as that button causes odd things to happen. has been so since .90. no one listens...back on point.
