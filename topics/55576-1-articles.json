The reaction wheels on the command pod only measures the tourqe of the controls, not the control itself, rigth?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what makes you control those first rockets?

The LV-T30 engines also produce electric charge as they are running. If you need more charge, you can stack another pod on your craft, turn off the reaction wheels, and maybe leave it empty, giving you an extra 50 units. It is possible to do a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn mission just using the 50 units of electric charge, if your spacecraft can get there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-09T00:10:56Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2013 12:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainArchmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T07:16:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo add to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaction wheels have no friction and do not saturate in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaction wheel force is additive when you have multiple parts that have them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T16:10:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo add further, in real life, they\u0027re often called gyroscopes.
