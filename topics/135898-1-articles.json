I\u0027m testing 1,1 against x64 loads beyond the x86 memory limit to see if I can make it crack, but I noticed a bug that isn\u0027t a 1.1 bug and is related to mods. If you have a craft in the water, you launch a new craft, the craft becomes debris and is removed as you approach within 2km. The only plugins I have installed is, scatterer, firespitter that came with RoverDude\u0027s update to MKS, RoverDude\u0027s USI stuff and Module Manager.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
