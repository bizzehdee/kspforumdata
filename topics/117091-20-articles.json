(They are doing scissors,which is nice though)\n\nYeah, I\u0027ve found half of the challenge so far, especially with the jets, is designing the aircraft in a way that forces the AI pilot to not bleed all its energy off.\n\nJust a query, for the jet category there is a set minimum weight - are we going by the weight in the Engineer\u0027s Report or can we go by KerbEngineer or something else? Because from what I can tell the in-built Engineer\u0027s Report doesn\u0027t respect altering the mass of a procedural wing. Only according to the in-game report my jet is 3.7t (without armament because the new BD armoury has broken the weapon pack ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) ) but KerbEngineer says that it\u0027s 5.1t."},{"CreatedByName":"Phearlock","CreatedById":90274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T10:25:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The way ai fly is makes me crazy.

My best advice is: Don\u0027t try to force the AI to fly intelligently, design an aircraft that the AI can fly in a dumb fashion. If I were making an aircraft for myself to dogfight in, I wouldn\u0027t end up with the Spike 5, however, the AI seems to like it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T10:29:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 10:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Phearlock**"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T10:36:06Z","Content":"@Littlerift: I will look into that.\n\nIf anything, the knowledge database seems to be precise."},{"CreatedByName":"Gojira","CreatedById":10884,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T19:18:05Z","Content":"Woohoo!
