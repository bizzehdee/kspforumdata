When I enter the VAB I was greeted by this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NVCJdDj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NVCJdDj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few seconds, it returned to normal, and I managed to actually play for a bit, but once my ship crashed (As they usually do), and I went back to the Space Center, I found this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3apCdg4.png\u0022 alt=\u00223apCdg4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went into the VAB again, but the frame rate dropped severely at that point, and the game became practically unplayable, so I had to force close it. Sometimes it crashes too, but recently it\u0027s just frozen or dropped frames so much I have to close it.
