When I enter the VAB I was greeted by this:\n\n![NVCJdDj.png](http://i.imgur.com/NVCJdDj.png)\n\nAfter a few seconds, it returned to normal, and I managed to actually play for a bit, but once my ship crashed (As they usually do), and I went back to the Space Center, I found this:\n\n![3apCdg4.png](http://i.imgur.com/3apCdg4.png)\n\nI went into the VAB again, but the frame rate dropped severely at that point, and the game became practically unplayable, so I had to force close it. Sometimes it crashes too, but recently it\u0027s just frozen or dropped frames so much I have to close it. I play KSP on Mac OSX 10.6.8 Snow Leopard through Steam using these settings, but I have experimented with different settings, but with no results:\n\n![KdGjWzv.png](http://i.imgur.com/KdGjWzv.png)\n\nHere are my computer specs: \n\nModel Name: iMac\n\n Model Identifier: iMac11,2\n\n Processor name: Intel Core i3\n\n Processor speed: 3,2 GHz\n\n Number of processors: 1\n\n Number of cores: 2\n\n Level 2 cache (per core): 256 kB\n\nLevel 3 cache: 4 MB\n\n Memory: 4 GB\n\nBus speed: 5.86 GT/s\n\nHelp would be much appreciated!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-04T20:10:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2015 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Master Tao**\n  \nNorwegian \u003E English"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T20:15:27Z","Content":"The first issue is a graphical glitch that I believe cropped up in KSP 0.90. Since it doesn\u0027t affect gameplay, fixing it wasn\u0027t a high priority.\n\nBased on your specs, the most likely cause for the second issue is running out of memory, but your [thread=92230]Player.log will show that[/thread]. The stock solution is to reduce the texture quality."}]}
