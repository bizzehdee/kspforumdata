As far as a beginner telescope I recommend getting yourself a decent pair of binoculars to start, check out models made by celestron. Once you are comfortable with finding stars,constelations, and nebulas at low power. The minimum scope I would recommend, and the one I own, is an 8 inch dobsonian reflecting telescope made by Orion telescopes. It\u0027s a great scope for a little over 300 American dollars. Don\u0027t by anything less or you will just have to a better and bigger telescope in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.s.
