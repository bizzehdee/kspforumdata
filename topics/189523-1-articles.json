When you have all the instruments unlocked, a complete package for the Mun (two goo for balance, one materials bay, one of each of the four sensors) already costs 20k funds. The seismometer and gavioli detector in particularly hit the bottomline hard, and you want to make sure to return them. The Breaking Ground surface experiments and support equipment will cost you another 15k\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, you probably want at least two Kerbals (a pilot and a scientist), though I usually carry three in order to get them XP in a timely manner. A three-man pod costs 3.8k (or just 3k with Making History). Landing legs cost you another 1k-2k depending on your setup. So you\u0027re already at 40k total, and you don\u0027t even have fuel, decouplers, or engines yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what my latest midgame Mun lander looked like. It has all the equipment mentioned above, so 40k invested towards a three-Kerbal lander with all experiments onboard; and then, another 30k is used for all the rest of said lander, and the stages below it. It\u0027s actually quite healthily overprovisioned; the second stage still has fuel when I start the deorbit burn at the Mun, and the lander has more than 2025m/s too, because the four nosecones decouple during Kerbin ascent when they\u0027re no longer needed. Only the materials bay is ditched, the rest of the science experiments are returned to Kerbin. Well, the surface experiments obviously stay up there too... The variant without surface experiments (you only need them once, after all) has even more excess \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, and I\u0027ve done small hops to neighboring biomes with it. Gotta keep the hops really small though, and flown the rest of the mission well, or it\u0027ll run out of fuel on the way back to Kerbin. Hops are more expensive than you think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are solar panels you can\u0027t see here, there\u0027s an OKTO-2 probe core in case there\u0027s no pilot in need of XP, and batteries and an antenna stashed in the service bay. Four Spark engines on the lander. I\u0027d only need two as far as thrust is concerned, but I like symmetry. The stages below are driven by a Cheetah and a Mastodon respectively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could probably make it a bit cheaper if I really tried, but as said before, the only savings that can be made are in the 30k that makes up the rocket, not in the 40k that make up the science and the pod. So the potential to scrooge is somewhat limited. Probably downsizing the first stage a little would be the approach I\u0027d take.

It was not meant to come across like that. It is indeed not intentionally cost optimized - hence the last part, where I said that thef first stage probably has the most potential or savings, even if they won\u0027t be that large. See, I aimed to give a practical example of how the majority of the spacecraft\u0027s cost is tied up in the science experiments themselves, which defines a bottom floor below which the cost may never fall, no matter how frugal you build.

The resulting vessel had about 200m/s excess instead of the other one\u0027s ~600m/s, and that\u0027s a number I wouldn\u0027t go below in case something doesn\u0027t go according to plan.

Or relays work too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting approach, but I must ask - is that actually safe to return? Last time I tried to reenter a lander can without a heatshield, it promptly burned up, even on a relatively benign trajectory. Admittedly, that was a few versions ago, before they reworked the Mk2. I\u0027ve always just assumed that it wasn\u0027t meant to be, since even the descriptions state them to be unsuitable for reentry, IIRC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, which part decouples after landing? The entire structure above the probe core? That would be... counterproductive, IMHO. Because the science is so expensive, the return value is a significant factor in total mission cost. I don\u0027t always get the full ~35k value of my return vehicle, but I probably get at least 25k if I use my excess fuel to control my EDL timing and vector. That would put the total mission cost of my original 70k vehicle at around 45k funds at most, which is likely less than what you\u0027d pay for a 54k vehicle that only returns two lander cans and assorted greebling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recommend paying the (very small) price in weight and cost to put a 1.25m service bay on top of the Mk1 lander can.

Last time I tried to reenter a lander can without a heatshield, it promptly burned up, even on a relatively benign trajectory. Admittedly, that was a few versions ago, before they reworked the Mk2. I\u0027ve always just assumed that it wasn\u0027t meant to be, since even the descriptions state them to be unsuitable for reentry, IIRC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, which part decouples after landing? The entire structure above the probe core? That would be... counterproductive, IMHO. Because the science is so expensive, the return value is a significant factor in total mission cost. I don\u0027t always get the full ~35k value of my return vehicle, but I probably get at least 25k if I use my excess fuel to control my EDL timing and vector.
