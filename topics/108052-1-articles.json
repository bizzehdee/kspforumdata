So what happened with courage and stupidity stats? They still serve no function and appear to be an unfinished part of the game.\n\nAs I say, this may have been covered but I\u0027ve not seen an explanation. Perhaps it\u0027s a mechanic reserved for a later addon?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T13:49:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 01:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mulbin**"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T13:53:07Z","Content":"Either Squad has decided that there isn\u0027t a compelling use for them (they existed long before crew XP, which may have replaced them), they are intended to remain flavor elements without gameplay impact, or Squad may implement some use for them in a later patch.

As Squad has stated numerous times, they called this release 1.0 because it was \u0022scope complete\u0022. This is completely different from feature complete. This version had everything they had originally planned for the game. Plans change over time and even though they finished what they originally wanted in the game, there are still more features to come including multiplayer.\n\nAs said above, I\u0027m pretty sure these stats are mostly about the facial animations. But to me they also add to the flavor of what it means to be a kerbal in a space program - this is their version of \u0022the right stuff\u0022."}]}
