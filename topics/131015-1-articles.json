I splash back and play with him for a while before he gets bored and wants out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\nSeven fifteen and I pull the bottle of milk out of the microwave and fasten the top on it and scoop up John into my arms and wrap a blanket around him. We sit in a rocking chair the sounds of an ocean front filling the darkened room as he drifts off to sleep. Looking down at him asleep I can feel the creeping on my skin and know that I won\u0027t share in the comfort of sleep tonight, I feel the memories surface in my mind, the phantoms of days past, the tightening around my neck and the smell of salt and oil fill my nose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\nSeven forty and I lay my infant son down in his crib and tuck his blanket around him and make sure his Pooh Bear is next to him. I leave the room and grab my head phones off the door knob and plug into whatever music I think might make me feel better while checking my email. More rejection notices and come-on\u0027s, no news that I have been craving, no offers again, another day gone. I sit at my desk and fire up my laptop, eight years on and still going strong, it never lets me down. I open up Steam and browse my library nothing sticking out at me. The door slams and my wife returns home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\nNine O\u0027clock and Anna is in bed and I am still awake fighting the growing fear of my own head and I am back at my computer, Eddy\u0027s keys glow blue and welcoming. I just click an icon to do something not caring what, moments later the familiar of three little green men screaming in fear and adulation covers the screen. I settle in for the long load time, my old laptop is a trooper but his age is showing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\nNine fifteen and I look around the KSC checking my contracts and my active missions, nothing really checking my eye then I notice it, an alert in the corner WARNING: Vessel \u201CArtemis 5\u201D low on supplies. Reading that I remember; a bad mission, a lone kerbanaught stranded on the mun the failed takeoff. The recollection triggers a flood of pent up emotions I have been carrying all day and suddenly I am all alone feeling the fingers in my mind dragging me down... NO I am not there anymore I am safe and goddamn it I am going to bring poor Edmin home safe too. I open up Spotify on my phone and put on power metal, he is coming home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\nTen forty and I stand outside in the cold my boot loose on my feet the embers of a cigarette glowing faintly. I run through delta-v requirements in my head, going through my limited engines and parts available. My mind races as I think of ship designs, then I have it I know what to build and how to do it. I am back inside after I scrub my hands and face I am designing then its ready to go. I push the construct button and time wrap watching the time tick down, the clock races and its finished with five days left before Edmin runs out. I scan my roster of available pilots and there is only one option for a mission of such magnitude, Jeb go bring our boy home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\nEleven O\u0027clock and the rocket screams into the sky. All system nominal good track and a nice roll, then it happens I hear it even through my head phones, the anguished cries of a child in fear. I move like lightening and am at the crib-side in a moment. John is sitting up, tears streaking his face. As I look down at him I feel the shared dread of dreams and hate that he already has things to fear in the night. I pick him up in a moment holding him close. His whimpers calming and a small smile forming on his face, and I know that he will be hanging out for a bit. I carry my little guy out to the living room where my desk is and sit him on my lap a blanket tucked around him. He wiggles a moment before settling in for an late evening with dad, happy to be in my lap. Then the mission is back on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\nEleven Forty and I feel someones head slump over and look down in my lap. John is fast asleep a faint snoring the only indicator of life. I go to stand up and I am greeted by a whimper of protest, guess he isn\u0027t ready to move. I go back to fiddling with my maneuver nodes planing my landing approach. I make another attempt to stand and get a grunt of dismay from my lap. Fine... Back to the mission. Deorbit burn, adjustment burns, final approach... this is it this is the make or break moment legs down, kill horizontal velocity and moments later touch down. The muffled womp of a decoupler and the rover is deployed and Jeb is off into the crater towards the canyons. The rover bounces along zipping across the Munar surface\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;\u0022\u003E\nTwelve ten and finally reached the crash site of the Artemis with a nudge of the rover Jeb rolls the capsule so the hatch is up and Edmin is freed. Its the work of a minute and he is on the rover on the way home at last, a few minutes later and the lander is lifting off leaving behind the rock that would have been his tomb. I am on the edge of me seat white knuckled the whole way. A routine return from the mun suddenly has much more weight and as the capsule makes its descent through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere I wait with fear in my heart as the ablator ticks down. Heat builds and my anxiety grows. Its not going to make it I came in too steep. I panic trying to think of options, \u003Ci\u003EWhat would Manly do?\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-style:normal;\u0022\u003E, maybe I can aerofoil the capsule decrease the drag... then its over the flames are gone and its slowing down. Foomp and the parachutes deploy, then splashdown. I want to shout I want to cheer. We saved Edmin we got him home. Then I can feel them hot and heavy, the tears running down my face as I let it out and I face the terror in my head, the fear, the lonely isolation all washing over me. I feel the tide rising and I feel like I am going to lose it but I see the smiling faces of Jeb and Edmin in the corner of my screen and feel a little tug on my shirt and look down at the baby in my lap. I got you home Edmin go home kiss your wife hug your kids you made it home, buddy. I wipe my eyes and close my laptop, I hitch John up to my shoulder and carry him off to bed again. As I walk back to the living room killing the lights I pause for a moment and say aloud I\u0027m glad I got you home Edmin and thanks for helping me get home tonight too.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T04:37:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDamn, man.

Its really hard to write about this my bouts of\u00A0depression and mania and its even harder for me to talk about it with my family and friends.
