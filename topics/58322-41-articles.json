This would make it easier to click on, and stop missiles sitting inside the wings (it looks weird). To differentiate between them and the bomb hardpoints, you could just make the missile one much longer (hard point goes most of the length of the missile), and then make the bomb ones greyer...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAIM-120 would be radar guided. But yeah, there surely is room to expand!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket/missile hardpoint will have a totally different model eventually, I just scaled the ordnance hp for simplicity and to save some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I did add in testing is a second torpedo.. this one is propelled for shooting off the side of a ship or launching from a sub, I\u0027m testing it alongside the boatparts update now. I\u0027ll see what I can do to get more variety in the next update. Really what I do is pick a hole, and then find a weapon to add to fill that gap, and write the code in to make it happen. Heat seeking is by far the most expensive of the lot in terms of performance loss, next would be the CIWS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"harpwner","CreatedById":30268,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T03:27:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022InfiniteDice\u0022 data-cite=\u0022InfiniteDice\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Zephyrs were meant to be A-G missiles, you\u0027re right they are not terribly fast. The Kerbenders should do what you need... I\u0027m wondering how you were firing them. They should track a forward heat source, if they are having issues I could give them a secordary air-air mode that will make them behave slightly different if launched while flying.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s interesting, i just thought since the nature of the missile was heat seeking it would make sense (but just in this mod) that it would turn towards my plane\u0027s heat source.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIll try again and see if i cant fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
