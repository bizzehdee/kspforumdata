I\u0027m in the mood to add some new ores to my game, just something simple to start with, diamonds which I imagine could be found in rare deposits on asteroids. Any tutorials or documentations that I could read up on about adding ore? Also, do I have to start a new game for the effects to take place? I have a career mode I\u0027m rather invested in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks in advance for both your help and patience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T18:26:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t done this before myself so take what I say with a grain of salt ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding a resource just takes a simple config file - see Community Resource Pack for a config file that adds a lot of resources (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91998\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91998\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you need something to harvest the resource - look at the existing drill config files and under a section named something like \u0022ModuleHarvestResource\u0022 and either add your resource or add a new drill - ModuleManager (MM) is a really good way to do this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-Module-Manager-2-1-5-%28May-22%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E(\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-Module-Manager-2-1-5-%28May-22%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-Module-Manager-2-1-5-%28May-22%29\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you need tanks to store the stuff in - same as above MM is the way to go for this - add a tank(or tanks).
