What would be the real life analog to this? Is this a concession the game makes oriented to better gameplay or would this actually be possible? I mean - I know thrust is a function of chamber pressure and propellants used (among other things but I\u0027m guessing these 2 are the main items?) so my common sense tells me this \u0022Thrust Limit\u0022 in-game functionality would have no place in real life without actually modifying the engine - is this the case?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany thanks in advance, as always I gloat in your knowledge of science and space related stuff \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-10T16:59:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2018 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by hypervelocity\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ebad englando again\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ment18","CreatedById":125039,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-10T17:03:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour right, real engines cannot\u00A0arbitrarily reduce their thrust.\u00A0 Most engines can throttle a little bit, like \u002B-5% I think, but it takes special engine designs to get higher than that.\u00A0 The Apollo landing engine was unique in its ability to throttle to 11% I think, and Be4 and Merlin can throttle down to 40% and 70% if I remember correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hypervelocity","CreatedById":136426,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-10T17:08:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125039-ment18/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125039\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125039-ment18/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ment18\u003C/a\u003E, that\u0027s what I thought - I noticed the throttling ability in the engines you mentioned (I have used the Apollo descent engine and a couple of Merlins).

The 100% level does not mean the maximum physical power level attainable, rather it was a specification decided on during engine development\u2014the expected rated power level. When later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of power level to physical thrust helps reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or operational data from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the power level was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power level on that date.\u003Csup\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_main_engine#cite_note-SSMEFTY-12\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[12]\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/sup\u003E Engine power level affects engine reliability, with studies indicating the probability of an engine failure increasing rapidly with power levels over 104.5%, which was why power levels above 104.5% were retained for contingency use only.\u003Csup\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_main_engine#cite_note-SSMEAT-32\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[31]\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-10T23:25:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2018 11:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Gargamel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-11T13:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223413466\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176627\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221531246587\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe RS-25 (Shuttle main engine) was capable of 67%-109% throttle levels.\u00A0 The Merlin 1D (Falcon 9) can throttle between 40% and 100%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsn\u0027t Merlin 1D more than 200% of Merlin 1A?\u00A0 I don\u0027t think it is 40% to 200%, but I have to wonder how much bigger they have to make the first stage merely to keep the hoverslam possible with the more powerful engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t forget that\u00A0 changing the thrust of solid rockets is far more likely in real life than throttling liquid rockets.\u00A0 You can\u0027t change them in flight, but you can manufacture the rocket to give higher/lower thrust as it burns through the fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hypervelocity","CreatedById":136426,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-11T18:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for all the replies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a bit of context: I am creating a spaceplane that is inspired in Boeing\u0027s Phantom Express.
