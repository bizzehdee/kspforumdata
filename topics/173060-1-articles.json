So you\u0027re looking at whatever it costs to maneuver into the right assists.\u00A0 I\u0027d say a few hundred here.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s about 1,000 m/s\u00A0to get from Laythe back to a Kerbin intercept (again, without any assists on the way)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnd it should be pretty much free to capture back at Kerbin, if you have the heat tolerance to aerobrake.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo 4,000 m/s should be enough for a round trip, without needing to get too terribly fancy with your maneuvers.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-27T06:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say it was marginal without some luck. Sure, it is do-able but risky. It would almost certainly mean aerobraking back at Kerbin, which for me usually means just a capule and heatshield (20% ablator is good for almost any re-entry).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are some variables that are hard to predict, particularly your gravity brake\u00A0at\u00A0one of Jool\u0027s inner moons.
