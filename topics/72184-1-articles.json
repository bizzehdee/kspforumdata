I still have a very difficult time imagining KSP as a multiplayer game.

If I want other peoples\u0027 input, that\u0027s why I come on these forums... I\u0027d much rather see content for KSP cover more high-concept science fiction like interstellar travel, planetary colonization, high efficiency propulsion, et. cetera.

This departure towards muliplayer seems driven more by indi trends and than anything else. KSP was an early-access indi game when being so was cool. Now all of the top games on steam are \u0022early-access\u0022 and \u0022indi\u0022. So Harvester adopts multiplayer ... and suddenly KSP looks cool again. The interviewers have new questions and Harvester can leak tidbits to keep them interested. That\u0027s much more fun than discussing new engines, new planets or mathematical bug squashing. The reality is that neither KSP nor Squad are suited for multiplayer development. This is going to be a long uphill battle, ending in a cluster of griefer-managment issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut perhaps problems are the real goal of muliplayer. The downside of the indi development cycle is that eventually you have to finish projects. Not the entire game, but you have to eventually say that this or that aspect is actually done. That is a scary time for developers. Just look at what happened to Persson (Notch) as Minecraft became feature-complete (the war of words with Yogscast at 2011 minecon). Taking on new, huge tasks like muliplayer buys time. It will allow squad to continue the \u0022it\u0027s alpha\u0022 act for another year. That might be a good thing if it keeps Squad motivated, but can be a very bad thing if it means that KSP languishes under multi-month or even year-long waits for incremental improvements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-13T18:51:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2014 06:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sandworm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Michaelo90","CreatedById":98783,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T19:08:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMultiplayer could be really fun if server admins get proper tools to keep griefers and other unwanted players out, but that\u0027s not even close to being the biggest problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real problem is time warp.
