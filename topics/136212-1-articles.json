This will IMHO however not mean that KSP hasn\u0027t got a future. There are many games, who have been abandoned by their original creators virtually ages ago and who are still alive and kicking thanks to a big modding community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of my favourite examples is Microsoft Train Simulator. Train simulations is one very niche subject. The purpose of a train simulator is to run a train, literally watching it as it runs down miles and miles and miles of track. To some, me included, this is a relaxing, fun way of spending your free time. This enjoyment not only comes from the running of trains, but also from making content. When MS Train Simulator came out, it was BAD! The stock game was flawed, the stock content was looking like sh*t and hadn\u0027t the game been very open to custom content (despite the fact there was little to no documentation), it would have died a quick and silent death. But still today, people are creating content and commercial addons are being sold. Third party products, be they commercial or free, have overcome many of the short-comings and have also spawned successors of varying success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith KSP, I think, once Squad stops eventually working on it, whenever that may be, the modding community will be keeping it alive for quite some time.

This will IMHO however not mean that KSP hasn\u0027t got a future. There are many games, who have been abandoned by their original creators virtually ages ago and who are still alive and kicking thanks to a big modding community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of my favourite examples is Microsoft Train Simulator. Train simulations is one very niche subject. The purpose of a train simulator is to run a train, literally watching it as it runs down miles and miles and miles of track. To some, me included, this is a relaxing, fun way of spending your free time. This enjoyment not only comes from the running of trains, but also from making content. When MS Train Simulator came out, it was BAD! The stock game was flawed, the stock content was looking like sh*t and hadn\u0027t the game been very open to custom content (despite the fact there was little to no documentation), it would have died a quick and silent death. But still today, people are creating content and commercial addons are being sold.
