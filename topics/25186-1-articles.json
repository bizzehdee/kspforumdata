However, i wanted to keep it stock, so a revolving engine at the back like in the original would do, and just one engine at the back was too weak. Now its just a jet plane with kinda-VTOL capabilities. takeoff is ok, but landing is a nightmare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/j2TtmnY\u0022 alt=\u0022j2TtmnY\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif image is broken, go here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/j2TtmnY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/j2TtmnY\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebefore you ask, yes i did use to noclip for parts while making it. i needed it to make the VTOL jet engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epress 1 to toggle the VTOL engines, 2 for the main engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edownload:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download.php?u2p27fx38x9oe6y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download.php?u2p27fx38x9oe6y\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KissSh0t","CreatedById":57142,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T22:22:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat looks pretty nice..
