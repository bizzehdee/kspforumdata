I\u0027m moving entirely away from using upgrade points and relying on the tech tree, instead (likely) developing a new upgrade \u0022web\u0022 system. The way I\u0027ve got planned still could be considered \u0022flat\u0022, but much less so I think. Firstly, I plan on tying into the stock upgrades somewhat by having them as requirements for certain upgrades (ie, can\u0027t unlock a second build rate without a tier 2 VAB). I haven\u0027t fully decided if some upgrades will be unlocked automatically with stock upgrades (ie, build rates are solely a function of editor levels), or if they\u0027ll need to be purchased separately. Secondly, I\u0027m going to try to provide more options for upgrades, so that if someone wants to always use new parts and doesn\u0027t care to reuse old ones then they can do that, but if someone else tries to recover every single part then they\u0027ll be able to do that. Both ways will be considered valid, and there will be upgrades to make that playstyle better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t finalized any of my plans for upgrades though. I like the freedom of a custom upgrade system (face it, the stock upgrade system is very limited and upgrades are few and far between. I can tie into it 100%, but that reduces the freedom of playstyle and alienates Science and Sandbox game modes), but that\u0027s also a lot of work and may end up being as bad as the current one. But it sounds like fun for me to do, and hopefully would be fun to play with \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the editor GUI (and corresponding GUIs) is/are the next to get a facelift.
