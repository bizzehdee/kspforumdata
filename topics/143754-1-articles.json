Do give it a try with the stock gear. I usually have more trouble taking off than landing. A lot of people are saying to use bigger gear than the stress tolerance data indicates, but I\u0027ve found that using gear with 2/1\u00A0or greater\u00A0stress tolerance/ship mass ratio is usually a bad idea in terms of stability on landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get a lot more bouncing and swerving when my gear aren\u0027t at least a little flattened out, and not from adjusting the springs lower either. I try to dial in the total gear tolerances to be slightly, maybe 10-20% over the weight of the plane. Obviously there is no tweakable setting for stress tolerance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will mix and match from small to large (rarely extra large) retractable gears, varying the total number, placement, and friction settings to get a good match. The key reason I try to get it that close is that a 30t spaceplane might only mass 5-10t on landing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T02:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce some progress is made on fixing the landing gear and the mod gets updated, you will definitely want to look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/89874-105-adjustable-landing-gear-v120-masscost-scaling-tech-nodes-drag-may-30/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EAdjustable Landing Gear\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 It\u0027s just between a rock and a hard place because of the bugs in 1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, I\u0027d say try the stock gear and when it begins to frustrate you to no end that you can\u0027t find a good mounting spot for them so that they are wide enough not to flip the plane and level enough to not to hold the plane correctly and straight enough to not have the wheels crooked (this will inevitably happen if you like to build a variety of designs), then it\u0027s time for Adjustable Landing Gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-14T02:15:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2016 02:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T12:38:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBaha is on indefinite leave due to life so I\u0027d not hold your breath for ALG - the dll source is there but not the model source.
