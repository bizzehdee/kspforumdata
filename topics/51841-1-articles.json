And then something happens and you need to resort to an older save. Maybe you timewarped through the core of Kerbin? Maybe Kraken ate you? And when\u0027s the last time you saved? If you usually don\u0027t rely on the quicksave function it can be quite a while ago. Or maybe you\u0027re new to the game and haven\u0027t used it yet. And if you do decide to quickload the helpful autosave function will kick in and save at first opportunity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy proposal to save a lot of headache and frustration is to keep a few of the older persistent.sfs around. Before it overwrites persistent.sfs have it rename the older one to persistent.sfs2, and if that file exist rename that to persistent.sfs3. Two or three backups should be enough. To illustrate this, this is what the save folder looks like now:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EShips\u003Cbr\u003ESubassemblies\u003Cbr\u003Epersistent.sfs\u003Cbr\u003Equicksave.sfs\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith an automated backup system it would look like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EShips\u003Cbr\u003ESubassemblies\u003Cbr\u003Epersistent.sfs\u003Cbr\u003Epersistent.sfs2\u003Cbr\u003Epersistent.sfs3\u003Cbr\u003Equicksave.sfs\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know many of you value the way KSP rewards good planning and punishes bad plays, I do too! You sent an unmanned ship to Duna without power generation? Sucks to be you. You sent a ship to Moho but used too much \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V during the insertion? Better send a rescue party or plan another way home. My suggestion won\u0027t counteract that but rather serve as a much needed last resort safety net when you do sit there and wonder if your last two hours of gameplay truly is lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a sidenote, if anyone knows of a mod or even a third party program that does something similar without cluttering up the savefolder I\u0027d love to hear about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
