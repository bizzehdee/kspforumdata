As a result, you don\u0027t have any clouds. I suggest installing a config pack like SVE, Spectra, AVP, etc. Also could you take a picture of your GameData folder and share it here, as well as uploading your KSP.log, so we can tell what exactly the issue is?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Flying Kerbal","CreatedById":171547,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-14T00:08:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Heirloom and thanks for responding.\u00A0 My apologies for the slow response, I\u0027ve been a bit busy since my last post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, so after fiddling around most of this evening, I finally managed to completely corrupt my install, Kerbin ending up completely white, so I give up uninstalled it, and went for a completely fresh game downloaded from Steam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the GameData folder is completely stock.\u00A0 The only addons here are the two DLC\u0027s Making History and Breaking Ground.\u00A0 Here\u0027s a picture of my nice clean GameData folder:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZL3OKkr.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ZL3OKkr.png\u0022\u003EMods I would like are \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, together with other Mods needed to make it work, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Probes Before Crew, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, although I am aware \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E and so on have been added to the stock game now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve actually installed mods in\u00A0earlier versions of KSP, indeed I\u0027m playing 1.2 simply because I \u003Cu\u003Edo\u003C/u\u003E have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E working perfectly in it, but in 1.7 I\u0027m stuck.\u00A0 So any help or advice you can offer will be very much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Flying Kerbal","CreatedById":171547,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-14T20:49:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, after a great deal of fluffing about, fiddling and futtering, I finally got \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E to work.\u00A0 I changed over to AVP and am stunned by the results!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a few more little things to sort out and the KSA will be back in business.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
