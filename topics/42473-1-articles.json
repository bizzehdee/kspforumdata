Technically speaking, E = mc\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 is wrong. The correct equation is E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 = p\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2c\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 \u002B (mc\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2)\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. The reason for that is that the symbol \u0027m\u0027 is reserved for rest mass which is invariant for an object. However, inertial (and therefore gravitational) mass remains proportional to total energy. Since inertial mass of an object is equal to \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3m, it is also entirely fair to write E = \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3mc\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. Gamma is, of course, Lorentz Boost factor and it satisfies 1/\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 = 1 - v\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/c\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. Since p = \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3mv, the two expressions for energy are equivalent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour point is entirely valid, however, since it is the inertial mass of the object that determines the force required to accelerate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for relativistic rocket formula, something very interesting happens. While from perspective of the outside observer the ship accelerates less and less, requiring more and more fuel to get closer to speed of light at alarmingly faster rate than classical rocket formula would suggest, it\u0027s not actually as bad as it seems. Due to space contraction, it becomes increasingly faster for the ship to cover distance as measured by ship\u0027s clock. If instead of looking at speed relative to various objects you consider proper velocity of the rocket, which is how far you get in certain amount of ship time, eventually the equivalent \u0022rocket formula\u0022 becomes linear. That is, to go twice as fast, you need twice as big a fuel fraction. And that actually makes it possible to go really, really far, provided you have good fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, this doesn\u0027t let you break the light speed barrier. You can get insanely far on reasonable amount of fuel and within life time of the crew, but on Earth many, many years will pass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jwenting\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jwenting\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe speed of light it not a speed limit, it\u0027s a speed bump.\u003Cp\u003ETheory does not say you can\u0027t go faster than light, it only says you can\u0027t go AT light speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you could derive a way to accelerate to a speed \u0026gt;c without ever being at c, you could travel ftl.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the same goes for slowing down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat isn\u0027t actually true.

To an observer outside the bubble, the ship is faster than light. To an observer inside the bubble, the ship is completely stationary (I use the term \u0022bubble\u0022 here because warp field geometry [and, yes, there are people - real scientists - who do research into warp field geometries, which is, in a word, AWESOME] is still highly theoretical and nothing is known experimentally, and this is unlikely to change for some time barring a few changes in our current understanding of how the universe is put together that would make it possible for us to construct an FTL drive system - if I recall, current equations call for a particle with negative mass to exist, though I have no idea how it works - I\u0027m not a physicist.
