Slowing down and increasing stability. They make reentry more controllable by varying your drag profile. If you don\u0027t use Kobra manuvers, they are needed to avoid overheating. If you locate them near the tail, they will also add flight stability in reentry. Be warned, 4 air brakes is not enough to control the speed of an empty Mk3 plane in a dive.

Your SSTO is typically heaviest on accent. Waffling at transonic speeds wastes more fuel mass then 6 seconds of rocket burn. Using discrete rocket engines also saves you the extra jet mass. Jets are dead weight above 20 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the payload, you need hefty engines. 1.25 m engines do not scale well to 3 m fuselages. I find a KER read of .6-.7 \u0022vaccum\u0022 TWR is good for a Whiplash power plant, and a TWR of .6-.7 at takeoff weight for the anerobic mode should be sufficient after your jets do their thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStruts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStruts (and fuel lines) are a tricky subject for space planes.

I also manually transfer fuel/oxidizer from the pods to the fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy go-to Mk3 SSTO uses 8 Wiplashes and a mainsail. It can get a touch more than a freshly emptied orange tank to orbit.

I could likely replace 2 cargo bay segments with cabins and have more dV in orbit. The third cargo bay is required to store the 2 reaction wheels, solar panels, and batteries it needs.

A crew bay, cabin and support is only a 12 t payload (conservatively). I can SSTO that with 4 Wiplashes and a Mainsail (possibly just a Skipper). A Rino and 12 RAPIERs has to be too much thrust for that mass. Reduce the weight (and fuel) of your anerobic mode, and you reduce all of your flight needs. You also have far too much wing. You only need enough wing to maintain a 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA at 200 m/s. You won\u0027t be needing low speed lift until you lose most your weight.

Add control surfaces and structural wings to taste. (Especially in front of the structural A wing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShift the wings for CoM/CoL balance. Use two struts each to hold the pod relative to the body (ensure you make a triangle with each strut. Sides will be the wing, strut, and fuselage wall).
