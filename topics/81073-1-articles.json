I love MKS/OKS for the complexity and challange to setup a fully functioning base. Tac Life Support for a little bit realism and motivation to look at the time for a change :-). Interstellar, KEthane Scansat Deadly reentry for additional awesomeness :-D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut currently im looking for a Mod that does allow me to refuel my ships in a very specific way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar (AWESOME mod) and Kerbonite kind of bug me, because ive the feeling i dont have to work for out of Kerbin-fuel. I always like tofly really big ships so a little lander with an refinery/Drill/Converter is easy to outfit and take with me. Ive got the feeling of getting easy and free fuel for very very little investment. Kethane, while awesome because the deposits are exhaustable, has the same problem: i take a little Kethane Lander/converter and a scanner with me and can refuel almost anywhere in very little time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing im looking for is the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A Resource which is NOT present on EVERY planet. It does not nescessarily needs to be exthausable but it would be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The way its extracted should need some serious equipment. Im talking about a real Factory or destillery or the construction of an Oil Platform Sized Station. Its just too convienient to have a little mobile Rover with some tanks on him and fuel a whole Fleet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the mining of the Resource takes very very long. The timespan im talking about is this: filling a Half Rockomax tank in 1 Kerbal Month. If you are using some LifeSupport mod you will have to worry about your Kerbals dying before you have enough Fuel to get back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the idea of fueling up somewhere else than Kerbin and the mods out there are awesome, but i cant shake the feeling of getting free fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso my Question: is there a Mod out there which matches my \u0022needs\u0022 a little bit? Or a little tutorial for maybe decreasing the drillamount of the Kethanedrill?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebest regards\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T19:30:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Grossbeer, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s really an addon that does what you want, as any fuel producing addon is only limited by time and we have timewarp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is as you say, fuel for free...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s another option though, that is more time consuming in a real sense, and limited enough to keep the challenge, it also requires no addons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel can \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E be refined on Kerbin, so all fuel you use has to come from home, this means fuel barges sent ahead of time on low energy orbits, bi-elliptical transfer is good for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERendezvous, refuel, your supplies can be left in orbit but are of course limited to what you\u0027ve sent, you \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E combine this with kethane or karbonite for even more difficulty though by shipping kethane/karbonate \u003Cem\u003Eback\u003C/em\u003E to Kerbin for processing (imaging the refineries are too heavy/require too much maintenance to be sent into space).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel caches will let you extend your missions, but need a real input of effort to achieve \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-07T19:36:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2014 07:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T19:39:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no mod that does what you want, but using ORS (or even Kethane, but it has some idiosyncrasies that I personally don\u0027t like) you can easily set up additional resources in specific places. ORS is much easier for doing, say, polar ice caps because you just have to draw a picture for the planet and assign it a resource, whereas with Kethane you would have to write some code (not hard code by any stretch, and Majiir has made it very easy to hook into it, but if you\u0027re not comfortable with that ORS is easier to customize).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T20:07:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeya, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion would be ORS.
