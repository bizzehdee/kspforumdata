When he loses consciousness he drops the stick, control surfaces return to neutral positions and thus G-load relaxes too. Having normal G, a pilot wakes up after a few seconds and if the airplane wasn\u0027t pointing towards the ground he survives.\n\nOf course, in the real life there\u0027s a problem of a possible pilot\u0027s leaning on controls on G-LOC. And if that doesn\u0027t happen there\u0027s a risk of some uncontrolled muscular contractions on wake up causing some random inputs \u002B several seconds of disorientation afterwards.

The ones that act in the forward - backward direction are already implemented, they just have higher tolerances than longitudal Gs. Or may be you mean the forces that act in the direction from one shoulder to another? They are not implemented because of two reasons: first, it is hard to imagine a vessel design that makes them significant and second, there\u0027s few to none info about RL tolerances and effects of such forces.
