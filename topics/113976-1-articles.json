It only takes an extra 100 or so m/s of delta v to get to (less if you slingshot off the Mun) but requires considerably less to land and take off from something like 900\u002B m/s delta v less. So overall it can take roughly 1km/s less delta v to go to Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact it takes so little delta v to take off from that you can eva a kerbal on the surface and use the jetpack to fly all the way back to kerbin!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethx a lot\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:32:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESlightly more to GET to Minmus, but a lot less to land and take off again.
