It only takes an extra 100 or so m/s of delta v to get to (less if you slingshot off the Mun) but requires considerably less to land and take off from something like 900\u002B m/s delta v less. So overall it can take roughly 1km/s less delta v to go to Minmus.\n\nIn fact it takes so little delta v to take off from that you can eva a kerbal on the surface and use the jetpack to fly all the way back to kerbin!"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:21:08Z","Content":"thx a lot"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:32:42Z","Content":"Slightly more to GET to Minmus, but a lot less to land and take off again.

Minmus needs orbital plane alignment, which costs quite a bit of fuel (still not as much as to land on the Mun).

(make sure you have enough bat or a tower attached so you don\u0027t run out of electricity)\n\n3 launch with a minimal gravity turn until AP is 40-50ish\n\n4 Turn the ship horizontal and use the heading indicator for 96 or 84 (depending if you need to go north or south) burn until satisfied. This should get you within .1 degree\n\nThis can also be done with a gravity turn but corrections to the plane can be more costly then the savings. That being said if minnimus is at it highest or lowest point you can just launch equatorial with a normal gravity turn and fly-by at the assending/desending node"}]}
