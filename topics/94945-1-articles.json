Then you can play with your periapsis at each apoapsis until you get the hang of what altitude to enter at. It gets easier with each mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Janos1986","CreatedById":132068,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T15:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrajectories mod can help you with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt generates a white line which represents the orbit after you aerobrake at your actual periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you only have to radial burn back or forth until you get a periapsis (and therefore an apoapsis) that you like.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
