It\u0027s a very difficult question, and I honestly don\u0027t expect anyone to find a solution for it - in our world. In the Kerbal universe, BERTY might be the only one who can ensure Kerbin\u0027s and Kerbality\u0027s survival in the long term. Of course this is not easy to explain morally, but if the other option is the extinction of all Kerbals...

What many people don\u0027t understand is that every day we are killing the future of mankind with every piece of trash, with every kilowatt used, with every liter of CO2 we emit: all of this is poisoning our planet. I was quite shocked when on a physics lesson we were discussing different types of motor engines and how they emit these byproducts and then he said: you shouldn\u0027t worry about it, Earth will become inevitably poisoned not in your lifetime. I think this is the worst attitude kids are supposed to learn. I however love that there are many campaigns that raise money for recycling, nature protection and byproduct emission. They must teach the future generations that if we don\u0027t do something, the planet will just become overpopulated and poisoned. Considering birth, I think there should only be one child per family. If we don\u0027t control birth rates we will kill ourselves too quickly. China is a wise country, and they realized they overpopulated so they set up the 1 child law which is a very good thing. India has to do the same because it is insane how they have 8 children in families.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I am not to judge about humanity but I will do my best to save us from ourselves. Before thinking that killing half of humanity is tyranny, think of it this way-your are extending humanities existence twice in time, which is saving multiple generations of humans.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"czokletmuss","CreatedById":28063,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T11:21:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceSphereOfDeath\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpaceSphereOfDeath\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan I ask if after the AAR is finished it will be downloadable via, say a txt file?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking about making a e-book of sort of the AAR but it would require a lot of work (for instance, screenshots - some of them are vital for the story because of the \u0022show, don\u0027t tell\u0022 rule) and I would need someone to double-check the grammar and typos.

It certainly beats having the audience read a computer screen. Most of the time the voice is female (theories on why vary, see below) to emphasize the \u0022otherness\u0022 of the A.I.\u0027s nature, but there are many examples of male and gender neutral synthesized voices. Generally, they all carry a pleasant (if somewhat dull) monotone. If it should ever become (or started out with) a Creepy Monotone, watch out.\u003Cp\u003EThe gender will vary depending on the intentions of the computer. If it is designed to be utilitarian, military like, then it will be male. If it is supposed to be very user friendly for the tech-ignorant, then it will be female. The Star Trek franchise even shows this evolution: in the original series the female voice was always used when accessing encyclopedic information. The movies were more military-like, so it used a male voice. The Next Generation era computers were simply the most user friendly computer possible short of reading your thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has been referred to as the most common sci-fi female character archetype. That is, since Most Writers Are Male, and the Sci Fi Ghetto is particularly associated with male fans, there are a disproportionate number of male characters but somehow the idea of the female computer has gotten lodged into the collective unconscious. Probably not coincidentally, these A.I.\u0027s will have long, largely nonsensical descriptions whose acronyms \u0027just happen\u0027 to spell feminine names.

I think the hardest part would be finding a publisher for this sort of stuff, because publishing companies are often big control freaks that require everything to conform to a certain formula. Something like this with lots of inside Kerbal humor would probably not impress publishers as much as we all wish it would, although it is certainly deserving of more. I\u0027ve always wondered if it could be translated to video format, if we could find people to do all the voices and animation and KSP recording and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-06T04:56:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2014 04:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by BigOto2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peter1981","CreatedById":23895,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T11:25:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etry lulu.com my dad and mum and brother have all used this and made a profit!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- you can have hardback, paperback \u0026amp; even .pdf all avaliable for sale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- with full colour pictures, monochrome, no picture versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- you can do all diffrent versions, price them diffrently\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen post the link in your signature and watch the sale roll in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethus no publisher: you are the publisher and they print books individually and ship them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"czokletmuss","CreatedById":28063,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T20:04:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESneak-peak into the next chapter (which is coming Soon - in the meantime you can read the new chapter of my CK2 AAR \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yuqzZ3z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yuqzZ3z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"team.leit","CreatedById":68347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T20:06:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022peter1981\u0022 data-cite=\u0022peter1981\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Etry lulu.com my dad and mum and brother have all used this and made a profit!!\u003Cp\u003E-- you can have hardback, paperback \u0026amp; even .pdf all avaliable for sale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- with full colour pictures, monochrome, no picture versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- you can do all diffrent versions, price them diffrently\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen post the link in your signature and watch the sale roll in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethus no publisher: you are the publisher and they print books individually and ship them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not that, it is about if SQUAD will let czo do it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceSphereOfDeath","CreatedById":69754,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T22:50:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022czokletmuss\u0022 data-cite=\u0022czokletmuss\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECK2 AAR\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, but I assume this is your space race story, if not please post a link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peter1981","CreatedById":23895,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T22:53:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eforum rule 2.2.g would prevent the signature from publising the book perhaps but#\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy understanding is this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the one hand: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECopyright is the automatic right of the creator from the point that the first \u0027recorded\u0027 the work in a tangible manner.
