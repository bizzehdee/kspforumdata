I\u0027ve also stripped down B9 to several parts S2 (pod, tank, crew tanks and adapter), and the rcs tanks and the M27 \u0022tug\u0022 w/counterbalance. I would like to install IonCross or TAC-LS, but I am going to wait. Additionally, \u0022I\u0022 must have Universal Storage and DMagic\u0027s Orbital Science (two of the best in my opinion). ScanSAT and Remote Tech will have to wait until I can see what works with 1.0. I\u0027ve also hacked ZZZ\u0027s 2.5m greenhouse for IonCross with a good balance (that is such a great model). The last thing that I have installed is the K2 Gemini-like capsule. That is also an excellent model that needs an IVA.\n\nIf something is broke tomorrow, I will just remove the above until it works.\n\nBtw, are they going to have clouds?

It doesn\u0027t look like anything career-wise in 1.0 has changed other than the tech tree revamp and moar contracts. I often feel that Squad needs to take a break and go design a board game - that\u0027s game design at its purest, where every mechanic has to be there for a very good reason. Not \u0022we need to be able to change one currency into another... because it\u0027s what Harvester wanted when he wrote it up on a napkin 4 years ago\u0022.\n\nKSP the rocket launch simulation game is excellent.

If you send a crew to Dres to harvest science (even if you\u0027ve already maxed out the tech tree), upon return you\u0027re astronauts will have earn experience, you\u0027re given points because of all the science you gathered, and that science gets recorded.
