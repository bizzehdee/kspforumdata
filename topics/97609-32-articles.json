As I just started a poll about, I regard KSP now as a game, in contrast to a simulator/emulator. Mostly, because I think HarvesteR and Squad tries hard to make KSP a game. (Look at all the latest updates. Have they added anything really for the simulator/emulator part of the game, i.e. sandbox. Well, a little, but mostly for career mode - the game.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, is sandbox ready for 1.0? Yes, and it has been for 1-2 years. (Seriously, you can add a new aero model, or better water textures i 1.1 or 1.2. It is not a requirement. You can have fun in sandbox mode without it. Even re-entry damage, which I greatly look forward to, could be added in 1.3 without any harm done.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, is career mode (the game) ready for 1.0? No, I would say. Why? Because of 2 things (that I can think of): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. No cut-scenes and no story. If we take another game as an example, what would, say, Mass Effect be without story and cut-scenes? (You would run around on different planets, killing unnamed enemies in different clothes. Are they good guys? Are they bad guys? No, idea, you just kill them. Would that be fun? Yes, somewhat. Is the game better with cut-scenes and a story? Yes, immensely so!) Can a story be added in 1.1 or 1.2 in KSP? Well, to me, that would be really, really strange, to have it added after the full release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. No higher purpose. Again, in Mass Effect, (with the cut-scenes) you know what you set out to do and why. You have a mission, a goal. In KSP, its easy to get confused. Sure, you know why you start playing. To get to space. Possibly to get to the mun. But then what? What is the long term purpose of the game? How can I \u0022win\u0022? (Maybe it doesn\u0027t have to be an exact winning condition, but still, something to aim for.) My suggestion to this problem would be a self-updating encyclopaedia (as proposed in this thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108810-Wiki-integrated-into-KSP-career-mode\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108810-Wiki-integrated-into-KSP-career-mode\u003C/a\u003E), where everything you do updates your information about that moon or planet (or sun) you just performed a survey on. That would be one way to add some kind of goal (to complete the encyclopaedia). But even if nothing like that would be made, I miss a way to win. Can that be added in 1.1? No, that (to me) would also be strange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, \u003Cstrong\u003Emy conclusion\u003C/strong\u003E: if Squad aims to make a space program simulator, it is absolutely ready for 1.0. If they aim to make a game, like for example airline tycoon (or any other tycoon game really), I would say it is not quite ready (but not very far from it.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T16:40:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022monstah\u0022 data-cite=\u0022monstah\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...meaning, we\u0027re just kids in the back seat yelling \u0027Are we there yet\u0027..?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t put it like that.
