The clipping looks scary, but it\u0027s fine otherwise. Unless you do time acceleration. Even at 2x speed, the little guy clips out pretty quickly. He gets launched away at quite high speed if you attempt 3-4x accel.\n\nIf you recover the plane, he (and most likely the core too) is left on the runway. But that\u0027s no problem, you can recover the \u0027payload\u0027 too separately after (or before) that.\n\n![VEStsVt.png](http://i.imgur.com/VEStsVt.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"ZentroCatson","CreatedById":143939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T06:33:07Z","Content":"I had the exact same bug on an 1.0.2 career save.

Once the Kerbal was trapped in a small probe core, and with KIS I put the whole probe core in the rescuing Kerbal\u0027s pocket (inventory), and brought her back to Kerbin like that. Another one was trapped in an inflatable, but not habitable, OKS storage module. I used KAS to attach a docking port, docked to it (which re-powered the module), inflated it, and then re-entered using it as an inflatable de-accelerator (similar to what NASA just tested). Amazingly, it worked.\n\nI wonder if this problem occurs without mods, or if it\u0027s caused by a problem with one of the mods?"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T05:08:49Z","Content":"I\u0027ve tracked this down to a particular ModuleManager config in USI MKS.
