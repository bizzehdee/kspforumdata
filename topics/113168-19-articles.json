The devnotes is no place for a simple picture that should have been put in the announcement section, and a lot of information was posted on other sources (reddit, twitter) that only made it to the forums via community members. The PS4 FAQ was too little too late. Communication failures from Squad aren\u0027t really a new issue, but this was an especially bad failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially I wasn\u0027t happy with the PS4 announcement, but after reading Harv\u0027s article I feel a little better about it. I\u0027m still skeptical of their choice of partners, but it sounds like they made a tech demo of KSP working on a PS4 before Squad committed to this, so maybe they have at least some coding skills. Their website and accomplishments list is still atrocious though, hopefully Squad made the right choice with them and it won\u0027t come back to bite them later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like this decision may have been linked to the mysterious deadlines around the 1.0 release. I seriously doubt Squad will comment directly on this, but as others have said the little bit of information we have on the timelines lines up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Unity 5 update sounds like it\u0027s progressing nicely, hopefully we won\u0027t have to wait too long for 1.1, but I would rather it be delayed and stable than early and buggy. Hopefully the game will finally get a proper balance/polish pass this time since it didn\u0027t really get one for 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope Squad backports the PS4 UI and control scheme to PC once they\u0027re done with it (as an option, definitely not as the default) for those of us with gamepads who like to connect our PCs to the TV occasionally and play on the couch. I don\u0027t have a PS4 and don\u0027t plan on getting one, so the existence of a console version doesn\u0027t really mean anything to me, but I don\u0027t have a problem if one exists so long as the integrity of the PC version is maintained. If it\u0027s optimized well, it could provide a decent low-cost alternative compared to a gaming PC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, I wish Squad success in this endeavor, so long as the PS4 version doesn\u0027t further negatively impact the PC version (1.0 is already done, but it sounds like now it\u0027s providing some benefits for the Unity 5 update).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gerandar","CreatedById":136705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T21:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t even waste 5 minutes playing KSP on a console.
