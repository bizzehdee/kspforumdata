Game of the year? Totally, but not really elegible since 1.0. Labor of love? That was before Take2over. \u00A0Best environment? If I really thought so, KSP would not be elegible since what, 0.19? And most fun with the machine? Yes, KSP could be kinda contentender here if kOS got integrated into stock with a side dish of 0x10c. But as far as The Machine is concerned, IMO nothing comes anywhere close to Factorio, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=factorio\u002Bcomputer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enot by far\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-24T13:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223509104\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022180769\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221545440443\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022176735\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jesusthebird\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/22/2018 at 2:00 AM, Jesusthebird said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteam Awards Voting...\u0022Most Fun with a Machine\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace Engineers is there...what about KSP?? How does a game even become eligible for such an award? Hard to imagine with as great as this community is that ksp wouldn\u0027t make the cut for that category..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince it\u0027s all about player votes, I\u0027d say that the public opinion has spoken, plain and simple. KSP has entered Steam awards before, so it\u0027s not like this community doesn\u0027t \u0027do Steam\u0027. They\u0027ve just not voted for KSP this time. We can all have opinions about why that is, and no doubt it will be hotly debated, but bottom line KSP has only itself to blame for not being up there this time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand: I have looked at the games that ended up on the different categories, and mostly just shook my head and shrugged at most of the nominations. GTAV for Labor of Love? Seriously? So, maybe we should be glad KSP didn\u0027t get named alongside... other games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-26T13:09:56Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2018 01:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by swjr-swis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGotY \u0026lt;\u0026gt; LoL\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
