Your mission was well executed and your crafts looked good.  I like the reuse of the command module for the Laythe lander and for the return to Kerbin.  You could have had more pictures, especially with the resource window open, but nothing looks too implausible.\n\n[@zeta function](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/178370-zeta-function/) Congratulations, you have completed the Jool 5 Challenge on Level 2!  It\u0027s a great accomplishment for a new member of the forums.  I liked the Tylo lander, it\u0027s impressively small for two Kerbals.  Your Laythe lander was also a unique design.  Thank you for the descriptive pictures!\n\nKSP 1.3 has rolled around and while KSP updates usually mean a new leaderboard and some new rules, not much has changed that can influence performance on this challenge.

If any images have been eaten and are needed, let me know and I can reupload.\n\nMods were BetterTimewarp and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\nMission went as follows - Liftoff to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, used last gasp of big booster plus LV-N to get a Jool intercept.  \n\nTylo gravicapture into the system, then a Laythe orbit.  Used very elliptical orbits everywhere for my main ship.  Laythe lander safely laneded, then back to orbit.  Kept the core of the lander, basically a service bay with a chair and reaction wheel, fuel can, and Spark, and docked it with a Tylo stage.  Took the whole mess over to Tylo and parked in elliptical orbit.  Detached the lander and an ion stage, used the ion stage to lower orbit until circular, then landed the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E lander.  \n\nSecond album took off Tylo, dropping stages (reversing direction at one point) and made it back to my ion tug with very little fuel left.  Used the ion tug to get back to high orbit, and grabbed some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E from the main ship for Vall.  \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E landing on Vall, and back to Tylo orbit.  Moved the whole mess to Pol, landed on Pol and Bop using ions only.  Basically I would drag the big xenon can to a moon, leaving it in high orbit, and land on ions.  Lift off, meet the fuel can, and go back to the main ship.  Third album I did this on Pol, Bop, Eeloo and Dres, so I won\u0027t repeat myself any more.  Used LV-N powered main ship to get to Eeloo then Dres then home, left the ion part in orbit and brought Jeb down in the capsule.  All interplanetary flights were done with the main ship together and Jeb in his capsule.\n\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026module=system\u0026controller=embed\u0026url=http://imgur.com/a/6wIX5\u0022 style=\u0022height:451px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026module=system\u0026controller=embed\u0026url=http://imgur.com/a/0ZYDE\u0022 style=\u0022height:462px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026module=system\u0026controller=embed\u0026url=http://imgur.com/a/4xMMb\u0022 style=\u0022height:476px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-26T18:00:53Z","Content":"[@Jetski](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119969-jetski/) Congratulations, you have completed the Jool 5 Challenge on Level 1!

Is that Tylo? and did you just land on the tail and flop over to horizontal?\n\u003E \n\nYes, this is the very place that determines possibility of doing it with this kind of craft. Went a bit too tight on delta v (left the second ship in elliptic orbit, and even didn\u0027t take 100% \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E on separation, so there was some reserve to increase delta v - but there is also the question of getting back to a refueling site, given the second shuttle works just as a tanker after leaving all the detachable stuff on Laythe) and this kind of gravity is a bit too much beyond my piloting capabilities (next time I decide to do this in this kind of gravity, I\u0027ll write autopilot script, at least for the final maneuver)... Plenty of reloads\n\nAnd it doesn\u0027t land on tail, it flips a few meters above ground (preferably to make an additional softening boost at some 30-40 degrees pitch; gaining some horizontal speed is not a problem, but better to account for that on descent and not to completely kill horizontal speed before this last maneuver), there is a secondary set of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to perform this maneuver quickly and with enough control (also flip-protection if you bounce on touchdown)\n\nThis maneuver works perfectly on the Mun and should be quite doable on Vall, just Tylo makes it all ~~a bit~~ way too fast-paced for my piloting capabilities\n\nAnyway, there will be a video of the landing. (Although, a proper demonstration of how it works will probably be when I get to Vall, since it\u0027s not that crazy gravity.)\n\nBy the way, since Pol-Tylo transfer gave me almost polar orbit, I\u0027ve aimed for this. Flew over and had to drive a bit from the landing site after getting some fuel, but here we are\n\n![5d433ecee20c.png](http://s018.radikal.ru/i528/1707/23/5d433ecee20c.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerolyov","CreatedById":62002,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-15T21:28:15Z","Content":"Are you still accepting submissions recorded in 1.2?

Also if it\u0027s clear where you\u0027re going, such as during a long timewarp or on an easy landing on Bop, Pol, or Vall, the middle of that can be cut out.
