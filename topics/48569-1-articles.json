After MANY tries I finally got a pretty big honking thing out there lol. Pics below. However, I turned on the lights I had installed which looked awesome and they lost power after one orbit. I never put an electrical generator or solar panels etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I watched a tutorial on how to dock and my station has 4 separate docking stations. What i would like to do is fly up there, dock with it, and install an electrical power source. While I could dock with it, how the heck do I take parts up to it? How do I install them once I do? Do I have to hook up the lights to this source somehow? I\u0027m really lost on what to do next, any help or just a point in the right direction would really be appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimage.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s12.postimg.org/c3igzdiu5/Station_Launcher_2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Station_Launcher_2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimage.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eimages\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/844/viff.jpg/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/8469/viff.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022viff.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI re-added the picture of the launcher, I can try and get a better one, but it has 6 of the large fuel tanks with the largest engines, with a 7th in the middle of them all. the Station is stacked above it with tons of struts to get it thru the launch lol.

So make yourself a power assembly, a structural component like a truss with some bigass solar arrays and some batteries on it would be fine. Make sure it\u0027s got at least two docking ports, one to attach to the station, one to detach from the vehicle you use to dock it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re doing assembly in orbit you might want to build yourself an orbital tug. This is a vehicle that stays in orbit, and is used for moving other bits around. Nuclear engines and plenty of RCS fuel for docking are the way to go. Just keep refuelling it when required. If you\u0027ve got a decent sized launcher design, you could launch the tug with your power assembly already docked to the top. Zoom up to your station, dock, then undock the tug if required. Job done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother alternative if you\u0027re planning on sending kerbals up to the station is using a lifeboat to power it. You should probably have some way of recovering the kerbals back to the surface (just in case something goes wrong). Put a few extra solar arrays and batts on the lifeboat, leave it docked to the station permanently and use it to power it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T13:53:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not adverse to modding your game, there\u0027s a great plugin called KAS, which has means of carrying and attaching things, but there may still be a bug hindering orbital attachment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou launched that in one go?

So I built a new addition complete with solar panels, batteries galore, a nuclear generator, you name it lol, plus 4 extra fuel tanks. Then, after FINALLY figuring out rendezvous and docking and literally running a clampatron into another on the docking station i realized, I think the clampatrons I put on the station are on the wrong way!!! I was unable to dock. With SOME luck I realized I had also installed a shielded docking port. So I on my new ship and new edition I changed the docking ports and away I went. After many more frustrating attempts to get on target, I finally closed in, inched my way up and BOOM. I docked. The sense of achievement when finally docking and seeing that entire station immediately light back up and its sas kick in was just awesome. Its been QUITE awhile since a game was able to inspire the way this one does. I\u0027m now thinking about bases on other planets and launching those missions from the orbiting station. I\u0027m also going to make the station 5 times larger with continuous new additions with better port systems!
