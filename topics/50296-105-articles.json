Because of my specific settings and mods (FAR thin atm, scaled up planets sizes, nerfed reaction wheels, scaled down science/rep/funds gain, reorganized tech tree, etc) the only way to advance early career is to grind through some test contracts which involve sending a rocket up to a specific elevation and letting it drop straight down. I can get a little horizontal velocity using engine gimbal vectoring, but that gets too expensive in early career and has it\u0027s own problems/limitations when doing so with fixed wings in an atmosphere. The only way to profit with these contracts is to salvage parts of the ship using parachutes. Now I can\u0027t do that because a straight vertical drop will never slow down enough to be able to deploy the chutes. So the changes to DR have upset that \u0022sweet spot\u0022 I had found in my customized KSP. Also I agree with the comment above about there needing to be some type of feedback telling when it\u0027s okay to deploy chutes. So yeah, I\u0027ll be disabling that feature. Maybe later on I\u0027ll add it back when I get flight control tech, but I\u0027m not sure I have the patience to attempt any long duration missions only to have the chute fail in the last seconds of the mission because I had not yet figured out how \u0022temperature of shockwave and density of the air\u0022 mechanics work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: Please don\u0027t take this as an attack against your mod.
