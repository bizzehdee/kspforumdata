I kinda picked it up and fiddled until I learned it. However, I feel I\u0027m lacking something. If I ever try to go to any other body that isn\u0027t the Mun or Minmus, the mission never works out. I\u0027ve watched countless videos seeing people do things that seem impossible, and yet I can\u0027t get to Duna with an overpowered rocket without cheating. Just recently I installed Space Y and some near future mods. I made a rocket to send to Duna, waited for a window, and went on my way. Things went great for the most part. Getting into orbit was easy, circularising was no problem, and the Duna encounter was a piece of cake. However, when I got there (after a 6 min. burn with 7 nuke engines), the game told me it would take a 15 minute burn to get into Duna\u0027s orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what am I doing wrong?

But just to make sure I understand you correctly: you prepared a spacecraft for a Duna transfer window, planned and executed a maneuver node at the proper time, successfully got an encounter, and travelled all the way to Duna. Then upon arriving, you discovered that the capture burn exceeds your remaining fuel, and in fact exceeds the initial transfer burn by a factor of 2.5. Right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can help us help you by providing some extra information. For example, specifying burn magnitude via the time your engines are lit isn\u0027t very useful. It depends 100% on the specific construction of your spacecraft. Instead, could you give us the delta-V figures? That\u0027s the number (in m/s) you see when you make a maneuver node. Delta-V (a shorthand for \u0022change in velocity\u0022) is the universal term to describe the reach of a rocket, and how much effort is required to go places in space.

Like you\u0027d have in a car, where you know the distance between two places and decide whether you can do it on your current fuel level or not. But in space, distance as such doesn\u0027t work, because distances constantly keep changing. All things in space are always moving; it is physically impossible to not move in space. So instead, people came up with the idea that if you change your current speed and direction (AKA velocity) so that you have the same direction and the same speed as the target object, you are essentially \u0022already there\u0022 - provided you performed this maneuver at the right time and at the right point in space. And voila: change in velocity is now the only performance characteristic you need to know of a spacecraft to figure out if it can go somewhere. The \u0022when\u0022 and \u0022where\u0022 is independent of that, and can be determined separately (see: transfer window).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe calculation is done via the Rocket Equation: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E = 9.80665 * Isp * ln(mass fraction), where the mass fraction in turn is the wet mass of a rocket stage divided by the dry mass of the same rocket stage. If you look closely, you\u0027ll notice that this complicated looking formula is in fact just a constant multiplied by a quasi-constant multiplied by something your calculator gives you.

As others have already said, you\u0027re missing one crucial step, and that is the act of lowering your flyby periapsis with a correction burn en-route. Because you\u0027re capturing at the edge of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, you\u0027re required to propulsively cancel out a majority of your speed around the Sun, only to let Duna\u0027s gravity accelerate you again as you fall towards it. Instead, you want to burn deep down in Duna\u0027s gravity well, and only cancel as much travel speed as you must in order to match speed with Duna. Basically, by burning where you did, you spent fuel for several days worth of acceleration through Duna\u0027s gravity that you didn\u0027t need to pay if you burned much closer to Duna. It\u0027s a weird concept to wrap your head around, but unfortunately I\u0027m not finding the words to explain it better right now. What matters though is that a capture \u002B full circularization in low Duna orbit should generally cost only about 600 m/s; you paid over 1,500 m/s. The difference is really that drastic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree quarters of the way towards Duna, make a node, and try to lower your flyby periapsis to something like 75 km. The light blue \u0022radial in\u0022 and \u0022radial out\u0022 markers are very useful for that kind of thing - usually more useful than the green prograde/retrograde markers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that - the only thing that hasn\u0027t already been said by others is that your rocket feels way too heavy. I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re trying to land on Duna, so I can\u0027t really tell if it\u0027s appropriate or not, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever flown a Duna mission this heavy. Something that you learn as your player skill improves over time is the art of \u0022downsizing\u0022 - of making your missions just as small as they need to be. This has a massive effect, due to something called \u0022the tyranny of the rocket equation\u0022. That fancy term describes the fact that in order to lift more mass to orbit (or push it to Duna), you need more fuel, which itself has mass, so you need more fuel to lift that fuel, which itself has mass, so again you need more fuel... Long story short, rocket size grows exponentially with payload mass. So downsizing is good practice no matter where you intend to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-28T07:38:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2017 07:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-28T07:38:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223000111\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490686398\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt showed that in order to have the smallest possible deviation from the target orbit (defined by the maneuver node), the best method is to point directly at the node as opposed to pointing prograde.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis assumes that the maneuver node was created perfectly.
