Eve\u0027s atmosphere is so thick that it makes more sense to use it as a source of lift, rather than avoiding it using a suborbital hop. The best way to do that probably involves feathering the throttle, although the only real way to find out is by experimentation. If I had to hazard a guess, though, I would say using a low throttle and aerodynamic lift is probably more efficient than muscling your way through the atmosphere using a high throttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as optimal max speed goes, I\u0027d say capping it out around ~Mach 5 is probably for the best. That\u0027s the place in the supersonic regime where drag is the worst. What you should definitely not do is hang out in the range from Mach 0.8 to Mach 1.1, since drag is really high in that regime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor landing... whatever works for your plane. Every aircraft is different. Some can land at their stall speed, some can\u0027t even land unless the engines are running. It really depends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-28T18:00:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got a plane on Eve. A part of it can even get back home. Which means it\u0027s a little bit ridiculous that it can only make, like 30 km hops when it\u0027s actually there. It\u0027s not easy to fly there but then nothing about Eve is easy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is the soupy air plus the heavy gravity. Flown like I would fly it on Kerbin, the air grabs it, slows it to a halt, and the gravity slams it to the ground. So just to land I have to come down at a pretty steep angle, keeping my velocity around 60 m/s, then flare up at which point it\u0027ll very rapidly slow down to about 35 and touch down. To hop, I just burn upward at 45-60 degrees as far as my fuel will take me, then glide back down. No way I\u0027ll get up to 40 km or Mach anything much -- best I can do is maybe 15-20 km. And I\u0027m packing pretty serious engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI.e.: it works, it\u0027s certainly possible to make something that works better than my first attempt at an Eve plane, it\u0027s difficult, and your biome hops will likely be hops, not glorious sweeping arcs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
