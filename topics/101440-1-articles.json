I prefer RTS to TBS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my favourites would have to be Stardrive. A lot of people call it unfinished, but honestly, I think it\u0027s a brilliant game; any single match will take days to complete unless you just power through it in some ungodly fashion. It\u0027s a hybrid of RTS and TBS, with combat, movement, and some diplomacy all happening in real time while research, construction, colonisation, and economy are all turn-based, and it works very well, I think. You pick a species from 8 options (humans included), give your faction a name, flag, colour, and then go through the traits that you want. You start with a single planet, with a single station, a tiny exploration ship, and a cargo ship, and you have to build up and expand from there, forging alliances and trade networks with the other species if you\u0027ve managed to avoid war. Victory is determined in one of three ways; absorb all (remaining) species into a unified federation (once you\u0027ve started on this path, it gets exponentially easier to absorb the other species), crush them all through conflict, or an endgame scenario that I won\u0027t say much about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last play-through I made was as a race of samurai space bears (no, really) called the Kulrathi. As I recall, I destroyed two species; the Ralyeh, who are almost always xenophobic, and Humanity, because they were getting pesky. I got into federations with some other species, but then I managed to complete the endgame scenario and emerge victorious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA view of the 1\u003Csup\u003Est\u003C/sup\u003E Fleet fairly early on in the match.

The 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E and 3\u003Csup\u003Erd\u003C/sup\u003E tend to go around worlds very close to the home system so that I can have considerable firepower around my most important worlds when needed. The 4\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003Eand 5\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E tend to be smaller and more specialised. I had no 5\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E in this game, so it was the 9\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E that was comprised of a bunch of ragtag ships that didn\u0027t get assigned to fleets upon construction, so I just gathered them all up into one thing. The 4\u003Csup\u003Eth \u003C/sup\u003E was a planetary bomber fleet (or that may have been the 3\u003Csup\u003Erd\u003C/sup\u003E... hmm, can\u0027t remember).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, even earlier on I believe was this engagement:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/bkjSBEc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bkjSBEc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bkjSBEc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to clear some Remnant from a world I wanted to colonise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch later on, the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E and 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E moving to engage some hostiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/lh5Gd3r\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lh5Gd3r.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lh5Gd3r.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a part of the endgame scenario.

I can\u0027t see any problems with it, really, and it\u0027s fun and rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also played Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. I can handle AI skirmishes for the most part, but one of my friends somehow manages to find a way to get to the highest tech levels insanely quickly, so it isn\u0027t much fun playing against him when you know he\u0027s got an armada building up. Nevertheless, I do enjoy Supcom. I don;\u0027t actually have any screenshots at the moment, but I do remember an awesome moment in which I took down a T3 Seraphim naval base that had two very, very powerful battlecruisers, and I did it with a mix of destroyers, a cruiser or two, and a load of aerial support. I lost a lot of frigates, but I took them down in style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I also enjoy launching nukes and blowing stuff up that way. That\u0027s always fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only turn-based strategy that I\u0027ve played is Worms. I\u0027ve played a couple of them, including 2, Open Warfare (on the Nintendo DS), Reloaded (the best one, IMO), and Revolution (a bit sucky).
