It is 1177 AD, and I\u0027ve claimed all the British isles and have expanded into Europe. France has but two territories left, and I\u0027ve been killing off their royal family one by one. Yes that upset the pope and got me excommunicated, but alas, such is war.

(it was awfully suspicious when his transport left his full banner army with the king on leading it, I quickly reinforced the island my self)... My bro was bearly fending off constantinople from the turks (I failed to get help in time aswell)... I last remember foolishly declaring war on Lithuania (they weren\u0027t catholic) and all my half banner armies were wiped when I clicked end turn (coop doesnt allow defence due to bug)...\n\nEuropa: well many saves going, last non cheat one I did, went like this : after the Prusso-Russo wars, the american and canadian colonies allied with each-other and broke off, Canada(me) strived to expand south before the Americans expanded west... The two French reconquests of Anticosti ended in failure for france, creating the the Canadian carribean in the ashes of the Antilles..

I prefer RTS to TBS.\n\nOne of my favourites would have to be Stardrive. A lot of people call it unfinished, but honestly, I think it\u0027s a brilliant game; any single match will take days to complete unless you just power through it in some ungodly fashion. It\u0027s a hybrid of RTS and TBS, with combat, movement, and some diplomacy all happening in real time while research, construction, colonisation, and economy are all turn-based, and it works very well, I think. You pick a species from 8 options (humans included), give your faction a name, flag, colour, and then go through the traits that you want. You start with a single planet, with a single station, a tiny exploration ship, and a cargo ship, and you have to build up and expand from there, forging alliances and trade networks with the other species if you\u0027ve managed to avoid war. Victory is determined in one of three ways; absorb all (remaining) species into a unified federation (once you\u0027ve started on this path, it gets exponentially easier to absorb the other species), crush them all through conflict, or an endgame scenario that I won\u0027t say much about.\n\nThe last play-through I made was as a race of samurai space bears (no, really) called the Kulrathi. As I recall, I destroyed two species; the Ralyeh, who are almost always xenophobic, and Humanity, because they were getting pesky. I got into federations with some other species, but then I managed to complete the endgame scenario and emerge victorious.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A view of the 1^st^ Fleet fairly early on in the match. I\u0027d managed to get cruisers at this point, but not many of them.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![SzXPceo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SzXPceo.jpg)](http://imgur.com/SzXPceo)\n\u003E \n\u003E I always station my 1^st^ Fleet around the homeworld. The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ tend to go around worlds very close to the home system so that I can have considerable firepower around my most important worlds when needed. The 4^nd^and 5^th^ tend to be smaller and more specialised. I had no 5^th^ in this game, so it was the 9^th^ that was comprised of a bunch of ragtag ships that didn\u0027t get assigned to fleets upon construction, so I just gathered them all up into one thing. The 4^th^ was a planetary bomber fleet (or that may have been the 3^rd^... hmm, can\u0027t remember).\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, even earlier on I believe was this engagement:\n\u003E \n\u003E [![bkjSBEc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bkjSBEc.jpg)](http://imgur.com/bkjSBEc)\n\u003E \n\u003E I had to clear some Remnant from a world I wanted to colonise.\n\u003E \n\u003E Much later on, the 2^nd^ and 2^nd^ moving to engage some hostiles.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![lh5Gd3r.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lh5Gd3r.jpg)](http://imgur.com/lh5Gd3r)\n\u003E \n\u003E This is a part of the endgame scenario.

Having a galaxy-wide civilisation is good until your best fighting forces can find themselves needing to go from one end of the map to the other ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E [![jLxHXq6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jLxHXq6.jpg)](http://imgur.com/jLxHXq6)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nI recommend this game. I can\u0027t see any problems with it, really, and it\u0027s fun and rewarding.\n\nI\u0027ve also played Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. I can handle AI skirmishes for the most part, but one of my friends somehow manages to find a way to get to the highest tech levels insanely quickly, so it isn\u0027t much fun playing against him when you know he\u0027s got an armada building up. Nevertheless, I do enjoy Supcom. I don;\u0027t actually have any screenshots at the moment, but I do remember an awesome moment in which I took down a T3 Seraphim naval base that had two very, very powerful battlecruisers, and I did it with a mix of destroyers, a cruiser or two, and a load of aerial support. I lost a lot of frigates, but I took them down in style.\n\nOh, I also enjoy launching nukes and blowing stuff up that way. That\u0027s always fun ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nThe only turn-based strategy that I\u0027ve played is Worms. I\u0027ve played a couple of them, including 2, Open Warfare (on the Nintendo DS), Reloaded (the best one, IMO), and Revolution (a bit sucky). Always fun, though the AI seems to be either really dumb or insanely accurate.\n\n...\n\nI think I may go and play Stardrive again."}]}
