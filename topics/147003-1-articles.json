That\u0027s why you copy before posting. So now I\u0027ll just keep this short:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just downloaded KSP, tried to play, and the only thing that works are the flight tutorials in training. Not construction tutorials, just ones where you are flying. Everything else and the game becomes unresponsive. It loads for a few seconds before stopping on the load screen and then does nothing. I have to force quit after that. I don\u0027t know why this is happening. I have all the graphics on their default\u00A0settings, so my computer shouldn\u0027t have a hard time handling it.\u00A0Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComputer specs: 15\u0022 MacBook Pro (Mid-2012)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProcessor: 2.3GHz Intel Core i7\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMemory: 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-03T03:13:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2016 03:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MICROkerbin6\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-07T12:42:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168338-microkerbin6/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022168338\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168338-microkerbin6/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@MICROkerbin6\u003C/a\u003E, please take a look here and upload your Player.log and KSP.log somewhere for us, thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-please-read-before-posting-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MICROkerbin6","CreatedById":168338,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-27T21:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry I didn\u0027t stay up to date on this post.\u00A0The\u00A0issue was fixed with a reinstall of the game.
