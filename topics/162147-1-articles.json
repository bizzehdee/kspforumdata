KSP is mostly run by a CPU and good ram. It stores the data on your RAM so it can load quicker. Next is that KSP only uses a single core of your CPU for the calculations of the physics. As many games, this game is not optimized for multicores, because that\u0027s very difficult. (whole other story). So if you have a I7 processor with 8 cores, it better for things like rendering ans photoshop. The GPU is in the stockgame not so much used at all, only when you instal heavy graphic mods, but even then, a simple GTX 860 can run them easily.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP calculates all the physics for every part in KSP, thats why it gets slow when the partcount rises. You can try a mod to weld parts together en reduce the partcount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheRagingIrishman","CreatedById":165004,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-16T17:17:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYa like Dr. Licor said, this is due to the fact that KSP is mostly limited to 1 core. You have an 8 core so overall your cpu usage isn\u0027t super high but the main core that KSP is running on is definitely struggling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-16T17:27:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs other said above, KSP depends a lot on single thread performance, especially clock speed.

Lag, stutter and FPS dips are just facts of Kerbal life. I think we need to give up any hopes that it will ever be fixed. Use fewer parts, mods and fewer ships. Try SSTU.
