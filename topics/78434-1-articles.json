For the S1 SRB, under Heavy Rocketry, this is \\|8000.

I think for now it\u0027s just a placeholder for something which they will add in future. I would have 2 suggestions of how they could implement it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. After unlocking a science node with science points, you actually need to invest (development) money for each part to make them available in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Instead of using science points to get the whole science node, you can instead spend money on single parts to unlock them if you haven\u0027t got enough science or are unable to get more science for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current shown prices would be placeholders obviously and would change later.

Just a possibility. The other, more likely possibility is that that was implemented as a placeholder for the \u0022science/funds/reputation exchange\u0022 system, as morph113 more or less suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jodo42","CreatedById":68895,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T16:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I\u0027m aware, it\u0027s the money you need to pay upfront to unlock the part for use after you\u0027ve researched its node.
