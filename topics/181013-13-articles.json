Looking over the contract pack I created a spreadsheet showing every reward for every scenario outlined in the contract configs so that I could visualize any patterns of how you chose the values\u00A0and I now just need to figure out appropriate values for the JNSQ bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is what method did you use for coming up with the original reward values and failure penalties? I\u0027d like to perhaps use a similar method in order to provide some consistency to your existing values. Some of the numbers seem slightly odd like Dres which is the only body to have values not rounded to the nearest 1000 (for example Dres failures funds (crewed) is 250507) Also I\u0027ve noticed that most of Jools moons (except for Laythe) have random variables applied to them, while no other bodies have this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the spreadsheet I mentioned, ignore the JNSQ tab as it\u0027s not final. I started filling out sort of randomly chosen values for the new bodies and then stopped half way through to ask in this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YURPYLSa7qPejoFQG0xR3CjsnX75nf0L2GhxVrMOXsI/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YURPYLSa7qPejoFQG0xR3CjsnX75nf0L2GhxVrMOXsI/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Actually I suppose since JNSQ is 2.7x scale, that the original values may actually be too low for the upscaled bodies and may make it too difficult to progress as it will take more fuel and larger rockets to get places.. I\u0027m still interested in your response to the above but I may have to consider a complete rebalance just aimed at JNSQ specifically. Then again I also play with Monthly Budget so funds don\u0027t really affect me in the way they do a typical player so I\u0027ll have to do some testing perhaps on a \u0022stock\u0022 JNSQ install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Okay so.. I\u0027ve ended up just deciding to do an entire rebalance .. If you can call it that. Basically I just wrote some formulas that look at how far away a celestial body is, in which direction it is (inward or outward) in the system, as well as whether it\u0027s a moon or not and then it does some math and spits out a bunch of values for rep rewards / penalties, fund rewards / penalties, and science reward / penalties. So yeah not sure if you\u0027d call that a rebalance since no actual testing has been done on if the rewards and stuff seem \u0022balanced\u0022 or not, that\u0027ll take some testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I will note though for layers 1 and 2 of the missions I\u0027ve left those hand written, it\u0027s just layers 3 and 4 that the above applies to.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also only done this on the spreadsheet mentioned above under the JNSQ tab. I\u0027ve yet to have the time to actually convert all those values into actual config files. I\u0027ll probably do that next time I have an evening to spare (no guarantees on when exactly that will be, hopefully sooner than later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce I\u0027ve done that however I may throw together a post in the addon development forum so that I could perhaps find some volunteers willing to assist with testing the balance, since the current version was created via math I\u0027m sure there will be some tweaking necessary. After some (hopefully) extensive testing I may contact the JNSQ guys and see if they\u0027d be interested in having it come with JNSQ as an (optional?) patch at some point in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s funny though I\u0027ve been back at KSP for over 3 months after a very long hiatus and have yet to actually play a proper game ... Just modding modding modding.\u00A0And when I did try to actually play a game I got the kOS mod and then spent an entire month programming lol! I swear I tend to do this with any game I play..
