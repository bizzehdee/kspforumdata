Is good to add that this is a really reputated game, because it might be dificult for some people who dont have experience with previous flight simulator games and you really need to be good to have really stupid thing that might seem easy in other games, I hope this game grows up so it can be more amazing of what is now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am quite fan of Kerbal Space Program \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T21:15:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatKerbal","CreatedById":98809,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T21:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome To the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rowsdower","CreatedById":91811,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T21:45:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xetalim","CreatedById":64539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T14:32:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like nobody has to tell you how to do something:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alicelewis","CreatedById":98859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T10:12:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m new in this forum.
