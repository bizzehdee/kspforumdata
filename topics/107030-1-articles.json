Note, \u0022lifting body\u0022 parts with lifting modules assigned need useInternalDragModel=False in the module, and dragModelType = default. However, with body lift included in KSP 1.0, giving non-wing parts a lifting module is not the best idea.\n- The lifting modules have changed significantly. Make sure you check out a stock cfg.\n- Intakes either need to have the insides slope inward, or a custom drag cube assigned, so you don\u0027t get a lot of flat plate drag (i.e. making a flat black inner \u0027cap\u0027 is seen as a flat plate, whereas clearly visually the intake is supposed to be hollow and keep going back...to get around this problem, you customize the dragcube values).\n- Hollow parts like decouplers or cargo bays need custom drag cubes.\n- Bulkhead profiles need to be added; they are the basic attach size profiles (size1, 2, mk2, etc) or srf.\n- Engine type needs to be added for the engine for the camera shake to work right (a bunch are supported in code, but really only liquid, solid, and nuclear are used in cfg IIRC, maybe jets too).\n- The old drag values (maximum and minimum drag, intake drag numbers, parachute drag numbers) do absolutely nothing.\n- Parachutes need dragmodifier modules applied (check the stock cfgs). These multiply the visual size of the canopy (at that state) to get a final drag amount, since drag is now based on visual size, not magic numbers (but they didn\u0027t make the chute canopies real sized, so they need insanely high modifiers).\n- Engine Isps on average are 85% what they were, and engines have more clearly defined types (lifter, sustainer, vacuum engine). Isp curves also continue down to near-0 Isp.\n- Jets are totally different.\n- Engine gimbals have been increased significantly\n- Engine costs are relatively sane now, and entry costs are tied relatively directly to them.\n- Isps and TWRs have changed slightly to make later-tech engines strictly better, albeit not insanely so, than earlier ones.\n- The dry mass of solid rockets is higher than it used to be.\n- Multipart (i.e. not fully enclosed) fairings do not work right now. They would need a plugin to work.\n- The only drag occlusion is stack occlusion. Take a boost protective cover as an example. If the boost cover is mounted \\*directly\\* atop the pod, it will occlude the pod\u0027s drag; if you mount a docking port first, then the cover, you\u0027ll get essentially doubled drag (near full cross-sectional area from the pod since only the top bit is occluded by the docking port, then the same for the cover.)\n\nThat\u0027s all I can think of for now.\n\nSee the forthcoming thread on how to deal with jets; they are **very** different.\n\n**A Plea:**\n\nPlease add anything else you can think of that\u0027s relevant to this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T02:16:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 02:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NathanKell**"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T07:37:51Z","Content":"Thank you very much for consolidating the part changes.\n\nI would only add a link to the [**Temeprature guide for parts in 1.0**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117930-Guide-New-temperature-rules-for-parts-in-1-0-%281-0-2-updates%29) just in case.\n\nAnd maybe there are other guides out there for isp curves, heatshields, drag profiles etc.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T07:40:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 07:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T09:52:43Z","Content":"calculating lift and mass for wings and control surfaces:\n\ndeflectionLiftCoeff = Surface area in m^2 \\* 1/3.52 (3.52 is the magical jebediah coefficient)\n\nmass = deflectionLiftCoeff \\* (1 \u002B ctrlSurfaceArea) \\* 0.1t (ctrlSurfaceArea increases weight, e.g. all-moving ctrSrf are 2x as heavy)\n\nctrlSurfaceArea = proportion of the wing area that is control surface\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAttach nodes will only attach in one specified direction, the last three parameters are XYZ vector:\n\nexample:\n\nnode\\_stack\\_top = 0.0, 0.9375, 0.0, **0.0, 1.0, 0.0** (= Y up)\n\nnode\\_stack\\_bottom = 0.0, -0.9375, 0.0, **0.0, -1.0, 0.0** (= Y down)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T20:04:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Porkjet**\n  \nCpt.
