The key is that the end of the beam opposite the docking port is attached to a part that swings the beam in an arc. That is the functionality that I am looking to implement.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nSNAFU"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T13:00:47Z","Content":"Your looking for Infernal Robotics."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T22:03:01Z","Content":"No stock parts do this, so your question has been moved to the modding section."}]}
