Being an Orbiter vet of several decades standing, I already knew how to fly rockets so I just needed to learn how to build them in KSP. A quick trip to Minmus following a Scott Manley tutorial video made me think I knew all about it, so my 1st Mun lander was very complex, a transformable lander/rover thingy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/eNtf7U\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://flic.kr/p/eNtf7U\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/eNtf5y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://flic.kr/p/eNtf5y\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a marvel of engineering with each langing leg on a separate action group (and other action groups to work them in various pairs) so I could tip the thing over and stand it up again (on Kerbin) no matter how it fell over. It could even drive along perfectly well upside down. So I was very happy with it and sent it off to Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/eNteXq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://flic.kr/p/eNteXq\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut despite having all these features, there was still a lot about KSP I didn\u0027t know. Such as, I hadn\u0027t considered how the forces exerted by the moving landing legs would toss the lander high into the sky on Mun compared to Kerbin, so all the functionality was very difficult to use. Still, the thing was liberally covered in struts so it still worked, although it had tense moments and broke a solar panel bouncing around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, in those ancient days, Mun didn\u0027t have procedural terrain. It was pretty much just a sphere composed of flat facets with little craters and rocks drawn on with low-res textures. So, a very boring place, but actually quite good rover country. You could go screaming along for miles and miles without fear of jumping off a or falling into a crater, just every once in a while you came to the edge of a facet where the angle of the terrain changed slightly to that of the next facet. But that happened at the horizon so you could see it coming miles in advance even in the dark and slow down to cross such ridges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, I covered a significant distance with no problem. However, eventually I got totally bored with the unchanging vista of flat terrain, sharp horizons in the distance, and the same low-res ground texture repeating ever few hundred yards and decided to go home. This is when I discovered that I didn\u0027t have enough dV. See, this mechanical marvel of a lander was essentially just my Minmus lander with wheels on it. This was before I\u0027d discovered MJ and KER so had no idea how much dV it had or what was needed (and was cursing this because such basic information is readily available without mods in Orbiter), but I figured Mun couldn\u0027t have much more gravity than Minmus. I\u0027d been quite concerned with my fuel consumption during the landing, however, and knew I didn\u0027t have much left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, it was JUST BARELY enough to get to orbit and I thought, no problem, I\u0027ll just do my 1st KSP rescue mission. Due to difficulties in getting the lander back upright in low gravity, I had no real control over orientation. Thus, the orbit was rather egg-shaped, inclined about 30^, and retrograde. That complicated the rendezvous but no problem for an old Orbiter vet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. So I decided to get fancy and use the newly discovered KAS to refuel the lander so I could bring it back. Unfortunately, due to glitches with that, refueling proved impossible so I had to use Plan B, which was to just bring Jeb home in the empty seat of the 3-seat pod, leaving the rover in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T14:25:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first was all SRBs becuse I didn\u0027t know how to use liquid fuel.(didn\u0027t read the controls..?)
