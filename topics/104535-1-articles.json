You may remove the Legacy parts (located in GameData/MagicSmokeIndustries/Parts) if you are installing IR for use with another mod and only need it for the plugin.\n\nChangelog:\n\n    2.0.2\n    [LIST]\n    [*] Fix for unnecessary EC consumption for uncontrolled parts.\n    [/LIST]\n    \n    0.21.4\n    [LIST]\n    [*] Recompile for 1.0.5\n    [/LIST]\n    \n    0.21.3\n    [LIST]\n    [*] Recompile for 1.0.4\n    [*] Fixes for tweakscale interaction for transalting IR parts\n    [*] Better handling of symmetry for presets and other settings.\n    [*] FAR compatibility: FAR is notified when the IR parts have changed their position so it can recalculate voxel model accordingly.\n    [*] Better input handling for all textfields, makes typing in desired values much easier.\n    [*] Proper handling of New button in editor.\n    [*] Fixes for KIS/KAS attached IR parts to function properly.\n    [*] Minor changes to API implementation of UID field.\n    [/LIST]\n    \n    0.21.2\n    [LIST]\n    [*] Made our AppLauncher icon follow the same behaviour as when blizzy\u0027s toolbar installed and only show when there are robotic parts on the craft in flight. Editor button is still always visible.\n    [*] Fixed .version file\n    [*] Updated KSPAPIExtensions.dll dependency\n    [*] Converted Legacy parts textures to DDS\n    [*] Rearranged Legacy parts position in tech tree.\n    [*] Added support for CTT for Legacy parts.\n    [/LIST]\n    \n    0.21.1\n    [LIST]\n    [*] Fixed a bug with the stock toolbar\n    [/LIST]\n    \n    0.21.0\n    [LIST]\n    [*] Recompiled for KSP 1.0\n    [*] Updated stock toolbar support\n    [*] Updated custom parts filter. Now with custom icon!\n    [/LIST]\n    \n    0.20.0\n    [LIST]\n    [*]BREAKING: Field \u0022Coarse Speed\u0022 has been renamed in the UI to just \u0022Speed\u0022. Will affect all KOS scripts that read or change that field. Field name in part.cfg has not changed, so all existing crafts should load successfully.\n    [*]BREAKING: Some Events and Actions has been renamed in the UI, check your IR related kOS scripts.\n    [*]BREAKING: Part config fields \u0022maxRange\u0022 and \u0022minRange\u0022 are now obsolete. There are no reworked or legacy parts that use those two fields.\n    [*]NEW: All controllable servos now have Acceleration parameter. As the name suggest it is the rate at which servos speed up or slow down. Default value for legacy parts is 4x.\n    [*]Acceleration and Speed are only applied in-flight, in editor parts move at their default speed.\n    Tip: Lower acceleration allows for smoother movements leading to less wobble, but at the cost of lower speed.\n    [*]NEW: You can create preset positions for all controllable servos and switch between them in flight and in editor.\n    [*]Presets are automatically sorted from lowest to highest\n    [*]In editor you can switch between presets either on main Servo Configurator GUI or via Preset Editor\n    [*]In flight you can move servo from current position to next or previous preset position via main Servo Controller GUI or using ActionGroups\n    [*]You can move servo to arbitrary preset position via Preset Editor window both in flight and in editor.\n    [*]For examples on using presets refer to the video overview linked below.\n    [*]NEW: Integration into other mods through API\n    [*]GUI Redesign\n    [*]Redesigned Editor UI to fit most of the relevant fields and actions in one window.\n    [*]You can now move individual servos and change their main parameters from single IR window without the need to right-click every servo.\n    [*]Redesigned in-flight controls to accommodate all new changes and for better readability.\n    [*]All IR in-flight windows now obey F2 command (hide/show UI) and should not get in the way of your awesome screenshots.\n    [*]Custom category in editor listing all robotic parts.\n    [*]Editor and Flight window width is scaled dynamically.\n    [*]Editor window now has an option to revert servo to default position (usually 0).\n    [*]You can move servos to precise positions in editor by creating presets and snapping servos to them.\n    [*]Position and ranges for inverted axis parts are now shown in different style.\n    [*]All buttons now have basic tooltips.\n    [*]Whole set of new icons for a polished looks.\n    [*]TweakScale configs on Legacy parts have been fixed to work with the latest version of TweakScale.\n    [*]Servo sound\u0027s pitch now scales with servo\u0027s movement speed\n    [/LIST]\n\n**Recommended Downloads**\n\n[**TweakScale**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112693)\n\n- Lets you increase and decrease the size of all robotics parts, without having to resort to multiple scaled copies cluttering up your part list\n\n[**Model Rework \u0026 Expansion**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65365)\n\n- A large collection of robotics and structural parts that really take advantage of what can be done with Infernal Robotics (these will eventually replace the current parts bundled with IR)\n\n**Source Code**\n\nAvailable on Github:\n\n[https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/InfernalRobotics](https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/InfernalRobotics)\n\nMy free time is quite sparse these days but I make the best of what I can do to keep this plugin going.

Trusses and wheels can also be scaled at these fine increments, though I didn\u0027t allow for wheels to become huge since I just don\u0027t know if they behave correctly when enormous. You can easily change this if you want.\n3. The mass of robotic parts except at the smallest scale is increased somewhat (most Rework parts originally: 0.1t, my changes: 0.3t); this gives them slightly stronger joints. Smallest-scale parts now weigh ~ 0.02 instead of 0.025ish.\n4. Much simplified TweakScale stuff - fewer SCALETYPES to edit if you want to fiddle with scaleFactors or what have you.\n5. Hides the three pointless (I think? I just couldn\u0027t figure these out) half-size Athlete trusses.\n\nDownsides:\n\n1. Biggest downside: when placing parts, they start out huge and you\u0027ll have to scale them down for normal-sized ships. This is currently unavoidable if you want parts more than 1.5X (or so) the size of the originals.\n2. Telescopic pistons didn\u0027t get upscaled - they don\u0027t cooperate and I don\u0027t know why. Maybe someone else can figure this out. You can still make trusses match their size (or pretty close) since they\u0027re made to freescale.\n3. Heavier robotic parts could be a downside too.\n4. The original SCALETYPES for reworked parts had a cool system of matching names of scales to absolute sizes of parts - this is somewhat broken with my system, but only for half-size bits like RoboTruss Lite and RoboTube parts, wheels too, I think, and maybe some others. I.e. a RoboTruss Lite part at \u00222x\u0022 scale will no longer exactly match every other part scaled to \u00222x\u0022. I think the bonuses outweigh this.\n5. No Legacy part support. They break like the telescopic pistons. Also don\u0027t know why.\n6. Didn\u0027t mess with electric charge required, so that will be way off - maybe in another version.\n\nWith some fiddling, this same thing could be done to allow 8x or 150x (or whatever) size robotic parts too, though they would be really annoying to place in the editor.\n\nFYI: **I\u0027m totally guessing on reasonable masses for the scaled-up robotic parts, so tweaking is probably needed; maybe some stuff is totally broken.** Feedback welcome!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T01:21:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 01:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AccidentalDisassembly**"},{"CreatedByName":"vardicd","CreatedById":75832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T12:57:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Actually, what version of AGX are you using? I just found out that the 1.31-series has a memory leak that the current version (1.31h) seems to have fixed (though there is another bug that surfaced... Not a performance bug, but a functional bug for career mode. Diazo is working on it though.) If you\u0027re using version G or earlier of AGX 1.31, update it to H. I had MASSIVE stuttering problems at times. I too thought it was IR related since I had noticeable problems when I tried out IR once again. Unfortunately, I grabbed the new IR pre-releases at the same as I had updated several plugins, AGX included. AGX doesn\u0027t have KSP-AVC support it seems and I don\u0027t CKAN, so AGX updates can fly completely under the radar of users.\n\u003E See if updating AGX helps.\n\nIf that was for me, I\u0027m still using version 1.25D ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif) Way outta date on that one."},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T16:12:19Z","Content":"Great work guys, I love the fact that when assigning parts to an action group you no longer need to toggle a direction on and then off again. That caused a lot of issues with some of my torture devi.... I mean machines. Also I\u0027m having some issues getting the rotor to lock. It will turn past its adjusted preset minimum and maximum every time. Also the 180 degree Pivitron I believe it was, would not accept a new \u0022center\u0022 position it would default to its original preset regardless of what I enter and save. I wound up using the old deprecated Pivitron with a default center position of 90 degrees and that worked like a charm.
