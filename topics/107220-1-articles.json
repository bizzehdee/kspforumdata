If you goto that and find the Vessel class, you can see all the properties. In this case Vessel.orb_velocity or Vessel.srf_velocity are probably what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat needs testing to determine if either of those is the velocity you are looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other place to look is at the source code of another mod. Find a likely mod that does something similar and see where it ties into the KSP API to get the data it needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that, it is trial and error, there is very little documentation to help us out unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
