KSP SDK have very low documentation. this.vessel.\u003C?????\u003E ???????????? how get strain vessel ? no change speed G = 0 from vessel, change speed is high then strain is high. or example how get surface speed ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T18:17:06Z","Content":"The first place to look for objects is the Object Browser in your IDE. If you goto that and find the Vessel class, you can see all the properties. In this case Vessel.orb\\_velocity or Vessel.srf\\_velocity are probably what you want.\n\nThat needs testing to determine if either of those is the velocity you are looking for.\n\nThe other place to look is at the source code of another mod. Find a likely mod that does something similar and see where it ties into the KSP API to get the data it needs.\n\nBeyond that, it is trial and error, there is very little documentation to help us out unfortunately.\n\nHope that helps,\n\nD."}]}
