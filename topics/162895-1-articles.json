This doesn\u0027t mean that if 12 people do the MiG-9 then there will be 12 MiG-9\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mods we are using here are; BDA\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAviatorArsenal\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is to go for the minimalistic approach were we can show some amazing stock planes.
