Wish I would\u0027ve found this forum a year ago, though. Would\u0027ve saved me a lot of frustration. But I learned a lot through trial and error, so maybe it\u0027s a good thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond the obvious, I\u0027ve learned the most important things in the game are proper launches and good orbital maneuvers. I finally feel like I\u0027ve gotten them down pretty well. However, through an embarrassing amount of hours (about 1,600 thus far) I\u0027ve found the Nerv useful exactly once. I had a contract to deliver a class E asteroid to Bop. Using the asteroid\u0027s own fuel to get me there seemed the obvious answer. The problem was, with Mammoths to catch and pull the rock, I was using up all its ore before I reached Bop. I redesigned the ship with 16 Nervs instead. Obviously, the ore went a lot further just converting to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E instead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E/o. For that particular mission, it worked really well (I still cheated, though: threw on some Vectors for power: those 30 minute burns are brutal).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, I haven\u0027t used them at all. Every screenshot and video I see shows that pretty much everyone else is using them for interplanetary burns. I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027m missing. A Nerv seems to me to be a rocket with the same power as a Terrier. Sure it has 2 1/2 times the fuel efficiency, but 6 times the mass at 25 times the price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI prefer large ships with multiple crew members and single launches, so I use Terriers for the return stage, but not often for the transfer because of their power shortage. I know the Nerv\u0027s mass is offset by dropping the oxidizer, but I still don\u0027t see the trade-off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what am I missing? Do you leave the transfer stage in orbit and refuel it? Seems like it would add even more time than the burns do. Plus, I think it would present problems with time-stamping (I always play career) if you re-docked new ships to it. Staging them seems like a waste of money. Terriers are cheap. I just dump \u0027em, and who cares?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow. Just saw how long this post is. Apologies. If you guys could tell me what you\u0027re doing (and how much better it is), I\u0027d appreciate it.

Wish I would\u0027ve found this forum a year ago, though. Would\u0027ve saved me a lot of frustration. But I learned a lot through trial and error, so maybe it\u0027s a good thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond the obvious, I\u0027ve learned the most important things in the game are proper launches and good orbital maneuvers. I finally feel like I\u0027ve gotten them down pretty well. However, through an embarrassing amount of hours (about 1,600 thus far) I\u0027ve found the Nerv useful exactly once. I had a contract to deliver a class E asteroid to Bop. Using the asteroid\u0027s own fuel to get me there seemed the obvious answer. The problem was, with Mammoths to catch and pull the rock, I was using up all its ore before I reached Bop. I redesigned the ship with 16 Nervs instead. Obviously, the ore went a lot further just converting to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E instead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E/o. For that particular mission, it worked really well (I still cheated, though: threw on some Vectors for power: those 30 minute burns are brutal).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, I haven\u0027t used them at all. Every screenshot and video I see shows that pretty much everyone else is using them for interplanetary burns. I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027m missing. A Nerv seems to me to be a rocket with the same power as a Terrier. Sure it has 2 1/2 times the fuel efficiency, but 6 times the mass at 25 times the price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI prefer large ships with multiple crew members and single launches, so I use Terriers for the return stage, but not often for the transfer because of their power shortage. I know the Nerv\u0027s mass is offset by dropping the oxidizer, but I still don\u0027t see the trade-off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what am I missing? Do you leave the transfer stage in orbit and refuel it? Seems like it would add even more time than the burns do. Plus, I think it would present problems with time-stamping (I always play career) if you re-docked new ships to it. Staging them seems like a waste of money. Terriers are cheap. I just dump \u0027em, and who cares?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow. Just saw how long this post is. Apologies.
