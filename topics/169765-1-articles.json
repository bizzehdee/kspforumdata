Are you sure you\u0027re running the 64 bit version of the game? There should be two different executable files in the root folder, \u0022KSP.exe\u0022 and \u0022KSP_x64.exe\u0022. You want to use the second one. . .the first is only for people who are still using 32 bit operating systems. If you\u0027re launching the game with \u0022KSP.exe\u0022, it\u0027s going to limit your memory usage just like you say.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-19T03:47:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if you are launching through Steam and the launcher, make sure it\u0027s set to launch the 64-bit version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that back when 64-bit KSP first came out it was super unstable and basically shunned by modders, but it\u0027s gotten a lot more stable since then and almost all mods work fine with 64-bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-19T08:07:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs said above, running KSP the 64bit version will \u003Cs\u003Efix\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0allow this, which is quite natural. 32bit won\u0027t allow more than 2gb, but I haven\u0027t touched the 32bit version in years.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt\u00A0the moment I have a 1.2.2 install with all the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-0 package and some personal favorites, around 80-90 mods, 44k of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E-patches, still running like a charm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-19T14:00:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223271692\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169765\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516312563\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022131364\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lonewolfviii\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Lonewolfviii said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhy hasn\u0027t someone written programing for the game to use system cache for mods and use ram for game . it would allow for 50 mods . and stop the crashing of the game .

He thinks that he can somehow \u0022force\u0022 KSP to use more of his RAM, and that would somehow improve the game\u0027s performance. He\u0027s using 64 bit, he just doesn\u0027t understand how RAM works and apparently isn\u0027t willing to learn. He also said that I \u0022wouldn\u0027t believe what he could do with files\u0022 and that he \u0022didn\u0027t need to understand how RAM works, cause he understands how files work\u0022 So honestly, I\u0027m surprised to see him asking for someone else to \u0022write the programming\u0022 when he seemed so sure that he would have no problems doing it himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat or he\u0027s \u0022just trolling\u0022 again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-19T14:06:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154640-rocket-in-my-pocket/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154640\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154640-rocket-in-my-pocket/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Rocket In My Pocket\u003C/a\u003E thanks for enlightening us.
