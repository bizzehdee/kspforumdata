You can use time warp while rotating to skip time when craft rotates. I am usually not choose certain time to begin rotation because I start it immediately after I created manevour and never rotate 5 seconds before manevour because you can be certainly late to perform it. I\u0027m not sure before EA beginning but I think, that rotation works with more time warp modes than they were in the first game\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
