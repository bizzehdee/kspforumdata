I get that the update might never come because of development on KSP 2 but I feel like a lot of us on console just want an answer to if the update will come and when.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal Space Noob","CreatedById":228223,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-30T17:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel you.

What makes that unacceptable is the fact that there has been zero communication whtasoever! Have you ever seen a large game company like T2/PD just go past an announced release date with zero communication? it\u0027s super unprofessional, theres litterally no reason not to just announce a delay. I reccomend we all contact Private Division customer support. I already have, and they\u0027re refusing to give any information whatsoever. But, if a good handful of us all start asking, they might realize that their community has been abandoned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
