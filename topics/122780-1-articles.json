Adding mass to the bottom of the rocket will likely not help. Adding fins to the bottom more than likely will, and the old \u0022straight up to 10KM and do a dog-leg to the right\u0022 approach will probably not work for a large number of rocket designs. The aero rework rewards attempts at a more realistic gradual gravity turn now. In fact, gravity turns - where you allow gravity to gradually pull the nose over - are now actually possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts now deliver vastly less science. You\u0027re expected to get your science more from performing experiments. You\u0027ll also not be able to create manoeuvre nodes (or see SOI changes for intercepts) until you have updated your tracking station and Mission Control building to allow for flight planning and for patched conics to be shown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHTH\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Oh yes, and the science lab, plus two scientists on board, now features a science-over-time mechanism that can provide you with vast amounts of science, so long as you can get some experiments processed in there to get some data to turn into that juicy, juicy science.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-11T11:09:29Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2015 11:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by technicalfool\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaver","CreatedById":46640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T11:44:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry tailfins to enhace the stability of your rocket in the atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T11:49:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all: The new aero still isn\u0027t as good as FAR, but reading a FAR guide will help you a lot getting craft to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort version is that the worst thing one can do is to attempt to rapidly turn a craft during flight, as the craft will likely get uncontrollable if the angle of attack gets too high. Instead make gentle turns, always staying close to (surface) prograde. How far you can get your heading away from prograde depends on craft design, but rule of thumb is to keep it within the circle marker on the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore instead of turning to 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 10 km, you now should do a gravity turn, meaning that you\u0027ll want to start to turn right after launch (how far depends on the TWR of your first stage). For a well made rocket design, it\u0027s enough to slightly turn east right after launch, and then not touching the controls at all (except for staging obviously).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding weight to the bottom of the rocket will make it more unstable, actually.
