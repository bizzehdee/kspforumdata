in-game simulator feature has been requested many times already (including by me) to help with ship design and mission planning.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhilst I think such a feature could be helpful if done sensibly, I had a re-think on what approach would be best for the game and how it could best be implemented, so...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I see it there are two main areas that need to be covered, Design Evaluation and Test Flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTest Flights are exactly that, a real launch designed to check out and test some aspects of the planned mission or design. \u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EAs such they will very often only carry the bits needed to complete the test.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EA good example is the early Apollo missions, they were very much not \u0027Moon landing attempts\u0027 but they were vital to test and evaluate different aspects that were needed for the eventual success of Apollo 11.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThey were all \u0027Test Flights\u0027 but they were still very real flights with very real financial cost and very real risk.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAnd I think it\u0027s this aspect that the \u0027Trial and Error\u0027 approach replicates quite well,\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003Eno matter how good a simulator is there is still no substitute for trying it out for real.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDesign Evaluation is where I think a \u0027simulator\u0027 feature should fit, and it\u0027s probably a better name too.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIRL we design probes for Mars, we calculate what we think they will behave like based on what knowledge and experience we have, but we don\u0027t \u0027know\u0027 if it will actually work until it gets there and either succeeds or fails.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis is the role I see for a Simulator/Design Evaluation feature, it should not replace Test Flights or the need for them, or guarantee success, but should help players to ensure that the basic design has a fair chance of doing the job it was designed for before committing to an expensive and risky test flight.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EEffectively an in game equivalent to getting the boffins to re-check all the maths, running computer simulations and ensuring that the ship is balanced and the staging plan works as intended etc.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EYes it would need sensible design aids like Dv, TWR, CoM and CoL readouts by stage during initial construction, but also just a simple facility to run a dummy launch sequence, or selected portion of the flight \u0027in the lab\u0027, to check that the ship itself \u0027works\u0027, so that when it\u0027s launched either as a test flight or full mission the risk of failure due to design oversight is reduced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course there are always the \u0027Revert\u0027 and \u0027Sandbox/Hyperedit\u0027 options for those that wish to use them, but for a \u0027No Revert Career\u0027 game this type of feature could fit in nicely and be less \u0027overpowered\u0027 and a bit more realistic than a \u0027fully accurate practice run\u0027 simulator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts,

a\u00A0better, more comprehensive, set of design and evaluation aids that can\u00A0give us the chance to design a bit more effectively. \u00A0The usual suspects being Dv and TWR info etc\u00A0of course, but also simple ways of checking that stuff works as we want,\u00A0like action groups working in the VAB/SPH, a\u00A0\u0027wind Tunnel\u0027 setting that shows\u00A0lift/drag\u00A0arrows that can be tweaked to show the effect of different atmospheres and altitudes etc. and perhaps a \u0027zero G simulator\u0027 setting that allows us to\u00A0check thrust balance etc and see directly how stuff is affected,\u00A0without needing to do an \u0027actual\u0027 launch and hack gravity. \u00A0The kinds of tools that would be available to help RL designers either as computer simulations or

it should look very basic and uninteresting as not to take away they enjoyment of visiting a planet \u00A0for the first time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think, as you mentioned simulators are limited, that any simulator should be dependant on researching a planet just like

with, and over time (based on duration of study, \u00A0number of sensors,and technology of sensors, and proximity of sensors) you developed more info and better simulators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example ground based telescopes \u00A0could let you guess the orbit size, but you need more advanced methods of discovering \u00A0mass, terrain, atmosphere, temperature, \u00A0etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while early game you just know Duna\u00A0is there, you have no way to simulate it to any degree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo say you build a satellite in kerb in orbit, now you see its rocky, \u00A0not a gas giant, it\u0027s a certain size, \u00A0maybe guess it\u0027s density, but that could be wildly off, you don\u0027t see a thick atmosphere so you can make some aerodynamic guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo really the next step is a probe flyby, \u00A0you get a real good look at the surface, \u00A0some good spectral analysis.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you now have a good enough data set for a fair simulaton, and rough terrain
