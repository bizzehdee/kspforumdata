WASD only gives me lateral movement (no up and down), and if I rotate the camera the kerbal only rotates on this 2 dimensional plane. I can left click and drag to get him to say look down, but as soon as I touch a movement key he reorients back to his flat plane of movement. While I can get a bit of up and down out of this, its pretty hard to control, and almost impossible to stop. The result is that if I drift away from my vessel for more than a couple seconds, it leaves my two dimensional plane and its pretty much impossible to get back to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like there are controls I am missing, or is this actually how its supposed to work?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fabri91","CreatedById":17,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T21:02:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook in the ingame settings menu, there all the commands for EVA are listed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T21:13:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, thanks.
