Its got more common as I have progressed through the game, and now it crashes every single time. I have googled around, and apparently I tmeans I am reaching a memory cap? but I have windows 7 64 and 16GB of RAM. So memory should not be an issue? All my .... is updated, and changing graphic settings did not help. I dont know where to upload the crash files, and the outputlog txt version is to big to upload to pastebin. So I dont know what to do. This has pretty much stopped my progress in the game, please help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T09:24:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Tiffan, please watch your language on this forum, see the rules\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064-Forum-Rules\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E here\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP on Windows cannot use all of your memory because it is not a 64bit program, please put your output_log.txt and crash folders on \u003Ca href=\u0022dropbox.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edropbox.com\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022drive.google.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edrive.google.com\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E or a similar file hosting site, then post the link here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiffan","CreatedById":151846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T12:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7TQePVjQ_MXV21TZzRGMVNqekU\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7TQePVjQ_MXV21TZzRGMVNqekU\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E Thats one of the files, all the crashes seem to be the same tho, always at exactly the same point so I dunno if you want the rest of them?
