So check my reputation before hand, 777, do the mission with my tourist orbital bus which holds all 4 kerbins, and afterwards i check my reputation and I have successfully netted a grand total of 9 reputation (being my total rep was 786 after the mission).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have an explanation as to what is going on or has anyone else seen this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: An update on that, I performed a retrieve science from orbit contract (net 5 rep) and a ferry 4 kerbins to orbit contract (net 31 rep) and i received 4 reputation for doing both contracts...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-14T14:01:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2016 02:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Wild_Rover\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdditional info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-14T14:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReputation is asymptotic. It maxes out at \u002B1000 and -1000, and it gets there gradually -- you can never actually reach either of those numbers.
