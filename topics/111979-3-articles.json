If you want to design rockets seriously, this is a must have.\n\n2 - MechJeb. Also has engineer functionality and the autopilot saves a lot of time after you\u0027ve done the same things repetitively. It also helps to standardise your launch profiles when testing rockets.\n\n3 - EditorExtensions. Don\u0027t even try building without it.\n\n- StripSymmetry is another must have. Not many builders use it of my knowledge, but it\u0027s brilliant of getting things perfect.\n- Also worth mentioning is a not very well known mod. There is QuickScroll, but I prefer this: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35018?p=1618801\u0026viewfull=1#post1618801](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35018?p=1618801\u0026viewfull=1#post1618801)\n\n4 - Kerbal Alarm Clock. Great for reminders and, not sure if it\u0027s needed anymore, but warping until SOI changes.\n\n5 - Raster Prop Monitor. Makes IVA\u0027s both beautiful and functional.\n\n6 - Docking Port Alignment Indicator. Makes docking actually a science and not guessing your orientation.\n\n7 - HyperEdit. Must have for testing so you don\u0027t waste your time transporting ships that might not even work.\n\n8 - TakeCommand. Let\u0027s you spawn Kerbals directly into command chairs.\n\n9 - Thermometer. Lets you see a part\u0027s temperature by right clicking.\n\n10 - Distant Object and CactEyes Telescope. The former lets you see dots in the sky for planets and adds star light blocking vision, and the latter is a telescope with science functionality.\n\n**Extras**\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement. Part connections weren\u0027t really fixed with 0.23.5 and this actually FIXES it.\n\nFinalFrontier. Tracks where your Kerbals have been and gives them ribbons.\n\nKronal Vessel Viewer. View 2D or 3D images of your craft.\n\nNavUtilities. Runway indicators for RPM.\n\nVesselViewer. Ship visualisers for RPM.\n\nHotRockets. Makes rocket exhaust beautiful.\n\nCoolRockets. Adds ice effects upon launch and launch cryo boil off stuff.\n\npizzaoverhead\u0027s mods. Good for visuals.\n\nWindowShine. Makes windows beautiful.\n\nAeroGui. Displays aerodynamic stats.\n\nLightsOut. Lets you toggle day and night in VAB and SPH.\n\nPartAngleDisplay. Lets you adjust part fine tuning and displays their values.\n\nKSP IRC. Use IRC chats in game.\n\nPilot Assistant. Plane autopilot and stats.\n\nPlanetShine. Adds reflected light albedo effects.\n\nProbeControlRoom. IVA for probes.\n\nMulbin\u0027s Flags, UAL\u0027s flags, DirtyFace83\u0027s flags\n\nIn game Wiki viewer. Use the wiki in game.\n\nBDArmoury. Fun stuff.\n\nCameraTools. I don\u0027t know how to use it but I\u0027ve heard it\u0027s useful.\n\nScanSat. Make maps of planets and moons.\n\nTexture Replacer. Change the texture of stuff in game.\n\nFilter Extensions. More filters.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T22:27:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Woopert**"},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T22:47:36Z","Content":"Must haves?\n\nVOID (best HUD I\u0027ve yet used; KER\u0027s is decent, but VOID\u0027s is better).\n\nPreciseNode\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\nMechJeb (for the advanced transfer window, alt-tabbing out to a browser is a hassle)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T23:16:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E MechJeb (for the advanced transfer window, alt-tabbing out to a browser is a hassle)\n\nHave you tried the Transfer Window Planner?
