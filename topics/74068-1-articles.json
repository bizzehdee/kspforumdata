I don\u0027t want to double post, but I didn\u0027t want to spam his thread either with everything I had written down. Here\u0027s Fylas\u0027s thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65371-researching-optional-upgrades-for-older-technology-at-higher-tier-levels-possible\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65371-researching-optional-upgrades-for-older-technology-at-higher-tier-levels-possible\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDISCLAIMER 2:\u003C/em\u003E I understand that for most of what I listed below, \u0022there\u0027s a mod for that\u0022 already. Please don\u0027t turn this into a list of responses that points people to this mod or that mod. That\u0027s not the point of this thread. And I also understand that even discussing funds in career mode prior to 0.24 being released is putting the wagon before the horse. This is just brainstorming folks...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to begin, (this is going to sound really narcissistic) my main problem with career mode in it\u0027s current form is the scheme of unlocking parts. The parts you start out with reminds me of v0.13 type launches. Which is fine from a tutorial aspect, which Squad has stated was the purpose behind how they had the tech tree set up, easing new players into the KSP world. And yes, I know there are mods out there that change the layout of the techtree nodes, just bear with me. What if you had access to much more of the parts on career start, but you still had a lot of research to do? I\u0027m talking about \u0022Upgradeables\u0022, the flipside to \u0022Tweakables\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say that you wanted to create an efficient spacecraft design, but when you finished putting together a ship that did what you needed to do, it was just to darn heavy. What if you could \u0022upgrade\u0022 certain parts by notionally having it constructed using a different metal alloy. This would certainly make the ship lighter, requiring you to use a smaller launcher, less fuel, and from what the \u0022talk\u0022 about 0.24 has indicated, less money to launch it to orbit. But there\u0027s a catch. As with most engineering designs in KSP, you can\u0027t improve one aspect of a design without sacrificing another. That lighter alloy means the ship will have to land softer, withstand less G-forces, and might be less heat-resistent. So, once again, it all comes down to balance and cost vs benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start, all upgrades would need to be researched, and each individual part upgrade would happen in the VAB/SPH, and would cost money. Just like customizing your car; if you want something better than what that car comes with out of the manufacturer, you have to spend money to swap out components. My suggestion for practical application of an \u0022Upgradeables\u0022 UI in the VAB/SPH would involve adding a blue toggle button to the part tweakables menu that would swap the menu back and forth between tweakables and upgradeables. Reasoning is to keep the list of options from possibly running off the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: You put a \u0022Poodle\u0022 engine on the back of your spacecraft, now you want to upgrade it? Right-click on it to bring up the tweakables menu, toggle the blue button to swap over to upgradeables, but you only have one option? That\u0027s because you\u0027ve only researched one upgrade for that part. It just happens to be an upgrade to the gimbal mechanism. You see that the gimbal range of the Poodle will increase from 2.5 to 3.5, the larger gimbal mechanism only increases the engine mass from 2.5 to 2.6, and you can afford it, so you install it. Oh wait, you changed your mind, you uninstall it. Like tweakables, it\u0027s not final until you hit launch. The different gimbal mechanism wouldn\u0027t change the appearance of the part, it would just adjust performance stats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I didn\u0027t want to make a gameplay suggestion without having it thought out and serious consideration to how it could affect the gameplay. Below is a list I\u0027ve spent time collecting, revising, or deleting ideas I had on how each part type could be upgraded. I believe the tech tree would be too large and complicated to research each upgrade for each individual part, so I would propose each upgrade would apply to similar parts. Researching an upgrade that could be fitted to an LV-T30, would also allow you to use it on LV-T45, but not necessarily on the \u0022Mainsail\u0022, and definitely not the LV-N. Also, I do think that some parts themselves should still be researched: RAPIERs, nuclear engines, ion propulsion tech, the big solar panels, the mobile science lab, those ginormous NASA parts, etc. But having to research a thermometer? No.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECAVEAT FOR ANY MEMBERS OF THE KSP DEVELOPMENT TEAM -\u003C/em\u003E I am no programmer, so forgive me if any of these ideas aren\u0027t even feasible in the KSP engine. This isn\u0027t meant as a demand for certain features, just something that I was thinking could add another dimension to the career side of KSP. I DO plan on trying career mode again with 0.24, and very much looking forward to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECAVEAT FOR ANYBODY ELSE THAT READS THIS -\u003C/em\u003E I don\u0027t claim to have the best ideas, that\u0027s why I made this a [Discussion] These opinions are just that, my opinions.

Of course, you don\u0027t have to, but then you\u0027ll run out of one fuel before the other. You could use the tweakable menu to reduce the amount of the extra fuel so you\u0027re not carrying dead weight, but this upgrade would provide you with a properly paired engine/tank combo with just the right amount of each fuel type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAdditionally, depending on where future development leads, you could upgrade tanks to carry different types of liquid fuels such as kerosene or hydrogen to burn with oxidizer, or swap all those and use nitrogen tetroxide with hydrazine.

If you have the money, you can modify the middle wheels to take away the steering mechanism, and modify the front and back wheels to take away their drive motors. Of course you could just disable the functions in the tweakables or on the fly, but the you\u0027ve trimmed mass off of all six wheels by taking away what you don\u0027t need.

But if you want to use it, it still costs money since your modifying a part that has already been manufactured by an aerospace company.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022allmhuran\u0022 data-cite=\u0022allmhuran\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Indeed, you could pretend that every part upgrade was in fact a new part in a higher node in the tech tree. I wouldn\u0027t actually do it that way because the number of parts would explode and selecting parts in the VAB would become very annoying, but \u003Cem\u003Econceptually\u003C/em\u003E they\u0027re equivalent.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAgain, \u003C/em\u003EI addressed this as well by saying that unlocked upgrades could be used on similar parts (ie LV-T30 and LV-T45) to keep the tech tree from being too large and complicated. And upgrades would be selectable similarly to the tweakable menu. So you\u0027re not gonna have several \u0022Mainsails\u0022 to choose from in the parts list.

Well, first of all, you would want to add something to in-flight GUI so that you can tell exactly what upgrades you are using on a part. It could get annoying trying to remember exactly what upgrades you are using on your craft. Second of all, it would be equally annoying to have to remember which parts you have chosen to upgrade and which parts you have not while in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, after that little bit of skepticism, I would like to say that your suggestion, if it were implemented, would be a very good way to get rid of those annoying times when you need \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E a little bit more efficiency, or \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E a little more thrust, but there is no part that meets your exacting specifications, and you are forced to settle with something that is only close to what you need. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough there are a few suggested upgrades that I have issues with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerodynamics-upgrade lift ratio- I think that this is kind of ridiculous from an aerodynamics perspective. (of course, all KSP aerodynamics are ridiculous as it stands now.) To change the lift-to-drag ratio in way that would seem realistic would involve changing the shape of the wing, which you said that you did not want to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommand Pods-upgrade electric charge- I don\u0027t think longer recharge times should be implemented (at least, not yet) because of gameplay issues and the fact that no other batteries have a limit on recharge speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPropulsion-Fuel Tanks- Realistically, the wall on liquid fuel tanks would be pretty thin as it is, (I think I read somewhere that kerosene tanks are about 1% of the mass of their fuel) and reducing it would vastly reduce structural integrity and give virtually no capacity increase. This may be viable on xenon tanks though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel and Engines- modular fuel controller- Adjusting the fuel:oxidizer ratio on engines could lead a whole host of annoying design problems. Even with modular fuel bladders, you would have to remember to tweak all of the tanks that will be running that engine. (And implementing an auto-tweak could be frustrating as fuel flow through non-stacked fuel tanks is kind of confusing.) Also, if you want to increase thrust or ISP I think it would be better that the upgrade just be a simple \u002B10 isp for \u002B.1 weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, I am neutral on this suggestion. At some times, I think that it would just be confusing to have variable stats on parts. At others, it would be quite convienient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, very good job on the post itself.

Like I said, I know there are many people out there with better ideas than mine. I agree with the portion about the individual upgrades you listed and the problems with each. Especially with adjusting wing chord or thickness without an outward appearance to the wing. It\u0027s just a balance between ultra-realism and functionality on a programmer\u0027s level (which I am not, lol, so take that with a grain of salt \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).
