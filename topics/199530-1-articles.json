The ones in breaking ground are alright, but they\u0027re pretty small. With big surface features such as Mars\u0027 Olympus Mons or Io\u0027s cryovolcanoes, bigger and more interesting bases can be created, and procedurally generated caves and underground features can provide an interesting new way to get science, and a better reason to have rovers. New science parts can observe the volcano plume or scan the surface for caves and ravines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-12T02:22:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToo early to say at the moment. Most of what the devs have shown off would be considered ground scatter or regular terrain. As of right now, there isn\u0027t going to be caves or natural overhangs. That may change in the future if the devs move away from how planets were made in KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-12T04:26:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still believe that certain additions to dev posts hinted a sort of underground exploration, namely mining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe already know that a lot of features are hand sculpted (there\u0027s few seconds of footage about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E area being modeled) and we don\u0027t know if planet generation has changed.
