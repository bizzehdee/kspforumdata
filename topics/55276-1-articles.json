And we do it by copying the way the mammalian brain does perception and control in the neocortex. Perception and control inherently includes self-directed experimentation. The risk I think is that we have to give it a certain degree of autonomy in order for it to engage in experimentation. Experimentation is what allows it to fill in the blanks in it\u0027s model of reality. It\u0027s model of reality may drift towards something unfamiliar to humans, so we will not be prepared to outline which experiments are acceptable.
