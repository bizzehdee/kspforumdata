Is this a bug or does it have to do with the latest update - maybe some radiation heating or something.. ?\n\nThanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T14:16:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 02:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by noxgandhi**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T13:21:12Z","Content":"You ran a nuclear engine, and it dumped its heat into the ship as the vessel reached thermal equilibrium. Some wing parts would help it radiate away faster, but it\u0027s not worrisome unless you need to run the engine more. \n\nYou can turn off the heat gauges by pressing F10."},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T13:33:15Z","Content":"Solar panels will also radiate heat."},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T13:39:09Z","Content":"Also, those temp gauges have memory leaks and will crash your game in 1.02.

I guess the temperature of parts doesn\u0027t drop if the respective ship is not active/selected.
