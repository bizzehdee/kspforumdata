It\u0027s quite hard to predict as SOI size aren\u0027t visualised on the map. You have to make calculations or carfully manage you ships. This situation is dangerous around Duna (where Ike has a quite lare SOI) and in the mess around Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- You changed SOI too fast and the physic engine calculate badly because of missing frames. This is a bug which is due to be solved in 1.0.

I have not tested this method to try and find future SOI changes, but I use it for docking my ships (ie. adjust my AP or PE to intersect the target orbit, then click a few orbits ahead till the nodes are reasonably close, then make a small adjustment to bring it down to ~100m), so I would expect it to work the same for planetary encouters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively you could use [thread=24786]Kerbal Alarm Clock[/thread] (as kweller has pointed out), a very usefull and much recommended mod anyways, to remind you to check every orbit once per orbit, that way you would at least not have to manage the times yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope I could help,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the best TXR\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T08:04:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 08:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T09:09:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m with Kweller - Kerbal alarm clock.
