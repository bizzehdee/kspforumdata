For starters, alien visitation and cryptozoology afford room for an iteration where Da Guberment \u003Cstrong\u003Eisn\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E hushing anything because they\u0027re don\u0027t know much more than the average Joe - e.g. the aliens are hiding from them too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you have the variation in that these theories do not always correlate with anti-intellectual / anti-intelligentsia / anti-science views; \u003Cstrong\u003Eusually\u003C/strong\u003E the conspiracy involves not all individual scientists but Big Science and/or\u00A0Da Guberment oppressing individual scientists. The tendency of such theories to be promoted by \u0022truth-seeking\u0022 / \u0022dissident\u0022 faux-scientists in labcoats touting crooked credentials is indicative, I think, of not all scientists getting written off as in on the conspiracy. There\u0027s also the angle of the phenomenon being \u0022too advanced\u0022 for scientists who don\u0027t use the theory-maker\u0027s esoteric methods of knowledge acquisition, and so they deny it out of ignorance rather than malicious conspiracy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose what I am really pondering is whether theorizing on concepts that are in contradiction of known physical laws- like pushing extraterrestrial visitation reports as true when we more or less know such things to be impossible given the nature of how the reports usually occur- or pushing unfalsifiable theories as science (interdimensional hypothesis on UFOs and the simulation theory) would constitute a denial of science.

I\u0027m not an expert in how any of that works, but the gist is that under IPv4, because there aren\u0027t that many addresses (a little over 4 billion total combinations), your router at home gets its own WAN (wide area network) address, and any computers connected through it have to share it. So, maybe your PC is connected to the router directly, and your laptop and your cell phone are on WiFi on that same router - from perspective of greater internet, they all share an IPv4 address. But for your router to talk to each device, it assigns its own LAN (local area network) address to each device.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when you ask for a page of this forum, the server sends it back with your router\u0027s address, and your router has to figure out if you requested it from your PC, laptop, or cell phone (in the above example). When you are connected through TCP (which is used for all web requests), the router can look at additional information in the packet to match response to a request, and it knows which LAN address to forward it to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis gets complicated with games, however. Not only are they using the UDP, but you might also be the one hosting the server. When another player connects to you, the very first packet telling that they want to connect arrives at your router, and without some additional mechanism, your router has no idea where to send it to. Something in the game has to tell the router that you\u0027ll be expecting a request and where it should be forwarded. There are a number of different ways this can work (including IP spoofing in some older UDP games...) and none of it is completely fool proof.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIPv6 is different. Because there are a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of addresses available, your router doesn\u0027t just get an address, it gets a range. It assigns sub-ranges to devices on the LAN, so if you publish your IPv6 when hosting a game lobby, that address points not just to your router, but to the specific device you used to host the game. However, even here things aren\u0027t smooth, because of course it couldn\u0027t be simple, and you actually get several different IPv6 addresses assigned, and some of them are permanent, and others are temporary, and you\u0027re supposed to use them in different situation because security. And if you simply copy-pasted your old IPv4 code, you\u0027re probably publishing the wrong IPv6 address, which means at some point your connection might go away, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt all gets pretty complex, and this is why dev ops people and network engineers are paid good money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is interesting and not wholly inconsistent with what others are describing as the problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you assume an independent Dev studio - publishing from a region where IPv4 is the norm and IPv6 region customers are incedental (secondary customers) would you expect to see problems reported by the IPv6 people that are not experienced by those in the primary market?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I have seen maps that IPv6 is only common in North America, parts of Europe, a couple of places in SA and Africa - leaving vast swaths of the planet still using IPv4 as the primary protocol)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there anything that a user can do?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\u00A0 \u00A0- - -\u00A0 \u00A0- - -\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelated question from something you wrote:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... in the old days of gaming, players computers\u0027 were the server(host) as I understand it.\u00A0 Now, studios rent (or provide) servers in various parts of different regions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume that this means that when I hit \u0027join battle\u0027 in the old days (Rainbow Six, 1998) that the game would link me to a host and that host was someone else\u0027s PC.\u00A0 But today I assume that when I hit join battle that I\u0027m linking up with other players on a dedicated server that might be in a node like DC, Chicago or San Francisco - and that all players PC\u0027s are just clients.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the Dev studio (today) writes a net code they are familiar with (IPv4) and puts the game on a server in DC, an IPv6 region - the IPv6 should accommodate legacy protocols, right?\u00A0 Or does the studio need to adjust the net code for the game in a way that ports it to the different regions\u0027 protocols?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(is any of that right?)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo again if the problem is correctly identified...
