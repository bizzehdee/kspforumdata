It\u0027s nice to see that you are so enthusiastic, and wanting to take over mods, wanting to improve them and get them playable for the Community again. But please, think a moment about this: You\u0027ve maintained now a couple of mods by others, and you *gave up on all of them* now. Why? \n\nYou can\u0027t even make mods at all, you can\u0027t texture, you can\u0027t model, you can\u0027t write a plugin, so I ask you why you take a mod over like Bargain Rocket Parts or this one now. This one worked, and you just added a bunch of configs from Bahamutos old thread here, and \u0022sell\u0022 it now as your brand-new maintained modpack. I have to agree with the others, you just want your name in the mod. \n\nListen dude, why don\u0027t you just take over one mod and care for it in a proper way? Adding models, which you\u0027ve made ***yourselves***, or whatever you can all do to improve or refurbish mods. You can see now how the community reacts, and it\u0027s worth a minute of thinking how this should continue. Hopefully not like this.\n\nSo, get into modding yourselves, make your own mod, but stop taking over mods you can\u0027t be able to maintain anyway. This is my opinion, and I think others share my opinion. I don\u0027t want to be rude, but really, think about it."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T19:14:42Z","Content":"The name besides his is a good example of that IMO."}]}
