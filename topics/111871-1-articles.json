I didn\u0027t really keep track of what\u0027s been happening, and now a few days ago I decided to come back.\n\nFirst thing I see is that KSP is now in full release. I had a quick look around ingame and I can already see a lot of things that weren\u0027t there before. I also find the new SAS a bit confusing.\n\nCould someone bring me up to speed a little?\n\nAlso one other thing, what the hell does the narrow-band scanner do?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T18:16:27Z","Content":"Hello, and welcome back.\n\nThe areodynamics have been completely reworked to be more realistic. This includes a much more sophisticated model for drag.\n\nThermal systems and effects are now part of the game. Heat is conducted and convected as well as radiated. If things get too hot, they explode.\n\nResources are part of the stock game. Scanners, tanks, a drill, and a resource converter have been added.\n\nKerbals are assigned as pilots, engineers, or scientists and gain experience as they roam farther. This improves their skill level.\n\nAll engines have been rebalanced.\n\nMany, many, many other changes.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T18:24:38Z","Content":"As for the SAS, you can have it track different things: Prograde, Retrograde, Radial, Anti-radial, normal, anti-normal, to target, away from target, maneuver nodes, and your current heading."},{"CreatedByName":"SergeantBlueforce","CreatedById":73432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T18:32:28Z","Content":"You know, I\u0027ve had this game for 3 years now, and furthest I have ever got is Minmus, with my greatest achievement being a medium-sized space station orbiting it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T20:55:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 08:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SergeantBlueforce**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T20:22:45Z","Content":"That\u0027s ok.
