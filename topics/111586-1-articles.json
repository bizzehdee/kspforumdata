I can select Space Center.\n- KSP appears as a starry background / skybox.\n- I was able to get out to the game menu from here (Esc again, iirc)\n- The game menu appears as normal.\n- Trying to restart the game returns me to the starry background / skybox\n- Quitting the game and restarting works fine.\n\nDoesn\u0027t happen every session. No logs (not a crash).\n\nIn the latest case, on returning to the game, my craft is now on an escape trajectory out of the solar system and the previously EVA pilot is now MIA. Seems the workaround is manually quicksaving before every mission."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T09:10:04Z","Content":"Known issue, but there\u0027s no known cause or resolution yet, usually you end up with not-a-number errors in your save file.\n\nRather than rely on a single quicksave you can use alt\u002BF5 or rightshift\u002Bf5 to make named saves."}]}
