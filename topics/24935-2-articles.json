My theory is that it is a comfortable metaphor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGiven the popularity of space fighters in such mass media shows as Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, Babylon 5, and others, they obviously appeal to people. I\u0027m in the minority, but I think they are missing the point. Here\u0027s my reasoning:\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me that the space fighter is nothing more that people taking a dramatic and comfortable metaphor (sea-going aircraft carriers and combat fighter aircraft) and transporting it intact into the outer space environment. But if you think about it, interplanetary combat is highly unlikely to be like anything that has occurred before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine a speculative fiction writer back in the Victorian era, such as Jules Verne. Say they wanted to write a novel about the far future, when heavier than air flight had been invented, and the age of Aerial Combat had arrived.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey might take the dramatic and comfortable metaphor of sea-going frigates and battleships and transporting it intact into the aerial environment. Held aloft by dozens of helicopter blades, the battleships of the air would ponderously maneuver, trying to \u0022cross the T\u0022 with the enemy aerial dreadnoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee how silly it sounds? Well, combat spacecraft behaving like fighter aircraft is just as silly. In both cases a metaphor is being forced into a situation where it does not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, when the Wright brothers invented heavier-than-air flight and Fokker Triplanes started dog-fighting Sopwith Camels, it was totally unlike anything that had occurred before. Biplanes never ever tried to cross the T, and a sea-going battleship had never ever performed an Immelmann turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, by analogy, when interplanetary combat arrives, it too will be totally unlike anything that has occurred before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tfin","CreatedById":27558,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T12:53:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt really doesn\u0027t bother me that space vehicle travel is gotten so completely wrong in nearly every instance, because the truth of it is irrelevant for nearly everyone, and the point of real science fiction is the exploration of the human condition through the introduction of a novel element (Original Star Trek\u0027s alien races, for example, representing humans who have some singular difference like a lack of emotion). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe space travel is just a way to encounter a new civilization in a world where there aren\u0027t any.
