I pretty quickly figured out that efficient landing is horizontal and the only way to realy do it was on the dry lakes. Was hard enough back then to hit those dry lakes while learning to fly. Now in 0.21 they have been removed due to the new procedural terrain system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell even with that system in mind it should be possible to get the ground less bumpy on the former lakes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts dam impossible to land a spaceplane there now if its not VTOL or small as well a Cessna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was told I could parachute the craft down. Yea, low density air as it is and a 500 parachutes later. Plus the fact that they cut the second you touch the ground so they are no good as drought chutes for breaking either and there have been many threads about the parachutes to so I know a lot of people would like a fix for that to but it seems ignored to sense well spaceplanes are a minority so its not that important sens a lot of people dont even understand the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst they removed the possibility to have the chutes open for spaceplanes on the ground to stop easier and other contraptions now we cant land on what once where reasonably flat lakes probably, not to say they where perfectly flat, you could still find bumps that could smash a craft easily, but still you had a good chance of landing with some practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me that spaceplanes takes an ever bigger back seats to rocket, well rockets are fun but so are spaceplanes but when did spaceplanes get a new part? We are still stuck with a few basic wing parts and not even a big square wing can be given to reduce part count?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo this is frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-27T22:41:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2013 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlmarti","CreatedById":70037,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T21:41:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI will be completely honest here...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I started playing I took a look at the parts for the planes, and just said.. pass....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking a wing by tiling together a bunch of parts that clearly were never designed to go together, is not my idea of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will wait until they get more/better parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T21:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt least some dry river beds would be nice, I quite agree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T00:36:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think many people were landing very large spaceplanes on Duna on landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have landed and returned four different models of spaceplane on Duna, and only one was landed on wheels.

Why ruin good landing sites on one of the few planets whit atmosphere fit for spaceplanes etc?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the low altitude the old lakes offered was needed to land spaceplanes at low speeds sense the athmosphere was ticker.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
