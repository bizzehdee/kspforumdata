After backing up my previous game just in case I ever wanted to go back, and saving a few of my creation I might want to use again in my new game, I deleted KSP, and and am now re-downloading it from Steam. The reason I am doing this is because I was getting too reliant on MechJeb and the game was becoming uninteresting. I installed MechJeb when I was having trouble getting the hang of docking. I was trying to build a large ship in orbit and since I kept failing trying to dock the pieces together I installed MechJeb to do it for me. After that I soon began using MechJeb to do my launching, thinking, \u0022I\u0027ve done this launch before sucessfully, I already know I can do so I\u0027ll let MechJeb do it this time.\u0022 Pretty soon MechJeb was doing my flying, and playing the game was more like setting maneuvers for MechJeb to execute, walking away, and coming back later. It all began to make playing the game just boring. I also suspect the this version of MechJeb or a conflict with and older version of MechJeb was causing some bugs in the game, hence the fresh install, not just deleting MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, starting anew, and it\u0027ll be nice to start fresh with a little more experience and not have the blood of hundreds of dead Kerbals on my hands. Plus I\u0027ve got a good plan of progress so I\u0027ll have some goal to try and achieve. First get to the Moon and back again, first with rovers then with Manned missions. Then do Minmus again. Then build a space station, then a Mun Base, maybe followed by a Minmus base. But a space station around the Mun, and again maybe another on Minmus. Only after I\u0027ve conquered all of Kerbin\u0027s system will I let myself get distracted by the other planets of the solar system. And I think I\u0027m going to stay all stock, except for a mapping satellite mod, I want to find the Easter eggs on my own this time, not just look up where they are from someones YouTube video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere goes nothing... again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperWeegee4000","CreatedById":71621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T03:21:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t you make multiple save files in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Ohhhhhhhh....\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-22T03:27:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2013 03:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SuperWeegee4000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T03:23:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKids, let this be a lesson to you; mods lead to the dark side!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T03:45:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can relate to the mechjeb.
