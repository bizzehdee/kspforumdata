The farthest I have gotten is an orbit of 100k around Kerbin. I am still fairly new to this game so if this is a dumb question I apologize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the miner:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ek1Aa36.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ek1Aa36.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the miner and launcher:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FQ5Ieys.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FQ5Ieys.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launcher has three stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried adding SS boosters to the base of the rocket but it caused the center of lift to go to one side (not sure why cause I put them on symmetrically) making it too hard for my poor piloting skills to handle.
