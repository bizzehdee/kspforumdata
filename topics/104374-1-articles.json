These ideal alignments happen only rarely. What you did was to manufacture the conditions for a Hohmann transfer by using very costly means. I don\u0027t consider what you did to be a Hohmann transfer at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA perfect Hohmann transfer to Moho looks like this: Apoapsis is the launch point and is located at Kerbin, periapsis is the intercept point and is located 180\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E opposite the launch point. Since the launch point is Kerbin, and since Kerbin lies in the ecliptic plane, the launch point must be one of the nodes of the transfer orbit. The other node must be 180\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E opposite, which is the intended intercept point. Therefore, intercept must take place when Moho is at one of its nodes. A true Hohmann transfer is possible only when Moho will be at one of its nodes at the time of intercept, and when that node is 180\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E opposite of the launch point. These conditions are very rare. It\u0027s probably never possible to perform an absolutely perfect Hohmann transfer, but with the right conditions you should be able to get close. You just have to be patient and way for those right conditions to arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
