It fails to give me some good route between moons. Well it failed each time, even offer me to dive into Laythe ocean and hope to get outward...\n\nSo I tried to compare in a mission to Moho. I sent 3 identical rockets.\n\n- One would have trajectories calculated by MJ prokshop thingy (MechJeb mission)\n\n- One would be a pure Hohman planetary transfert (Hoffman mission)\n\n- One would be some manual node tweak (with mid course plane change) (Manual mission)\n\nMy rocket has 3 main stages, each are asparagus. It\u0027s quite heavy (1130T on the pad). It\u0027s designed to lift 200T payload to 100km. But as the payload is only 80T, I keep part of the first stage while the engines (4 LVN) of the second stage are lit.\n\nMy goal is to check deltaV differences on each missions. There is a 4T, 2000m/s SSTO lander, but it\u0027s tank is locked.\n\nStarting DV for each rocket : 13500m/s\n\nIn orbit at 90km : 9000m/s\n\nI compared the DV of each ship after achieving a 40km circular, 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclined orbit around Moho\n\n- Mechjeb : 8360 m/s left\n\n- Manual : 7610 m/s left\n\n- Hohman : 6380 m/s left\n\nThis is not possible since I burnt (from memory) 3200 using MechJeb \u002B capture, and the others were higher. It\u0027s no way possible to have only consumed 640dV to go from Kerbin orbit to Moho orbit.\n\nFor the return :\n\n- MechJeb calculated a 3380m/s route, which arrived with a additional 1880 to be captured (I aerobrake to avoid it)\n\n- The manual node calculation costs me 3950, which arrived with a additional 890 to be captured.\n\n- The Hohan transfer costs me 5430m/s, and an additional 700m/s.\n\nOn the return, calculations seems to be more coherent. But I don\u0027t understand why the DV calculations are so wrong on the first part.\n\nI think KER and MJ calculated some false DV for my craft. It must have been higher than 13500m/s.\n\nSo to go to Moho (ignoring the landing) I started with 13500m/s, arriving in Kerbin SOI, I had\n\n- 5000dv left with MechJeb calculations.\n\n- 3600m/s left with a mid course plane change\n\n- 900m/s with a pure Hohman transfer.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-18T16:01:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2015 04:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Warzouz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T14:33:41Z","Content":"It does sound like there was an error in how MJ/KER calculated the dV of your craft.

I just read your latest post...\n\nCost to Moho is very dependent on plane change and if you arrive close to Moho Pe or Ap around the sun, the braking burn also depend on how well you hit moho at your own Pe around sun.\n\nYou have good TWR so the error should not be to an serious issue, as the node assume zero burn time this can cause significant error with low twr and going to Moho its expensive to correct.\n\nHowever if you first burn to solar orbit and then burn for Moho you will miss the Oberth effect from burning in low orbit around Kerbin, this explains why it was so much expensive. \n\nThe MJ prokshop burn is not optimal as it will do the plane change as part of the main burn, this is usual cheaper to do later. \n\nNote that you don\u0027t really need to match planes with Moho, this can easy cost 1500 m/s if unlucky, its enough to get an intercept and then change plane after entering an orbit with high Ap.\n\nRecommend using mechjeb standard transfer to planet for Moho."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T17:08:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The bolded point is at least one place where you\u0027re losing a *lot* of dV.

These ideal alignments happen only rarely. What you did was to manufacture the conditions for a Hohmann transfer by using very costly means. I don\u0027t consider what you did to be a Hohmann transfer at all.\n\nA perfect Hohmann transfer to Moho looks like this: Apoapsis is the launch point and is located at Kerbin, periapsis is the intercept point and is located 180^o^ opposite the launch point. Since the launch point is Kerbin, and since Kerbin lies in the ecliptic plane, the launch point must be one of the nodes of the transfer orbit. The other node must be 180^o^ opposite, which is the intended intercept point. Therefore, intercept must take place when Moho is at one of its nodes. A true Hohmann transfer is possible only when Moho will be at one of its nodes at the time of intercept, and when that node is 180^o^ opposite of the launch point. These conditions are very rare. It\u0027s probably never possible to perform an absolutely perfect Hohmann transfer, but with the right conditions you should be able to get close. You just have to be patient and way for those right conditions to arrive."}]}
