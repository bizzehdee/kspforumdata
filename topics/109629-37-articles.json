It might just be worth using those again. The shuttle itself is a hard aircraft to fly even in real life it was a flying brick with no atmospheric engines for a 2nd try. Also the shuttle had many landing zones just in-case there where mistakes made. In KSP we have 2 divided by water so you only get one chance. The only areo (if this counts) i saw that needed some love was the SRB separation which looks to be improved in this version.

I keep backups of working versions and use a isolated install with only a few necessary mods. If it does not work then the feedback is posted and in no way would i even consider it pressure or an obligation. As a tester i understand exactly what im being given the mod for. To test and report issues. I cant speak for others but lets also not forget that sometimes mods can have unforeseen issues on other peoples setups or conflict with other mods that one single person (with a single set of hardware and game config). This cant be discovered without a defined testing team with diverse setups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not see anyone that needs to feel pressured. This is a development thread not a release thread. Nobody should have any expectations of this mod until it hits the \u0022release\u0022 phase. The front page still has 1.6 so im not seeing anything being rushed to the public. AVC puts everyone on the next version when this is a dev release. I understand this for a public release but at this point either a github with changes could record progress or simply limit it to people wanting to test and report and know this could include possible broken versions. One of the biggest issues i have testing the mod is not knowing what was changed so i can try and replicate issues or push new changes to the limit and report back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf people need a 100% stable finished shuttle right now, there are plenty of stocklike versions, 1.6 works well and of course lets not forget KSO. They also should not be on the development forums looking for stable finished releases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP was in early access for along time and i think people had the same understanding that things may not work properly the first time.

If you go gradually and make sure everything that is done already keeps on working, so version control is a must, saves you a lot of time and frustration and keeps everything clear. Dont forget we are working on this with multiple people at the same time. There must be some kind of organization to get things managed right. The way it is going now only works on projects where only one person is working on. For example If I post something and someone else posts something other 5 minutes later not including the change I made or rendering my change invalid, thats counter productive. Even when you look at this as early acces, compare it to Steam early acces. You can only download one version so only test one version so the input you give is clearly based on that one version and all the devs are clearly working on that same one version.

I also add scansat stuff and whatever else my mind creates. This game is like having unlimited access to a hobby shop model plane isle. People are going to mix and match and do what they want to do.
