They might have been anticipating the release and already working on prereleases of 4.3, but generally you don\u0027t slot things like this into a release cycle that is already underway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T21:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOut of principle and long experience, I\u0027d wait at least two weeks for the early adopters to find any huge problems, and probably I\u0027d wait until 4.3.1 -- there\u0027s not usually enough benefit compared to the risk. In fact, I made that very call this morning on my own project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe performance bits of Unity 4.3 appear to mostly be about baking the scene, unless I read the release notes wrong. I\u0027m not sure how much can be baked in the KSP setting; your spacecraft is moving all over the place, and that\u0027s the most complicated part. Maybe we\u0027ll get higher frame rate at launch?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jotapeh","CreatedById":9221,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T22:37:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess the main reason I asked is that I\u0027m a Unity developer myself, and converting my projects this week has been as simple as opening them in the newest version of Unity.

If you don\u0027t ship the bleeding edge Right Nowz then you get beat up by people wondering why it takes you so long, while if you skip your Q/A and acceptance cycle and ship something early then you wind up breaking in edge conditions you skipped testing and users come at you with pitchforks because you busted all the things. Revving our internal Q/A to be as complicated as what some of our customers are doing with our product is a constant challenge.

So it is sometimes better to stick with previous version as you know which nugs to expect. And this is especially usefull as you can quickly see wheter a bug that has been reported by your comunits is game engine related or related to your game implementation. If it is rellated to game engine there is usually nothing you can do except avoid it (not always posible) but if it is related to your game implementation you can actually fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for original question wheter using latest Unity would improve game performance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpgrading to newer version of unity will probably improve game performance a bit especially in the area of graphics. But the problem with KSP is that most pepole are expiriencing performance isues due to physics part of Unity game engine which hasn\u0027t been updated in a while. So don\u0027t expect any major performance improments at this point yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
