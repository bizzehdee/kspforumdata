I recommend to add that, actually, but it is a very slight thing to alter in the file. In any case, thx for the feedback!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, what you are doing wrong to SSTO: almost nothing. you already go supersonic (\u0026gt;340m/s), and that is the hardest thing. Once you have it at 340m/s and accelerating, however slowly, \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t touch anything\u003C/em\u003E. You vertical velocity will rise as you speed up, so you should get to ~20kms at ~1,200m/s. From then on, try to get as much vertical speed as you can on what is left of air, without pitching too aggresively (or at all, actually, if you are at 10-15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BAAoA, don\u0027t bother), and when the RAPIERS give out, switch them to rocket mode. You have plenty of vacuum dV and thrust, so don\u0027t bother much with top speed on airbreathers, it\u0027s quite draggy. As soon as you see the nosecone throw a temp gauge at you, you are going fast enough to go up instead of only sideways, more or less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething that I\u0027m finding out is that actually, climbing shallower on the lower atmo might be slightly more efficient. I\u0027m reconsidering my \u0022go to 10,000m to break Mach\u0022 policy, I just did a very nice flight on a big SSTO (a bit more aerodynamic than this one, though) by keeping it at ~10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BAAoA during the climb, it went supersonic on its own at about ~6,000m and I only touched the controls to level out a bit at around 15,000m to wait for the temp gauge to show up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. I end up switching modes at \u0026gt;22,000m, \u0026gt;1,300m/s surface speed, and \u0026gt;175m/s vertical speed, so you have a goal to reach. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashTestDanny","CreatedById":151030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T16:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat control point do you use?
