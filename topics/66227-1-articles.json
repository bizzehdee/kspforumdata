I tried my hand at building \u0022traditional\u0022 Eve return vehicles, but they ether broke on landing, didn\u0027t have enough D/V to make orbit, or (once I added FAR) were uncontrollable. I have been on a spaceplane kick recently, so I decided to see if it was possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the aircraft was stolen from a basic spaceplane I made for mucking around on Kerbin. I replaced the jet engines on the wing pylons with aerospikes, and the nuke engine in the center got swapped for a Kethane tank and a pair of Kethane Zero-bypass turbine engines. On the front is a Mk1 command pod, fuel tank, and a pair of radial engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting this thing into orbit around Kerbin without stageing was actually harder than getting into Eve orbit. The Kethane turbines are finicky to say the least.

Again the Kethane engines are a pain in the butt. They can barely keep above stall speed at low altitude without overheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a long slow climb up to 20km where I had to kick on the aerospikes (the Kethane engines will continue to run past 20km but they don\u0027t make enough power to avoid a stall/plummet to a horrible death) Once the aerospikes are on I pitched nearly vertical and jettisoned the Kethane assembly. At this point it ceases to be an airplane and is now just a really ugly rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround 50km the aerospikes run out of fuel and the main body of the aircraft gets jettisoned.
