In a KMP game you can freely interact with other players and do all the Kerbally things you\u0027d normally do in KSP, but with friends (or strangers) playing in the same universe, at the same time. Oh, and you can use (normal, on-rails) warp as much as you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESurely you jest! Who\u0027s responsible for this hoax?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo joke. It\u0027s a real multiplayer plugin and it even actually works (er... mostly). KMP builds on the already-amazing KerbalLiveFeed mod created by Alfred Lam/SodiumEyes, and KMP itself was created by me: Shaun Esau/TehGimp. KMP would not have been possible without the help of testers like Simon C. (CaptainCarpenter), nor without the numerous discoveries made and shared by KSP\u0027s incredibly smart \u0026amp; helpful modding community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EGameplay\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo I can race my friends to the Mun?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuild space stations together?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotally!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHigh-five during an EVA in orbit?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighly recommended!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuild an outpost on Duna?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost definitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDeorbit satellites with kinetic kill vehicles?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know why you\u0027d want to, but yeah you can do that too...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHave a drag-race on Eve?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat one can be a little janky, but yeah you can!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETrick my friend who\u0027s actually good at this game into doing all the hard stuff for me?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuild, fly, dream... together?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a good way to put it--I should make that into a slogan or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnd I can use warp as much as I want, anytime I want?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep--normal \u0022on rails\u0022 warp is always available, though \u0022physics warp\u0022 isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBut... how?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big problem that immediately comes up when allowing players to use warp whenever they want to is that forcing everyone to go into warp is unpractical, and otherwise your local copy of the solar system wouldn\u0027t be synchronized with other players (so the planets and moons would be in very different positions relative to each other for different players). KMP gets around this by allowing players to play in multiple timeframes (or \u0022subspaces\u0022) simultaneously. You can sync with any player that\u0027s \u0022in the future\u0022 relative to you whenever it\u0027s convenient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat sounds complicated. Is it complicated?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor gameplay purposes, at least, it\u0027s actually really simple! Need to go to warp for a few years to position that shiny new Jool probe? Go ahead! Want to build a new space station with your buddy afterward? Just sync up and you\u0027re good to go. That\u0027s it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat happens when I\u0027m not in sync with someone else?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll still be able to see those players and what they\u0027re doing in-game--you can chat, send screenshots, share designs, etc, but you won\u0027t be able to interact with any in-game vessels that those players control. Vessels from the past or future turn translucent so that you know that you won\u0027t be able to affect them. If the other player is in the past, KMP tries to predict where they\u0027ll be in the future and shows their ship at that location. Keep in mind, though, that since the ship is still being manipulated in the past, the predicted future location can rapidly change. If another ship has been manipulated in the future, you\u0027re effectively just watching a recording of events that have \u0022already happened\u0022 play out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWon\u0027t everyone just be out of sync all the time?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on what people on a particular server are doing, but yes it\u0027s totally possible that everyone on a server might split into their own subspace, and that\u0027s A-OK! When you first connect to the game you\u0027re always placed in the \u0022latest\u0022 subspace currently on the server, and if you ever want to directly interact with another player the most you\u0027ll have to do is click a button. Vessels that aren\u0027t under active control by another player and that haven\u0027t been touched in the \u0022future\u0022 (relative to you) are all available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat happens when I disconnect? Will my vessels disappear?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo! Your vessels are saved to the server\u0027s \u0022universe\u0022 and will continue to be simulated whenever at least one player is connected to the server. Be sure to leave your ship in a stable orbit, or it may not be there when you come back! Your vessels cannot be controlled by other players unless you \u0022unlock\u0022 them for public access, but keep in mind that other players can still crash into your vessels physically while you\u0027re absent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECan anyone just hop into my ship when I\u0027m offline!?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo! Your vessels are marked as \u0022private\u0022 by default, which prevents other players from taking control of them or from docking with them. If you want to allow another player to dock with one of your vessels or to be able to take control of your vessel, just set your vessel to \u0022public\u0022 status. Keep in mind, though, that whoever is in control of a vessel can set it as \u0022private\u0022 to claim it for themselves!! Only mark ships \u0022public\u0022 with players you trust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs KMP massively multiplayer? Can I look forward to a solar system teeming with hundreds of players?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. KMP is solely intended to be used with relatively small servers hosting just a few players. The bandwidth and performance requirements that come with having more than a handful of other players are too high for most computers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EPlaying KMP\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow do I get started?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust download KMP and install it like any other mod.

In this experimental release, exceptionally stubborn connection problems may require the server to be restarted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhile building a Mun base I noticed that my friend\u0027s ships sometimes move a bit when they initially touch down. Is that normal?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes. When a vessel touches down, KMP will update its exact position, which will correct any accumulated errors from near-surface flight. Additionally, incoming position/velocity updates from another active player can cause a landed vessel to appear to \u0022dance\u0022 in place slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy friend was flying a space-plane in atmosphere when her ship seemed to disappear from my game. What happened?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a vessel is flying in an atmosphere outside the range that KSP simulates physics for it is immediately removed from the game (because KSP assumes the ship is going to crash anyway). Loading a vessel repeatedly causes major performance issues, so KMP will only add an in-atmo vessel to your game if it is within normal physics range. The other player\u0027s vessel is still tracked by the server and will always reappear in your game once it lands, breaks atmo, or comes back into physics range. You can also still view the other player\u0027s location from the Map View.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen approaching or retreating from another active player, sometimes our relative velocity changes and/or our positions shift as the other vessel comes within about 2.5km range or so. Why does this happen?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen other vessels that are controlled by active players are outside of visible range, KMP uses a positioning technique based on orbital data which is efficient in terms of performance, but which does not offer adequate accuracy for two players to successfully rendezvous and dock. To handle this, KMP switches to a relative positioning mode when two players enter rendezvous/docking range that provides sufficient accuracy for docking, but which also accumulates small positioning errors relative to the normal orbital positioning technique. As a result, when switching between normal orbital positioning and docking-mode positioning, vessels may shift position \u0026amp; velocity in order to account for these accumulated errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy does it look like I\u0027m stuck in an Alfred Hitchcock movie sometimes when I initially approach another player in orbit?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese odd position shifts are caused by KMP switching from \u0022best guess positioning\u0022 orbital mode to rendezvous-mode \u0022negotiated relative positioning\u0022. The time needed for the actual negotiation process varies with altitude over the current dominant body--the process happens very quickly in LKO, for example, but can take nearly a minute in an outer-Jool orbit. If two players get badly out of sync due to lag while in docking range, the negotiation process may take place more than once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI was trying to dock with another player but their position never seemed to settle down. What gives?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking-mode positioning requires all players involved to be in very tight synchronization. If the total amount of lag between you and another player exceeds a certain threshold, KMP is forced to use alternate \u0026amp; far less accurate positioning methods. If your connection to the server is poor (e.g. if your ping exceeds 500ms), you may not be able to rendezvous with other active players (though docking with a ship that isn\u0027t controlled by another player should work fine). If you can\u0027t seem to get into range and you know your connection to the server normally works well, try returning to the space center and back to your vessel (which will force KMP to re-synchronize with the server). Unoccupied vessels generally behave more like normal single-player KSP, so if you still can\u0027t get into range, consider having one player wait in another ship or at the Tracking Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESometimes when I\u0027m near another player in orbit I seem to lose significant amounts of thrust. What\u0027s causing that?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome thrust can be lost during docking-mode positioning, especially if you have a laggy connection to the server or a slow-running game. Note that this only occurs when other active players are in the region. This is a side-effect of the techniques used to ensure that both players see the same situation on screen with the accuracy needed for successful rendezvous and docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI was rotating my vessel when I suddenly lost all rotational momentum. What happened?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis most commonly happens when your game is commanded by the server to fast-forward in time slightly, in order to keep you in sync with other players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy isn\u0027t KMP perfect?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Space Program is well designed to provide a smooth single-player game experience, but it is not (yet?) well adapted to the demands of multiplayer gaming. The way the universe is shifted around the player, the differing methods needed to accurately calculate ship position/velocity/rotation in different in-game circumstances, the need to accurately account for lag in the network connection, the various complications that result from timewarp, and many other obstacles all add to the challenge of creating a viable multiplayer experience. While I will endeavour to improve KMP further, it is very likely that many of the issues that exist now will not be easily solved. The Known Issues list outlines the bugs I am currently aware of that will likely be fixed (eventually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EServers\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow can I find a server?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no server browser for now, though this may be an option eventually.

If you have a specific development-oriented question and have watched this video, then please feel free to ask me questions about KMP\u0027s innards on Reddit (TehGimp666) or Twitter (@TehGimp). In a nutshell, KMP relies on your local game to do most of the heavy-lifting when it comes to simulating the universe, and updates information like a vessel\u0027s position \u0026amp; velocity based on what is happening in other players\u0027 games using a variety of situation-dependent methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy did you handle [problem X] with [dumb solution Y]?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that I don\u0027t have much prior experience with multiplayer game programming, it\u0027s hard to say whether any particular clumsy element of KMP can be blamed on working around KSP\u0027s various idiosyncracies or just my own stupidity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy can\u0027t I launch a vessel that includes mod parts?

However, the restriction on mod parts was built with the knowledge that a later version of KMP will probably allow servers to specify a list of mandatory mods so that players would have optional access to their most-prized non-stock parts. If the players on a server can agree on a set of mods that they will all have installed, it is currently possible to override the mod part restriction when necessary using steps available in the README.txt file included with the KMP server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECan I use a mod that doesn\u0027t require using any non-stock parts?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally you can, but this is not \u0022officially\u0022 supported and mods may interact with KMP in unexpected ways including (potentially) crashing, having unexpected effects on gameplay, causing errors for other players, or even causing damage to a server\u0027s \u0022universe\u0022.
