But after living close to the Space Center and hearing all the screams and watching all the flashes, one kerbal diced that changes had to happen. He thought about other things that would save him a space in the history books, and came up with a phenomena nobody had ever heard of before. Sports. Kerbals have always been struggling with\u00A0throwing,\u00A0kicking and catching. But there were three things that they did just a little bit better than the other sports.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDriving:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbals have been racing\u00A0each other everywhere, and with every possible craft.
