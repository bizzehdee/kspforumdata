I can select one, click on the the \u0022Track Object\u0022 button which reveals it\u0027s trajectory and any future encounters. However, when I click on anything, the asteroid disappears. For all I know, this is as expected behavior and I\u0027m just missing something. But I have no idea. This is my first experience with tracking asteroids. If anyone can shed some light on this for me, I\u0027d really appreciate it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAndrew\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
