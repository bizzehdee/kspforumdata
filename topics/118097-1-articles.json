Hot summer weather probably isn\u0027t helping either, in the winter I never had any overheating problems even with clogged cooling apparatus. If there is any get the dust out with a can of that compressed air you find at office stores. You can also do what I do and use a bunch of q-tips until the dust is gone. In the case of dense heatsinks and other things that are difficult to visually inspect, use the q-tips until they come out of the apparatus clean."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T05:08:32Z","Content":"Being stupidly paranoid about heating from my old laptop, my gut reaction is to put my and to the exhaust fans.

But the game doesn\u0027t define the power required, the load connected to the PSU does. \u0022you need more than 750w\u0022, as a blanket statement, is ridiculous - to determine how much power you need, you need to measure... how much power your hardware actually needs.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E ***\u0022Results like this show that the power effiency when you are playing games is reaching to the max!\u0022** -* this is pure male bovine excrement, probably posted by someone who has no clue what efficiency actually means.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **\u0022*the MOBO is deciding to reboot the system due the high power efficiency\u0022:*** Just no. What else can I say, this is not how it works at all. Replace \u0022high power efficiency\u0022 with \u0022low power quality\u0022 and it gets closer.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ***\u0022PSU can BLOW up.\u0022*** If this happens, your PSU is undersized and missing critical protection circuits, or just plain broken. - Again, nothing to do with the game *or* the BIOS.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The only part of that advice worth listening to is: \u0022It\u0027s probably the PSU\u0022 (as others have suggested here) and \u0022Buy a decent PSU\u0022.  \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m sure XFX and Corsair are nice, but they\u0027re by no means the only purveyors of not-complete-garbage switchmode power supplies.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Personally, most of my machines have Antec PSUs, and I\u0027ve had no trouble from them - even when testing well above rated output, where they simply shut down gracefully. OTOH, I have had cheap \u0022no brand\u0022 Chinese units that fail catastrophically (magic smoke escape) at less than 50% of sticker rating.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Each to their own with regard to favourite brands, but as the saying goes: \u0022you get what you pay for\u0022. The PSU is arguably the most important item of hardware in a PC - all the other components depend on it for stable operation. It\u0027s also one of the few that can completely ruin your other hardware when it fails.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E TL,DR: Go buy a decent PSU from a reputable brand, ensure that it can actually produce the *continuous* output power your hardware configuration requires. Then see if the problem goes away.\n\u003E \n\nAs somebody who has a mild interest in electronics, how can somebody be that stupid? Exploding power supplies? Malfunctions because of efficiency? Talk about stupid. That\u0027s getting dangerously close to politician stupid. Whoever wrote the answer Gerula quoted must be denser than depleted uranium. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-12T14:11:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2015 02:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun**"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-12T14:20:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 minutes ago, Flymetothemun said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As somebody who has a mild interest in electronics, how can somebody be that stupid?\n\u003E \n\nBeats me, but since \u0022on the internet, nobody knows you\u0027re a dog\u0022 I\u0027m betting this \u0022answer\u0022 (and I use the term *very* lightly) was provided by a dog.
