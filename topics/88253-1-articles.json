You can safely have two (or three, or 100) craft in the same or intersecting orbits- as long as they\u0027re in slightly different phases. The bigger issue is probably the additional burden they place on your CPU, as mentioned before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to simply hide view of them, you can do that with the tab on the top of the screen. But if you want to actually DISPOSE of them, you can either \u0022Terminate\u0022 them, or send up a small vessel with a \u0022Klaw\u0022 to de-orbit the vessels (with particularly large vessels capable of surviving re-entry it may even be *profitable* to bring them back to the ground on Kerbin for recovery...) Having an ISRU system set up (using mods) helps a lot with this last option, since it means the fuel necessary to repeatedly de-orbit debris (and then stabilize the orbit of the vessel with the Klaw after detachment) so is a LOT more affordable... And I suggest deploying the probe with a spaceplane or other 100% re-usable launch system, so as to bring down the cost of getting it to orbit in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-23T01:58:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2014 01:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spheniscine","CreatedById":125755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T05:06:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not worried about crashing into them.
