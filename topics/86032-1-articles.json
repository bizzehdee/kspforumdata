I realize everyone treats RTGs as effectively endless power sources, but there\u0027s an \u0022efficiency\u0022 number that pops up when you right-click one, which got me thinking: Do the PB-NUK Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators eventually run out? In real life, the radioactive elements used to generate power eventually decay into uselessness, but is that simulated in-game? If so, how long is the \u0022lifetime\u0022 of one RTG?
