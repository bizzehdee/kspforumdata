I assume this means that the game simply won\u0027t generate asteroids anywhere else in the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am suggesting is that, eventually, asteroid generation be added to the rest of the solar system. However, the only way to detect these distant objects would be to have a spacecraft or probe in the area equipped with some kind of telescope or radar part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo take this a step further, this system could also be used to detect minor moons around other planets. For example, all of Jool\u0027s current moons would be known at the start of the game because they can be seen from observatories on Kerbin. However, sending a probe with the detector part into orbit of Jool would allow you to discover several asteroid-sized moonlets. This would be just like how the Voyager probes and subsequent missions revealed many new moons around the gas giants that had never been seen from Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, Squad already has plans for the next few updates, but this would be a very interesting feature to add eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: This part could be the mobile asteroid/moonlet detector:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9ivHBht.png\u0022 alt=\u00229ivHBht.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe this was actually a part made by Squad while they were considering adding a resource system to the game. It would have been a long range detector for resources on a planet\u0027s surface. I suggest that it could now be repurposed as a radar for asteroid detection and tracking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-24T14:24:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2014 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by jfull\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MysticPing","CreatedById":42543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T19:10:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like a good idea!
