I personally believe that they can very easily(well...sorta.), through a variety of methods/means, add other solar systems and interstellar travel to the game in a balanced fashion. WILL they do it is another question, and totally up to them, but they most certainly can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I really dislike how people seem to feel that such things will ruin the game. It would be more than possible to balance and include in a reasonable manner given the framework they already have/plan on creating. My ONLY concern is time. I want KSP to have as much depth as possible, and that means as much gamespace as possible. If they add another solar system, that\u0027s more to do, but I don\u0027t want that at the cost of some other feature that should go in first(mining and reentry heat being an easy example...or possibly actual weather). That said, if added, no one is saying you have to use it, but if not added then no one can use it. At the very least i hope they put in the infrastructure required in the code so that modders who want to experiment with it can do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The \u0022realism\u0022 argument bugs me a lot. At the end of the day how real this is comes down to the devs, but one of the things that I love about KSP is being able to test out things that we will likely never see in real life. We don\u0027t have hyper massive space stations, moon bases, or even manned missions to mars(lot easier when your astronauts don\u0027t eat) in real life, but they are something we could do \u0022in theory\u0022 and no one seems to have a problem with them being in the game(and expanded upon). If they really bug you, you probably don\u0027t build them, and still enjoy whatever part of the game you have. It\u0027s easy to limit yourself if you choose not to do something, but it sucks for others who wanted to do it but now cannot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a LOT of theorized ways to do interstellar travel, and I personally hope that it is not only added, but that many different methods are. As for balance, that\u0027s almost trivially easy. Not only are some of these methods inherently balanced(the aforementioned ramjets would be easy to make costly), but unless something massive happens, they\u0027re planning on adding a resource system(which will finally help balance the currently overpowered nuke rockets...which no one seems to mind in this topic). Possibly in the very next major version. Every ship you make won\u0027t be sporting antimatter engines if it requires mining bases on 6 different planets, a complicated ferry system, and a year of in game time to build one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in short, first and foremost I want them to ensure the game keeps it\u0027s quality with whatever they have planned. If they feel they don\u0027t have development time to add interstellar travel(or to do it justice) so be it, but if kerbal suddenly starts making AAA money out of the blue and they think, we should expand our goals, I very much hope they put the quality and effort they have into making the current game, and apply it to interstellar travel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T17:49:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, if they decide not to include other star systems, i hope that FTL/interstellar STL could still be an endgame tech for the campaign - make the creation and launch of the first interstellar vessel the final chalenge in the campaign, kinda how it was in the Civilization series...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou just send it off and get a congratulatory message.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-07T17:52:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2013 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Awaras\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Aramchek_","CreatedById":12588,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T17:58:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope squad doesn\u0027t listen to all the people whinging about other solar systems, or how it \u0022breaks the realism\u0022.
