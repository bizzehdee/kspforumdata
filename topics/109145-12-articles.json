At that point, you\u0027d still get the \u0027hatch obstructed\u0027 message, but could manually EVA kerbals from the top hatch, but not the bottom, and they could enter through the bottom or the top.

Is there a reason?\n\nThe engines look lovely. Though I would note in passing I find it a little odd that the VTOL thrusters are built to operate at optimal thrust at Mach 1.7 alongside the Wheezely; I guess making their own thrust curves to be optimised for low speeds and altitudes is a bit too tricky? Likewise, I feel the MkII Ion engine is either not showing its stats right, or a little insane - is it really meant to be an order of magnitude more thrust *and* twice the ISP? That... doesn\u0027t seem right, even with the dramatic electricity demands.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T02:50:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 02:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reiver**"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T06:16:05Z","Content":"@Reiver;Fighter cockpit does make more sense. As for its pointyness, I blame watching too much Cowboy Bebop around the time I was modeling it - one of the ships in it has a long pointy cockpit, and the fighter cockpit ended up looking similar.\n\nThe VTOL thrust curves being optimum at mach 1.7 because I wanted the Siddeley to be able to pull double duty as a main engine if players wanted to build Harrier/ Yak-38 style aircraft. Similarly with the Jumpjet, since it too can function as main engine, although I suppose I should reduce its power slightly given its size. The Pegasus is solely the result of copying from the Siddeley cfg and not thinking to change the thrust curve. It\u0027ll be fixed next update. Since the Pegasus isn\u0027t designed to be used to propel something at trans-mach speeds anyway, I don\u0027t think its much of a problem for now, though I\u0027m sure someone will figure out how to use it as a main engine in some sort of crazy sideways flying brick or something.\n\nThe Ion engine could probably use a little tweaking. For its current stats, I looked at the stats for the NFP engines and used those as a baseline - in particular, the Hi-SNAP engine (2.6 thrust, ~11000 isp, ~45Ec/s, ~.25 tons) - and extrapolated what a larger engine\u0027s stats might be from those."},{"CreatedByName":"Reiver","CreatedById":148134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T10:38:22Z","Content":"VTOL: Hm. I would argue that the Harrier was subsonic, and the Yak had something closer to a thrust-vectored main engine and then a pair of boosters at the front, which is *probably* best represented by shoving an actual turbojet on the back if folks so desired supersonic flight. Then you could rig up a thrust curve that\u0027s optimised for low speed \u0026 low-mid altitudes, and caps out just around the sound barrier - plenty fast enough to poodle around with as a VTOL, but if you\u0027re trying to VTOL your spaceplane you\u0027ll be wanting a supporting Rapier or something, and leaves VTOLs being balanced while doing what they want to do most - lots of thrust! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nIf you did this, I\u0027d suggest running the same curve on all the VTOL engines, so you don\u0027t get weird thrust imbalances as altitude climbs. It\u0027s a little gameish, but probably simplifies an awful lot of a hard bit of design work to start with. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nCockpit: I guess I can see it. That said, it looks like it had a \u0027normal\u0027 nose curve going on, then suddenly tapers out to make it longer still, which isn\u0027t generally how the Kerbal stuff goes. Were it to continue to blunt, I think it\u0027d be more American-ish.\n\nThe Ion engine: I understand that NFP does things a bit differently to stock. I\u0027d suggest considering how much surface area you\u0027re throwing around vs the stock Ion\u0027s rear panels, and going with that - preferably at similar ratios of thrust \u0026 ISPs (which, let\u0027s be fair, are already pretty fantastic), because Ion engines scale linearly with surface area - there\u0027s no \u0027economy of scale\u0027, because the limitation is ion pressures within the engines themselves.\n\nI\u0027ve been continually tempted by another engine, too, though I guess it wouldn\u0027t technically need to be a MkII: the **turborocket!**\n\n![p123.jpg](http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4404/p123.jpg)It\u0027s a turbojet that burns fuel and oxidizer to heat inflowing air without relying on the air for an oxygen source.
