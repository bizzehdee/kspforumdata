It sometimes creates such physics glitches, that the craft disassembles on launch. However... When you are fast enough to open the bays, the craft survives. The glitch is gone, when you close them again. So its definitely a bug with this part, the animation system and physics initialization. I havent tried to launch with opened service bays, closing them on launch, though... Have to try...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T08:20:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 08:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Frank\\_G**"},{"CreatedByName":"bonyetty","CreatedById":57769,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T08:23:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I find that the service bays I spend the time to develop into a sub assembly never have an issue.
