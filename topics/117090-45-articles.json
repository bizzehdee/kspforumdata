Was a huge upgrade when we stepped up to a 1040ST, with color monitor ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022).  Eventually we had a huge external hard-drive (optional -- no such thing as integrated hard drives)... I think it was like 80mb... Could fit -many- floppy disks worth of games on there ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022).  It used the same wonderful 1-button joystics as the Atari consoles.  And yes Q-Basic was where I started programming too;  heh, nothing like the structured programming languages I use now, but you gotta start somewhere.\n\nSo, you can take solace in the fact that you are not the only \u0027old fart\u0027 around, though it sounds like you may still have a year or two on me :).\n\nIVAs -- well, theres two sides to making IVAs.  The first is the initial geometry and texturing.  For this you need some pretty decent skills at modeling/etc.  This is the part that I despise; trying to make internal geometry is....hell.  The second part of making IVAs is done in Unity, and pretty much consists of drag-and-drop the props into place, rotating them properly, and hitting the \u0027export\u0027 button -- any semi-trained monkey -should- be able to do that part.  (Yes, even setting up RPM props/IVAs is that simple).\n\nIf you can make it through the first part, let me know, and I can probably help you figure out the Unity/prop setup stuff.  Sorry I can\u0027t help on the modeling; it gives me hell as it is, and I\u0027m afraid any suggestions I may have are likely wrong/misguided."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T18:58:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 minutes ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sounds good!

(Going to -try- to allow swappable engines, but I don\u0027t think it will work out due to stock limitations on how the engine modules function; would also be a big sloppy mess trying to allow patching and RO/RSS compatibility).\n\nWill likely be a couple base geometry variants (like the MUS parts), which can have diameter and radius changed independently (so you can make a little shorty if you want).  Some of the variants will have integrated solar panels.  The integrated RCS ports positions will be adjustable so that you can balance them for the intended payload."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T20:17:41Z","Content":"Keep the engines separate, I tend to use other propulsion than LF/Ox engines for orbiters, and you already have a huge range of engines to choose from ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T23:08:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 hours ago, planeguy868 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Do you have plans to make cut-down AJ10 and service module for the Apollo craft?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As in the service module from Eyes Turned Skyward, like this.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![apollo_block_iii_vanilla_small.png?w=750](http://wiki.alternatehistory.com/lib/exe/fetch.php/timelines/apollo_block_iii_vanilla_small.png?w=750\u0026tok=f96ef2)\n\u003E \n\nAnother developer has taken this under his wing and has a workable set of parts that deal with ETS in this fashion.
