I\u0027m not sure you quite got the important point that Gianni1122 was making. Generally, when you launch a rocket, you want the engines to fire first. Then you want the rocket to go up a ways, and then maybe you want to decouple something. Once you are almost out of the atmosphere, you maybe want to get rid of your fairings. So you need to set up 3 stages -- one stage for each of those things. And then you activate the 3 stages by hitting the spacebar at the appropriate times. The rocket in the picture will fire its engines, decouple the decoupler, and dump the fairings all at the same instant, the moment you launch the rocket off the pad. Even if you have the \u0022falling apart\u0022 issue covered, this seems like it\u0027s going to be bad for drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s the next point. When rockets have proper \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and they don\u0027t fly straight, it\u0027s because there is too much drag at the front end of the rocket, and not enough at the back.
