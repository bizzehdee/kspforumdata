It\u0027s what makes this game awesome. B9, KW Rocketry, KAS, etc. They\u0027re all fantastic. I can\u0027t load the game other than stock now. I don\u0027t have a bad computer, either. i5 3570k @ 4.3GHz, 8GB DDR3 RAM, 660Ti 3GB video RAM, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea why, but loading any addons, B9 especially with or without the active management thing doesn\u0027t load at all and gets stuck loading something or other. When I DID get them to load, the game would CONSTANTLY crash for no reason. I\u0027d get memory-related crashes too, even though I wasn\u0027t even close to the maximum memory my computer has. 60ish percent utilization. That\u0027s nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the hell? It\u0027s become a chore to even start the game up, and I\u0027m getting kind of sick of it. I\u0027ve tried everything from active management which makes the textures look like crap (doesn\u0027t even seem to fix the issue anymore) to doing several clean installs and deleting everything.

Your only option right now if you want more memory available for use is to run the Linux 64bit client of KSP (there\u0027s no 64bit client for Mac, and the Windows one is very unstable).
