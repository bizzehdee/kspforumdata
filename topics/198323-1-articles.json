I also looked a bit in the configs and apparently real fules calculates volumes in kiloliters so my calculations should be correct, but i suppose it also has to do with the fuels i use and the ratio, and i just get lost since i can\u2019t find a value of density for kerosene or lox or hydrogen in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, i am asking for help from people that are better than me on how to calculate the volume of the tank and get the ammout of fuel i put in correct\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-27T22:36:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRO_Resources.cfg refers to CRP(Community_Resource_Pack) - look in the CRP .cfg files and you should find a file (or more than one) that defines resources including density - should have a batch of \u0022RESOURCE_DEFINITION\u0022 lines in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: RO_Resources.cfg is a module manager patch file - check that the resources you\u0027re interested in haven\u0027t been modified with this patch file.
