Ideally it was going to run on gas and batteries through the night while charging batteries during the day. I didn\u0026#39;t release it then because I didn\u0026#39;t have a video capture at the time and wanted it to be presented with video. I have also attempted to transport it to the Island which would have been really cool. Well now I have held on to it long enough and I want to get it out so I can start with some fresh builds in the 1.0.5 update. Hope you like it and maybe an Engineer out there somewhere might want to take on the challenge of making Lighthouse run on it\u0026#39;s own. I have put enough hours into it for now and it will just be sitting on the shelf for quite awhile.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFlight Operations:\u003Cbr\u003E\nIncrease throttle to full\u003Cbr\u003E\nPress Space-bar\u003Cbr\u003E\nPress Q to rotate the lights\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCraft File\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022https://files.secureserver.net/0sRrRu3hq9zIBv\u0022]Lighthouse[/URL]\n"}]}
