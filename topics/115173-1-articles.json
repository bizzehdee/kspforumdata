Just the way an arrow is constructed: the heavy head at the front, the draggy feathers at the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFins are draggy bits, so first things first: remove them from the upper stage. Fins should never go on upper stages unless you know \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E what you\u0027re doing and have a very special purpose in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I bet that if your rocket flips over, it does so backwards, i.e. tilting towards the camera in the first screenshot. Or, if you overcorrect, it will flip to opposite way. It will never flip sideways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I know that? Because there are three control axes (yaw, roll, pitch) and you only stabilize two of them with your fins (yaw and roll). Pitch is completely unstabilized, and that not only makes it easy to flip in that direction, but also the reason your manual pitchover is so violent. You need a minimum of three fins in radial symmetry to stabilize all three axes; four is better. So take the pair of fins off the bottom of the central stack, switch to quad symmetry, and put them back on. Yes, I know you have SRBs attached radially. You can shift your fins to sit diagonal, that works fine too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThirdly, your rocket is unsymmetric. How did I know the rocket would tilt over backwards if not steered? Because there is a canopy on one side of that inline cockpit that\u0027s not on the other side, and that canopy creates drag that pulls the rocket nose in the direction of the canopy. If you use this part in a rocket under FAR, which goes directly off of vessel shape, you have to account for this. Your other alternative is to build a tourist vessel with basic pods only, for example three side-by-side. But that also creates a draggy top stage, and you\u0027ll have to fly carefully to prevent flipovers too. EDIT: What you could also try is flipping that inline cockpit 180 degrees so that the canopy is on the belly of the rocket. Maybe you can let it help drag you into the gravity turn that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, you want more push on launch stages than on upper stages. With your vessel, it\u0027s probably better to go with TWRs of 1.5, 1.3 and 1.0 instead of 1.3 across all three stages. DV-wise, you are almost always better served with not thrust limiting your launch stage at all. The key thing to watch out for is maintaining control over your gravity turn; a high thrust first stage with large fins doesn\u0027t like to turn much, so you have to pitch over earlier and more aggressively, which can be a scary thing if you\u0027re new to the game and may cause piloting errors. If you want to play it save and comfortable, you can go with less liftoff TWR, but it\u0027s not as fuel efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh, and a trick Scott Manley recently showed off in one of his videos: You want to keep more heavy bits at the front fo the rocket, but fuel tanks empty top to bottom, which equals removing heavy bits (fuel is your main heavy bits) from the top. You can counter this by constantly pumping fuel from your center stack\u0027s bottom tank to the center stack\u0027s top tank during ascent as that top tank empties. Don\u0027t get distracted from your piloting though! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T08:18:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 08:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfox","CreatedById":59958,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T07:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m not using FAR, so my advices might be a little bit odd, but I personally would relocate tail fins from SRB\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s to main rocket, to keep them producing a bit of drag even after detach of SRB\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s, so your rocket keep facing \u003Cem\u003E\u0022towards space\u0022\u003C/em\u003E.

I pretty much agree with Streetwind\u0027s assessment of your rocket. I\u0027ll add that those AV-1Rs on the upper stage don\u0027t steer, so they don\u0027t help you keep your heading at all, and then I\u0027ve found that the Delta-Deluxe Winglets aren\u0027t really the best choice for steering fins since it\u0027s only a little piece of the fin that actually steers. My suggestion would be to go with Tail Fins, or (barring that) AV-R8s, both of which are fully-deflecting surfaces. Those will help your steering out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR these days voxelizes your craft and analyzes its drag profile from that data; a long, skinny craft will generate less cross-sectional drag than a wider, shorter craft. From that, I might suggest losing the SRBs entirely in favor of another lower inline stage, but before I\u0027d do that I\u0027ll ask how far up the tech tree you are - do you have access to any 2.5 meter parts? You\u0027ll have Modular Girder Segments for sure (as they\u0027re Starting Tech), and can use those to make engine clusters for moar power on the lowest stage if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour flight profile might also need some work - here\u0027s what I do: launch and stay vertical to 5 kilometers, then turn eastward only by about 5 degrees. Hold that until 7 kilometers, then turn another five degrees. At 9 kilometers, slowly pitch at 5 degree increments until 15 kilometers, when you should be at 45 degrees or so. Now, if you\u0027ve maintained stability - and a \u003Cem\u003Eslow\u003C/em\u003E pitchover is the key there - check your time to Apoapsis. If it\u0027s 35 seconds or more, \u003Cem\u003Eslowly\u003C/em\u003E proceed to pitch down to 25 degrees above the horizon; at 45 seconds or more, pitch to 10 degrees above the horizon; at 55 seconds or more, pitch to the horizon and keep burning until you reach your desired Apoapsis height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggested mods - Procedural Fairings (much nicer than the stock ones; using those here would compensate for the un-evenness of the Mk1 Inline Cockpit\u0027s Canopy) and TAC Fuel Balancer (this one would help with the idea of shifting fuel back into the upper stage tank; you just set it to \u0022Transfer In\u0022 on both Oxidizer and Liquid Fuel and set the pump rate to maximum, and fly. TAC will take care of the fuel handling for you for as long as you need it).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperlynx","CreatedById":90829,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T10:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemoving the SRBs and going with only a stick design I\u0027ve managed to get a comms sat into space.
