I started out with a grand and somewhat complex system, but eventually I simplified it heavily and broke it down to this: a simple data server on one end and a receiving client on the other. Things are nearly at the point where I\u0027ll be making early releases so you can see what\u0027s what, so keep an eye out over the next few days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment, the server is a TCP server that establishes itself at the IP address and port listed in the antenna config. At the moment, the mod also \u003Cem\u003Erequires\u003C/em\u003E RemoteTech. The mod\u0027s DLL actually references RemoteTech because it uses the RemoteTech.API class to gather connection information. I\u0027ve tried getting to this class via Reflection. If anyone has any advice on how to get to this class through Reflection, I would be very thrilled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment, there are two clients, though only one of them is up-to-date with the latest protocols. The big one is a NASA Apollo Mission Control-style client implemented using WinForms (so expect it to work in Windows only). It has all of the flight controller stations (see the gallery below), with lots of plans and hopes and dreams. The other is a very stripped-down client that simply takes the data it gets and saves it to a CSV file. The second isn\u0027t a priority at the moment, so it isn\u0027t currently functional, though when it is, it should work in Linux and OS X, as it\u0027s a console program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Pxix4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Originally, all of the data in my client-server setup was transmitted via strings in key-value pairs. However, the more complex the information got, the more complex things became when trying to interpret the data. For example, I wanted to be able to transmit resource information related to each part in the vessel. Eventually I decided that it would be easier for me to use a serializable structure that can be deserialized on the client side. I\u0027m not entirely happy with this solution either, as raw UTF-8 transmissions are preferable for the reasons you mentioned. In the future, I\u0027m hoping that I can switch between protocols to support that type of data.
