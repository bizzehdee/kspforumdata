No mods, except for aesthetic enhancement (TextureReplacer, EVE, HotRockets...etc.)\n\n2. Do not cheat. If you are found to have cheated, you will be DQ\u0027d forever and ever.\n\n3. There are no building limitations, use as many parts as you like.\n\n4. There is no time limit, only those who get to Eeloo faster than the rest.\n\n5: Scoring system is person with shortest MET upon Eeloo closest approach **while in its SOI.**\n\nAnd now the rules for Manned:\n\n1. No mods, except for aesthetic enhancement (TextureReplacer, EVE, HotRockets...etc.)\n\n2. Do not cheat. If you are found to have cheated, you will be DQ\u0027d forever and ever.\n\n3. There are no building limitations, use as many parts as you like.\n\n4. There is no time limit, only those who get to Eeloo and back faster than the rest.\n\n5: Scoring system is person with shortest MET upon Kerbin surface recovery.\n\n6: Return to Kerbin is *manned*atory. If you just strand a Kerb on Eeloo and leave him there, it won\u0027t count.\n\n7: You must have a Kerbal walk on Eeloo\u0027s surface at least 1 time in the mission.\n\nGentlemen, start your rocket engines!"},{"CreatedByName":"MoeKitsune","CreatedById":127670,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T08:38:36Z","Content":"What about getting to Plock in Outer Planets Mod?
