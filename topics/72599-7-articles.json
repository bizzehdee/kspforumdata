However... \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;incoming spoilers\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere may be clues (intentional or unintentional) in the script, that this story goes even deeper into metaphysics and spirituality than it appears to. It\u0027s interesting that the first \u0022question\u0022 presented to us in the film isn\u0027t, \u0022Will we survive?\u0022 but is actually, \u0022Do ghosts exist?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the film makes it quite obvious that Cooper became a \u0027ghost,\u0027 but I\u0027m starting to think the term isn\u0027t just being used \u0027tongue-in-cheek.\u0027 I\u0027ve seen discussions about ghosts before that touched upon the idea of entities that exist in higher dimensions, that death could be such a form of transcendence, that they might be from the future or the past, etc. I believe there\u0027s a clever fusion of science and myth at work here, presented in a very technical way. Let\u0027s look at the build-up to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMurph tries to tell Cooper that ghosts exist, which he skeptically ignores.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmelia tries to tell Cooper to trust that love transcends dimensions and even death, which he also skeptically ignores.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDr. Mann tells Cooper that the last thing you see before you die is your kids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the climax, Cooper experiences all of these things. He discovers he is Murph\u0027s ghost. He uses love to navigate the tesseract. Upon crossing the event horizon, he immediately finds himself at the threshhold of Murph\u0027s bedroom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn popular myth, can ghosts move things? Sure, but it takes a LOT of effort. In spite of Cooper\u0027s \u0022God-like ability\u0022 to walk through time, he has to pound away repeatedly like someone with a battering ram, just to knock a book on the floor. Furthermore, ghosts are often believed to be trapped in places that have some history of great emotional or physical trauma, and at no point in his life did Cooper have more regret than when he walked out that door. Is he actually dead in the tesseract? It\u0027s quite possible. Would we expect anything less of someone who entered a black hole? The last thing that happened was Cooper screaming from the pain of the supergravity. It\u0027s not much of a stretch to assume that the black hole actually killed him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo wait, if he died then why isn\u0027t he still dead? The answer to that is in the name of the mission. Lazarus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m probably way off, but dayum, this is exactly what a good sci-fi movie SHOULD do. Get people to actually think, analyze, and hypothesize. In having Cooper give Murph a summarized rundown of the scientific method, Nolan was practically inviting the audience to do that very thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now maybe someone can answer something that I might\u0027ve overlooked. Was it ever directly implied that Gargantua was an artificial black hole? Or that falling into Gargantua merely led to the tesseract?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-08T23:45:37Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2014 11:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by vger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T20:41:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hypermetric\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hypermetric\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy biggest issue is that during the climax they perform a slingshot maneuver around Gargantua, the massive black hole which they were already in orbit of.
