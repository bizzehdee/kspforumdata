I ran into a ton of bugs like this, that weren\\\u0027t immediately apparent doing a straight port of my 0.14 code.\n\n That method, and the state will prove very useful I think, as scene switch detection was a serious problem with 0.14, and it seems to be called with the appropriate state each time the scene switches."},{"CreatedByName":"jhultgre","CreatedById":15519,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T09:18:26Z","Content":"I hadn\\\u0027t really looked at the PartModule system while doing my port but it seams like it will allow me to be more flexible and compartmentalized going forward, but will probly require a total rewrite to get there."}]}
