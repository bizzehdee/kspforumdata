And without the people that answered questions, I wouldn\u0027t be as good as KSP, so I want to return the favor. What I want to do is KSP lessons via skype or teamviewer. Teamviewer is an application that lets others remote access your computer, but it\u0027s not as dangerous as it sounds, it has many security measures. This way, we both can share the same KSP and look at it together, which sounds fun. If you are scared, you can use the KSP on my computer, but I will make it restricted so you can only see the screen, not change it. Teamviewer has an in built chat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you are a total KSP newb, I can show you how to do anything from get in orbit, to going to other planets. Contact me on skype, my skype is coupon1234.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, since some people think teamviewer is unsecure, if you\u0027re scared, we can just do a skype call that shows my screen, so you can follow along my KSP as you play on your KSP, and you can ask questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-24T16:55:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2014 04:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Coupon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coupon","CreatedById":26924,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T00:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone?
