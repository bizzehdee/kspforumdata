This means more money in their pockets and more motivation in their heads, making it much more likely that they\u0027ll be able to successfully fulfill the goals set in their roadmap, shown below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BPQY970l.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/BPQY970l.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E^ KSP2\u0027s current roadmap ^\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs can be seen, multiplayer is currently at the final stage of the roadmap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you guys think?
