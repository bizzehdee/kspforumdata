Wolfram|Alpha says the boiling temperature of water at this temperature is about 5.445 degrees Celsius. If the water is salty, the melting temperature will be lower, but I\u0027m not sure if this will affect the boiling temperature measurably. Wikipedia (itself sourced from cab.inta-csic.es), says the average high temperature in the warmest month in equatorial Mars is 4 degrees Celsius, which is below the boiling temperature by a relatively large margin (~27% of whole temperature range below boiling temperature).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the mentioning of the possibility of puddles in Hellas Planitia, the boiling temperature at the lowest altitude (which I usually just refer to as Low Point) is between 8.98 and 10.04 degrees Celsius (varies because of seasonal pressure changes). This is sufficient to support regular water without salt or anything (although given what we\u0027ve found in the regolith, salt ending up in bodies of water is a near certainty) and since Low Point in particular and Hellas in general is further from the equator, the temperature shouldn\u0027t commonly approach the boiling temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like to correct an error that I made in the OP.

Wolfram|Alpha says the boiling temperature of water at this temperature is about 5.445 degrees Celsius. If the water is salty, the melting temperature will be lower, but I\u0027m not sure if this will affect the boiling temperature measurably. Wikipedia (itself sourced from cab.inta-csic.es), says the average high temperature in the warmest month in equatorial Mars is 4 degrees Celsius, which is below the boiling temperature by a relatively large margin (~27% of whole temperature range below boiling temperature).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the mentioning of the possibility of puddles in Hellas Planitia, the boiling temperature at the lowest altitude (which I usually just refer to as Low Point) is between 8.98 and 10.04 degrees Celsius (varies because of seasonal pressure changes). This is sufficient to support regular water without salt or anything (although given what we\u0027ve found in the regolith, salt ending up in bodies of water is a near certainty) and since Low Point in particular and Hellas in general is further from the equator, the temperature shouldn\u0027t commonly approach the boiling temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like to correct an error that I made in the OP.
