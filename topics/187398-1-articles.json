Total package cost. Players are not going to buy all the DLC of a game unless it is heavily discounted. Paradox is notorious for having products with hundreds of dollars of DLC, so many people buy the DLC when heavily discounted during sales. Right now if you want the complete version of KSP, you will need Making History and Breaking Ground in order to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Product Cycle, Every product has a cycle it goes through. Development, Growth, Maturity, Decline, and Termination.

Opportunity Cost, Private Division cannot afford to just keep tacking on KSP DLCs because the market will realize this and try to out-compete them. With KSP2 it shows that KSP is still an active force in the market and pushes the new standard of competition for space management games, the opportunity of cost of just solely developing KSP is just too high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Diversification, by having multiple titles it helps reduce concentration risk on a investment. Before KSP2 the entirety of the investment was riding on KSP DLCs and post launch support of the game. Now with a new title, the developers can branch away from support roles to actual developing and creative roles.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis doesn\u0027t mean KSP2 will be a success, but there are multiple material reasons that necessitate and justify KSP2\u0027s development and primacy over KSP1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-20T15:39:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2019 03:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by TheRag\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-20T15:42:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are making cool new things and improving outdated old things and making money.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you want from them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbolExplorer","CreatedById":177191,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-20T15:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223654670\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187398\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566314638\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022134066\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vegatoxi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/20/2019 at 4:23 PM, Vegatoxi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what\u0027s\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethe\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0problem to make use of KSP through DLC\u0027s?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223654659\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187398\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566314184\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022144674\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheRag\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/20/2019 at 4:16 PM, TheRag said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven then what is there to be done with KSP?
