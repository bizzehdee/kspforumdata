It will be ok at first but as your plane gradually heats the parts at the tip will start overheating as time passes no matter what. Use rapier if you can since rapier gives more thrust at really high speeds which allows you to go 1400m/s to 1650m/s depending on your plane design. Rapier is actually quite efficient too at altitudes passing 25k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would use shock cone at nose for reducing drag as much as i can. And use the rapierspike design which reduces the taildrag and gives stability improving performance. Rapierspike is what you would call a shockcone placed over rapier and clipped inside just enough so you can\u0027t see the white paint of the shockcone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally like Pilot Assistant mod. It is the best plane autopilot there is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want to go under 20km use wings that have fuel in them. Connect the wings to the biggest fuel tank you can use in your design. Even if you do this you still will have problem with the intakes. Connecting the intakes to the biggest fuel tank possible also helps. This will only gain you some time before they overheat tho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are building a 1 man plane what you got there is a really big design. Think small. I managed to build a quite small plane that can do 6 Kerbin circumnavigations before running out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OT5lXWp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OT5lXWp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel consumption 0.08 going at 1581m/s\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T15:27:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 03:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T18:03:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did a circumnav with an extended version on the second plane.
