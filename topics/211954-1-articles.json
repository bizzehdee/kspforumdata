There is a certain condition with a tricycle gear configuration that causes the aircraft to be unstable in yaw while on the ground. It happens most with landing due to braking action, but I have seen it on some of my crafts where the aerodynamic configuration of the plane pushes the nose into the runway. If force is applied in pitching down whether from engine thrust, aerodynamics, or braking, more force is applied to the nose wheel increasing the nose wheel\u0027s normal force and therefore friction. With that increased friction any deviation will cause the plane to turn and with it being in front of your center of mass, it will cause the craft to turn more. The default settings for the steerable gear have their angle limiter decrease with greater speeds (where taxi speeds are essentially below 10 m/s).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can change it so it doesn\u0027t do that, but your nose gear will still have too powerful of a correcting force and can cause you to spin out (and if you don\u0027t use a steerable wheel for your nose gear you can\u0027t even\u00A0 steer). The better solution is at a medium speed to start pulling up to get pressure off the nose wheel disempowering its turning power. You will lose the ability to correct yaw from the nose wheel and will have to rely on your vertical stabilizer and rudder, but there should be at this point sufficient speed to use them assuming it is large enough and far enough away from the center of mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AuddieD2015","CreatedById":224859,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-11T05:13:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224230417\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211954\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221676050899\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197339\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Coyote Foxtrot\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Coyote Foxtrot said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using a tail-dragger or tricycle gear configuration?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTricycle arrangement.

It won\u0027t save you from a bad landing, but for takeoffs it should do the job.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nActivate advanced tweakables (main menu settings) and then override the friction control settings on your\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efront\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0landing gear and reduce it to 0.5 or lower. Excess front wheel friction can make it act like a pivot and since the thrust is (almost) always coming from behind that pivot point, once it\u0027s going even slightly sideways it\u0027ll tend to keep going until it spins and/or crashes, but reducing friction can make a huge difference to this.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTweak the landing gear positions so that you\u0027re at a slight nose up pitch on the runway and/or angle your wings so that they have a few degrees of positive angle of attack (leading edge above trailing edge). KSP wings work solely by their angle to oncoming air so angling them like this means you get some/more lift on the runway which makes it easier to take off, though it\u0027s a balancing act as too much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E can produce excessive drag at higher speeds.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOverride the suspension settings and increase spring and damper strengths. Weak suspension is more likely to sag under load which can make a bad situation worse, but strong suspension will resist this and keep your plane stable on the ground.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd some pitch control at the front of your plane. These are called canards, but you don\u0027t have to use the \u0022canard\u0022 parts for this- although they are pretty good for it with fairly fast response times. When trying to take off with just pitch controls at the rear, the elevators actually push the plane down in order to lift the nose up, reducing lift; canards at the front will actively raise the nose and provide more lift when you need it most. You should also disable pitch controls on control surfaces that aren\u0027t at the very front or back of your plane as they\u0027ll provide minimal benefit but increased drag and could even make it harder to control.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-11T14:15:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224230159\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211954\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221675996222\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022224859\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AuddieD2015\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/10/2023 at 3:30 AM, AuddieD2015 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have read dozens of posts on \u0022Why does my plane turn 90 degrees and explode on the lawn?\u0022 I have made certain that my wheel are straight and started using universal to line them up.
