One the one hand those parts are large and the holes are large enough for other parts and kerbals to pass through so it\u0027s more realistic that way. On the other hand unless you really need those parts to be penetrable you should make the colliders solid like the cargo bay. In addition complex colliers make physics calculations more intensive, and with the state of KSP right now it\u0027s not a good idea to tax the CPU too much.

For the arch pieces, one of the major points of (for me, at least) it is that it would be passable.

The issue is that if I turn off the option to surface attach things to them, you won\u0027t be able to attach anything to the sides (inside or out). The main workaround I can think of would be to temporarily move the cargo bay off of the mount, then put your payload on the lower stack point, then put the cargo bay back on the upper stack point. If your doors don\u0027t open, that is probably the major contribution to this issue for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, such hatch/ladder thing must be done outside unity unless you\u0027re crazy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E, I was more speaking about base shape colliders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s likely possible unity do some \u0022magic\u0022 makes collider smarter then we think (because unity know itself better than us) and sometime \u0022the thing to do is not the best thing to do\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lonely plug-in itself will not contribute that much to memory usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes they are openable fortunately \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, anim does not create slowdown now, I tried with 4 bays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe workaround is not a full one, as small things doesn\u0027t snap correctly (as I said, a clamp-o-tron is mostly impossible to put in the exact center, unless using stock adapter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue: see last 4 pic of the albums\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/chSXg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
