I would also guess that chances are that craft will be traveling faster than the typical circular orbit speed because it would need to be in an elliptical orbit in order to ensure escape from the atmosphere. So while you would need less dV to get up to orbit, you would need more dV to catch up to the mothership\u0027s orbital speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could conceivably have a ship in a close orbit, but outside of the atmosphere. The lander could take off and rendezvous at the top of it\u0027s parabolic launch. The ship in orbit could slow down to catch the lander, grab on, then accelerate away back into orbit. I\u0027m not sure how much this would \u0022save\u0022 you in total, but I suppose you could set it up so that your lander needs less mass to escape from the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T13:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a *third* option of sorts- if you can get a plane (a rocket-plane on Eve perhaps, or one powered by Thermal Turbojets with KSP-Interstellar) into a circular trajectory in the upper atmosphere where its peripasis is always above the altitude at which unloaded craft are deleted, then you can unload it and it won\u0027t disappear even though it never leaves the atmosphere...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say a plane because planes expend a lot less fuel maintaining a given altitude, and are much more \u0022floaty\u0022- meaning when you send up your craft to rendezvous with it, it will be much easier to dock with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest, on Eve, using a large plane with enormous wings (for high endurance) in level flight and a circular \u0022orbit\u0022 for the mothership (power it with a single NERVA or Thermal Turbojets). Provide it with an ascent vehicle capable of reaching orbit, or make it capable of reaching orbit itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the mothership, deploy a much smaller/faster plane to descend to the surface. Start out with it attached to the belly of the mothership via docking port or decoupler, for easy deployment, and have it dive down to the surface in a steep dive immediately after being detached... (you can actually use lift to INCREASE your rate of descent if you dive with a winged craft from orbital velocity) Land as quickly as possible, grab samples, and fly back up to the mothership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransferring your Kerbal over is the hardest part- it\u0027s probably easiest if you either (a) Make the mothership capable of reaching orbit, so you don\u0027t have to bother in-atmosphere (simply dock to the mothership and then scramble up to orbit) or (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Use a mod that allows crew transfers between docked craft without EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you opt for an all-stock approach, probably the easiest solution is to give the smaller plane a \u0022Klaw\u0022 radially mounted to face upwards, and simply have it fly into the belly of the larger mothership (preferably close to its Center of Mass).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use mods, another possibly is to simply create a really enormous mothership using B9 Aerospace with a cargo bay large enough for the lander-plane to simply fly into- at which point you can ditch the Kerbal on EVA and have him grab onto conveniently-placed stock Pegasus ladders or command pod doors to have him stabilize with the mothership- while the lander can simply be allowed to roll/slide out of the rear of the cargo bay with a little well-planned pitching on the part of the mothership...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wait too long on rendezvousing with the mothership, though, you\u0027ll have issues with its heading relative to the horizon (and thus the Angle of Attack of its wings) changing while it was unloaded- since heading in KSP is maintained relative to the galactic plane (a vessel pointed prograde on one side of a planet will be pointed retrograde if loaded back up when it has orbited to the other side- and don\u0027t even get me started on the complexities if you leave a craft unloaded for a significant portion of that planet\u0027s revolution around the sun...) So you still need to get back up to the mothership as quickly as possible, unless you want to risk loading up the mothership where it is in an Angle of Attack where it will instantly enter into an unrecoverable spin...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn afterthought: KMP or a similar multiplayer mod would simplify the mothership tactic IMMENSELY (simply having a pilot to keep the mothership\u0027s angle of attack constant while another player pilots a smaller plane to the surface would prove invaluable...)
