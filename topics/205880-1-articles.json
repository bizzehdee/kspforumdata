Go find a star system with a habitable planet and some other planets, spawn a rocket on the habitable planet and go to every other planet in that star system and return to the habitable planet, in other words, do a grand tour. If you want to give yourself an even harder time then flyby some moons as well. Good luck\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022d2l0r2v5we381.jpg?width=960\u0026amp;crop=smart\u0026amp;a\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022540\u0022 width=\u0022960\u0022 src=\u0022https://preview.redd.it/d2l0r2v5we381.jpg?width=960\u0026amp;crop=smart\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=441edb9bab040bb02a56943468a124da053cfca9\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
