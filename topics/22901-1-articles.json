You compare with shuttle, and indeed you are right, since the best cost analysis I\u0027ve seen on it (at least in order of magnitude, shuttle accounting is a mess) got a similar cost per flight, and the payload was roughly a third, so it is more effective... unless you take into account that the whole ~70mT orbiter got to orbit with its ~25mT payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then you go and compare with Falcon Heavy.

That is short of what I have been saying all along. But I would much prefer to have them working at something worthwhile. Imagine if the money was spent on building in-space reusable (hence, refuelable) stages and putting them on top of rockets (chemical or nuclear, for a near-term personal proposal, I would like to see a methane/LOX transfer stage/unmanned tug). Or fuel depots, or transfer habitats, or multipurpose reusable landers, or waypoint stations, or surface habitats... we could have an inner solar system transportation system set up for what this program will cost, and we would end up going somewhere, while those aerospace contractors keep receiving their paychecks just like they do now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only big advantage SLS could have over other launch systems is the 10m diameter of the core stage. And Boeing keeps on showing stuff that throws that away by inserting a 5m adapter, and other people finding neat tricks to get around the launch diameter limitations in the meantime (inflatable heatshields, segmented mirrors, that short of thing). That means they throw that away and look even more silly next to the Falcon heavy, or even ULA\u0027s own launchers. Hell, even old Proton can do what SLS is meant to do, cheaper, if you master the crucial in-space techniques like autonomous rendezvous and fuel transfer that we would need anyway. Right now this looks like the old NASA fixation on direct return from the moon and huge Nova rockets. Remember what Churchill said? \u0022You can always trust the Americans to do the right thing... after they have tried out every other possibility and seen that they don\u0027t work\u0022. When is NASA going to do the equivalent of the \u0022go with LOR\u0022 decision, and how much money will they burn in the meantime?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. Lots of things to do, and practically none getting done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
