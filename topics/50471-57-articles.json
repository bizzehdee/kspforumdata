If you watch any of the Atlas V launches, you\u0027ll see that their altitude starts going down eventually, which means they\u0027ve passed apigee. Though, to be fair, parking orbit on Earth is really high, over 300k for manned launches, and only slightly less for unmanned launches. So, maybe you should consider going higher. My parking orbits are 328k or so, and I never have trouble getting anything into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you need tips on doing station missions, I have a bit of advice. Try to launch at a time when your apoapsis will be roughly equivalent to the station\u0027s, and you periapsis is lower than the station\u0027s, so that you can coast around the planet a few times to catch up to it. That\u0027s how I\u0027m doing all of my station missions, particularly my ISS missions(Yes, I\u0027m building the ISS).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T03:43:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERazorcane: just lots of pretty pictures to show off the mod, basically.

And for reference, I was doing this to send stuff on a GTO, so I was able to get away with pushing apoapsis really high while burning to raise periapsis. Trust me, you want to let the first stage throw it high more than send it sideways compared to higher TWR stages, since that gives it time to get into orbit. On one occasion the second stage actually dipped back below 105 km into the upper atmosphere for a bit.
