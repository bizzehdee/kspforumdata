Most of what I have installed is stuff that I think should (and likely will be) in the game anyway, it\u0027s just not because the devs haven\u0027t even hit the .20 alpha version. So, I\u0027m basically just getting parts of the game before they are officially released. For instance, I\u0027ve got a few of the Lazor parts. Romfarer is now part of the dev team, so something like what I\u0027ve got is certainly going to be in the final game. The instrumentation is rather... sparse, to say the least, and the devs have mentioned Kerbals being able to automatically perform certain flight functions. Adding readouts and a small amount of automation sounds an awful lot like MechJeb to me. Haystack? Confirmed that its functionality is already in the game. Graphotron? MapSat? Crew Manifest? Subassembly Saver/Loader, Editor Tools? Not confirmed, but something like them will almost certainly be there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR-While I understand the desire to challenge yourself by staying stock, there is nothing at all wrong with \u0027skipping ahead\u0027 to patch something that isn\u0027t exactly broke, but certainly not done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T19:43:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKethane, ISA, Protractor, Mechjeb (i found that i absolutely suck at docking to anything that has more than one docking port:blush:), Chatterer adds nice immersion - i love to hear my little green guys gibber to each other.
