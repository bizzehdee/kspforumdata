I have several satellites or probes which, although have full power and reaction controls, seem to just stop working on any yaw and pitch. Now all these have the MechJeb device connected to them. I have an orbiting telescope which was working then, out of the blue, just stopped doing anything in ways of control. Same thing happened to mun landers which were working then stopped working. All with full battery power, fuel, and reaction control. Has anyone else experienced this before, and how if possible were you able to fix the issue?"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T04:14:11Z","Content":"Some clarification is needed.\n\nWere these craft working one minute and not the next or were they working in 0.90 or earlier and not in 1.0?\n\nHow big are the craft?\n\nDo you have reaction wheels or are you relying on the built in torque from the pod/probe core?\n\nWhen they were working, was that with or without the engines on?\n\nDo you have any mods installed? If yes, list them please."},{"CreatedByName":"silvereagle2061","CreatedById":116341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T04:37:36Z","Content":"It all happens in 0.25.0 They all have the following mods, tweak scale, surface mounted omni lights, eva handrails. That\u0027s what the \u0022ordan industrial KOMMAND-R Pictozoom 2000 space telescope, but I also had a lunar lander on its way to the mun and was working just fine until it too, stopped working but had the same mods that the telescope had on it. They all had reaction wheels.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T04:39:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 04:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by silvereagle2061**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T05:32:25Z","Content":"The octo2 probe core had the reaction wheels removed.
