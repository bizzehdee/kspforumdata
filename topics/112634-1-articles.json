I have several satellites or probes which, although have full power and reaction controls, seem to just stop working on any yaw and pitch. Now all these have the MechJeb device connected to them. I have an orbiting telescope which was working then, out of the blue, just stopped doing anything in ways of control. Same thing happened to mun landers which were working then stopped working. All with full battery power, fuel, and reaction control. Has anyone else experienced this before, and how if possible were you able to fix the issue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T04:14:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome clarification is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWere these craft working one minute and not the next or were they working in 0.90 or earlier and not in 1.0?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow big are the craft?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have reaction wheels or are you relying on the built in torque from the pod/probe core?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen they were working, was that with or without the engines on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any mods installed?
