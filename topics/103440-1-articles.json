I recommend getting to that orange point and then click the speed-indicator on your navball to make it show your speed relative to your target (that\u0027s a trick i didn\u0027t learn about until after months of playing). When yyou\u0027re at the closest, burn retrograde until you speed reads close to 0, and then work from there."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal007","CreatedById":92253,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T03:53:55Z","Content":"Thanks lads, somehow a restart placed the affected ship into a normal alignment so the panels could get light, and I was able to make it home, however in a previous attempt I got a hell of a lot closer, around 200m, I think i was rushing whereas if im right I can adjust over several orbits?"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T04:27:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks lads, somehow a restart placed the affected ship into a normal alignment so the panels could get light, and I was able to make it home, however in a previous attempt I got a hell of a lot closer, around 200m, I think i was rushing whereas if im right I can adjust over several orbits?\n\nThis depends a lot on how the two orbits relate to each other. If you want to use the \u0022multiple-orbit\u0022 method to get a closer intercept, I can share what I\u0027ve done. I get an orbit that\u0027s similarly shaped and inclined with a single intersection point, get to that intersection point, then burn pro-retrograde until I will get a close encounter on the next pass. If you have the target set, you can watch the target position marker move as you burn."},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T10:07:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think i was rushing whereas if im right I can adjust over several orbits?\n\nNot so much really... at least not always.\n\nYou got a nice fairly close intercept displayed on that first pass. If you had tried to adjust over multiple orbits then you would find that Jeb would not be at the point where your orbits crossed on the next lap around Kerbin, his orbit is wider than that of the rescue ship and therefore his orbital period is a chunk longer. On the next lap Jeb would have been still on his way out to the intercept point when the rescue ship passed it. Given enough time then eventually he would come back round again to another close approach, but it could be many orbits down the road. \n\nAs impyre alludes to, adjusting over multiple orbits works best if the two orbits are very similar to begin with (therefore similar periods). It can also work if the orbits are different but they need to be a bit more specific. For instance if Jeb had an orbital period exactly twice that of the rescue ship then the second orbit would result in Jeb being at opposition (furthest away) at the intercept, but the next orbit again would bring back the nice close approach. This is whats referred to as Phasing Orbits and is a useful trick to learn when you start moving on to docking and orbital assembly. (its why you build stations in a pretty high orbit. I like to build at 150km so that launches from kerbin can set up a phasing orbit beneath them. If you built at 70km then future launches would have to launch higher still to be able to phase correctly. This is also one of the reasons ISS sits up at 300km in our world, to make space for phasing orbits below it (and to avoid atmospheric drag which in reality doesnt have a sharp cutoff))"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T17:00:57Z","Content":"If jeb is in a dead ship on an elliptical orbit, all you need to do is Eva and have jeb push the ship retrograde when at apoapsis. If you haven\u0027t made it to the atmosphere when you\u0027re almost out of fuel you just hop back in, hop back out and repeat. Eva fuel goes back up when you get back in BTW. Then once youre in a degrading orbit, you just wait it out till you don\u0027t get out of the atmosphere anymore. Hope you packed enough \u0027chutes"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T18:04:13Z","Content":"If you have RCS, you can prepare your orbit for rescue. I was out of fuel twice in my Joolian 5 mission. I managed to get back to Laythe Orbit (where my station was) but not able to circularize. RCS to change the inclination to 0 and set the correct periaps. Then I sent a Tug to cache it. It was quite easy (MJ can help a lot with that).\n\nIf you have a docking ring you can simply refuel (a simple drone mission with little fuel will do). If you don\u0027t, you have to send a ship with an empty seat."}]}
