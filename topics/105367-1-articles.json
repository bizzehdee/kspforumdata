Actually it looks a lot like one of my spaceplanes from .90, but it needed a few modifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all: Sadly, no more canards for me. The stress seems to be too much for those, so I built a delta wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how to get in space? It\u0027s a bit like before, but also much different. Climb as fast as you can, but watch your speed. Don\u0027t go fast than Mach 1 (~332 m/s) or it\u0027ll become hard to control your place. Level out in the higher atmosphere, above 20 000 m and gain speed and slowly climb. If you get too fast in the lower atmosphere, you\u0027ll burn up. Then wait until your engines stop making you faster. The RAPIERs didn\u0027t flame out on me, like they did in .90, just stopped to make me faster. But to go into space you need to get faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if that happens switch to closedCycle. Do it manually to have a better control over it. And close your intakes, they produce drag. And then it\u0027s just waiting until your apoapsis goes above 70 000 m, stop your engine, wait until you get near your apoapsis, do your orbital burn and your in space! I did it on my second try, it\u0027s really easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a first pic of my plane, it still needs some tuning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MigIstlh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MigIstlh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see me here on my way back to KSC, but I\u0027m a bit too high there.

They\u0027re used to slow me down. Which brings me to my next point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-entry!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t point your nose down on re-entry. Don\u0027t. Never. You need to loose speed if you want your Kerbals to survive this! And you wont, if you go nose first. Instead point your space plane anti radial when you hit the atmosphere. That\u0027s why I\u0027m using control surfaces as speedbrakes: They also help keeping the nose up. Doing this should slow you down to 1500 m/s when you hit the lower, thicker atmosphere and your plane will survive. Well, mine did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, do a nice landing (you can control the break intensity now.

Alternatively, if your plane has high enough thrust, you can keep your pitch higher, between 15 and 30 degrees (depending on design) throughout the ascent and that will also buy you some extra vertical speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mat2ch\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mat2ch\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDon\u0027t go fast than Mach 1 (~332 m/s) or it\u0027ll become hard to control your place.

Thrust on jets increases with speed, so you want to milk the high thrust while you\u0027re lower and have more air. Yes, you will heat up. You\u0027ll need to use trial and error to find the ideal ascent, but I\u0027ve found that after 19 km the heat starts dissipating. Push your parts as far as you can get them, keep them on the verge of exploding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E Edit: Do yourself a favor and get \u003C/em\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-2-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-2e-3-10-Jun-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EClaw\u0027s Stock Bug Fix Patch\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cem\u003E to fix the memory problem with temperature gauges so you can keep them active and monitor which parts are about to explode. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me to leveling out at 20 km. Depending on how much thrust you have on a particular plane, you should ascend at 30 to 45 degrees and start leveling out gradually between 6 and 8 km. The higher your thrust the more you can pitch up initially and the earlier you want to start leveling out. For an easy leveling-out maneuver, set your SAS to prograde and let it dip down, then set back to stability. Yes, you should be level or almost at around 20 km, but don\u0027t wait until that altitude to do it, otherwise you\u0027ll shoot out of the lower atmosphere too fast and won\u0027t be able to gain enough vertical speed. Again, you will heat up, but that\u0027s OK as long as you don\u0027t explode \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T03:42:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 03:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A_name\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
