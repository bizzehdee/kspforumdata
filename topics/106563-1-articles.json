Unsure of what would ensue, I even attempted to record my efforts to take off, but sadly, the video decided it wanted to end up corrupted. I extended my landing legs, and tried rolling down the hill. After burning through about 1/3 of my remaining charge, I managed to get the nose far enough up in the air that I was able to throttle up the engine, and take off. Never again Jebidiah, never again!
