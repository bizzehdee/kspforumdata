An exhaust I can make in \u003C10 min? Thanks!\n\nWell, I guess the key part of that video is how the Smoke domain nodes are setup. So you can see how he adds the fire emission and colors.\n\nSo the quick way would be to just add a circle and fill it with an ngon. Scale it and move it behind your engine. Press spacebar, and type Quick Smoke and select it from the list. Boom! One quick smoke sim. \n\nScale that box that was added up so the smoke your after will fit inside nicely.\n\nSelect your circle, go to physics tab and under the flow type change that to either fire or fire and smoke. (They both produce smoke) Just one more than the other.\n\nNow select that box that was added, the Smoke Domain, and go back into that physics tab. Find the Temp Diff value under Behavior and change that to 0. (This changes the sim so the smoke/flame doesn\u0027t rise like it normally would, helpful in getting that blast effect)\n\nAfter that you should have basic fire spitting out of your circle thus appearing to be from the engine. \n\nKey smoke domain settings:\n\nUnder Smoke flames you can play with the Speed value in the reaction section to increase the size of the flame.\n\nIncreasing the smoke value also impacts the fire/smoke amounts\n\nKey emitter object physics values:\n\nThe initial velocity checkbox along with the values below it can be tweaked to give your flames some initial oomph.\n\nSo after all that you just need to select the smoke domain, then head into the material node editor. Like in the video above you should see all the smoke stuff setup and read to go. You just need to add the actual emission and colors of the flame.\n\nThis part shows you how.\n\n[http://youtu.be/u-zK7Bu8cAI?t=5m45s](https://youtu.be/u-zK7Bu8cAI?t=5m45s)\n\nSeems like a lot but it goes quick!! Best part is once you setup those nodes once, you never have to do it again. You can just append settings into your new projects from the sim you took the time to get tweaked.\n\nOr like Starwhip\u0027s awesome renders you can draw it in Gimp! But that requires actual skill drawing that I utterly lack.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T20:14:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 08:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by esinohio**"},{"CreatedByName":"esinohio","CreatedById":57681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T21:28:17Z","Content":"Having launched her missile the Maelstrom Alpha watches the Ratte\u0027s turret exploding skyward.\n\n![4jEx4qk.png](http://i.imgur.com/4jEx4qk.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"esinohio","CreatedById":57681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T02:03:51Z","Content":"Working on a new batch of planets for future renders.
