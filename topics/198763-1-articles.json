That because not many people think about them. Well, we need cameras in Kerbal Space Program. \u00A0Cameras will server an important role in tow categories. Science and photos. Cameras would be used to gain science by taking pictures. Here pictures would take a picture on what\u2019s in their view. If a planet is in its view it will focus on that planet and scanning generating science.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003EExample\u003C/span\u003E: \u003Cfont color=\u0022#e74c3c\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EThe camera is pointed at Jool. After a few seconds of taking pictures the camera would then have a message with some science points. \u00A0It would say (this is an example) The giant green gas giant Jool is quite beautiful and has many layers of the atmosphere. It can see that the gas giant has many storms. The storms are very large. The guys at R and D can learn something about Jool.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe data for this part though would be huge! 45% more than the average data the Gravity\u00A0experiment needs to send the information back to Kerbin. At the R and D or somewhere else at the KCS you can see what photos the camera caught. You could also use the science and gain more using the space labs. You could research them in space!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cameras would also be able to see in Inferred, Gamma, X-Ray, Ultraviolet, and the regular spectrum we see. You can switch to this modes and get science from each mode! Here is an example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003EExample: The camera can sense that the Sun is really hot! Better not touch it. It would good with fried eggs. Mmmmm.....\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDifferent modes would cary in science and data. And it would be allowed to research the, more in space. However in the tech tree there would be tree variations of this. A small one, medium one, and a large one. Each one would be able to do certain things.

You can also see the solo system from the camera\u2019s\u00A0view, You can change at what the camera looks at too! It\u2019s can look in different directions and you can see in other spectrums! You could take awesome photos and picture with this! These cameras would also be able to simulate the cameras view of passing Jool or any other planet or moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever this camera will use a lot of electricity. So informer to use this camera you will need a lot of electricity units.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-17T15:58:16Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2020 03:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Dr. Kerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
