Not fast enough that you\u0027re jetting around on \u0022free gas\u0022 but fast enough that a staging station could produce enough over a long mission to fuel a return from orbit or some such. The details need to be hashed out a bit so it doesn\u0027t end up just cheating on fuel. I\u0027d expect it\u0027d be up the science tree with Fuel Cells, etc. I\u0027d also expect you\u0027d need a scientist and an engineer for it to work effectively. Not sure if it can be implements but I would expect the further out from the sun a real world system like this would get the slower the organic processes of the bacteria would get so less effective in the outer solar system, or perhaps using more electricity to maintain a temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
