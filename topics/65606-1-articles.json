I tried sticking something in OnUpdate only to realize OnUpdate is only called in flight, whereas I need this to happen in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Okay, if you define a method called Update, it will get called in the editor much like OnUpdate does in flight. Still would love a callback for tweakable value changes, but this works for now... [Next problem: how to force the right-click menu to redraw.
