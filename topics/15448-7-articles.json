I enjoy KSP mostly for the ability to design flight systems (shuttles, planes, rockets) and so for me, MechJeb is a useful tool because I\u0027m not a pilot, I\u0027m an engineer. Neither my reflexes nor my computer hardware are ideal for flight simulations per se, but MechJeb allows me to have success with my landings and other flight operations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think if you ask the experts who do this for a living, they\u0027ll tell you that, while it can be rewarding to calculate a trajectory by hand, it\u0027s also highly unnecessary for an astronaut to do these days. The next generation of NASA vessels will fly almost entirely by computer, both for safety and to conserve fuel whenever possible. The landings on Mars, both unmanned and the eventual manned flights in the future, were and will be handled by computer control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the MechJeb system is brilliant and I\u0027ll continue to use it whenever needed. Having said that, if KSP version 0.75 or whatever, decides to throw in an autopilot feature, I\u0027d like to see it include a failure mode every once in a while that may force me to fly manually in a landing phase as I think that\u0027s the most likely scenario for needing to do so. There\u0027s nothing wrong with a little adventure flying. As others have pointed out, it does make the experience more exciting and rewarding. But I love KSP for the engineering and the simulated (so far) science and exploration.

I very much like the various information displays, and I like being able to know \u0022This rocket can carry a payload of X tons, including Y tons of fuel, into a circular orbit/Molniya orbit/Munar landing/Grand Tour\u0022. For me _at this point_, the whole trip into whatever my target is, whether it\u0027s an orbit or a landing, is a waste of time - I\u0027m looking forward to the accelerated full control mode, too. I build or tweak my rocket, then set up MechJeb, hit Space, and put KSP into the background until it\u0027s done and I can check my stats. Then I tweak and repeat - I\u0027ll go through a couple dozen configurations (six Aerospikes \u002B 2 Turbofans, four Aerospikes, 2 45\u0027s, 2 turbofans, different staging, etc.) to compare. At such time as I actually want to fly, I\u0027ll not use MechJeb\u0027s autopilot - but really, I\u0027m not that interested in flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently, I\u0027ve been playing with MechJeb\u0027s Autom8 module - being able to actually do the actual calculations in-game is very cool, and after I build modules to do the math, I can feed in information from my current rocket and orbit. Also, I can have a one-button launch to Molniya orbit, or a one-button Grand Tour - and then perform my efficiency tweaking routine over and over, easily... and that\u0027s what I find fun, getting closer to what the math says I should be able to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I had to hand-fly everything, I\u0027d have quit long ago.
