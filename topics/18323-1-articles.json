So im going to get straight to the point, MechJeb doesnt work for me. Iv tried uninstalling every mod, JUST the MechJeb. And when I first start KSP, MechJeb works just fine. But when I restart the flight, or make a new rocket, the second time I fly it, MechJeb is not there. It just disapears. Im not sure if there is a toggle key for it or something. But please if someone knows how to fix this, please tell me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Is Anyone there?

After many many hours i found the culprit myself. Now it may not be exactly the same problem but could be a lead in the right direction. I used to have the control part to attach to ship but no menu tabs ever appeared. This is a copy of my post from a different thread that worked for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, problem solved. Here is what i did. After days of messing around with this thing i finally found the culprit. COMODO Anti Virus blocks certain applications if it does not recognise its certificates. I tried telling it that KSP can go do what it wants with no restrictions but still didnt work so i just uninstalled COMODO, Uninstalled KSP 0.20 and reinstalled KSP 0.21 with mechjeb 2.0.9 in the gamedata folder. I then gave it a test and all works perfectly. I then installed B9 parts and NovaPunch2 and tested again succesfully.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T07:16:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also can\u0027t get MechJeb to work.
