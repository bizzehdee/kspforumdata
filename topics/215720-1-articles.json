More specifically, the fuel never drains and I can simply burn engines forever. I did formerly have a couple of mods installed, including the \u0022cheat window\u0022 one form Spacedoc. This had a bug where all the cheats were \u0022On\u0022 to begin with.\u00A0 I have since deleted all mods and uninstalled, and reinstalled the game, but still I have infinite fuel. I have also checked the in-game \u0022infinite fuel\u0022 toggle and turning it \u0022on\u0022 or \u0022off\u0022 does not change anything.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
