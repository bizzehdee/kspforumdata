The second order of business is to launch an unmanned sub-orbital, and I figure it would be reasonable to wait 30 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually it would be reasonable to wait 90 days, but I only have one pad, so 30 will do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I go 10,0000 x time warp and count the days going by until I reach 30.

It screwed me up really bad a couple times when I was trying to time certain things by counting how many days had gone by by just looking at Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause Kerbin is so small and dense, it needs to spin faster to be more \u0022realistic\u0022, giving you that extra dV due to the planets rotation and all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to check out the Kerbal Alarm Clock mod which I can\u0027t play without. You can set up certain windows and times to launch and it will keep track of everything allowing you do to simultaneous missions or automatically fast forward to a particular point in time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T01:49:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice if KSP had some kind of MJD editor, so you can just enter the MJD and voila, you\u0027re ready for launch day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
