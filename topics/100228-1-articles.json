(Goes out the window with several sticks though)\n\nMost commonly modern motherboards will be slightly faster with two sticks of RAM in the appropriate slots, as dual channel mode can be engaged. The gains are admittedly small, but they are pretty much free. Some boards are capable of utilising other multiples, like three or even four sticks, for respectively triple or quad channel mode. Those can use whatever mode is available, though for any of those you will need a set of RAM sticks of equal size. Speed and other parameters do not have to be the same, though the system will revert to the slowest speed in the bunch when using unequal sets.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-22T18:57:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2015 06:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T06:02:42Z","Content":"Maybe my trivia on this is a bit outdated, but I wasn\u0027t aware of motherboards being capable of utilizing more channels on dual DIMM setup vs single DIMM.

It\u0027s because values are stored in a capacitor with a transistor used to prevent the charge from decaying; as transistors aren\u0027t perfect, it has to be refreshed every so often (the refresh rate these days is generally 64ms between refreshes, and is *required* to be at least that often). That\u0027s what the \u0027D\u0027 stands for in SDRAM (which modern RAM is). It\u0027s just that modern DIMMs have the refresh handled on the DIMM, so the CPU doesn\u0027t have to worry about it (but it does still draw power)."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T07:36:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E At the risk of underestimating your knowledge (as I understand you work in a related field) I found [this](http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-the-Dual-Triple-and-Quad-Channel-Memory-Architectures/133/3) to be a useful resource for a short explanation. \n\u003E Using the empirical approach: tests do quite consistently show an improved performance.

Between this link (thank you) and some reading up that I\u0027ve done, my knowledge was, indeed, considerably outdated. The same exact practice, using two parallel memory units, was in place with older machines to get 64 bits of data per clock from two SIMM units, which were capable of sending just 32 bits per clock. This was later addressed with DIMM, which is modern memory architecture, by having each DIMM unit perform two memory reads per clock. Double Data Rate. When DDR came about in late 2000s, it removed the need for having two parallel sticks of RAM. That was the state of my knowledge. Modern Dual Channel access, however, pulls the same paired RAM scheme on DIMMs, which allows getting 128 bits per clock, effectively, making it quadruple data rate. Hence my confusion.

My LGA 2011 motherbord even uses four channels. \n\nNow using four dimm in an two channel system might reduce memory clock speed a litle, speed is anyway locked to the slowest sets of modules however in practical use the extra memory will make your system work better simply by working as disc cache."},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T13:39:58Z","Content":"i dont think they make rom anymore, certainly not the write once and if there are bugs in your firmware then deal with it kind. or those cool eproms with the little window in the chip where you had to erase it with uv light. modern eeproms are pretty good, i sometimes wonder why they arent used instead of flash. i know working with arduino that you can overwrite the eeprom about 10x as often as the flash before it degrades. its probably a density thing.\n\nmost of the modern eeproms ive used have a serial interface, and so would be somewhat slower than a typical storage device. older mobos used to have those removable eeprom/flash chips with a parallel interface, but a fairly recent mobo had a socketed 8-pin dip spi eeprom, which i thought looked out of place on a modern mobo. then again you really dont need to run much code off of it. just enough to get start a bootloader. once the computer is up and running it relies little on the bios. in the old days the computer was dependent on a lot of bios code but i think those dependencies have been solved in other ways."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T14:50:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E i dont think they make rom anymore, certainly not the write once and if there are bugs in your firmware then deal with it kind. or those cool eproms with the little window in the chip where you had to erase it with uv light. modern eeproms are pretty good, i sometimes wonder why they arent used instead of flash. i know working with arduino that you can overwrite the eeprom about 10x as often as the flash before it degrades. its probably a density thing.\n\u003E most of the modern eeproms ive used have a serial interface, and so would be somewhat slower than a typical storage device. older mobos used to have those removable eeprom/flash chips with a parallel interface, but a fairly recent mobo had a socketed 8-pin dip spi eeprom, which i thought looked out of place on a modern mobo. then again you really dont need to run much code off of it. just enough to get start a bootloader. once the computer is up and running it relies little on the bios. in the old days the computer was dependent on a lot of bios code but i think those dependencies have been solved in other ways.\n\nThe flash memory who contains the traditional bios rom functionality is loaded into memory as part of the boot process.
