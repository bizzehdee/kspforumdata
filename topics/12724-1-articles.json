This is because there is nowhere to place wheels efficiently. I go for the standard three wheel configuration one wheel at the front aligned with the centre, and two near the back spread further apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is the fact that everything is a cylinder, the rear wheels are always at an angle meaning that my plane will just fall on its side. How do I amend this? How did you place your wheels on your space plane?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dogon11","CreatedById":20786,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-15T15:01:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlace the pylons on your wings or wingtips, rotate them to face down, put the gear on that, add struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-15T15:03:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you turn off angular lock in the SPH (click the button next to symmetry) it allows you to attach things radially to the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-15T15:05:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use WASD to rotate the wheels in 90 degree steps, or hold shift for 5 degree steps, this way you can more finely place your wheels and other parts, and as dogon11 said, you can also mount your rear wheels on pylons so they are level with the nosewheel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
