This morning I restart the game and go back to the options to check if a setting exists. And I see that the games believe in both fullscreen and windowed. Some graphic options are at the same time in medium and full.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RegisBlackbird","CreatedById":226276,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T19:01:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also thought the graphical settings were not saving correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it seems to be a graphical bug which highlight the \u201Cdefault\u201D selection along with any changes you have made. So it looks like both \u201Cfull screen\u201D and \u201Cborderless\u201D are selected simultaneously, for example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe effect goes away if you hover the mouse cursor over the highlighted buttons (not clicking).
