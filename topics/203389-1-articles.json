I was already up to Docking. I noticed there was an update installed today and I couldn\u0027t replicate any of the manoeuvrers I had achieved last week, so I decided to go back a few tutorials. I can\u0027t get any , except the 1st, to work. The 2nd one refuses to stage and the capsule crashes every time. When I press the stage button, the engine just moves to the parachute stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny way to revert to the previous version?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-28T14:13:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage ipsAttachLink_image ipsAttachLink_right\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022123.78\u0022 height=\u0022900\u0022 style=\u0022width:370px;height:auto;float:right;\u0022 width=\u0022727\u0022 alt=\u0022x7vATDU.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/x7vATDU.jpg\u0022\u003EDifferent sellers give you different methods to choose the older versions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the KSP Store, you log in to the account you set up to buy the game, follow \u0027Download\u0027 and look down the page for the previous version(s).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bollen","CreatedById":212448,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-04T18:03:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you OHara, but I\u0027m on Steam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-04T18:54:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223999810\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203389\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221625421795\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022212448\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bollen\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n48 minutes ago, Bollen said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you OHara, but I\u0027m on Steam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn steam, right click the game in library list, select \u0022Properties\u0022, then \u0022Betas\u0022 in the window that pops up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe older versions can be found under \u0022select which beta you would like to opt into\u0022 dropdown\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
