How you\u0027re using the KSO is very important to me as well, as that is the information I need to make improvements and fixes. An example of that is the improved cargo bay and the nosecone that can be opened. Which were additions made after I saw how players are using the KSO. The KSO Super 25 which will be made eventually is also along the same lines to answer the request for a larger KSO.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s becoming hard enough for me to track and report to Nazari legitimate bugs with our build as opposed to player induced bugs do to having customizations or mods we didn\u0027t intend. And then you have me also posting updates on the various phases and plans and it\u0027ll become a mess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease take discussions on personalizing your installation of the KSO to private chat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe however, welcome discussion on custom configurations (meaning editing CFG files) that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Improve the functionality of the current version of the KSOS to make it more user friendly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Fix bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Improve compatibility with other mods such as FAR, DRE, MechJeb etcetera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs well as discussions such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-How you\u0027re using the shuttle?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-What things you\u0027d like to see that fit the style, theme, and scope of the KSOS?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscussions asking how to change its size, rescaling it, cutting pieces off, moving or removing internals, are outside the scope of this thread. That goes for other mods as well (such as rescaling a part to fit the KSO).
