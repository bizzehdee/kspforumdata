Be sure to back up your saves first, and also remember that having mods in the Steam copy of KSP is a frequent cause of KSP breaking (especially when changing versions) so copy the existing KSP to your desktop, delete all mods and then change versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to do it all by hand, just copy \u002B paste your current copy of KSP and then delete mods from the new copy.
