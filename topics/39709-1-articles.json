On approach, I don\u0027t see why the station needs any physics calculations _at all_. It should be stable and inert, and until I hit it, no forces will perturb it so no cpu cycles need be wasted on it. I also am a very careful pilot and take extreme pains to not bump or crash anything, so I\u0027d not mind turning off all collision detection with everything which isnt a docking port too, just so I can get a smooth approach and docking (the critical and pilot-intensive bits)... all I want to do is move modules around and glide around in my little tugs at a nice framerate, and I\u0027ll sacrifice all the wobbles and collisions for that (I do NOT collide - well, there was that one time with that badly placed communication dish).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously this isn\u0027t for everyones tastes, but an option to disable all the wobbly physics and collision detections just might give drastic frame rate improvements here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
