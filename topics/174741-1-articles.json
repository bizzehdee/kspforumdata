Something that would work as a simplified SQL UPDATE\u00A0or something like that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003EUPDATE \u0022vessel name\u0022.PARTS p\n\tSET p.autostrutMode = \u0022Off\u0022, p.rigidAttachment = \u0022False\u0022\n\tFOR \u0022LaunchClamp\u0022 in (SELECT name FROM p.MODULES)\n;\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, I want to change all parts of a kind to autostrutMode=Grandparent, while all the parts of another kind should be autostrutMode=Off. And there\u0027s a lot of parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is something not too easy to do editing directly the craft file - at very least, some serious regular expressions would be needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart Wizard is useful when searching for a specific part to be changed or deleted. Good, but it\u0027s not what I need now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
