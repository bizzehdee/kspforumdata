Main problem is, that it cannot reach Laythe, not even on a good day, other problem is, that when you expend your ammunition it is useles and you may as well deorbit the whole thing. I think, that \u0022Marduk\u0022 should be armed with at least 2-4 missiles made of SRBs facing forward. To make them reloadable missiles will be equiped with docking ports on both ends, so they can be docked by light service craft on to the hard points of the ship. What I find very good is the \u0022Smart Missile System\u0022 very light - RCS tank, flat probe body, linear RCS port and docking port and yet it can devastate smaller craft - ideal for defense of a space station or capital ship. As far as armor goes - it is almost useles, because it can be destroyed by simple missile made of nosecone and sepratrons. Armor realy protects only againts smaller projectiles, so \u0022Marduk\u0022 class light cruiser should have armor only on vital areas to keep parts and weight down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T13:02:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWeapons, i\u0027m out!
