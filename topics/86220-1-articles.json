I thought about it. I very nearly did it for the video. But I found that building rockets that 1x1 meter blocks don\u0027t lend themselves to building things that are use fractions of a meter (2.5, 3.75m), though I suppose I could have fudged it. It\u0027s rather amazing how SMALL most (KSP) rockets would be within the building though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T20:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was under the first, if not the only person that died during the project because I refused to fly around and help with the darn thing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the Video has become a great documentary of what persistence can accomplish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGive Fleet some reputation for it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xenro66","CreatedById":123894,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T13:15:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow that\u0027s freaking amazing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
