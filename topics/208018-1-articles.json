My plan is to visit whole Kerbin system whit this one big ship.\u00A0 But I must say to be on safe side I would like to strut some parts via EVA but well the old mod from DMAGIC looks like is no longer working.

Best to save this only for radial boosters to Auto-strut to the core stage while skipping the decoupler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the other two options, in big constructions I tend to have a couple of the biggest parts (or parts nearby a docking port or decoupler or reaction wheel) Auto-strutted to the \u0027root part\u0027, and the root part Auto-strutted to the \u0027heaviest part\u0027, and that kind of circular logic seems to hold everything together nicely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember that an Auto-strut connection is like using a Strut part and using them everywhere will increase your system lag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are building a huge vessel out of many docked smaller parts, I would add you might want to switch off or reduce the authority of some reaction wheels and use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E for attitude control. I have experienced problems with two sides of a docking connection beginning to flex themselves to death wildly all on their own which even the Auto-strut did not help --- but, EVA struts did! You use an Engineer kerbal to attach them, this is stock now with no mod needed. One downside is that sometimes when you leave that vessel and reload it later, the strut ends are still attached where you left them but the steel bar itself is not there anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-05T23:09:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2022 11:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by HandyAndy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
