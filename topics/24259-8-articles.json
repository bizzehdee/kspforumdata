Part of the code or DRE caps the maximum temperature to 1600. Seems to halve it in the case of the 280 model though as I got that up to 1800 degrees without blowing up.

The tiny engine is perfectly fine though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematically there should be no difference, but it may need a bit of fine tuning\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mystique","CreatedById":95628,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T16:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, that seems to be the problems.
