The old sweatshirt was soft as a cloud and delightfully warm, and smelled just faintly of fabric softener and\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe felt her cheeks flush just a touch more, and cinched the drawstring tighter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs they came to the end of an incredibly long corridor, Edgas drew back his wide-eyed, thousand-meter stare, and began undogging the thick-looking hatch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWatch your step, it can get a little slick inside,\u201D he said.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe pulled the hatch open with a loud groan, both from him and the hatch. She took one step forward, and a frigid blast of air took her breath away, turning it into a little roiling cloud before her eyes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt is \u003Cem\u003Efreezing\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in here,\u201D she mumbled as she cautiously stepped over the threshold. She pulled her hands into the floppy sweatshirt arms, fumbling not to drop her cane, as she looked around the cavernous space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt... really \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0freezing in here...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShafts of light from floodlamps high above illuminated twinkling ice crystals that hung in the still air. On every surface, a paper-thin layer of frost sparkled like diamonds. And within it all, rushing in through her lungs with every chilling breath, was a permeating \u003Cem\u003Efamiliarness\u003C/em\u003E, like the first welcoming scent of home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the unmistakable stink of gear oil.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, just below zero is usually the best we can do,\u201D Edgas said as he followed her in, \u201Cthis place isn\u2019t as insulated as the rest of the base; even with a nuclear reactor we can\u2019t quite get it above freezing. There\u2019s heated garages on the far side for major work, and...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe didn\u2019t really hear him. As the shock of the cold wore off, she began to take in what \u003Cem\u003Eelse\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was in here. A few boxy, tracked vehicles off in one corner she somehow recognized as sno-cats. Off in another was something that looked like a quartet of jet engines mounted on skis. But towering over everything else\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003EWhat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is \u003Cem\u003Ethat?\u003C/em\u003E\u201D she blurted out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s the LCC-1,\u201D Edgas beamed up at the enormous machine, \u201Cwe found it rusting in a field in Ysair, \u003Cem\u003Ethey\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0paid \u003Cem\u003Eus\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to remove it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was... a bit difficult to wrap her mind around. The thing towered nearly as high as the hangar ceiling. It looked less like a vehicle and more like a small building, mounted on eight enormous balloon tires three times taller than she was. As she craned her neck ever higher, she saw someone standing on top guiding a huge piece of machinery as it was lowered from above.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe recognized Lemmy, waving his, er, stumps to someone else, \u201Ceasy does, lad! Two pips t\u2019the right, take it slow... right... right... now hold there!\u201D A head belonging to Doyle, his young... assistant, poked out from a hatch she couldn\u2019t see. \u201CMind the lower hoses. Pair of 36-mil spanners, and check the lockout.\u201D Doyle nodded and disappeared again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHoy, thar!\u201D he called down to the newcomers, \u201Cis that the young miss up and aboot, now?\u201D Doyle\u2019s head popped back up through the hatch, and he gave an enthusiastic wave. She managed a more timid one in return.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeside her, Edgas opened his mouth to speak, blinked, then seemed to change what he was going to say, \u201Cwait, is that number three?\u201D he yelled up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYar. Number one\u2019s blowed its seals again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat about number two?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStill in the machine shop fer an overhaul. Waiting on that primary buffer panel, we are.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas put a hand to his face, mumbling something into it, \u201Cok, ok, I\u2019ll makes sure there\u2019s one in the next supply run,\u201D he called back.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s what ye said about the \u003Cem\u003Elast\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0supply run.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFine, I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s two!\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemmy laughed, and Edgas quickly yet \u003Cem\u003Ecautiously\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0led her away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat on Kerbin do you use such a machine for?\u201D she tried once more to gawk back at it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMoving stuff up here by air is expensive, and \u003Cem\u003Edangerous,\u003C/em\u003E\u201D Edgas explained, \u201Cmost of the modules would have fit in a transport plane, but it actually cost less to restore the LCC and haul them overland a few at a time. We don\u2019t use it as much these days, the sno-cats handle the supply trips, but I\u2019ve always kept it on standby. In a real emergency, we could use it to evacuate, not even a storm like this would stop it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAh, here we are...\u201D he gave another of his awkward grins, and pointed to... a large pile of junk in the corner.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat is... it?\u201D she raised an eye... bulge back at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s it. At least, as much as we could recover.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe stared at the unidentifiable heap, expecting... something. Yet nothing came. It looked like nothing more than so much meaningless scrap. Picking up one frosted panel with her floppy arm-gloves, she turned it this way and that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe tried another. This one had a very strange, slightly scalloped semicircle missing. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u003C/em\u003E, at least, looked somehow familiar.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis looks like a bite mark...\u201D she muttered.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUm, yeah,\u201D Edgas rubbed at the back of his head, \u201Cafter we got you out a clutch of whumpers came along. Took some effort to scare them off, so we took what we could and didn\u2019t stick around long.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSomething... \u003Cem\u003Eate\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0this?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe nodded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe gave a little shake of her head, \u201Cwhat is a whumper?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, you\u2019ve heard of the abominable snow-kerb, right?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis drew a drawn out roll of her eyes, \u201Ceven\u003Cem\u003E I\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0know, is no abominable snow-kerb.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight, because whumpers ate them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe blinked, \u201Coh.\u201D But then, \u201Cwait, this is North Pole, yes? Is nothing but ice and snow for hundreds of kilometers in every direction, what else could these creatures live on?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPeople who go out to study them?\u201D Edgas shrugged.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe blinked again, \u201Coh.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen another thought weaseled into her brain, \u201Cback... back there in hallway... in window... I thought I saw... \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0outside, moving just beyond floodlights.

Sometimes they like to cling to the reactor housing for warmth, but they don\u2019t bother the base. They hate the taste of the insulation on the modules.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe blinked once more, \u201Coh,\u201D then gave a long sigh and a shake of her head.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis... wasn\u2019t working. She turned back to the jumbled pile of scrap. She had expected... She didn\u2019t know \u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0she\u2019d expected. She picked through more burnt, icy bits of metal. Nothing. Just... \u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E. One bit was a small, smashed box with two broken lights on it. IVAN was stenciled on it in her own language. For an instant... just \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0instant, she thought there was...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, more nothing. Another hunk of trash as meaningless as the last. She tossed it back into the pile with a grunt. All she felt looking at it was...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey, it\u2019s all right,\u201D she heard Edgas approach, \u201Cit was a long shot, anyway.

All she felt was... cold.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat if I \u003Cem\u003Eam\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0dead?

She spun back to him now, expecting, fearing... \u003Cem\u003Ehoping\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0he would have another; yet his face looked as torn as her own mind.

The light has forsaken this place, fled from it in terror. Here, smoking towers of brimstone climb above a lake of flames that never diminish, consuming but never consumed, and ash like corrupted snow falls from clouds blacker than the deepest night. Presently, stalking through this curs\u00E9d realm came a Demon. Oblivious to the choking columns of smoke it passed, its hide was even darker than the clouds above, reflecting none of the unworldly crimson not-glow it bathed in as it proceeded toward the dark tower at the center of this place of torment. It wailed like the shrieking of a thousand condemned souls.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe VC-19 \u003Cem\u003EDemon\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0circled once around the mostly darkened hospital building, a black hole in reality clad in paint that absorbed every wavelength of light, nearly invisible even in infrared. The four pairs of jet engines at the tips of its stubby tandem wings roared with fury as they swung down, now fully bearing its weight. It slowed to a hover, and seams appeared in its seamless flanks to reveal landing gear and a wide loading ramp beneath the tail. With sublime grace, it floated down the last few meters, settling the ramp and rear wheels onto the hospital\u2019s helipad. The flat patch of rooftop was far too small to support the whole beast; the nose wheels hung out over the street below, where the shimmering air revealed tanks spewing forked tongues of fire in every direction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo sooner had the wheels touched down than black-clad figures began streaming down the ramp.

One of the figures approached him and gave a sharp salute, its bug-like black helmet seeming to fold in on itself to reveal a face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s not necessary, Colonel,\u201D Heywood waved it away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COld habits die hard, sir,\u201D the other kerb said, then proffered a flight helmet with attached oxygen mask, \u201CGeneral Kerman on a secure line for you, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCan it wait?\u201D annoyance was plain in Heywood\u2019s voice, \u201Cwe don\u2019t have long before the generators give out\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSays it\u2019s important, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeywood nodded, donning the helmet and strapping the mask across his face, the cool flow of bottled oxygen pushing back the parching heat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe touched a button on the side, \u201CGeneral Kerman, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHeywood,\u201D a voice clicked in his ears, \u201Chow are you doing, son?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs well as can be expected, sir.

Heywood out,\u201D he touched the button again, and nodded to the Colonel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright, fall in, ladies,\u201D the Colonel\u2018s voice was barely above a whisper, yet rung clear over the thundering jet engines in Heywood\u2019s earphone, \u201Cthis kerb knows what he\u2019s talking about, so listen up.\u201D Most of the squad of what seemed like living shadows gathered in front of Heywood and the yawning elevator doors.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe eyed them a moment, \u201Cthis is a high value extraction. The target is two floors down in the isolation ward. What you will see in there is unlike anything you ever have before. These are not monsters, they\u2019re \u003Cem\u003Epeople\u003C/em\u003E; but they\u2019re sick and not in full possession of their faculties. So do what you need to. Aim for the head, it\u2019s the only thing that seems to make them stay down.\u201D He nodded back to the Colonel, who handed him a holstered sidearm before turning to the elevator.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBlue team, stairwell,\u201D the Colonel pointed as his helmet unfolded over his face again, \u201Cred team, with me. Let\u2019s keep this high and tight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe figures flowed out across the rooftop, half of them draining down the stairs. Heywood followed the Colonel into the elevator with the other half and disappeared. For a time, nothing moved above save for the embers kicked up by the raging firestorm, and the writhing shadows it cast.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen all at once, the rooftop became a fury of motion and martial ballet. Before the elevator doors had even fully opened, two of the black-armored figures charged out, crossing the distance to the transport\u2019s loading ramp in an instant to take positions on either side. More followed, surrounding Heywood as he pushed a large metal cylinder on a gurney out the doors and up the ramp without slowing. The stairwell door flew open with a bang, one figure crouching down to hold it. The rest of the team filed out at a run. The last kerb in the line came out backwards, guided and pulled along by the one ahead of him, unleashing a steady stream of tripleted bursts back into the doorway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ERat-tat-tat!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ERat-tat-tat!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ERat-tat-tat!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey, too, disappeared up the ramp.

One by one, the specters fell. But for each that did, two more appeared in its place in an unending stream of burning misery.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last two guards turned away from the hideous sight, retreating back up the ramp, and a \u003Cem\u003Enew\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0sound split the ruinous night.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EKa-chunk!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EKa-chunk!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EKa-chunk!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s engines roared with new fury as it rose from the rooftop. The autocannon in a turret under the tail first leveled the stairwell housing, sending flaming debris in all directions, then cratered it, then set the whole rooftop aflame. The last building in the forsaken city now burning, the transport turned away, and disappeared into the night.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe helmet and mask clattered to the floor. Heywood collapsed into one of the canvas jumpseats lining the wall, coughing profusely and wiping the sweat from his face with a corner of his lab coat. The Colonel sat down too, just a distance away. His helmet folded down into itself, becoming little more than a black half-ring at the back of his head.\u00A0 In the small, round window between them, the orange glow was already receding away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActivity in the cargo bay was slowly subsiding. Rifles were made safe and clicked into racks, packs were stowed, and more helmets \u003Cem\u003Esnick\u003C/em\u003Eed down to near nothingness, revealing very normal faces. Normal, but cut from stone. Conversation among the cadre of kerbelles was as practiced as their movements: understated, nothing wasted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Colonel nodded and touched his earpiece, \u201C\u003Cem\u003EOrpheus\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0has crossed the Styx,\u201D then turned to Heywood, who was still hacking, \u201Cyou should get checked out, sir.\u201D He nodded to a nearby medic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeywood waved her away as she approached, \u201CI\u2019m fine, just the smoke.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Colonel raised an eye... bulge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI really am.

Bad as I\u2019ve ever seen it. Makes that business in Andacania a few years back look like a sunny stroll through the park. Good people down there, all of them, but\u2014\u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft suddenly lurched sideways, banging Heywood\u2019s head against the wall. All around, faces looked up from whatever they were doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Corporal just chuckled, \u201Cturbulence. The offshore flow coming down from the mountains tends to pick up all sorts of eddies.

With the other hand, he tugged his lab coat tighter against a wash of chills that ran through him. He pulled himself up with a sigh, \u201Cdo you have a secure data terminal on board?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Corporal pointed to a screen mounted in a little cubby in the forward bulkhead. Heywood made his way there, sure to keep a firm handhold on whatever he could as the aircraft swayed and bounced. He retrieved a thumb drive from his pocket, plugged it into the port and began typing. He could feel the Colonel standing behind him, pointedly \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0looking at the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CData from the hospital\u2019s lab,\u201D Heywood offered, \u201Cwe\u2019ve still got one more chance to pull ourselves out of this mess.\u201D He moved to the large metallic cylinder in the center of the bay, stumbling a bit as the floor seemed to drop out from beneath him for a moment. The Colonel followed along, taking the little jolts in stride. Opening a cover panel, Heywood checked over the instruments inside, one of which registered a faint heartbeat. Just above that, the display read: \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003EKERMAN, DILFORD.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSeems like an awful lot of fuss for one person, sir,\u201D the Colonel mused.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt is,\u201D Heywood agreed, \u201Che\u2019s our last, best hope.

Maybe even\u2014\u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was tossed across the bay, landing hard against the opposite wall by another bout of turbulence.

It\u2019s a short flight, but you may want to buckle in anyway.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeywood nodded, rubbing at the dark bruise that was already forming on his cheek. He reached around to fiddle with the seat harness.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood thing we\u2019re not on a V-38,\u201D the Colonel said as he started up the short ladder to the flight deck, \u201Cthose little things \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0get tossed\u2014 \u003Cem\u003Ewhat the hells!?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe pulled his bare hand away from the top rung, trailing long strings of slimy black goo.

Around that table sat several people, all of whom looked far too green. Ties hung from unbuttoned collars, and suit jackets lay forgotten in one empty chair. The near wall bore an immense display surrounded by many smaller ones, and on that display was a map. An irregular, boxy, vaguely rectangular shape in the middle represented perhaps a small city, or a large town. Centered on that rectangle, barely containing it, was a broken, incomplete circle. Concentric circles spanned out from that one; the next, complete, but with bulbous, organic blobs crammed in sporadic lumps around its inner edge. Between this circle and the next were many blue icons, each marked with several numbers. The blue icons continued beyond the third circle, where they became mingled with green boxes, each of these marked with a single, large number.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe final circle surrounded everything on the map by a wide margin. It was very thick, and very red.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGeneral Kerman approached the table, and leaned on it with both fists, \u201Cgentlekerbs... we are running out of options.\u201D The others around the table studied its surface a moment longer.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThere... there \u003Cem\u003Ehas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to be another way...\u201D the Science Advisor said at length.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIf you have one, Professor,\u201D the General said softly, \u201Cnow is the time.\u201D The other kerb seemed to shrink in on himself a bit.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe spent a fortune modifying those tanks on such short notice,\u0022 the Chair of the Joint Chiefs began, \u201Cwhat\u2019s changed? Why have they lost effectiveness?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe General nodded, moving back to the enormous screen. He gestured before it, and images shifted and changed by his hand. The display zoomed in to one of the amorphous blobs pressing against a circle, showing a dozen more blue icons within the mass, each covered with an X.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThere\u2019s too many of them, sir,\u201D he pointed, \u201Cour tanks are being overwhelmed.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Intelligence Director scoffed, \u201Chow can mindless, barely mobile invalids stop a 1500-horsepower gas turbine pushing a sixty tonne tank wielding the world\u2019s largest flame thrower, General?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe General eyed him a moment, then waved at the screen. A smaller video image appeared.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDrone footage from earlier, as we were trying to withdraw our last units behind beta perimeter and got bogged down. Yankee company from the 19th Cavalry Regiment disobeyed a direct order and charged the oncoming hoard, buying the infantry time to get behind the wall.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe video began to play, a rock-steady view from above as the dozen tanks sprinted forward. As wall of steel and fire, they turned night into day, raging like dragons from the very bowels of the world. This wall slammed against something that looked like mud in the hellish glow, splattering it backwards and setting it aflame. But the mud... kept coming. The tanks slowed, first one and then another, and then ground to a halt. Wave after wave of writhing, inky darkness, like shadow made flesh, washed over them. The fire belching from their turrets dwindled to nothing. For a moment the screen went black, then returned with an eerie green cast, showing something that was definitely \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0mud squirming and flowing over huge, formless lumps where the tanks had been. The picture winked out.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis was the first incident,\u201D the General explained, \u201Cmore followed. With such a fluid situation, the significance was not immediately clear.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut still,\u201D the Director prodded, looking unwell, \u201C\u003Cem\u003Ehow?\u003C/em\u003E\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGeneral Kerman flicked at the screen, the video returning and zooming in to carnage beyond measure, \u201Cdozens, \u003Cem\u003Ehundreds\u003C/em\u003E, clogging the treads... the intakes... the radiators... Like honeybees suffocating a hornet.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Director\u2019s eyes grew wide, \u201Cthat looks like a directed response... do you mean to say they\u2019re showing some sort of collective intelligence?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003EI\u2019m\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0not the scientist,\u201D the General looked at the Science Advisor... then cleared his throat loudly.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHuh? Oh,\u201D the lab-coated kerb swallowed hard, \u201Cwe can\u2019t say definitively. According to our research team embedded at the hospital, the infected never showed any outward sign of advanced brain function, although EEG\u2019s did resemble greatly stressed but otherwise normal activity. For all we know, this behavior could be a simple ingrained response to outside stimuli. We never could determine what attracted them to living people, they never\u2014\u201C he paused to swallow again, \u201Cthey never actually \u003Cem\u003Eharmed\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0anyone, not directly, just... pawed at them... with those eyes...\u201D he ended with a shudder.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHow long can we hold out?\u201D the Directed squeezed his eyes shut, rubbing at the wide space between them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGeneral Kerman shared a glance with the Chair, then shook his head, \u201Chours. Midday at most. The infected are pressing against the wall wherever we try to reinforce it, piling on top of each other. We have to pull back and keep moving or risk them overtopping it. The troops are exhausted. Air strikes had only limited effectiveness to begin with, but we can\u2019t even use precision munitions with them pressed against the wall like they are. Once beta perimeter is breached we have plans for a stepped withdrawal behind gamma perimeter, but none of the commanders in the field give that much hope. Gamma won\u2019t last long, we\u2019re stretched thin enough as it is.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe leaned down on the table again, \u201Cgentlekerbs, at this point we can only conclude that secondary sanitation protocol has failed, and the time has come to activate primary protocol.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat you\u2019re advocating is unprecedented!\u201D the Director snapped, \u201C\u003Cem\u003Ewe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0only made those devices because \u003Cem\u003Ethey\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0made them! \u003Cem\u003EThey\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0only made them because someone \u003Cem\u003Eelse\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0did, and someone \u003Cem\u003Eelse\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0only made them to see if they could! No one ever thought they\u2019d be \u003Cem\u003Eused\u003C/em\u003E...\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat if it doesn\u2019t work at all?\u201D the Advisor broke in, \u201Cthe device has never been tested at this yield. If it fizzles\u2014\u201C\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThen we\u2019re back in the same situation we already are,\u201D the Chair answered, \u201Cwe\u2019ve been over the risks of trying a lower yield detonation. Anything less is unlikely to provide a wide enough thermal radius to neutralize the toxin.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Director seemed to think on this a moment, \u201Ccould we make it worse? Professor, is there \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0indication the toxin is airborne?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D the Advisor shook his head, \u201Cit can only be spread through direct contact. And any exposure to temperatures above 300C denatures it instantly. That\u2019s about the \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0thing we\u2019re certain of.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNods, and mumbles around the table. More flipping through notes and tapping at tablets. Then the Professor spoke up again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat about other civilian exposure?\u201D he asked.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWinds are favorable, at the moment,\u201D General Kerman flicked at the map, \u201Cblowing southeast. They should carry any residual fallout out to sea. But they could shift at any time.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat wasn\u2019t what I meant,\u201D the Advisor cringed, \u201CWhat about the press, internet...?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe National Intelligence Director cringed in turn, \u201Cwe\u2019ve been able to keep a lid on the domestic press, for the most part. Foul and disrupt social media feeds, slow any international exchanges, feed the right information to the wrong sources and vice-versa. Keep it muddled. People know something significant is going on, but they don\u2019t know \u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E,\u201D he tapped his pen irritably on the table, \u201Cexcept across the border in Nefcarkaland. Somehow, word got out through Blabber about a \u2018supervirus,\u2019 and\u2014\u201D he winced, \u201C\u2014zombies.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut... but that\u2019s not right at \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E...\u201D the Advisor pleaded.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Director waved him off, \u201Cwe\u2019re getting reports of growing civil unrest in some of their cities near the border, and\u2014\u201C his expression darkened as the Secretary of State now approached the table, talking into his phone.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI know sir, I understand that,\u201D he was saying, \u201CMister Ambassador, you\u2019re backing us into a corner here and setting a very troubling precedent, if you would only... I understand the difficulty of your position, but you\u2019re not leaving us... that is a matter for our concern and... yes, sir... yes, sir... very well, I will relay that.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Secretary sat down with a grunt, and fixed everyone at the table with a hard stare, \u201Cwe have a new complication.\u201D He took a moment to blot at his head with a handkerchief, tossed his coat on the chair, \u201Cthe Nefcarkalandern are getting restless. They believe their own situation is already deteriorating, and are no longer willing to sit idly by while we discuss this matter in a committee,\u201D just the slightest roll of his eyes, \u201Cthey\u2019ve given us an ultimatum: we have until dawn to take decisive and \u003Cem\u003Efinal\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0action... or they will.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s madness!\u201D the Director snorted, \u201Ctheir stockpile isn\u2019t as advanced as ours, they don\u2019t have anything \u003Cem\u003Enearly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0powerful enough to sanitize the entire\u2014\u201C He cut off, as his eyes grew wide in realization.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Advisor\u2019s head whipped back and forth, \u201Cbut... we\u2019ve never had any quarrel with Nefcarkaland... they\u2019re signatories to the KSA treaty, they\u2019re... they\u2019re our \u003Cem\u003Efriends!\u003C/em\u003E\u201D his own eyes didn\u2019t seem to find any answers, \u201Cthat would start a war...\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D the Chair said softly, \u201Cit wouldn\u2019t.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHe\u2019s right,\u201D General Kerman nodded, \u201Ca war requires \u003Cem\u003Etwo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0belligerents.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI...

Thousands of infected would survive, maybe more. Hemmed in from the north, by the mountains to the west, and the sea to the east, they\u2019d have only one way to go.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSouth.

That\u2019s upwards of fifty million people who just got wind that a horde of movie monsters is coming for them. Riots have broken out here in Spl\u00F8tsb\u00F8rgen and Tr\u00F8ndh\u00F8lm already, demanding that their government \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0something. \u003Cem\u003EWhat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0doesn\u2019t really matter at this point.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcuse me, General, sirs,\u201D the watch officer returned, one hand covering his headset mic, \u201CAWACS is reporting sixteen contacts taking off from Spl\u00F8tsb\u00F8rgen Air Base.

She wishes me to convey that the United Federal People\u2019s Democratic Kingdom of Omork, as ever, stands by its oldest and most trusted ally, the Republic of Kleptogart, and that she will spare no effort in assisting the Kleptogarti people in any way it is required. However, Her Majesty can see no benefit to the Kleptogarti people in pressing their interests against a sovereign power in their stead, should they suddenly find themselves unable to do so.

He stood with his back straight, shoulders up, taking a moment to straighten a tie that did not need straightening. He fixed every kerb at the table with a long stare before speaking.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMay whatever good is left in this world have mercy on us all,\u201D he said with a voice full of power and regret, \u201CGeneral Kerman, I order you to deploy with all haste.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n***\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA short time later, over what had once been a quiet, unremarkable town at the edge of anyone\u2019s concern, the dawn broke twice.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe dawn has moved on, leaning only dusk.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA harsh wind roars across a cracked, crumbling expanse of nothing, dried and dead, every last trace of moisture gone. It kicks up gritty, alkaline dust, scouring the surface, shrouding the land in a sickly, yellow haze. Through this haze walks a figure, clad all in black, hunched over against the relentless wind.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIts hands are bandaged, its legs wrapped in rags, leaving nothing exposed to the abrasive torrent around it. What might once have been a gas mask covers its eyes, the rubber cracked, the dark lenses scratched to near opacity. With one hand the figure holds its ragged cloak across the rest of its face. Its head is always bowed, studying the tortured ground as it lurches onward, never looking up. No, to look up is to know madness.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI want to cry... but I can\u0027t...\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the dark figure trudges along, a great form looms out of the roiling sepia cloud. The figure approaches, unperturbed, and pauses before the enormous bulk rising out of the ruined land. Here, someone has cut a hole in the hull of the ancient fishing trawler. A torn square of cloth whips in the wind, half covering it. A pathetic patch of ground nearby has been scraped up, a few dried brown stalks of some stringy plant still stand, slowly being eroded by the unceasing gale. For a long time, the figure only stares, clutching its cloak against the maelstrom. It moves to brush the scrap of cloth aside, but the wind tears it from its mounts, and it disappears off into the torrent.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nInside, the howl is left a muted wail. Shafts of dim light from rusted holes illuminate the dust hanging in the air. All around are the cast off detritus of a waning world. The figure bends, reaching for an object on the ground. It is a tiny doll, cobbled together from whatever was to be found. The moment the figure lifts it, it crumbles away.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI want to cry... but I can\u0027t...\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe figure moves on into the next room, and there he sees. Two skeletons huddle on the floor, cradling another, much smaller, its features twisted and deformed. Even here, in this dying place, some had clung to hope until the last bitter breath. The figure looks on a moment longer before turning away.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOutside, the wind rages louder than ever before. The figure trembles and slowly falls to its knees. Above, there is no sky. The sky has been gone since the day it receded, rolled up like a scroll; when the sun became as dark as sackcloth, the M\u00FCn became as blood, and the stars fell like rain. Above, there are only roiling clouds, red and angry. Snaking through them, twisting and churning, dominating what had once been the sky...\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is formless, yet it has form. Soundless, yet it has sound. Arm-claw-tentacle-appendage-\u003Cem\u003Ethings\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0jut from its not-flanks randomly, always shifting, changing.

Below the tattered remains of what might once have been a gas mask, there is only the weathered, desiccated jaw of a skull.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI want to cry... but I can\u0027t...\u003Cbr\u003E\nI want to die... but I can\u0027t...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI thought I was doing the right thing...\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdgas jerked upright, a scream on his lips, cracking his head on the shelf above his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003Ecot\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.

His breath puffed out into billowing clouds of mist, lit by a sunbeam in the dark room.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis eyes shot open.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENot right... that\u2019s not right...\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPanic began to rise again as he spun to his small window. There, he caught a last glimpse of the sun... as it disappeared below the rim of the crater, condemning the land once more to the long M\u00FCnar night.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn an instant, the air was ripped from his aching lungs.

He could feel the moisture on his tongue begin to boil.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI AM A PART OF YOU. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF YOU.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdgas flailed, helpless, tightness closing in around his face.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYOU SAW, BUT YOU HAVE NOT \u003Cem\u003ESEEN\u003C/em\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis heartbeat thundered in his ears.

His chest clenched and his throat spasmed, his lungs unsure whether to gasp or gag. He lurched from his bed, stumbling across the small space, flicking on every light he could in near madness. Finally he came to his little sink and heaved, producing only few bitter drops, sure he could feel the alkaline grit in them.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe clung there, panting, waiting for the tremors to work their way from his arms. In his reflection, his eyes were wide with terror yet still drooping from exhaustion.

Edgas shrugged and pulled the hatch open.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe hangar was, of course, cold. But the reverent stillness was broken by the growing drone of approaching turboprop engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIs that an... air lock?\u201D she seemed to test the words as she spoke them, pointing to what looked like a small room built into the corner.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGood eye,\u201D Edgas nodded, \u201Cslightly overkill but it came with the structure. Plus, it keeps us from having to open the main doors in bad weather like this.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven as he spoke, the drone outside grew louder and louder until it was a great, rumbling shriek. The walls themselves began to rattle and groan, the ice particles floating in the air to dance. Then... just as quickly as it rose, the sound flared for a moment before rapidly fading.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nStillness returned to the hangar, the only sound now the distant howling of the wind. Yet it only lasted a few moments. One by one, the lights on the airlock began to blink on and off in sequence. There was an empty rushing, and the doors slid open spilling out fog and snow.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor... just a moment, Edgas was certain he could hear the bassy opening notes of an imperious march, and then...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKawwwwwwwwww... pahhhhhhh...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKawwwwwwwwww... pahhhhhhh...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKawwwwwwwwww... pahhhhhhh...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA towering, dark figure materialized out of the roiling cloud, its breathing labored and mechanical. It wore a cloak, black as night, over a suit of steel and plastic that seemed to draw in and capture the very light of the dim space. On its head, a great helm that glinted in the darkness covered a mask with huge, condemning eyes and a perpetual scowl.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKawwwwwwwwww... pahhhhhhh...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKawwwwwwwwww... pahhhhhhh...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKawwwwwwwwww... pahhhhhhh...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdgas\u2019s nervous smile faded as the figure stalked up to him in a stiff, almost robotic gait. Its synthesized voice rumbled with an incredibly, almost impossibly deep tone.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKawwwww... \u201Cdo you have \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0idea... how cold it is out there?\u201D Pahhhhhh...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdgas glanced at the display on the wall, \u201Cforty below.\u201D He offered another nervous smile.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CForty.\u201D Kawwwww... \u201CBelow.\u201D Pahhhhh...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe thought for a moment, \u201Cseventy, with the windchill?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSeventy.\u201D Kawwwww... Pahhhhhh...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe dark figure raised an open hand as if to choke him, and for just a moment, Edgas could swear he felt his throat clench.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIf you were any other kerb,\u201D kaww... pah... \u201CI would kill you where you stand.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdgas stood... just a bit farther back.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe menacing newcomer didn\u2019t seem to notice, instead looking up at something... far away, stretching its upraised hand out as if seeing it all over again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI was on a beach in Ponp\u00EDn,\u201D kawwww... \u201Cflawless black sand, crystal turquoise water as far as the eye could see,\u201D pahhhhh....\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt then stared at both hands, its face somehow drawn with regret despite the mask.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI had a drink in one hand...\u201D kawwww... \u201Ca barmaid in the other...\u201D pahhhhh... \u201Cit was... paradise.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt thrust a gloved finger in Edgas\u2019s face, \u201Cthis... had better... be worth it.\u201D Kawww... pahhhh...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe figure stepped back, reaching for its helm. Latches released with a hiss of escaping air. It raised the helm up, then with a clatter of clicks and clunks, the suit seemed to fold in upon itself, peeling back to reveal... someone very different.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe stepped down out of it, offering a hand, \u201Cits good to see you again, Edgas,\u201D the handshake quickly became a hug with lots of back-slapping, \u201Cbut wow, you look like crap.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou haven\u2019t changed a bit, Burdous,\u201D Edgas grinned, \u201Chow long has it been?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CToo long,\u201D Burdous Kerman grinned back.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo, um...\u201D Edgas pointed at the empty suit that now seemed to be standing there all on its own, pulling its own head off, \u201Cwhat\u2019s with that?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPrototype environmental exposure suit for the next Laythe polar expedition.

This is the 37th time I have spoken to you from this office, where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this Republic. The events that have transpired these last few weeks will, no doubt, be remembered as such that have shaped not only our own history but the very course of Kerbal events. The last few days, especially, have been a time of division and anger here in our great Republic. This Administration was elected on a promise of transparency, and with that promise in mind, as one of my predecessors so famously said, the buck stops here.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThese are the facts as they stand, as of this livestream. Several weeks ago, a single individual contracted a previously unencountered pathogen through a still unknown vector. In seeking medical attention, the pathogen was spread to several others at the local health clinic. The illness was contained, for a time, at the County General Hospital, at which point research into a treatment began. It was here that the unprecedented virulence of the pathogen was finally grasped, that it could be spread person to person from the slightest physical contact, with the newly infected victim succumbing to dementia and incapacitation within only moments. Due to an error in containment protocols at the hospital, the pathogen escaped quarantine, and the infection began to spread into the city at large.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAt this point, upon my orders, a plan was put into action that had been crafted some time ago by Doctor Heywood Kerman. A former Army Colonel, infectious disease specialist at the Kleptogarti Center for Disease Control, and epidemiologist with the biomedical division of the Layland-Wutani Corporation, Dr. Kerman had spent his entire career analyzing the spread of disease and designing a multi-tiered response that could halt even the threat of a global pandemic, an extinction-level event. It was his determination early on that the F9H1 pathogen represented just such a threat, but due to a chain of events that this Administration now takes full responsibility for, his plan was not implemented until far later than it should have been. Possibly as a result of this delayed response, the infection escaped the initial quarantine zone, and threatened to break out beyond any hope of containment.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWith the global threat potential of this contagion now clear, it is at this time that I authorized the deployment of a 100\u00A0megaton nuclear weapon.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe resulting blast sterilized the area within 50 kilometers, neutralizing the toxin and eliminating the threat to our people and the world. Initial reports from the red zone confirm that no trace of the F9H1 pathogen has survived, but we must continue to remain vigilant. As such, I have ordered the evacuation and indefinite quarantine of all territory north of the 9th Parallel and east of the Kohio River. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe have been granted a reprieve, but as we all know, it has not come without great loss. These are the facts, as of this stream: 173,000 souls were known to be in the immediate vicinity of the blast, and are presumed deceased. \u00A0\u00A0\u00A031,612 have succumbed to injuries sustained, or are otherwise confirmed dead. Seventeen thousand, two hundred and thirty are currently listed as injured, and are receiving treatment at facilities across the region. These numbers are not yet complete, and are expected to rise as new information continues to filter in. And... this does not include the dozens killed, and hundreds injured in the waves of demonstrations that have already threatened to tear our great Republic apart.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI wish to set the record straight on one matter in particular, one that has given much of the fuel to these disastrous gatherings. Throughout this difficult time, such as they have been made aware, our neighbors and friends, the United Federal People\u2019s Democratic Kingdom of Omork, and the Commonwealth of Nefcarkaland, have stood by us with unwavering support. There is absolutely no truth to the rumors that either nation was considering preemptive military action. The decisions that were made that have brought us to this crossroad remain mine, and mine alone.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMy friends, we as a nation and people are indeed at a crossroad, yet there is only one way that leads forward. The road ahead will be long and arduous, and it is a journey we cannot endure as a house divided. Centuries ago, our forefathers pledged to each other their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. This is a pledge I now ask each of you to renew, for we must all lean on one another if we are to weather what is to come. But first, we must have healing. We must mend the rifts that have threatened to drive us apart in this, our time of tribulation. Another of my predecessors once wisely counseled, \u2018ask what you can do for your country.\u2019 This is a question I have asked myself every morning since before my political career began.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWith that in mind, my own path down this road is clear. It is with a heavy, yet hopeful heart, that I announce that I shall resign the office of President of the Republic of Kleptogart, effective\u00A0at noon tomorrow. At that time, Vice President Kerman will take the oath of office on board the Executive Transport in Bhangkong, where he has been attending a trade summit in my stead.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt is my sincere hope that this action shall be the catalyst that will begin the process of healing and reconciliation in this, our great Republic. It is my sincere hope, that we can move forward together, as one people, and one nation, together with our friends beyond our borders, so that no one else in this world shall again have to suffer what we have suffered these past weeks. It is my sincere hope, with the threat to that world\u2019s very existence now quelled, that everyone within the sound of my voice may sleep soundly tonight, knowing that the situation is, at last, under control.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-02T06:59:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2021 06:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-15T06:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223268256\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162280\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221515995007\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257438\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CatastrophicFailure\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, CatastrophicFailure said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022[\u2026]the situation is, at last, under control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf all the things you could\u0027ve said\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
