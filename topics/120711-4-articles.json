Is it a semi-serious, light-hearted spaceflight simulator or is a cartooney disaster simulation where the protagonists build spaceships out of junk? I feel like Porkjet\u0027s parts, and a lot of the earlier parts (55-gallon drums notwithstanding), follow the former aesthetic while Roverdude\u0027s follow the later. Maybe that\u0027s just my interpretation. I prefer the clean lines and elegant feeling of the early antennas while the new ones feel and look really clunky, like they\u0027re just way too heavy to even attach to my roof for satellite TV. vOv I like the AIES interpretation of that particular antenna. Can\u0027t put my finger on it but it doesn\u0027t look like it\u0027s half-rusty. Spaceship parts are built in a cleanroom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd because that\u0027s a personal preference thing and because everyone is going to have a strong opinion one way or the other, I feel like any criticism of that sort will be ignored.
