In KSP-Interstellar, you have thermal turbojets. What they are is essentially air-augmented thermal rockets- they pull in air to produce additional thrust for the same amount of thermal power.

And the ability to operate utilizing both internal and external working mass at the same time would also help with operation in thin atmosphere (like Duna\u0027s upper atmosphere) where there *is* atmosphere around, but not nearly enough to run in a thermal turbojet off of or such...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a good idea though- I\u0027m going to go bug FractalUK to include it in KSP-Interstellar.

That is using the air, including nitrogen, as reaction mass. The Isp is about 1.75-1.8x higher because of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn air augmented rocket can still make use of that, even if it forgoes the oxidizer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n350s for the best LFO engine would become a 625s LFO engine with air augmentation... using the same ratios.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut KSP jet engines are too efficient. The rapier getting 3,200 Isp, when the real J-58 ramjet gets ~2,100 Isp? meanwhile the ramjet gets 4,000 Isp... basically double what the real life J-58 gets (not to mention that they get a whole lot closer to orbital velocity than the SR-71 ever did).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause KSP engines are rougly twice as efficient as they should be, for this air augmented rocket, I\u0027d make it twice as efficient in the atmosphere as it should be, to keep it \u0022balanced\u0022 against the airbreathing engines that only work in O2 atmospheres... hence arriving at a 1,200 m/s sea level Isp instead of 625...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MatttheCzar","CreatedById":135304,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T03:32:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about splitting it in the middle and making it 912 seconds? \u00A0It seems more balanced that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbonautInTraining","CreatedById":145373,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T15:01:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMay or may not be worth mentioning this topic was started in 2014....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T14:13:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it came up when someone made another thread about wanting some jet engine that works in Duna/Eve atmospheres, and I mentioned that he didn\u0027t need all these werid fuel types he was proposing (alkalaine fuels, or magnesium fuels... whatever), that an air augmented rocket would likely give him something like what he wanted. I said I had brought it up multiple times before on these forums, and linked to 2 threads, 1 of which was this one... which then seemed to get a necro\u0027d.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway... I made a new version of my .cfg for an air augmented rocket:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/eojo85ycjbpkk5w/jetEngineTurboRamRocket.cfg?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/eojo85ycjbpkk5w/jetEngineTurboRamRocket.cfg?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrop it in the jet engines folder where the turboramjet is located.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause ramjets produce 0 static thrust, but ramrockets do, I wanted static thrust. A ramrocket has no thrust augmentation when static... that doesn\u0027t start to happen until a similar regime to where a ramjet would work. So a static ramrocket would produce thrust, but not have any higher Isp than a normal chemical rocket. We can get around this with a turbine compressor... much like a turboramjet (as used on the SR-71) mainly I renamed it to a turboramrocket because we can\u0027t scale Isp with mach number in KSP. (a turboramrocket is also possible, so I went with it)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I added a spin up/down time, and the thrust increases at higher machs... but the spin up/down is not what you want in an orbital engine... so I added two modes liek the rapier... atmospheric/turbine mode, which has the thrust augmentation from higher machs and spin up/spindown time, and a vacuum mode with instant throttle like other LFO rocket engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I think the loss of thrust augmentation wasn\u0027t enough of a penalty to using vacuum mode in an atmosphere, so its atmospheric Isp is worse too.. it actually has a nerfed Is Isp curve that I was considering using for atmospheric mode... in which its Isp is only 750 at kerbi n sea level (but in the 900s at Eve sea level)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T14:46:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222497477\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002274205\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459913551\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022135304\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MatttheCzar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/6/2016 at 5:32 AM, MatttheCzar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about splitting it in the middle and making it 912 seconds? \u00A0It seems more balanced that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I\u0027d point out that the SR-71 was getting that 75-80% \u0022bonus\u0022 at some pretty high altitudes. Ideally the Isp would be a product of air density and airspeed... ie total airflow, but I can\u0027t scale Isp that way. By the time one gets high in the atmosphere, the Isp, as by my .cfg, isn\u0027t soo high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 10km, its only about 1000 s, by 15km, its about 800s, at 20km... its under 600... turboramjets are still operating fairly well at 20km (and rapiers are doing even better)... so lets say this is equivalent to the SR-71s operational altitude... getting about 1.8x Isp relative to kerosene with \u0022free\u0022 O2 in a vacuum... so... take 350(best LFO engine vacuum states).. * 1.8 = 630... it seems not only about right to me at that point... but even realistic. The low altitude Isps are too high to be \u0022realistic\u0022... but keeping with wanting this to be more like the airbreathing engines (just with oxidizer as an additional input), it seems right to me for balance... but maybe you\u0027re right.. after all, I did make an Isp curve nerfing it even harder, down to 750 - but that may be too rough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 1200s Isp at 1 atm, and 1,600s Isp at 5 atm seems to be right about at the border for allowing an Eve SSTO from sea level... which is about where I wanted it.... but it may be too far on the side of \u0022possible\u0022 and should maybe move closer to the side of \u0022impossible\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if Eve sea level SSTO remains impossible, 1600s Isp is great for cruising around Eve... I also tried to balance it against the nuke on Duna... at the lowest spot on Duna, its Isp is about equal to a LV-N (with better TWR)... By 3km, the LV-N does better. By 17-18km, the poodle does better. A lot of duna is over 3km, so aside from flying low over lowlands, one may want to use the LV-N as a sustainer engine for flying\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angeltxilon","CreatedById":149432,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T14:49:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-07T14:52:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2016 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Angeltxilon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
