The part with the highest recycling percentage sets the cap for all other parts if they are stacked. So, if you have one RT-5000, you can provide 79% recycling for as many kerbals as you want to have on a vessel as long as you spam cheaper, less efficient recyclers. Once you have one RT-5000, for every 2 kerbals above the 3 supported by the recycler itself, you only need 3 RT-500s to get them to the same 79%. So the EC investment for the first 3 kerbals is high (18.5 EC/s) but every 2 kerbals after that only require 1.5 EC/s.\n\nOn a slightly related topic, the 79% recycler rate is pretty high. It\u0027s the highest in base \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS, and if I am remembering correctly, the only parts in MKS with higher recycler values are the Tundra Kerbitats which use way more EC for slightly higher values (81% and 83%, I believe) or way more EC AND Water to get even higher values (~93% I think?) All in all, I think the RT-5000 has its uses, you just need to figure out if it is worth the investment in EC production for the extra recycling efficiency. The more kerbals you have, the more attractive it starts to look."},{"CreatedByName":"jd284","CreatedById":139444,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-16T22:50:55Z","Content":"The RT-5000 is also the most massive per kerbal supported of any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E recycling part including the kerbitats.

I made a quick video to show. to much supplies get used, when the ship is in the background (with enabled recyclers).\n\nOne more thing I\u0027ve noticed AFTER the video, the strange habitation calculation. All 3 Kerbals are in the Command pod, the ship has a hitchhiker storage container and three 1 person recyclers and 1500 supplies.\n\nSo things to notice in this video:  \n\n-the supply usage  of ~48/day instead of the announced ~20/day when the ship is in background  \n\n-the different habitation for all 3 kerbals (vals hab and hs is frozen in the first fast forward run)  \n\n-the EC time left \u0022jump\u0022 while the ship was in background\n\n\\*help\\* Anyone has an idea whats wrong? Exception monitoring is on, but there were no exceptions here, no red lines top right.\n\nEDIT: Just recognized, that my mic got muted as I was calculating, unfortunately. I was pointing out, that the ship in the background used ~48 supplies / day, which is the same was when the recyclers are shut off. However, they were online and had power. Just the ship was in the background.\n\n[@RoverDude](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/)   @all\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/754b1_DqI5I?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-21T02:52:40Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2017 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Jebs\\_SY**"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T03:12:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 hours ago, DStaal said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Basically: Give them room.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s lots of good info on this in the KSPedia entry (I believe), but I\u0027ll point you to the wiki page for the various habitation-specific parts in MKS:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/wiki/Functions%3A-Habitation](https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/wiki/Functions%3A-Habitation)\n\u003E \n\nThank you the wiki is what I needed.   Here I was thinking that there was going to be no way to establish perm. resident colonists, but sounds like I just need the right parts....\n\nLeads me into a suggestion though,  maybe the colonist kerbals (those you can hire with that rating), as I understand it right now they simply raise all the colony stats.  Maybe they could be \u0022buffed\u0022 a bit on the hab home times ?   IE if I\u0027m a kerbal colonist recruited, I\u0027m probably not looking to make a return to kerbin??   Not sure, it\u0027s a thought."}]}
