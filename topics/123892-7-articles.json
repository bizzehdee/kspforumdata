Though the problem now is actually that a craft that is on the bottom of the ocean floor might intentionally be there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tourist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tourist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like the mk1 cabins. I\u0027m going to use them for tunnels to connect spacestation/base modules...

I imagine submersibles will depend on how buoyant things end up being at the end of balancing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceNomad\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpaceNomad\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, they don\u0027t auto-cut when the craft is stable, but when the craft comes to a stop*. That\u0027s a subtle difference: What normally happens to me when I splashdown is that the craft comes down completely vertical, comes to its (first) stop in an upright position, the parachutes cut, and only then it slowly tips over. More often than not something breaks when the upper parts are hitting the water then.\u003Cp\u003E*) Can\u0027t tell if that\u0027s stock or Claw\u0027s bug fixes either as I have it installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is accurate. It\u0027s actually a combination of landed/splashed, and below a certain threshold speed. So if you land perfectly upright, the chute will cut. But that means if there\u0027s a little bit of wobble, it might cut (because of the low speed), before the thing falls over. Landing at a slight angle (when possible) does help with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, if you forget, the moment the chutes cut your ship should be recoverable. Get your mouse at the top of the screen and click like mad as soon as you see the button.\u003Cp\u003ESource: I\u0027ve totally done this on multiple occasions, even before chutes stayed open for longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the speeds are pretty closely aligned.
