This has become an exciting new challenge I never had to consider prior. While others are so obscure i had to make a rocket who\u0027s entire purpose was the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only gripe thus far is the way in which multiple contracts are listed. The small window does not have any ability to be modified that I can readily see. I can expand and minimize the objectives, but can not reorder, hide from list or change how it is viewed. It would be nice to see some more features with this toolbar for customization. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions I would be looking for:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Having the ability to reorder the contracts from top down, will help with missions where you need to pay attention to requirements for completion during lift and orbit where timing is important. So you can complete objectives in the order you expect them to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Complete missions have an option to hide from the list instead of just being labeled in green, or reorder to the bottom automatically. This would really help the first suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome features that would just be handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Being able to assign contracts to stages. Such as color code or some other indicator the stage has a contract attached to it. Having it indicate red/green ready status to pass the contract would be nice feature. as so far many contracts require staging to trigger the complete status.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Not always requiring staging to complete. sometimes the test might be for a part such as a rocket burn at an altitude. Bringing the rocket up to the required altitude and burning is not enough if you have already started the rocket prior to the requirements. Inserting a stage and dropping fuel just to complete the \u0022stage\u0022 requirements seems a bit wasteful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe I\u0027m just trying to cram too much purpose into one launch. I was using contracts like a flight plan to accommodate as many companies as I can during the launch as possible, similar to a real space agency. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really enjoy the update and the game as a hole. Thank you for delivering such a wonderful product.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
