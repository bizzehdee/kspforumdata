I will miss it but the reason why it is very important for it to stay is because of those little bulges on the sides. While some may see it as a nuisance they have been very helpful in helping me design my aircraft. I am fairly certain they will go away with the new cockpit. (It\u0027s complicated but it will actually impact my designs (using rotation and offset may make up for it but it would take out a lot of ifs and tests if I could just keep it like it is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t ecxpect them to keep the current one as an alternative as that is not their style. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way for me to keep that part?
