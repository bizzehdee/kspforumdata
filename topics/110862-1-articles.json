The way I see it is a Space Camp type strategy in which your program inspires a love of aerospace in the general population, which makes them more willing to \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Esacrifice themselves\u003C/span\u003E participate in the space program. The Space Camp costs a lot of Funds to maintain, but it saves you funds in the long run if you hire an unnecessary amount of Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe opposite of this could be something to the effect of the Mercury Seven, where your small team of elite Kerbonauts are made public icons, earning you money for their fame but raising costs of hiring new, lesser-known staff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, is it even possible to add something like this? It would involve adding a new result for the EFFECT module in the config file, but since I have zero experience with C# I can\u0027t really look into it much myself. I welcome anyone\u0027s thoughts on the idea and its possibility (or lack thereof), and if someone wants to attempt it I would be happy to assist in any way (I can do the configuring, just not the programming).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
