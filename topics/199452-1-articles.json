I know they don\u0027t work like the normal engines so TCA doesn\u0027t see them. Does anyone know how to edit the files Airplane Plus files so TCA can work with them? Or does anyone know of helicopter engine mods that work with TCA? Many thanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Gibby\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
