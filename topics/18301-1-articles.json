It\u0027d be nice if we could choose which point the capsule snaps to, because after I\u0027d finished building the ring, it became impossible to move the pod to a different point on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/797/screenshot6sr.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/797/screenshot6sr.th.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot6sr.th.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here\u0027s some proof that I managed to put it into orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/2153/screenshot10yj.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/2153/screenshot10yj.th.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot10yj.th.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/8499/screenshot12en.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/8499/screenshot12en.th.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot12en.th.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/9270/screenshot17d.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/9270/screenshot17d.th.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot17d.th.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/4972/screenshot16b.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/4972/screenshot16b.th.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot16b.th.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe warned though, my PC is a new build, and I was getting about 1 FPS throughout the launch. You need to throttle up to about 65% before ignition, and leave it there, because it\u0027s unlikely you\u0027ll get chance to adjust it with the FPS issues. Make sure to engage the SAS before launch as well. On a few launches, the whole assembly decided to violently dismantle itself before ignition, so you might need to fiddle with the gantry height and move it away from the pad. I found that if the capsule is touching the VAB ceiling, it\u0027s probably not going to throw a tantrum on the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll parts are vanilla btw.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-31T20:23:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2012 08:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Narcosis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exelcior_esp","CreatedById":37004,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-31T19:48:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat looks AMAZINCREDIBLE!! if my PC was not a crap, i will try it and launch it.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit renember me to m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn station epsilon....
