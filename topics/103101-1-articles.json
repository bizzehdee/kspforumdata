Some cargo actually has to go to a destination in the middle of cities. Last mile delivery is best served by small vehicles with lots of flexibility (i.e. trucks), unless there\u0027s a *lot* of cargo going to one place, in which case a better facility makes sense. Most cargo is not time-sensitive, so you can have huge advantages by making most of the trip happen over highly efficient bulk modes (trains, ships) using intermodal containers. Any attempt to make a \u0022balanced\u0022 one will be worse at just about every task compared to a more specialized thing. The aeroscraft is utterly awful at last-mile delivery, because you need to land it somewhere (and good luck doing fast loading/unloading without infrastructure; it\u0027s simply not possible with any mode of transportation).

Smaller aircraft can handle small quantities of goods extremely quickly, but can\u0027t do capacity. Ships reign supreme for capacity per dollar. Freight rail (which can handle *thousands* of tons per train) is great for getting lots of not-time-sensitive cargo to a place near its destination, or (with heavy infrastructure, but lighter than an airport) to its destination. Trucks are flexible and suitable for last-mile, but have low capacity (need one driver per container).

That\u0027s because, as I mentioned, the idea of the \u0022ultimate\u0022 freight carrier is meaningless -- there\u0027s nothing that\u0027s best in all cases. Ships dominate for cheap high-capacity travel where the need to go on water doesn\u0027t impose too high a detour on the path (even if you could go via land, a ship can still be better for very large cargo; that\u0027s how NASA ships its largest rocket parts). Ports are not cheap, but they serve enormous cargo loads, and you don\u0027t really need that many of them (since you aren\u0027t delivering directly to the destination, the ship is only one step in the pathway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for transferring cargo: In most cases an aeroscraft would also have to transfer cargo to land transport (as you mentioned). However, transferring cargo is one of the things that ships and trucks and trains *excel* at: if you don\u0027t support intermodal containers and aren\u0027t carrying a single kind of bulk cargo (like oil carriers or car carriers), your transport method isn\u0027t even worth talking about for cheap mass freight. The challenge for aircraft (including this) is that intermodal containers don\u0027t tend to play nicely with them. 40-foot intermodal containers tend to way between 20 and 30 tons (max weight is 30.5t), which means you can\u0027t take very many of them on your craft (and note that a 40-foot container weighs 4 tons empty, so if you load them lightly then the weight of the containers is a significant fraction of cargo weight). Compare to a train, which can handle 1 or 2 40-foot containers per car, or a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I share your opinion but why you think is so awfull to load or unload cargo without infrastructure?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome models of aeroscrafts are designed to have their own bridge crane system to select and grab containers and place them on the ground without the need to land, some others had a similar system but with a ramp to load/unload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou may be able to load or unload container directly to trucks without external infrastructure.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason is that cargo is heavy, and you need to deal with it after unloading or before loading.

It\u0027s hard to make generalizations, though, because airships are just like airplanes when it comes to safety: an ultralight plane is less safe in inclement weather and crash situations than a 747. In the same way, some hot airships are blown backwards in a light breeze, but on the other hand, in the 1950s an American naval blimp program manned an Arctic airborne early warning station continuously for 10 days in the winter. The weather was the area\u0027s worst in years, grounding all other military and commercial airplanes with combinations and variations of ice, snow, rain, fog, and 65 mph winds. The airships went on sorties that lasted for days, in extremely heavy icing conditions, and succeeded in their mission with no crashes- effectively crushing the misconception that airships are inherently more vulnerable to weather than other aircraft. In fact, their natural buoyancy, lengthy endurance and ability to maneuver at low speeds makes them very well suited to ride out storms.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said before, at big scales, the good thing of airships grow much faster than the bad things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor \u0022last mile delivery\u0022 I know Amazon is looking into Quadcopter Drones to deliver right to your door.

In related news, airplanes aren\u0027t used for heavy cargo transport -- the lack of containers means they\u0027re bad for moving lots of freight. Trucks don\u0027t use containers in some cases when they aren\u0027t being used for intermodal operations, but a trailer can actually also go by train (even without the container, you can stick a trailer on a flatbed). You should know that \u0022go between plants of a firm, carrying medium quantities of cargo at medium speeds\u0022 is a fairly small niche -- rail is actually quite good for that in countries with rail networks, because while an individual thing might take a while to get from one plant to another, you care more about the overall flow of cargo between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I don\u0027t know about Argentina; it\u0027s extremely plausible that this could work out well in a place with poor rail and road networks. I\u0027m speaking from a much more US-centric point of view. However, I will point out that building rail on the assumption it\u0027ll be useful for the next 25 years is a very safe bet. The US and European networks started being built in the 19th century. Technology doesn\u0027t change physics -- steel wheels on steel rails are low-friction, and the ocean lets you move huge amounts of stuff very cheaply and easily. In 25 years, rail and ship will be dominant modes of transit. In 100 years, they\u0027ll still likely be dominant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T08:58:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirplanes does not use containers to transport goods, neither trucks in most cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, of course they don\u0027t:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.idunair.com/images/airfreight2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022airfreight2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir freight uses lightweight especially shaped containers that can be fit inside a standard container or a truck for multi-mode transport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo return to your OP, there is no single most efficient transport.
