sun).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe value in the 6 hour chunks is that this allows interdependent processes to work.\u00A0(Example: you have been drilling and refining\u00A0fuel for 18 hours, if it was done in one chunk, then all of your current ore would be refined, but you would then have 18 hours of unrefined ore, possibly losing some if you do not have enough storage, in 6 hour chunks, you get 3 smaller updates where it calculates how much of the current ore is converted, as well as how much new ore should be added over 6 hours, then updates all values at once, letting you process some of the ore you mined while away before it finishes processing.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: This means that if you have less than 6 hours of storage for something that you are both producing and consuming(such as ore), then you will not get as much effective production, as the production will stop during each 6 hour chunk due to the storage being full, and consumption will also

switchable in the settings)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf\u00A0the vessel has been inactive for less than 6 hours of kerbin time, then it will just calculate what should have happened in that lapsed time in one chunk.(like mining ore or converting ore to fuel)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf\u00A0a vessel has been inactive for more than 6 hours, then KSP will process the down-time in 6 hour chunks(still using the current conditions, so if your base depends on solar panels, I don\u0027t recommend returning to when it cannot see the sun).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe value in the 6 hour chunks is that this allows interdependent processes to work.\u00A0(Example: you have been drilling and refining\u00A0fuel for 18 hours, if it was done in one chunk, then all of your current ore would be refined, but you would then have 18 hours of unrefined ore, possibly losing some if you do not have enough storage, in 6 hour chunks, you get 3 smaller updates where it calculates how much of the current ore is converted, as well as how much new ore should be added over 6 hours, then updates all values at once, letting you process some of the ore you mined while away before it finishes processing.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: This means that if you have less than 6 hours of storage for something that you are both producing and consuming(such as ore), then you will not get as much effective production, as the production will stop during each 6 hour chunk due to the storage being full, and consumption will also stop due to storage being empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to the stock mechanic, RoverDude added a resource sharing mechanic that will allow local and planetary warehouses to share resources either with other local vessels, or with the planetary warehouse(depending on what sort of logistics support you have).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mechanic will try to transfer away resources when local storage is mostly full, and transfer in when local storage is mostly empty, but either way, it only tries to make local storage half-full, so 12 hours of local storage is a good idea when relying on these mechanics(so that you can\u00A0have 6 hours worth transferred in or out for each batch)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than the automatic
