When I say \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS it\u0027s only the supplies/mulch stuff, none of the MKS and such. I only missed the cool oxygen and CO2 tanks from TAC, everything else is fine. You can make self-sustaing bases with water and little ore, or lots of ore, which produces fertilizer, that converts mulch in supplies. Again, only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS and KPBS, not the other mods made by RoverDude.  \n\nI cheated a base on the Mun and worked very well warping years from the space center (again, for testing). A short perma-hab seems right to me, so I can\u0027t let a kerbal living in a lander can, and can archive perma-hab time with simple bases. I don\u0027t want to warp forever for no reason, but if a base is self-sustaning, I don\u0027t think I have to keep looking at it. Would be a nightmare to have various bases that need constant looking everytime I did a interplanetary transfer.  \n\nSo, KPBS \u002B \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS (without MKS), with short perma-hab seems very right to me.
