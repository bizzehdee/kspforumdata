It definitely isn\u0027t normal. \n\nIf all cores go to 100% that is likely the game crashing, so there would be no way to alt-tab back to it. In ye olde days of winXP, I had some games crash when alt-tabbing, but that was fixed with video card driver updates at some point and I haven\u0027t seen an issue like that for years. Do make sure you\u0027re up to date on video drivers. If that doesn\u0027t help, you might want to try an unmodded KSP install in case one of the plugins is making it unstable. Or skip all that go right for the workarounds...but seriously, update video drivers at least if you aren\u0027t up to date.\n\nIf you run in windowed mode, alt-tabbing won\u0027t be stressful to the system. It will hamper performance somewhat though... unless you go for fullscreen borderless windowed mode. Both NVidia and AMD have long since optimized their drivers to avoid rendering background windows when a game occupies the entire screen. Fullscreen borderless windowed mode gives you the all the advantages of both fullscreen mode and windowed mode, without any of the disadvantages. You\u0027ll be able to alt-tab instantly, get full performance, and not have a silly window border.\n\nSadly, game devs mostly aren\u0027t up on the best view mode and rarely include that option. KSP is no exception. Fortunately, unity supports it though and you can force it on easily... or resort to a third part app to do it (which works with other games).\n\nTo get that for KSP, follow instructions here:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20894-KSP-in-full-screen-windowed-mode!-quick-n-simple-(windows-only](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20894-KSP-in-full-screen-windowed-mode!-quick-n-simple-%28windows-only))\n\nor use the app here (works with other games to)\n\n[http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2675769](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2675769)"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T14:44:20Z","Content":"***I have found a solution!***\n\nOpen task manager, you should see ksp.exe or something.\n\nOnce you see that, click on the arrow next to it, and double click what comes up.
