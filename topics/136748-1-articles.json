Space was but a step away, the stars within reach. Huge ships departed from Kerbin, carrying their payloads to the far reaches of the system. Laythe sported a booming colony. Duna was a vast trade center. The dozens of presumed one-way missions to Eve had been recovered. Even Eeloo was populated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that was before the Change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough wars were fought in space and upon the planets, peace was still the usual state of affairs. Nearly the entire planet of Kerbin was unified, and the frontier worlds did not have enough people to develop internal strife. The most that happened was an occasional knifing in the streets of a city on Duna. Largely, the planetary nations cooperated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the Change came.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was not the first event of its kind, but it was the most calamitous. Previous events had unlocked new technologies, like the possibility for maneuvering thrusters to use mixed fuel. Others had, seemingly, killed the old gods. The altars their apostles had once ridden into space fell to Kerbin, their motive force suddenly absent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the Change was different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur physicists saw it coming. They saw all the previous events months prior to the incident itself. In this respect, the Change was familiar. Soon after each event, the physicists saw, in broad strokes, the effects of the next one. The effects of the Change, however, were so widespread and so severe that very few physicists believed there would be anything left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLittle did they know how right they were.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon its arrival, the Change brought widespread chaos. A mothership en-route to Jool lost its entire cluster of NERVAs to sudden, catastrophic overheating during its midcourse burn. Airliners in the skies above Kerbin and Laythe alike violently flew apart. Several probes in the outer system failed, due to the unexpected loss of efficiency of their solar panels. An SSTO shuttle lost nearly all power to its engines, in a rapid change of the thrust curve. That same shuttle subsequently burned up in mere moments, losing all aboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose were not the only results of the Change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Change modified the way the universe worked. Our physicists could no longer interpret the data given by their instruments. Nobody knew when the next event would occur. Some estimated within the next year, while others postulated that there would not be another event: the universe was done with its spasms and its growing pains. But that did not matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe had bigger problems at hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the loss of the massive supply freighters, the outpost on Eeloo starved. Only five souls made it to the return window. Laythe\u2019s colony imploded in a bitter civil war. Kerbin\u2019s world-spanning union fractured, the old nation-states rising again to squabble over the scraps of the old era. Only Duna stayed largely self-similar, although that was not much better than Laythe. Our greatest libraries burned, millennia of knowledge razed to the ground. The worlds forgot about one another after a couple of years, focused solely upon their own survival. The five kerbals from Eeloo dwindled to only one fractured scientist, his mind destroyed by the horrors he had witnessed. He landed on Laythe, mere weeks after the war had ended. Duna\u2019s largest manufacturing centers ground to a halt, starved of labor and vision. Kerbin\u2019s fresh water became sour, bringing most small towns unlucky enough to rely on rivers to their knees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet still, we persevered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDecades became centuries, and finally a light shone through the grit and dust of Duna\u2019s skies. The ancient shipyards returned to production, giving birth to a new generation of ships. The vessels ranged outwards from their home, first to Ike and then to Kerbin and Laythe. Upon the surface of Kerbin they found only ruins, sorrow, and desolation. But Laythe was a different story. Laythe had become a veritable paradise, full of flowering plants and flowing water and beautiful sunsets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Change seemed to be firmly in the past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the exchange of knowledge brought forth a terrifying revelation. The Laythers had built up their understanding of physics back to the pre-Change level, and so they saw what the Dunans did not. A new event is coming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne that will shake the universe to its very roots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-17T02:23:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2016 02:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by 0111narwhalz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EReadability\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KAL 9000","CreatedById":140704,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T14:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOoh!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andem","CreatedById":155578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T15:26:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMOAR.

This was intended to be a one-off. Of course, I might spring one on you in a couple weeks, or a couple months, or whatever, but that\u0027s not planned at the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, each prior event was linked to an update. We have:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 ...maneuvering thrusters to use mixed fuels... That\u0027s when the Vernor engines were released.

Some planes crashed too.\u0022 That\u0027s kind of lackluster compared to the apocalypse of 1.0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
