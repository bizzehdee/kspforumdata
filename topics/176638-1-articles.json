At least I was told that, when I brought this up ages ago. Won\u0027t mean that this stance has changes since than. However I would like so. Imagine designing a lander that has to be made to survive the acid rain on Eve. Or having to contend with actual sand storms on Duna. This would add tremendous interest to planets.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI suppose one could extend the whole terrain scatter feature to make planetary surfaces more diverse.

When one has invested hours of planning, design, testing, launching, manoeuvering and transferring just to discover that Eve\u0027s atmosphere is all-but-inescapable, this is an exponentially greater cost than discovering 20m above the launchpad that your parachutes have deployed because you forgot to set your staging properly, or even 100km up that you didn\u0027t attach any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.

This is good and it\u0027s something which could be stock/DLC. IMHO, ship building should always require some resource to be shipped from Kerbin, because no matter what kind of fabrication capabilities are deployed at the Moon or Mars if we ever colonize them, we won\u0027t be building microprocessors there. I also think a better navigation system should be implemented, allowing not only porkchop plots but also to plan and link together a series of maneuvers and gravity assists. With mods, you can build and fuel ships in either Mun or Minmus and, theoretically, send them inwards towards Kerbin so the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E coincides with a transfer window for another planet, thus saving lots of fuel (and avoiding the need to make ships more or less aerodynamic in order to launch from Kerbin).

In my opinion, everything that\u0027s been added that steers into space administration and away from space exploration has been a mis-step. At its purest and best, KSP is a really good caricature of a realistic physics sim, that makes learning about physics, aerodynamics and space travel, fun. Science desperately needs an overhaul, but what it really needs is an overhaul that makes it educational and fun. Likewise for planets. Currently science and planets suffer from the same problem - they\u0027re soulless props designed to fulfil a practical need for demonstrable progress. They (with perhaps 2 exceptions) do not inspire any wonder or enrich the game experience (or even better enrich the \u003Cem\u003Eplayer)\u003C/em\u003E in any significant way.

Right now, the \u0022career\u0022 is being signified by missions that are generated randomly and presented to you. The goal is to amass money, reputation and science by which you progress along a tech tree. The style of the missions may be fun to some, but I know there are many including myself that object to the ever repeating nature of missions, including the fact that there is no underlying \u0022story\u0022 involved. Gaining science is equally pointless, since many real world \u0022science recovery methods\u0022 require months of stupendous taking measurements and researching stuff. So basically I can build a bunch of probes and shoot them at the various planets and moons and have them take all kinds of point readings. Boom, tech tree completed, immersion gone (overly simplified).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOptics - A game can have appropriately stunning visuals that take the player into the atmosphere of the game. This includes not only the games assets (space craft etc.) but also the \u0022backdrop\u0022 (i.e. planets, atmospheres, weather, geographical features and so on). While I appreciate that the \u0022cartoonish\u0022 look e.g. of some of the rocket parts was intended, the graphics overall look flat and outdated. Immersion gone. In stock, the planets have no clouds and virtually no surface features. Most planetary textures are just bland. Immersion gone.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPurpose - A game can also profit from being educational, as you pointed out already. In stock, you have to guesstimate almost every aspect of rocket design. While you can use spreadsheets and other external tools, it is complicated and cumbersome. Immersion gone. So what the game needs and what has been clamoured for by many users are the basic tools that make \u0022rocket science\u0022 an educational experience (like with using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSurprises - Finally, if a game provides the user with surprising experiences, it can be more immersive. This can be achieved via the above described gameplay aspect, but also by being able to discover stuff in the game, like the anomalies, but also stuff we don\u0027t yet have like new geographical features (\u0022Hey, did you see that giant rock drop on Dres?
