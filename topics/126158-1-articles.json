I\u0026#39;d suggest trying to orbit a probe there to get an idea of how much dV you need.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso know that due to its orbital inclination, the dV required for going to Moho can change drastically from one launch window to another. But I think transfer window calculators take that into account, so if you use one it should be OK.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHaving some spare dV for Moho is usually a good idea, even with a good launch window. This is valid for any destination, but the actual dV used for Moho is unpredictable.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh, and nukes worked fine at Moho in 1.0.4, even without radiators, so there shouldn\u0026#39;t be any major issue with them in 1.0.5.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain: if you\u0026#39;re prepared, then going to Moho isn\u0026#39;t that bad.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-22T13:00:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2015 01:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaarst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T12:59:15Z","Content":"\n\u002B1 on the weight tip.

Ill have to give the ion engine a try.

This way you don\u0026#39;t really have to worry about inclination preventing an encounter. On the flip side, this probably would sacrifice DV for simplicity since you have to cancel out your inclination at the Moho encounter (traveling fast). You could perform an inclination change at your ejection burn.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, if you want to use ion engines for your ejection burn, launch your spacecraft into a retrograde orbit around Kerbin. This way you will be on the daylight side for your transfer burn.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T01:00:30Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Adm010\u0027]..any words of wisdom...[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\ni) How about the very recent and current \u0022I am never going back to Moho\u0022 thread?\u003Cbr\u003E\nii) Read, experiment, calculate (or before experimenting if you\u0026#39;re cautious), improve\u003Cbr\u003E\niii) Achieve\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdrevik","CreatedById":114231,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T01:44:58Z","Content":"\nMy approach is more straightforward: Build a pod with the science and such you want to take down as a lander, with 4 nukes and all Mk1 liquid fuel pods. Put docking port in front.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLaunch it into orbit. Build another ship with same docking ring and lots of extra liquid fuel.
