As I said before, with the lack of sun, once you\u0027re going fast enough, and you\u0027re far enough away from the earth, gravity would not affect you at all. If the KSP simulator is accurate (which it probably isn\u0027t at the moment, being so new), then it could take weeks, if not months or years, of running the sim for the speed to decrease due to gravity. Actually, it might never decrease, as the farther away you get from Kearth, the longer gravity takes you slow you down, giving you more time to get farther away, etc. And as there is no air in space (aside from the occasional stray hydrogen atom whose effect is negligible) to cause resistance, unless you hit something you\u0027ll never slow down. \u003Cstrong\u003EUnless of course you\u0027re talking about the G-force meter breaking, in which case it is a legitimate bug, but OP didn\u0027t actually mention that until later on, and was referring to not slowing down, which is normal.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DoctorEvo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DoctorEvo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, on second thought, go ahead and leave.
