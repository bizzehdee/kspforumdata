I\\\u0027m 27 years old and live in Australia. I\\\u0027m a programmer looking to get into my own indie game development in 2012. I love playing a variety of games and get especially excited about games that encourage and develop creativity and problem solving skills and which support persistent worlds (but don\\\u0027t mind thrashing about in an FPS or RTS too). Hopefully I\\\u0027ll get to know some people around the forums here and experience the ongoing development and improvement of this awesome game too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-05T19:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have Minecraft too. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-05T20:02:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GWigWam","CreatedById":12309,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-05T22:17:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome, I\\\u0027m a Minecrafter as well 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoxtane","CreatedById":6626,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-05T23:11:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m a Minecrafter too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m just better than the rest of you yahoos because I have an observatory in my main save \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lucho","CreatedById":12856,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-06T00:21:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom one new member to another (although not a minecrafter), welcome aboard!
