Of course, not all PC\u0027s are created equal, so getting a good PC for gaming can cost a ridiculous amount of money after the initial cost of the computer. However, with the obvious disability to modify console hardware, all games for consoles are created with the same specs in mind, thus guaranteeing a smooth gameplay experience.\n\nHowever, PC\u0027s are different: PC game developers do not have to create their games with a certain spec amount, and they can make their games as hardware-intensive or not as they please. Because of this some games run and play even better than what could be possible on consoles, games like Space Engine and KSP are great examples.
