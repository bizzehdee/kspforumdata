I generaly dont scrape the last little bit from every biome and end up haveing a few missions out to the easier to hit targets to finish out the tree. Make sure you do the impactor science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Not really. If you dont mind your craft looking silly just stud your craft with the recievers pointing in different directions. If you have one pointed down each axis from your craft (forward back left right up and down) you should always be able to recieve some power. At your worst angle (45% between 2 recievers) you should still pick up about 60-70% of the max potential. Personaly I tend to go with 3, forward and backward along my line of thrust and 1 on the side and just roll the ship so the side one gets reception if the forward/back ones are not geting good signal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. For tips I\u0027d say make sure you stick a pile of small, self contained reactor modules in orbit befor you upgrade to fusion power. the modules are basicly just a tiny UF4 reactor/generator and a pair of small radiators with docking ports. You can plug these into craft where you want more power than is pratical with RTG/solar but you want long duration with no maintnence. each one will provide around 8-12MW (depends on generator upgrade or not) max output and can run 8 years at max output or almost 32 at minimum. Perfect for pluging into a small craft/probe for years of mission time. If you\u0027ve got them in orbit you can just send up the main craft for a rendezvous and have an RCS tug pick one up and plug it into a docking port on the main craft. These are exelent for either ion propulsion if you bother or for a kethane miner/refinery as just 1 will power as many drills/converters as you can reasonably put on a craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond suggestion is if you decide to start playing with beamed power its alot easier to make a ground based system than it is to launch reactors into orbit. Orbital sats are going to be 40ton payloads for each reactor and with unupgraded tech you\u0027ll probably only get .7-.8 GW out of each one. Thats going to take a ton of launches if you want a 50GW or so net so you can get huge amounts of thrust from beamed power. It gets worse when you consider the need to refuel all those power sats every couple years. On the other hand its rather easy to deploy a cluster of 30 or so reactors that just sit there on the end of the runway beaming power into space. When they run outa fuel just recover and redeploy. you can even set the whole cluster on wheels and drive it away from the KSC to avoid lag. You do suffer a penalty due to beaming through the atmosphere but the system is easy to expand to counter that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-16T08:12:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2014 08:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by merendel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T08:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Krevsin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Krevsin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have a question.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to modify the heat radiators from the Near Future pack by Nertea to work with Interstellar and am struggling with the code.
