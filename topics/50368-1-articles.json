Hydrogen either needs to be stored at extremely high pressures, or extremely low temperatures. Both of those add further cost. There are also issues in using it for aircraft, given it\u0027s low energy density per unit volume.

If the grid electricity you\u0027re using to make your hydrogen isn\u0027t squeeky clean then you\u0027re back to square one, especially given the low energy efficiency of the conversion process. You may have zero emissions at the tailpipe, but the goal is lower emissions overall.

But I still think that the safety features and design of a vehicle influence it\u0027s crashworthiness more than size. There are plenty of large vehicles out there that are not very crashworthy. I can understand why people might assume larger, sturdier-looking vehicles might be better, but improving crash performance isn\u0027t about adding more metal to a design. The energies in even quite modest crashes make that approach pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T15:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Seret\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Seret\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETrue, it\u0027s an imperfect measure.
