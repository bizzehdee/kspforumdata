I\u0027ve seen very similar artefacts when, in my own projects, I have not set up either the correct texture bias for the shadows, or I forgot to make the shadow renderer use linear depth. I\u0027m not sure whether there is much you can do about it, except possibly use completely custom shaders on the object to change the shadow bias for distant objects. You can\u0027t do this directly through Unity or KSP, but you could do that using my shader manager plugin I have written for the electronic instrumentation for the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/40761-Kerbin-Mini-Shuttle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbin Mini Shuttle\u003C/a\u003E project.
