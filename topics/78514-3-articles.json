Though irregular is really just a big sphere of stars so I suppose it sticks to the round universe idea. Anyway, this mod is really made for KSPI so inclination doesn\u0027t matter much. You say within one degree of the galaxy core but think how much one degree means thousands of light years away, it adds up to at least a few light years difference up/down relative to our sun. Now in my opinion that doesn\u0027t really matter compared to the advantage of actually having more stars with their own planets rather than add a ridiculous amount of planets and moons to poor old Kerbol.

Though irregular is really just a big sphere of stars so I suppose it sticks to the round universe idea. Anyway, this mod is really made for KSPI so inclination doesn\u0027t matter much.

But yeah, even a few percent of a degree on cosmic scaled distances will result in ludacrus numbers. I really would\u0027ve like to be able to place the stars even further apart from the black hole but unfortunately the core game mechanics seem to break down if I increase the distances much further. As for PF:CE, I think I could make some custom planets myself, but giving people the amount of customization options PF:CE has will be very hard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OvenProofMars","CreatedById":114237,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T14:34:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Megalodon 720\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Megalodon 720\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI just punch in random 9 digit numbers\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that should work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fastwings","CreatedById":116001,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T14:48:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehi \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/117391-OvenProofMars\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#417394;\u0022\u003EOvenProofMars\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#417394;\u0022\u003E i sent u private message i like join with ya help out with mode \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
