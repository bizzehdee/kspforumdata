I had a glitch happen on a mission today that cause Jeb to not be able to board the craft he was in, nor could he, or the ship, be recovered (either at the top of the altimeter nor in the tracking station. I have fixed the bug, however Jeb is still showing the tracking station as well as being available for the next mission. The Jeb in the tracking station cannot be recovered or be deleted, but he can be targeted while in map view from another ship. So my question is how do I remove him from the tracking station when I cannot use the buttons at the bottom?
