I put the thing upright, engage SAS and as long as I don\u0027t switch back to space centre or another vessel it\u0027ll remain in that position no problem.

I have also noticed that leaving my Mun lander in orbit will result in the ship spinning with an accelerating force. Surely this defies the Newton\u0027s law of motion?

If you point your station normal/anti-normal it should stay in that orientation (rotating around its axis as it orbits). Any other orientation (radial or prograde) will appear to change as you orbit unless you have SAS direction hold on and you\u0027re focused on the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peewee69","CreatedById":161551,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T10:19:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the replies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor clarification, by \u0027upright\u0027 I mean pointing at normal (in my equatorial orbit this means north), which, as Reactordrone points out, should maintain that orientation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no joystick, so not that.
