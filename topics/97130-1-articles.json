I decided to check it out, and it\u0027s pretty good. But I can\u0027t help but wonder what star system this might represent, if any. It appears to have four stars- three I presume are yellow dwarfs, the fourth is blue-white in color and appears very small compared to the others, though this may just be the distance the star orbits at. Any ideas what star system this might represent?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
