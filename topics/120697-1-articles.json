The challenging planets are tylo, eve, and to a certain extent laythe since its atmo can cause trouble if the lander isnt designed with aerodynamics in mind at least to some extent. Guess its time to restart design of my tylo dropship (that would have if i did it right enough dV to land and takeoff withotu refueling, easily i can add 5 tons of IRSU gear and make it fully SSTOable after refueling on surface).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"origamiscienceguy","CreatedById":150839,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T01:39:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it seems his rules are that you cannot dock/undock at all.
