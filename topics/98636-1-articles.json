One of those ones that flips over from being a laptop into a tablet. Do any of you have any experience with these?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found one at BestBuy.com that seems pretty sporty, at least in my price range...\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-geek-squad-certified-refurbished-2-in-1-13-3-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i3-4gb-memory-500gb-hdd-natural-silver-natural-ash-silver/9638095.p?id=1219431851715\u0026amp;skuId=9638095\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebut it\u0027s refurbished.\u003C/a\u003E But even the new ones they have are $500. On the HP site they\u0027re in the mid-$500 on sale. I\u0027m really trying to stay under half a grand, though, if I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat particular model caught my eye because it has an i3 in it, as opposed to most of the others which run on Celerons or Pentiums. But I\u0027ve been so out of the loop on processors I\u0027m not really sure whether it makes a huge difference between the 3 types. If something like this has any hope of running KSP, even on minimum settings, it would be pretty kickin\u0027. But I assume that would be a huge stretch for any of this type of computer, especially in the sub-$500 range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it has to play Minecraft. Smoothly. One of the reasons I\u0027m considering it is because when I play with my son, I\u0027m on my desktop and he\u0027s on his laptop on a little table on the other side of the room, which is pretty awkward. I\u0027d really like to set up right next to him so I can help him out more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if an i3 or better is needed for either or both of those things, this seems like a good deal to me. If I can get away with a Celeron or Pentium, however (or if KSP is right out and I shouldn\u0027t even try), I can probably get away with something cheaper or save that money for more RAM or HD space. When I\u0027m flying rockets on my desktop, a second screen with spreadsheets, wiki, and forum access (or maybe that instruments plugin, whatever it\u0027s called) would be kinda nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for reference, my desktop is a homebuilt with a 3.2 GHz AMD Phenom II x4 955, 8 GiB RAM, and an NVidia GeForce 9800 GTX\u002B. It\u0027s five years old last month. Plays KSP just fine, in my opinion. I\u0027d like to think this will continue to far outclass any of the laptop options I\u0027m looking at, but again, it\u0027s been some time since I\u0027ve been shopping for computers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any thoughts on this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt","CreatedById":131025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T06:19:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy main question would be: why a 2-in-1? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not used many such computers, but, I would caution you on getting one unless you have a clear need for the tablet interface on a more powerful, yet mobile, computer.

Again, better models are capable of running MC on medium to high settings (provided that there are enough RAM and GPU performance). They are a huge leap from the pentium family. Apart of much better energy efficiency (=added mobility), the i3 sports features like hyper threading which the pentium lacks. It\u0027s pretty useful when it comes to multitasking.
