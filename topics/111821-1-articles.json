Remade an old one that worked okay in .90 but I feel it has more potential in 1.02. If by potential you immediately think \u0027wow that\u0027s some good acceleration\u0027 then you and I probably think alike, but I\u0027m running into a problem.\n\nI\u0027d heard Rapiers didn\u0027t accelerate so well at higher altitudes, and that the new semi-standard SSTO ascent profile is to gain speed at a lower altitude before pitching up. Buuuut...doing so, the Mk1 to Mk2 adapter I was using as a portion of the fuselage...overheated and blew up.\n\nI started my first big acceleration around 10,000 meters, and a second attempt at 15,000 with the same results. Am I just starting too low or what?"},{"CreatedByName":"Teilnehmer","CreatedById":143330,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T08:52:22Z","Content":"I believe you can play with your pitch angle.\n\nThe Rapier\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ceiling is about 28 000 m, and the top speed is about 1500 m/s.

That means jet engines are real gas guzzlers in their power band (due to higher thrust). For that reason I avoid going through the transonic speeds (250-500 m/s) until 10\u002B km where the air thins out. Avoid cruising in the transonic range the drag forces are the highest there and you\u0027ll just waste fuel fighting drag. RAPIER power plants may need to climb higher than 17km for a gravity assist to beat trans-sonic drag. Their thrust profile it\u0027s not as well aligned to that wall as turbo jets.\n\nOnce you pass the sonic barrier, you want full acceleration remember you guzzle jet fuel very fast at this point. \u0022Reentry\u0022 effects are a suggestion to pitch up, but you want to be close to them to build speed faster. Chemical rockets still consume fuel faster than jets. Some profiles actually don\u0027t manage convection heat, but simply soak it up and get out before damage occurs. You want velocity to be at least 1 km/s 30 degrees above horizon when your jets cut (angle is inversely proportional to the TWR of your anaerobic engines, but if you are significantly off on this angle you either have too much engine hanging out as dead weight or not enough and you will suffer gravity losses). 1 km/s is a minimum. Any amount you add here is less anaerobic dV needed.\n\nIf you have asymmetric flame-out issues, you don\u0027t have enough intakes or they are poorly assigned. Your height/speed should kill their throat before they starve."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T09:35:00Z","Content":"I prefer to climb 30-45 degrees past 8km, then start following prograde to exceed 400 m/s, and generally want to be climbing at 20 degrees as I pass 15km.\n\nAt 20km, I want to be going 15-20 degrees up, ideally I\u0027lld reach over 1,200 m/s surface speed with an apoapsis of above 30km.\n\nWith rapiers I tend to get 1,250-1,350 and a higher apoapsis before switching to rocket mode.\n\nWhen I only get to 1250 m/s, it is typically because I climbed too fast, and I\u0027ll have an apoapsis of around 40km... which may med up being better, I\u0027m not sure.\n\nA good basic rule would be 20 degrees at 20km, I guess"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T09:48:19Z","Content":"Would building the wings with a higher angle of attack help in getting to higher speed, jets\u0027 thrust pushing more forward than up?"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T16:51:12Z","Content":"1 km/s is less than half orbital speed.

Flatten out invokes the wrong imagery and using full throttle leaves you no reserve when altitude robs your power.\n\nI ascend to 10 km with 250 m/s at the steepest angle (at most 70) I can maintain speed at 70% throttle. Having some afterburner is important so you have more oomph when you get high and turn. Around 10 km I max throttle and gradually level out being careful to avoid much negative wing lift (negative AoA). Negative wing lift during this just creates induced drag losses. I pick up speed through the turn which is relatively quick due to the low speed.\n\nLower aerobic TWR craft will need a shallower accent, but they typically need gravity assists to enter the super sonic regime anyway so they need to fly to 18 km in initial accent.\n\nThis only works because mach 1 does not change WRT pressure. If that flaw is fixed, the rules will change. I don\u0027t know the equations, but I imagine going Mach 1.5 at sea level will never be efficient regardless."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Vlad","CreatedById":106306,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T21:09:24Z","Content":"I\u0027ll give some of these suggestions a go when I get home and let ya\u0027 know how it works out.

Speed of sound is proportionate with bulk modulus (stiffness) and inversely proportionate with density of the medium. The only effect temperature has on it is on density.\n\nSlashy is right about preferred altitudes.\n\nTurbo and RAPIER thrust curves WRT altitude see a major drop in the first derivative at around .06 and .03 atm respectively. That is roughly 15 and 18 km. Flying higher allows better thermal management though.\n\nTurbos have maximum thrust WRT speed at 1 km/s. RAPIERs at 1.3 km/s. Going much above that means you have probably over engineered your craft.\n\nOn an interesting note, RAPIERs have an unique drop in the first derivative of thrust WRT pressure at .3 atm (6-7 km). It\u0027s slight, but that is where turbo jets really diverge from RAPIER performance until they intersect at .04 atm and RAPIERs beat turbos. So there is numbers to support breaking the sound barrier at 7-10 km on RAPIERs.
