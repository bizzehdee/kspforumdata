It would be a small, air-breathing liquid fuel engine, similar in appearance to the pulse jet used on the German V1 \u0022Buzzbomb.\u0022 It would have low thrust and efficiency, but would be very cheap and lightweight. It could be used for small liquid fuel boosters on first stages or for rocket-assisted runway takeoffs, though its main purpose would be short-term relief of my unquenchable thirst for more building variety. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part itself would be 0.625 meters in diameter, fairly long, and would be radially attached.
