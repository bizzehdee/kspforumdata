You could add more cuts, add more angles of the same footage so you can cut between them. For example: startup. Exterior static shot to show the heli. Start engines, cut to interior showing the spinning bits, or maybe even switch the camera to one of the rotor blades. Either way keep moving the \u0022frame\u0022 while you\u0027re spooling up and getting ready to lift off.

I\u0027m not an expert on making videos but I\u0027ve watched a fair few. IMO if anyone is interested in the subject matter the style of the video is almost irrelevant and you did a good job of showing what the helicopter does. It might have been worth showing it in the SPH with an introduction or take a look inside to show how it works. Other than that, if you want your video to fit in the general style of current Youtube videos I would suggest the following if I was being ultra picky. 1) People tend to like videos with quicker cuts, (I think it\u0027s the current ADHD generation \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E). 2) Some of the text flashed by a bit fast. 3) Maybe some music. 4) Although it was 720p it looks like the video lost a bit of resolution during processing. People like sharper videos these days. 5) People like higher frame rates now. Your game looked like it couldn\u0027t quite keep up with the video\u0027s 25/30hz. A lot of videos are uploaded in a 60hz format now. Edit: Also I would say that although the external views are good it would be nice to have some shots of the helicopter from the fixed KSP camera as well, mix it up a bit.
