I was wondering if anyone has come across any notable tutorials on how to mod in custom crewmen? I\u0027ve been Googling all over and can\u0027t seem to find anything. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) I was hoping I could use a collection of stills I have, but, so far nothing.
