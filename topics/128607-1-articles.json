It goes \u0027on rails\u0027 and does not have physics applied therefore drag / aerobraking does not occur. \u00A0Since reentry heating is partially dependent on atmospheric density, if you wait until the ship is low in the atmosphere it is natural and to be expected that it will be traveling at unsafe velocities.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYour reentry angle has to be like Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Just right. If you\u0027re coming in to steep your heating rate may be too great resulting in explosion. If it gets even steeper the opposite occurs where although the heating rate is extreme it doesn\u0027t last long enough to be a problem. However, then you have a new problem \u00A0where you are coming in too fast and don\u0027t have sufficient aerobraking to arrive at a safe speed. A shallower reentry is needed. HOWEVER, if you go TOO shallow then you burn up your shield before braking enough to drop into the lower atmosphere. ~20-30km is a good target periapsis in most cases.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nYour \u0027minor\u0027 problem: Not enough information!!!

I go to space center while completely still, in a stable, circular orbit! Most of the cases is, I stoped the ship in orbit, went out to the space center, and launched another ship, tried to dock with the first ship, but BOOOM, during \u0022final approach\u0022, the first ship blew out. Is there anything to do with the debris? Might be the ship hit some. But about the minor problem, I think it\u0027s quite clear enough. Anyway, thanks for your suggestion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
