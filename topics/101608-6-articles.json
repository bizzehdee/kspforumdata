I have fairings around my mod\u0027s Orion service module that use ModuleDecouple and ModuleEngines. I assume that your fairings attach at the bottom, so that your ModuleDecouple \u0022explosiveNodeID\u0022 is set to \u0022bottom\u0022. If this is the case you could add a thrustTransform to the fairing with the z-axis pointing inward, then add ModuleEngines and a Resource node to your fairing config.\n\nHere\u0027s the ModuleEngines code from my OrionSMFairing:\n\n    MODULE{\tname = ModuleEngines\tthrustVectorTransformName = thrustTransform\tthrottleLocked = True\texhaustDamage = False\tignitionThreshold = 0.01\tminThrust = 0\tmaxThrust = 0.05\theatProduction = 3\tuseEngineResponseTime = True\tengineAccelerationSpeed = 5.0\tallowShutdown = False\tfxOffset = 0, 0, 0.0\tPROPELLANT\t{\t\tname = SolidFuel        \tratio = 1.0\t\tDrawGauge = False\t}\tatmosphereCurve \t{   \t key = 0 290  \t key = 1 360 \t}}RESOURCE{ name = SolidFuel amount = .011 maxAmount = .011}\n\nOf course, you will probably need to tweak the thrust, amount of fuel and so on to get the performance you want. It should help push the fairings away from the vehicle and prevent them from impacting.

The ascent is slightly more efficient but it doesn\u0027t make up for the loss in deltaV. The core TWR isn\u0027t super high, but it is manageable. The real limit for massive payloads to LEO is the EUS. This can be mitigated by launching it half empty, but I recall the SLS program manager said that if they\u0027re launching to LEO they would launch with the EUS completely empty, which puts the max payload at about 90 tonnes.\n\nAnyway, I decided the throw in a couple more missing parts, and I\u0027m again running into problems. I got the decoupler in, and it is super weak and struts are completely ineffective. I put one right at the top where the thrust beam is located, and it does absolutely nothing at all :/\n\n![flimsySLS.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/flimsySLS.png)\n\nEdit\\*\n\nManaged to fix it. Apparently the mass of the parent part has a huge impact on the strength of the conection. If I attach it to the hydrogen tank, the most massive part of the stack, the conection is nice and stiff, and I can launch at 4x time acceleration with no problem. This isn\u0027t where the seperation ring is supposed to be attached, so I just offset the surface attach node so that it could appear to be attached to the bottom of the stack while actually being attached to the hydrogen tank.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T14:23:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"brickmack","CreatedById":92193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T16:17:46Z","Content":"This is awesome, can\u0027t wait for proper texturing to be finished.
