The ascent is slightly more efficient but it doesn\u0027t make up for the loss in deltaV. The core TWR isn\u0027t super high, but it is manageable. The real limit for massive payloads to LEO is the EUS. This can be mitigated by launching it half empty, but I recall the SLS program manager said that if they\u0027re launching to LEO they would launch with the EUS completely empty, which puts the max payload at about 90 tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I decided the throw in a couple more missing parts, and I\u0027m again running into problems.

Apparently the mass of the parent part has a huge impact on the strength of the conection. If I attach it to the hydrogen tank, the most massive part of the stack, the conection is nice and stiff, and I can launch at 4x time acceleration with no problem. This isn\u0027t where the seperation ring is supposed to be attached, so I just offset the surface attach node so that it could appear to be attached to the bottom of the stack while actually being attached to the hydrogen tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T14:23:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brickmack","CreatedById":92193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T16:17:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is awesome, can\u0027t wait for proper texturing to be finished.
