It\u0027s a Co-ed, non dorming, service fraternity, and while they are technically dry (and national does enforce this fairly strictly), it does tend to be a very \u0027social\u0027 group (outside of official events).  They are based on the scouting principals, so much so I had to know the Oath and Law to get it, which wasn\u0027t a problem for 3 out of my 4 pledge brothers, as we were Eagles, but the other guy had to learn it quick.   We were required to do 25 hours of service time each semester, which our chapter mainly helped out at the local animal shelter (puppy walking day was always a blast :D).  We also did various other projects around the community.  One of which was a Monty Python Movie Marathon at the local cinema, and we donated all the proceeds to local charities.  So yeah it\u0027s a service group, but we always tried to do fun service stuff (Hey, it\u0027s college, ya know?). \n\nMy chapter was about 2/3 Male, 1/3 Female, which was pretty good considering the school I went to was roughly 9-1 male to female.  And about a 1/5 of our members were also grad students, who were always more than helpful with the undergrads studies. \n\nSo, knowing a strong part of KSP Forum\u0027s demographic are teens looking at colleges, if you\u0027re a scout, or just interested in service, when you are doing campus tours, see if each schools has a chapter, and message a member for info.  Most likely they will be more than happy to show you their chapter, and maybe get to know a couple people early.  If you are already at school somewhere, look them up, we have chapters everywhere, you might be interested in joining.\n\nThis wasn\u0027t intended to be an ad for the group, but I guess it turned out that way."},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-29T22:22:57Z","Content":"There used to be a section in the Scout handbook about APO.
