I was testing a lifting body twin-engine high-altitude hypersonic research jet (hooray stock aerodynamics!) and the sun was just coming up over the horizon directly ahead of me. (Thankfully Kerbals are immune to sunlight and radiation, otherwise poor Jebby would\u0027ve been blinded.) I didn\u0027t even notice the eclipse at first, and when I did I thought it was a graphical bug. Then I checked the map view, and noticed that the Mun and Kerbol were both perfectly aligned to deliver a beautiful eclipse to this part of Kerbin. Alas, I didn\u0027t get any screenshots, but still a very neat event!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Hooray for zero-eccentricity orbits causing monthly eclipses!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-26T01:47:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2014 01:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by zxczxczbfg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tanner Rawlings","CreatedById":58414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T16:26:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELegend says that a Kerbol Eclipse signifies good luck should you find it flying about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T17:59:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongrats!
