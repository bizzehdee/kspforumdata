I\u0027m currently working on a manned mission to Duna, with a lander/crew section already in orbit around Kerbin and a plan to dock a drive/fuel section... just as soon as I can get that into orbit without it detonating on the pad. Other than that, my progress so far has been a manned lander (and return) for the Mun and a three-part station over Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust in case anyone\u0027s interested, I\u0027m on Steam under \u0027Korlis\u0027 there too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T12:59:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck on your adventures, and if you have any questions, this forum is welcoming and as helpful as any on the internet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, \u0022Arrr, Happy Launching!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T13:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou stole cap\u0027t skunkys catch phrase, he\u0027s going to hate upon you!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewelcome to the forums korlis!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T13:41:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EArrr, Happy lithosphere breaking!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xiphos","CreatedById":60680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T15:02:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKorlis,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should make a duna station with dedicated reusable lander to take kerbals to the surface base and back to the station with ease!
