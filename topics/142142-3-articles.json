I may try to shore up the sides a bit once I get the final shuttle model made. But even then, be prepared to launch quickly after undocking.

It would take complexity of parts similar to Nazari\u0027s shuttles, I imagine, with\u00A0specialized air frame and hull parts, and they\u0027d be pretty useless for anything else.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther tests with the catapult have shown good results, with consistent (if overpowered launching).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA new issue has cropped up with a new plane: if the root part is above or below\u00A0the center of mass, the craft is given a nasty downward or upward (respectively) pitch. Right now I\u0027m trying to figure out if I can sidestep that, so my craft isn\u0027t sent headlong into the runway or flipped like a coin. But definitely a thorny\u00A0issue, and re-rooting to a docking port seems not to work at all.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, saving as a subassembly isn\u0027t working, unless I re-root to the shuttle (which caused the coin-like backflipping mentioned earlier).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-17T18:33:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2016 06:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PDelta41\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded subassembly bit\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
