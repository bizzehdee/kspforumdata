The other issue is that the same maneuverability that assists you in gunfights actually can hurt you in a long range battle if you scrub off too much speed in the turns: It doesn\u0027t matter if you changed your heading if you are down to 50 m/s.  You have to strike a balance between speed and turning to be successful. \n\nAs far as missile avoidance, the sidewinders seem a little off for some reason.  I have, quite literally, never been hit by one. I don\u0027t know if maybe the AI isn\u0027t waiting for the  target lock, or if the flares are just super-effective if the sidewinder can not see the engine\u0027s heat signature.  Avoiding AIM-120s seems to be more dependent on movement than the actual chaff. Sure i have the chaff on my planes, but it only seems to make a minor difference in the end.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-26T21:42:48Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2015 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SasquatchM**"},{"CreatedByName":"SasquatchM","CreatedById":11888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T21:46:27Z","Content":"I just had am idea.

When setting up the test trials I have been placing the aircraft nearly back to back; that is, facing opposite direction about 200m apart.  It may giver more interesting results if they were set up with only a 45 degree heading difference instead of a 180 degree difference.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027ve been searching into that, I have installed HyperEdit but I don\u0027t think that is the mod for this....\n\nI want:\n\n-back to back starting\n\n-starting at the same time\n\nKicked your ass again today b.t.w (God, I need to hit you 4-5 times before you explode) ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif \u0022:sticktongue:\u0022), maybe we should send our files to a member who wants to be the judge, o wait.......\n\n![ZidPZAA.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZidPZAA.png)\n\nSuper maneuverability is the key for me.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-26T22:39:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2015 10:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Triop**"},{"CreatedByName":"SasquatchM","CreatedById":11888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T22:30:59Z","Content":"Generally my starts are less than a second apart: however long it takes to switch between craft.

The other issue is that the same maneuverability that assists you in gunfights actually can hurt you in a long range battle if you scrub off too much speed in the turns: It doesn\u0027t matter if you changed your heading if you are down to 50 m/s.  You have to strike a balance between speed and turning to be successful. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As far as missile avoidance, the sidewinders seem a little off for some reason.  I have, quite literally, never been hit by one. I don\u0027t know if maybe the AI isn\u0027t waiting for the  target lock, or if the flares are just super-effective if the sidewinder can not see the engine\u0027s heat signature.  Avoiding AIM-120s seems to be more dependent on movement than the actual chaff. Sure i have the chaff on my planes, but it only seems to make a minor difference in the end.\n\u003E \n\nThe thing is, this is more an autopilot limitation than a craft design problem. If there was some way to get it to keep a reasonable amount of energy by not whacking in max pitch all the time while still maintaining the slow speed maneuverability and the option to pull stupidly hard turns when it needs to miy plane might actually have a chance, but instead it just spins round in 40m/s circles and has no energy to avoid missiles. Hopefully this is something that Bahamuto changes soon, the work that he\u0027s already done for BDArmory AI flying is pretty amazing so I\u0027m pretty optimistic. Until then though, my plane *suck*s.\n\nAbout the AIM-9\u0027s, maybe the difference is that the AIM-120\u0027s are based off a more modern and countermeasure resistant missile and so are less affected by chaff, unlike the AIM-9s which seem to be (I think, and my entire knowledge of this is based on one wikipedia article) based off one of the early all-aspect variants and so are less developed in terms of countermeasure resistance. Also, I don\u0027t think the AI is very good at choosing when to take a shot; they don\u0027t seem to care about target movement or whether they have a solid lock on the exhaust or are just getting the faintest glimpse of a target from front on- they just get any lock, and shoot."},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T22:39:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 46 minutes ago, SasquatchM said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I just had am idea.

This would remove take off speed from the equation and seems like a scenario much more likely to be enountered IRL than a both-on-the-ground option.
