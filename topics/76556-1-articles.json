With a slightly better food supply management, granted, but they would still all starve before they suffocate. Basic estimate: Imagine you burn all organic material, calculate how much CO2 that is going to release. It\u0027s not enough to get to toxic levels.

Plants don\u0027t just produce oxygen for no good reason. Oxygen is a by-product of photosynthesis which produces sugar from a combination of carbon dioxide and chlorophyll, this sugar goes into a process called cellular respiration which converts sugar and water to ATP and carbon dioxide ATP is a cell\u0027s main source of energy animal or plant. So knowing this this means there is no way for a virus to make a plant produce unbreathable air before the plant dies and the oxygen to carbon dioxide ratio is high enough that there is more oxygen made than carbon dioxide. A better scenario would be if all plant life died and the fungus population skyrocket producing carbon dioxide while most species of animal a reduced to a strict fungi diet meaning that the humans and other animals would live long enough to experience oxygen deprivation and carbon dioxide poisoning. So what then? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: I was trying to refine his theory so that it would be more clear or flawless to figure out how long we would have. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
