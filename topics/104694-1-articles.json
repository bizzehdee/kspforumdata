Become a colony even. But we won\u0027t know, until we go and find out.\n\nYou cannot say that something is not worth doing, unless you prove it. Tons of people thought the Americas (the \u0022New World\u0022) wasn\u0027t worth colonizing because there was nothing here. It wasn\u0027t until people came here and proved it could be tamed, that major populations started cropping up.\n\nNow, I\u0027m not saying we should go willy nilly and \u0022see what happens.\u0022 There\u0027s definitely a right and wrong way to go about it. But saying we should ignore the moon simply \u0022because\u0022 is a terrible excuse. No one is saying it won\u0027t be hard. No one is saying it won\u0027t be cheap. But that\u0027s no reason to just give up on what I consider to be the greatest resource within our relative grasp.\n\nWe could learn so much on the moon. We could also learn a lot from ARM.
