Figuring out how to launch a rocket from the Moon would be a tremendous boon to society as a whole in space exploration. The moon can support bigger payloads with lighter gravity.

Launches can go directly into the gravity turn with no air resistance to stop them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy? we need to build the spacecraft, reach LEO, go to the moon and land (which require deltav), just to fill our tanks and gain a little extra deltav?
