It may seem simple to explain at first, it\u0027s actually \u003Cem\u003Every \u003C/em\u003Ecomplex, because we are talking about billions upon billions of bodies acting upon each other while flying out from a central point (The Big Bang). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first gut answer to this is simple, when the stuff from the Big Bang exploded outward it all was given some spin like shrapnel from a grenade and that spin got amplified when other spinning objects started gravitating together, and that was all at a microscopic to near macroscopic scale. Then we get to planetary scale after a super long time, I have no idea how long in years, and this one is kinda easy. For example, Lets say this planet is absolutely unaffected by anything around it during its travel out from the big bang, its not spinning, nor is it rotating around another body, both near impossible but for examples sake we will use it, and don\u0027t concern yourself with how it was formed without spinning. This planet will sooner or later get hit by something or hit something itself, this is were its spin will come from, because no matter what, if something hits it, it would be impossible for that object to hit it exactly center on, it might come close but some very minor spin would still be passed to the example planet. After multiple hits more spin would be transferred, not to mention knocking it into orbit around other bodies sooner or later. This same thing is happening billions upon billions of times in other parts of space as well, a general flow will emerge and anything orbiting against the flow will get pulverized, or captured, by the larger number of objects going with the flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there are lots of holes in that explanation, maybe someone can flesh it out a bit more, but I think I got the gist. There will also be many exceptions, for example: rogue planetary bodies that have been knocked out of their orbits by who knows what.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, hopefully that answers your curiosity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: got ninja\u0027d by Themohawkninja appropriately, but this as well as impacts would contribute to the flow and spin of everything around it. And as he said the Universe probably isn\u0027t rotating, it has nothing to rotate around, it theoretically is the product of an explosion of some sort, so it would expand outward forever unless something were placed or formed where the explosion happened that had some sort of gravitational pull.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-23T03:18:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2013 03:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Savage117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T03:10:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arran\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arran\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShort answer in one word : Gravity \u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not a scientist, nor can i explain things correctly like and scientist, and someone here might correct me where i go wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut i assume, if you look inwards to atoms and neutrons, they act in a simulair way as galaxies and solarsystems do, they all rotate around simply said a gravitational body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll packed together they make up a whole thing.

As more and more particles get attracted by this initial bundle, the gravity well gets bigger and bigger, like a sink hole increasing in size. However a small fraction of the nebula will never collapse into the center... rather, it will fall into its direction but its too far away to become part of the star, but too close to be ejected into the surrounding space.

In general, physics of a black hole is very different from that of a charged particle.

Such a black hole would have a Schwarzschild radius of roughly 5.6x10\u003Csup\u003E-15\u003C/sup\u003E meters. In contrast, Bohr radius for Hydrogen atom, which is where you are most likely to find an electron, is 5.29x10\u003Csup\u003E-11\u003C/sup\u003E meters. That is almost 10,000 times larger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, the region of space where black hole has all of its funky physics is very small compared to the size of the atom.

The scales we are dealing with here are many orders of magnitude above Plank scales. So there are no inherent QG effects. Next, we look at whether we have to consider QM of the black hole itself. Since its mass, again, is many orders of magnitude above that of the electron, we can treat it as a fixed object at the center. Any uncertainty in its position is going to be much smaller than event horizon size. So we\u0027re clear there as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only place where gravity and QM interact in this picture is behavior of electron near event horizon. And we know how to deal with this. Because we assume BH to be a static object, we can simply do QED in Scwarzschild geometry. Basically, any place you see a partial derivative in QED Lagrangian, you replace it with covariant derivative. And anywhere you see a dot product, you\u0027ll need to insert the appropriate metric tensor. From there on, you just do normal Quantum Field Theory. I\u0027m oversimplifying a bit, but this is the general way in which you\u0027d compute interaction between tiny black hole and an electron. In a nutshell, that\u0027s also how Hawking Radiation is derived, except that you consider the vacuum of relevant QFT there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how complicated of a problem this is going to be as I haven\u0027t tried to work it out. I suspect, proper treatment is very difficult, but there might be nifty shortcuts for a good estimate that I can\u0027t think of without writing this all out. At any rate, you\u0027d be able to estimate the probability of such an \u0022atom\u0022 eating its own electron without getting into Quantum Gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd like I said earlier, this is only relevant if we want to know the life time of such \u0022atom\u0022. The electron\u0027s distribution, on average, is far enough from the center to be considered as a classical QM problem, giving you solution identical to Hydrogen atom.

Hydrogen atom is exactly the case where the probability is non-zero. In fact, radial component of probability amplitude has a maximum at zero. (I don\u0027t recall if it actually diverges, but that doesn\u0027t really matter in this discussion.) So at any given time, there is probability that electron is actually inside the proton. But because electron doesn\u0027t interact strongly, it just passes through like it\u0027s not even there. The only interaction is electromagnetic, and that\u0027s the very thing that gives you an orbital in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
