No \u0022fuel\u0022 in there, apologies. But, as for what it actually is...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s easiest understood when looking at a singular fuel tank, like the Rockomax X200-16. This tank masses 9 metric tons in total. That mass is called the \u0022wet\u0022 mass, because it is measured when the tank is full of liquid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis total mass is split into 3.6 tons LiquidFuel, 4.4 tons Oxidizer, and 1 ton empty structure. The last part, the empty structure, is the so-called \u0022dry\u0022 mass, because it contains no fuel at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mass ratio, then, is a very simple thing: it\u0027s the ratio of the fully-fueled \u0022wet\u0022 mass (3.6 \u002B 4.4 \u002B 1 tons) to the \u0022dry\u0022 mass that remains after all the fuel is gone (1 ton). For the Rockomax X200-16 (and indeed almost all tanks in stock KSP), this ratio is simply \u00229:1\u0022, or 9.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same number can be calculated for any given rocket stage. You take its total (\u0022wet\u0022) mass, subtract all things that are fuel, and you receive the empty (\u0022dry\u0022) mass. Then you divide the wet mass by the dry mass and you get the mass ratio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnderstanding this is kind of important, because it\u0027s one of two halves of the all-important Rocket Equation. The other half is specific impulse. Or rather, effective exhaust velocity (a number that Isp directly translates into via simple multiplication with gravity).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EdV = Isp * 9.807 * ln(wet/dry)\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027, courier, monospace;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;---- here is the mass ratio!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of this, the mass ratio is each rocket stage\u0027s single most important number. If your stage has a mass ratio of 4:1, and your engines deliver 300s worth of specific impulse, then that stage will deliver \u003Cem\u003Eexactly the same dV\u003C/em\u003E as all other stages with a mass ratio of 4:1 and engines with 300s Isp. It doesn\u0027t matter how many parts any given stage contains, how much it weighs in total, whether it\u0027s a lower or an upper stage, which size the main stack is, how much stuff is sticking out the side, how much it cost, which fuel type it is running on, or anything else... they will perform exactly the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn top of that, the mass ratio of your fuel tanks defines the upper limit of the dV an engine can achieve. In stock KSP, no engine can give you more dV than its own Isp, multiplied by the product of the gravity constant and the natural logarithm of 9 (which ends up being roughly Isp * 21.55). Not only that, but because rocket engines and payloads have mass too, you won\u0027t even get anywhere near that value in practical application. Much rather than approaching 20, you\u0027ll find that most rocket stages give you no more than 15 times the engine\u0027s Isp worth of dV. Beyond that, the diminishing returns just get too strong to bother adding more fuel. In Realism Overhaul, these numbers will be different, but the math works just the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, always be aware of your mass ratios \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-29T21:24:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2016 09:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T02:22:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt depends on whether your upper stage can relight its engines (or if not if you\u0027re doing direct ascent with no parking orbit) and how much you\u0027re throwing at the moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor reference, early moon probes were launched by:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nR-7 with a Blok E (RD-0105) upper stage, probe mass around 300kg\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThor-Able (Thor, Able liquid stage, Altair kick stage) - probe mass around 20kg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJuno II (Jupiter lower stage, Baby Sergeant cluster upper stages) - probe mass 4kg\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater probes were launched by Molniya (R-7 with an RD-0110 second stage and S1.5400 upper stage) or Atlas-Agena.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow heavy is your impactor?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T05:33:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and also what tech do you have available?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as to the general question, here\u0027s how I go about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Decide on a mission. Will this LV take payload to low Earth orbit? Will it take payload to beyond LEO? Will it be designed for both roles?

Consider: do you have restartable engine(s) for your upper stages? If not, and you are not doing a direct injection ascent, your final stage(s) will need to precisely handle the injection burn after being placed into orbit by the rest of the LV. If you have restartable engines, or you are doing a direct injection launch, then you can use part of the final stage(s) to perform parking orbit insertion and the rest for BLEO injection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that decided, I generally create stages that take advantage of the full rated burn time of the engine I use. Due to Isps and possible mass ratios varying between stages, trying to keep delta V equivalent between stages doesn\u0027t work that well. Also you can (and should) have much longer-burning upper stages anyway, since TWR isn\u0027t very important after your first 2km/sec of speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T06:26:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222479688\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135171\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459285671\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I must admit I made an oopsie - the number I meant is actually simply referred to as \u0022mass ratio\u0022.

You then add an engine to give you roughly 1.0 TWR. To do that with your target mass of 3 tons, you need about 30 kN. And since the engine\u0027s base TWR is 20, that means such an engine weighs 0.15 tons. Finally, you add 1.8 tons tons worth of fuel tanks (because your payload \u002B engine \u002B decoupler weighs 1.2 tons), only 8/9th of which is actual fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour stage now masses 3 tons, out of which 1.6 tons are fuel. Your mass ratio is 3:(3-1.6) = 3:1.4 = roughly 2.143\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou plug that in the rocket equation, and you get about 2240 m/s dV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor stock KSP, that\u0027s a pretty reasonable number for dV contained in a single stage. After all, the average launch vehicle has two stages, and the average player flying an average launch vehicle expends about ~3500 m/s to orbit. If anything, this stage is slightly over budget, but having a margin is always good. If you build another stage below this one, and make it again twice the weight of the \u0022payload\u0022 above it (which now includes the upper stage), that stage too will have 2240 m/s, assuming equal ratios of of mass devoted to engines and structural elements like decouplers. Though you would in fact devote more mass to engines, because you want to actually be able to lift off the pad, and to do so comfortably, you want a TWR of maybe around 1.5 instead of 1.0. So your final dV will be a little less - though still above 4000 m/s in total for the whole rocket. All in all, this is a pretty decent launch vehicle for an orbital mission that requires a bit of maneuvering (like a rescue contract), and it is that way because the fuel tanks and engines available in stock KSP have the stats they have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the tanks had a mass ratio of just 3:1, you would have to add a whole lot more of them to achieve 2240 m/s of dV in one stage: adding 4 tons of tankage and a 50 kN engine will give you a stage massing 5.25 tons, 2.666... tons of which are fuel, for a mass ratio of 2.032 and a stage dV of 2086 m/s. Maybe you should have added 5 tons of fuel and a 60 kN engine instead!

How many stages will it take to get my payload to orbit? \u00A0For me, this is generally determined by the diameter of the payload fairing since that will determine the upper stage diameter which will influence the lower stage diameter. \u00A0Since I prefer taller rockets to wider rockets, this also influences the engines that will be used. \u00A0Since I fly all missions by hand I find an upper stage TWR less than @0.75\u00A0uncomfortable if it has a very long burn time which means I\u0027ll stack additional engines as needed (upping TWR and reducing final burn time, and delta-V slightly). \u00A0I look for a space delta-V from my launcher\u00A0of around 10.5km/s, given that I\u0027ve chosen proper lifting and upper stage engines suited for their individual tasks. \u00A0Most of my rockets end up being 2\u002B1 (2 stages \u002B boosters) or 3 (no boosters) stage affairs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Double check everything. \u00A0Did I remember RCS on my payload? \u00A0On my transfer stage? \u00A0Is there adequate power? \u00A0Life support? \u00A0Do I need to provide roll control for the upper stage? \u00A0Lower stage? \u00A0etc...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 4 is the part where everyone will diverge into their own opinions on how to design things. \u00A0Yes, if you\u0027re going for nothing but\u00A0efficiency there is really only one or two ways to build a rocket, but we are free to explore concepts and accommodate the way we enjoy playing in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-30T22:06:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2016 10:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeuZ","CreatedById":160898,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T17:35:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/137690-dino1984/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022137690\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/137690-dino1984/\u0022\u003E@dino1984\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need about 13 km/s delta-V to get to the moon (9.8 For LEO \u0026amp; 3.2 for Moon transfer burn)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Scott Manley\u00A0didn\u0027t have just 11 km/s delta-V because sometimes Kerbal Engineer Redux shows not the right delta-V, but Mechjeb does.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T02:56:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is atmospheric dv in the screen shot KER will increase the DV for each stage as you gain altitude.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T17:53:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t ever try to use the atmospheric delta V columns.
