Some of you are aware that about a month ago I managed to finally destroy my old laptop computer. I\u0027ve been in the process of building one. Construction and assembly went very well, and I ran into no problems. The day my RAM finally arrived, I was set. It booted up and ran fine, and all I needed to do was redo the graphics drivers. No sweat. Even fired up KSP and built me a little test rocket to see how things changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027ve run into a problem. A rather serious one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter fooling myself into thinking I was fine, I disconnected all the cabling to move the case from on top of the desk to under it. And the weirdest thing happened. The mouse would no longer work. It\u0027s a Rat 3 USB mouse. In frustration I hauled it up on top of the desk and went to work. I removed and replugged in the mouse. Windows doesn\u0027t notice. I changed USB ports. Windows didn\u0027t notice. I unplug an external hard drive dock that was functioning fine. Plugged the mouse in there. Windows didn\u0027t notice. Went through device manager and removed and re-added all HID compliant devices (also shutting off my keyboard lol). Rebooted. Still the same effect. Tried to download and install the specific mouse drivers. Refused to install because it didn\u0027t detect the mouse. Went through Win 8 settings, removed fast boot option, disabled any sort of USB power down, rebooted. Still no effect. Even completely reinstalled Windows 8. No effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even went so far as to load up Ubuntu from DVD, and just ran it off the disc rather than installing it. Ubuntu did not see any USB mouse. For me, that\u0027s the clincher there. It\u0027s not a software related issue. It\u0027s a hardware one. Tried to post here earlier for help, but can\u0027t with a keyboard only. As soon as I start typing a note, I have no way of tabbing out to hit POST.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor any tech savvy folks who are more up to speed than I am, I\u0027m using a Gigabyte motherboard, specifically GA-78MT-S2P. If anyone can dream up some sort of fix, I will be eternally grateful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, until I find something that works, I\u0027m hosed. Stuck.
