Certinally it helps prevent aircraft going tottally out of control straight off the runway as i saw before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I find it nearly impossibble to trim this ting right, as soon as the nose gets to level/rate of climbs goes zero the whole thing becomes unstable and wants to flip up or down at random. It dosen\u0027t like to settle in straight and level flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If the rate of change of any angle gets too high or it goes past vertical it likes to go into an uncontrolable tumble. I can\u0027t figure out why that is or how to get control back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said when i can get it vaguely straight and level it flies like a dream and will happily chug along at mach 2 at around 40,000ft and if you baby it enough to keep it near but not past vertical it will happily climb at mach 1 to 55,000ft. It\u0027s got plenty of thrust and lift, it just dosen\u0027t like to fly stabely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully somone can have a look at this and tell me why.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-25T23:40:55Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2012 11:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Carl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"trbinsc","CreatedById":10144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T23:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere is your center of lift in relation to your center of mass?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T23:41:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Carl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Carl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHopefully somone can have a look at this and tell me why.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifficult to do that without pictures or a craft file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be drag, if you\u0027ve got more drag at the front (wings) while having engines pushing from behind then that\u0027s naturally an unstable combination and it\u0027ll want to flip to go tail first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could also be angled wings and/or too many control surfaces but they sound less likely from your description.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carl","CreatedById":2645,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T23:41:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty much on top of each other, i\u0027ve re-attatched the craft file as it seems to have got lost when i hit post somehow.

Also i chose the gear layout becuase it was the only way to get the plane to sit level on the ground.
