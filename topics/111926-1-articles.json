It would be a basically be a series of wars starting with WW1 or WW2 and working up until all out interplanetary conflict. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany thoughts, feedback, and suggestions would be appreciated(Recording software would help a bunch).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kvantovy","CreatedById":142861,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T06:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs for the recording software, I recommed OBS. It\u0027s free, easy to use and can be used for both streaming and/or saving video to a file. I use it in all my yt projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBahamutoD CameraTools mod is great for making nice shots in KSP. In his other mod, BahamutoD Armory, you will find weapons and for making oldstyle war machines KEX/Firespitter combo can be of help. There is also one mod with additional tank turrets (e.g. Challenger), but sadly I don\u0027t remember the name.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ace_Of_Spades","CreatedById":63298,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T00:25:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any ideas for the villain(s)\u0027 name?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T22:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ace_Of_Spades\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ace_Of_Spades\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes anyone have any ideas for the villain(s)\u0027 name?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb.
