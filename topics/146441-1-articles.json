Go in to dockIng mode linear. Turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Push left stick forward for forward momentum.

You can click the icon or press the \u0022Y\u0022 button to select it. In docking mode, press \u0022A\u0022 to toggle between translation and rotation. The indicator glows blue for translation and green for rotation.\u00A0\u00A0Translation allows you to move without rotating using the left stick to move left, right, forward and back. R2 and L2 allow you to move up and down. It\u0027s easier to control in the \u0022locked\u0022 camera view.

Damn wasted\u00A0docking for 4 hours finally get close enough and and crashed too much speed #$@* thanks for info try it docking mode but still it\u0027s very hard\u00A0to do! Looks like pc you can control those \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E engines without docking mode to use forward and backward control?

I\u0027m playing on console as well and it took many tries. This\u00A0works well for me, but I\u0027m no pro. I\u0027m able to dock every attempt now. (Some are not so graceful)\u00A0Once you do it it gets easier every time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Get about 5k away from your target and retrograde until your target speed is at 0m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Burn on the target node until the prograde market is inside the target node.
