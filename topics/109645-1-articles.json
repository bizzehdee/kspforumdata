This wouldn\u0027t affect past versions, of course but it would allow new version saves to be based on users (thus allowing families to keep their saves separate) and would also have the benefit of being easier to backup.\n\nCurrently I have my save directory symlinked to My Documents, but Windows really doesn\u0027t recommend doing that."},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:04:06Z","Content":"How would this affect those of us that have multiple installs, or have ksp stored on an external disc that we take places."},{"CreatedByName":"kaluce","CreatedById":114388,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T16:00:57Z","Content":"Perhaps a config option to select where you\u0027d like to save it then would be ideal since I forgot about people who take the game with them. \n\nSo, a config option that says the following:\n\n#This changes the default save location, leave blank for the pre 1.1 default.\n\nSave\\_dir=c:\\users\\kaluce\\my documents\\KSP\n\nThis shouldn\u0027t affect any mods that I\u0027m aware of (none seem to modify the save directory)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T16:07:01Z","Content":"I prefer it in the game directory, as I have multiple installs for different mods."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T16:10:47Z","Content":"Please no.
