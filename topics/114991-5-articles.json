This does NOT include ReservePower.  \n\nThe changes I\u0027ve got in DEV will then deactivate the support modules that have been selected in the PartsList and remember their pre-shutdown state.  \n\nWhen power has returned (yes currently this is a bit flawed, because it has no limit or time check, which I was going to implement) it will return any previously supported parts to their pre-shutdown state. I\u0027ve been thinking about how best to implement this. Either adding additional priorities to the modules (more complex) or a simple timed mechanism (but to restore parts to active in what order).. so probably what\u0027s needed here is a combination of the two checking before activation of each module that there is enough EC to handle it (very tricky to do). Or perhaps the restart can be a completely manual process whereby you can bring up the parts list and activate them (with a button) one by one... Or in priority groups.  \n\nI\u0027ll look at the manual shutdown as another button.. Or perhaps a config setting so you can configure what EC level you want it to kick in, rather than zero."},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-18T10:28:09Z","Content":"Progress Update, from Yesterday.  \n\nEmergency Shutdown Procedures now have a manual button to begin the procedures immediately.  \n\nThere are now High.Medium.Low Priorities for all supported modules that can be assigned default values in the settings file.  \n\nYou can override the default settings and assign priority to individual modules per vessel.  \n\nThese priorities will be used to deactivate modules based on amounts set in the settings for low, medium, high priority modules.  \n\nI have not begun making changes for the startup, so that is next.

Could you consider putting an EC Total at the top or bottom of the EC column that sums the modules\u0027 EC enabled by the Calc and/or ESP buttons?\n\u003E 2. *Really* minor: Any chance of removing the the prefix \u0022Module\u0022 from the items in the list of modules?  Kinda redundant in the Modules column.\n\u003E \n\n[@Brigadier](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/147109-brigadier/)\n\nQ1. Yes.  \n\nQ2. Calc. - ESP is an additional function that will shutdown and restart the modules based on Total Mains Power percentage (defaults, but user can change).  \n\nSuggestion 1 -Done. Don\u0027t forget the main AmpYear window shows the ACTUAL power production and consumption based on what modules you have selected to be included.  \n\nSuggestion 2 - Done.  \n\nA settings screenpic might help to explain:\n\nSpoiler\n\n![itgJVdd.png](http://i.imgur.com/itgJVdd.png)\n\nESP High, Medium, Low Thresholds are the percentage of Main Power at which ESP will shutdown or restart any parts/modules based on their priority setting.  \n\nEach Module (only shows those supported) can included/excluded from ESP processing by setting the first radio button for each item.  \n\nThe High, Medium, Low button sets the default priority value for that module for any vessels that have them.  \n\nSo in this example when Main Power Hits 20% the Turn Booster, Climate Control, etc (all the priority 3 partmodules) will be deactivated.  \n\nWhen Main Power hits 10% the priority 2 partmodules will be deactivated.  \n\nWhen Main Power hits 5% the priority 1 partmodules will be deactivated.\n\nReverse applies when power returns... so when power goes back up to 5% the priority 1 partmodules will be reactivated.  \n\nand so on...  \n\nAnd yes.. I will change the input boxes to be actual percentages (this is still raw development going on here ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif \u0022:sticktongue:\u0022))\n\nSuggestion 1 \u0026 2 implemented:  \n\nSpoiler\n\n![Q9g99f2.png](http://i.imgur.com/Q9g99f2.png)\n\nI need to fix the alignment of the last row... ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif \u0022:confused:\u0022)  \n\nThe total in the Parts List is the total of the shown parts, regardless of whether their first button is set to on or off.  \n\nThe Power Drain and Power Prod in the main AmpYear window shows the total, respecting the first button setting.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-18T19:58:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2016 07:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T10:23:57Z","Content":"Update on the next version progress... A few set-backs. I had to re-think and re-write most of how I persist data between vessels and across scenes in order to keep all the AmpYear (and new ESP) settings from one vessel to another and between the editor and flight. Mainly because in the editor a vessel does not actually exist until it is rolled out and there is no easy way to keep the references between a ship file in the editor and a vessel in flight. I also need to cater for saved craft files to save the AmpYear settings into the craft files so it won\u0027t forget what ESP settings you set for each saved vessel in the editor and when launched.   \n\nStill have a few bugs to iron out, including a completely broken transition to Flight mode, but slow progress is being made. Unfortunately I won\u0027t have much time this week (real life and real job), but hopefully will have some time to finish it off over the Easter break this coming weekend.

Still I managed to fix my broken transition to flight mode and now Ampyear ESP and other vessel data persists right through from craft file, to editor, to flight to save file. I also got some functional icons etc going (enough for now given 1.1 will mean a GUI re-write anyway). All that\u0027s left now is iron out the actual ESP processing bugs.
