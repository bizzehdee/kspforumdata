Now what I want to discuss is will they do it. The Chinese have really advanced over the years with many missions and they want to be equal or better then America and Russia. On the probe side of things China will never beat US or Russia however they could beat us in manned and I believe they know this. It\u0027s not in their plans to do this however there are reasons to believe they will:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

The Shengzhou is an Low-Earth-Orbital spacecraft, it does not have the systems or equipment nessessary to venture outside of LEO, and the current Chinese goal in space is to launch an Mir-class station by 2020, none of which involves beyond LEO exploration. The clostest nation to returning to the Moon is the United States, and we aren\u0027t landing as far as Bolden is concerned. Yeah, we\u0027ll flyby it, enter its orbit, drag a asteroid to it, build a spacestation on its dark side and invite private companies to mine it, but the next American spacecraft on the Moon isn\u0027t going to completely belong to the US Government, but more of an private-governmental apporach.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-17T23:36:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2014 11:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NASAFanboy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T23:36:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood points, however it should be noted that the shenzhou is a modernized soyuz which was designed from the ground up for lunar flight as the soviets answer to apollo.

In a sense so was Apollo 11 and 12, though in hindsight it was obviously also a major PR coup, and as far as some U.S. politicians were concerned the whole point of the program (e.g. beating the Russians). Nixon actually considered cancelling Apollo after 11. Basically his thinking was declare mission:accomplished, and not risk a lost mission that could tarnish the record of achievement. This would have lunacy (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E) in budgetary terms as the hardware for the later missions had already been built. Apollo 13 was supposed to be the first pure science mission, but we all know how that went. Apollo 14 through 17 were all science (especially the last 3), as was the truncated Apollo applications program (in the end, just Skylab). I actually tend to think that China\u0027s lunar ambitions (and manned spaceflight projects in general) are more of the nationalistic prestige variety, then of the ivory tower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NASAFanboy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NASAFanboy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESoyuz was supposed to be replaced by the Zond.\u003Cp\u003EThe Zond was the cislunar Soyuz variant, and it got cancelled even though it made several successful cislunar flights.
