In most programs you CAN color individual faces by placing different materials.. Actual per-pixel \u0022painting\u0022 is possible in a few programs, but it is not how textures in game [optimally] work. Per-pixel painting is used for rendering, not real time applications\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe process of \u0022mapping\u0022 (aka unwrapping) is much more important for games, so you have to think more how to unwrap, will you use planar, cylindrical, flatten mapping, or unwrap by hand, what faces to reuse on the texture, and you kind of have to imagine all this in your head. What I do is, while making the model, I think all the time of how it might work with texture, I look at surfaces and imagine what texture they will have, where the edges will match, etc.. After I get the model to a reasonable detail (but not final model), I unwrap it and render the uv map. I take the map to Photoshop and paint over it. Only then, when I apply this map to the model comes the visual part where I ACTUALLY SEE the \u0022paint\u0022 on the model. And then I can switch from Max to PS, paint a bit to correct texture, save, switch back to Max and you see it right away. So, this is how you do the visual part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I started making models, I had the same problem, I could do models to incredible details, but then I couldn\u0027t map, it was just a huge barrier in front of me. Primarily cause models become unmappable due to detail and impossibility to map some surfaces cause it\u0027s difficult to isolate them. And the thing is you just have to think about it while you model. And you just have to LEARN to think like that. Now it\u0027s relatively easy for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-04T16:45:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2013 04:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by nothke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cryocasm","CreatedById":5299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T17:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks man, I\u0027ll look into thinking \u003Cem\u003Ewith portals\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T16:24:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cryocasm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cryocasm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m a very visual person, which is why 3D modeling appeals to me so much, but the texturing part is really, really annoying and difficult because I can\u0027t even remotely imagine what the texture will look like while I\u0027m making it in Paint.Net.\u003Cp\u003EIs there any program which allows me to paint-bucket the surfaces directly?
