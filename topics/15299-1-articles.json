That there is endless possibility\\\u0027s on how to try and get into space ... and an equal amount of possibility\\\u0027s of your rockets/space planes exploding \u0026gt;,\u0026gt;. It is the Trial and Error that had interested me in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut alas .... I have a few problems with the game, mainly those concerning lag and mod installation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a (Semi) old MacBook Pro (Running a boot camped (but official) Window\\\u0027s XP OS that I use for all of my gameing purposes) with a 256Mb Graphic\\\u0027s card build in and a 2.4Ghz Dual Core Processor. (And before you ask, Yes, I know that Ksp \\\u0027recomends\\\u0027 you to have a 500 mb graphic\\\u0027s card ... but I usually play on lower settings) Even on lowest settings, the Lag is pretty bad and that is before the rockets fire off and all of the debris of my failed attempts is taken into account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is kinda jarring to me (personally) that I can play Starcraft II and Diablo III with very little to no lag at all (On Med graphics, mind you)... but cant Play Kerbal Space Program without massive amounts of lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some way to help reduce or eliminate the lag problem\\\u0027s that I have?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other problem is with the installing of teh Mods ... as seeing as I am a newb, I really don\\\u0027t know how to install them. :-[\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T14:35:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMod parts are simple.
