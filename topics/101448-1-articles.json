I grabbed some parts I made for 24.2 and dropped them in my 0.9 game folder. The emissives, textures, particle effects and sounds are not working. The textures are not even loading, (png format). Before I get too crazy trying to figure it out, (10-11 parts) I wanted to check if there is anything basic I might not be doing that needs to be done. Unity is still set up with part tools .23, and hasn\u0027t been updated or touched since I made the parts 6-8 months ago. If I load 24.2 they are fine and this is a direct copy into the .9 folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf nothing changed, I\u0027ll just pull the cfgs apart and make basically structural parts to see if that works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T18:05:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFind in the log where the parts compiles and you\u0027ll get some kind of a clue as to what\u0027s going on.
