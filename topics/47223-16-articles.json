Be crummy if those never saw the light of day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a bit of feedback on the Mk4, if I may. I experienced some trouble with balancing my Mk4 spaceplane. The main trouble was the CoM being too far to the rear. Way I built it was Cockpit, 3x payload segment, LFO segment, tail segment. I think I\u0027ll agree with the need for the cockpit to be heavier as a ballast thing if nothing else. Also connected to this: maybe consider adding a modest fuel capacity to all segments? B9 does this in a very snazzy way, allowing you to select whether you want a structural fuselage, LFO, LF, or monoprop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that I\u0027m digging about this fuselage system is the flat keel (is that the right term for the underside?), allowing me to very comfortably add landing gear. Adding rear landing gear\u0027s a bit of a problem with B9\u0027s 3.75m spaceplane fuselage, for example. A problem with the flat keel, however, could be clearance issues with the payload. I noticed that payloads which comfortably fit inside the bay doors on the top have a tendency of clipping through the fuselage on the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/49862818725886362/4FB3F0C48AA614698C915B1E377F1F43B50A6A1B/\u0022 alt=\u00224FB3F0C48AA614698C915B1E377F1F43B50A6A1B\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-16T21:27:49Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2014 09:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bomoo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reblobic","CreatedById":111112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T10:28:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Nertea,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELove all your work around here, Near Future definitely is a must have for my game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if you ever plan to add this solar panel from way back in this thread?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://nertea.the3rdage.net/ksp/panel_circular02.png\u0022 alt=\u0022panel_circular02.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T11:21:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose have been in Near Future Solar for a while now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4152380/KSPScreens/25/screenshot88.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot88.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4152380/KSPScreens/25/screenshot135.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot135.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reblobic","CreatedById":111112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T18:30:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThose have been in Near Future Solar for a while now.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4152380/KSPScreens/25/screenshot88.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4152380/KSPScreens/25/screenshot88.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4152380/KSPScreens/25/screenshot135.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4152380/KSPScreens/25/screenshot135.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey Sean,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was referring to this post nertea made a while ago. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51395-WIP-Nert-s-Models-Current-MKIV-Spaceplane-Parts/page22\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51395-WIP-Nert-s-Models-Current-MKIV-Spaceplane-Parts/page22\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou posted the old Orion solar panels.
