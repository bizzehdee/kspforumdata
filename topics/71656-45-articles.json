We made VERY heavy use of a number of different mods, including B9 Aerospace, TAC-LS, Kerbonite, OKS/MKS Kolonization, KAS, Inferno Robotics, ExtraPlanetary Launchpads, and a few others. Thought I\u0027d report back my results for those curious. Forgive me if I\u0027m rehashing anything that\u0027s well-known here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything actually worked... surprisingly well:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* All parts more or less synced up between clients without issue. Mod control was not a concern in our case as we were running with synchronized folders, and everyone was able to see each other\u0027s unique parts without issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Mods like TAC Life Support actually also worked about as expected. The only anomalies we encountered only occurred when syncing ahead to someone else\u0027s subspace, in which our Kerbals \u0027may\u0027 have died if we didn\u0027t have enough supplies aboard to accommodate the time advancement. This wasn\u0027t an issue for us because it was about how we expected it to behave, and just meant we had to actually co-operate and strategize our launch windows for various missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe sadly never got to really test out the Kolonization mods and such though too extensively - our own incompetence left us pretty much struggling to achieve orbit for most of the day, so we didn\u0027t get to actually embark on our planned colonization project \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Ship movements actually worked really well - any time vessels were moving in relation to one another, we were pretty impressed at how smoothly things looked. There was still some jumpy-ness, but the experience as a whole was WAY improved from the old KMP build we had tried from a year ago. Well done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the issues we had:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Any time we had a couple of player-controlled ships visible in motion near each other, there was this complete framerate halt every 5-10 seconds, which took another 5 seconds to clear itself. It looked like DMP was re-synchronizing the entire vessel state and the game was going nuts having to re-load the entire vessel each time. This problem was most apparent when we were doing formation work (i.e. lifting off from Kerbin in close proximity to each other), but disappeared almost completely during slower, more precise operations like docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The game was pretty unstable. At first I thought this was just the number of mods we had loaded, but the game\u0027s memory usage remained at about 3GB (and we were making heavy use of ATM to keep the usage as low as possible - we even tried OpenGL mode). We\u0027d generally get crashes every 30-40 minutes or so. This wasn\u0027t a big deal because the problem player could just re-join after a few minutes... and I\u0027d be hesitant to blame just DMP alone because we WERE being pretty mod-heavy at the time, but I\u0027m not sure exactly what the cause was between all three of us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* My friends would randomly get kicked for no obvious client-side reason, but the server logs would show \u0022Disconnecting client \u0026lt;PLAYERNAME\u0026gt;, sent CONNECTION_END (Kicked for trying to create an existing subspace) to endpoint\u0022 messages at the same time. MechJeb *WAS* generally involved around some of these cases which I know can cause DMP to act a bit funny, but I\u0027m not sure if that was the cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Finally, the one time we actually managed to try docking a couple of ships together, we had an issue. I was actually using KAS to try and affix one of my pipes to my friend\u0027s station for a refueling run, but a few seconds after I connected, both ships suddenly disappeared, re-loaded, and my ship was gone with only his station remaining! On my friend\u0027s screen, both ships were completely gone and he had to quit and re-join to get it back (after which only his station appeared though). Here\u0027s a video of what occurred:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/hjzyr51e-WM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this was a KAS connector port \u0027docking\u0027 (and not normal docking) I\u0027m willing to write this off as an errant mod issue; I totally understand that DMP isn\u0027t built specifically around mods yet.

One day I\u0027ll do a video on how IP networking kinda works, but until then I guess I\u0027ll have to explain it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a simple example, I\u0027ll write the address/netmask together. /24 is 255.255.255.0, which means it can contact things when the IP\u0027s first 3 numbers are the same. I *think* this is your problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClient computer addresses are: 192.168.0.1/24\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaptop computer addresses are: 192.168.0.2/24 192.168.1.2/24\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPi\u0027s addresses are: 192.168.1.3/24\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no way the Client and PI can talk to each other in that above setup, although the laptop knows how to talk to both of them. First make sure that they are in the same networks first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@MightyN0ob: Thanks, but this is likely a side effect due to how I try and spawn vessels in the atmosphere when they are close. KSP kills vessels that are flying more than 2.5km away, so what I do is I temporarily set them to \u0022landed\u0022, and then hope KSP figures out that they actually should be flying - at which point they start working again. I\u0027ve got an idea of how to \u0022fix\u0022 this (keep them landed and move them every frame referencing the last DMP update), but I haven\u0027t coded that yet.
