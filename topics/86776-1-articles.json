When on the launchpad, go to map-view, select the stranded kerbal as a target and wait until he is above KSC (they always seem to be in an equatorial orbit). Take a note of the Kerbals altidude. Then launch and aim for an AP some 20km below the orbit of the stranded Kerbal. Once at AP, get circular and then simply plot an intercept to the Kerbal. Once within a few hundred meters, equalize relative velocities, switch over to control the Kerbal and then just maneuver him to the rescue-capsule and enter it. De-orbiting is a breeze, point the craft retrograde, and burn about 200dV.
