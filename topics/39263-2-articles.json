Instead of having a preset CoM location is it possible to discover the center of RCS thrusters (currently activated, weighted for various thrusts) like RCSBuildAid on the fly and then have PWB pump fuel (selectable subset?) around to move the CoM to this CoT? I imagine having a preset CoM location isn\u0027t terribly compatible with docking and reconfiguring the craft to not resemble the previous craft so much. An \u0022auto\u0022 function like this would be the most useful to the user, perhaps with a readout if full alignment isn\u0027t possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother notion that pops into my head is that if this balancer can shift the CoM intelligently to some zero point, it can also shift it to a point with a known offset from zero. Orbital docking prefers no offset in any situation I can imagine but aerodynamic flight would absolutely love to set a CoM position relative to CoL for a selectable stability. For example perhaps it\u0027s known that a CoM 3m ahead of the CoL makes the plane fly nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese destination points are hard to calculate but perhaps RCSBuildAid and other mods like FAR (or stock) could supply these points externally for (optional) extended functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T15:43:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for this.
