It is a new option in the options menu, and you can set it to any color you want. The opposite of your main HUD color offers the most visibility. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is a new VVI gauge to the right of the altitude tape. It offers a visual indication of vertical speed from \u002B600 to -600 m/s, as well as a digital readout below the scale. The tick marks are at 50, 100, 200, 300, and 600 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease let me know if you have any feedback before I release this as a full version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://1drv.ms/1vnQIA2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESource Code\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trueborn","CreatedById":65830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T02:01:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have released a new test version of SteamGauges!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=131B3D0DB2B5645E!54762\u0026amp;authkey=!AIuJfz1raqQVu2I\u0026amp;ithint=file%2Czip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EDownload 1.6.1b\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oj2XzNk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oj2XzNk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, the nav gauge only appears when a waypoint is selected via the KSP map. There are four main components. The first is the rotating compass card in the middle of the gauge. It rotates so that the active vessel\u0027s current heading is always at the top of the gauge. The yellow needle is a bearing pointer that will point towards the active waypoint. To head towards the waypoint, just move the needle to the top of the gauge. In the upper left corner is a block labeled \u0022DME\u0022 (distance measuring equipment) that gives the distance to the active waypoint in km. And in the bottom left is a time block labeled \u0022ETE\u0022 (estimated time enroute), which gives you the time it would take to reach the active waypoint if you moved directly there at your current ground speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease let me know if you have any issues with this version before I release it as a regular release. I\u0027m also wondering if people would be interested in a full time nav gauge as a compass replacement, albeit without the waypoint information.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
