If you don\u0027t want to mess around with angles, simply put down a maneuver node and hold the prograde marker until the apoapsis is at the same height as the Mun. Then, simply drag the maneuver node around until you get the encounter you want! Simple as that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T01:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest is to get your vehicle into a stable orbit and then burn prograde (forward.) Your apoapsis will start rising, let it do so until its altitude is a bit past the Mun\u0027s orbit. Timewarp and you\u0027ll get an intercept after an orbit or three. This takes no more fuel to do than a planned transfer from LKO to the Mun, and it lets you see how your orbit will change as you increase speed. Try to note how it differs in burning from LKO to half of the Mun\u0027s orbital altitude, to the Mun itself, and to Minmus. Learning little things like this without using maneuver nodes or autopilots will really help you out in more advanced maneuvers later on. A basic understanding of what happens when you burn in direction X is invaluable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T02:33:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are on the opposite side of Kerbin from a point 60 degrees ahead of the current position of Mun, point your nose prograde and burn.
