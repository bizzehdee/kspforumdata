The more you burn, the lighter you ship gets as well. These are both constantly changing during a flight. Is there a way to calculate your exponential increase in speed as the mission goes on? To make it easier, lets just do a one stage rocket launching off of kerbin. This is probably still not enough info though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T17:38:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do not know of a better way than a second by second calculation of the vehicle state, like launching the ship in the game for instance.

In the game, is turbulent flow around a rocket represented, or does it stay laminar, no matter what? What is the skin friction coefficient of various parts in the game? Is compressible flow represented and can shockwaves form at supersonic speed? I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know how detailed the physics calculations of the game are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you knew what exactly goes into the games drag calculations, you could determine your speed at any point in time by using basic differential calculus. You would need to know the rate of change in pressure, rate of change of mass, due to expended fuel . Both of these rates of change would be with respect to time. It would basically boil down to the most fundamental of physics equations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF = m*a\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this event, F = Fr \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Fd\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere Fr = force produced from the rocket engine (constant)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFd = force created from drag (not a constant, function of the change in pressure).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em (mass) is also not a constant, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s changing with time, as mentioned above. As acceleration is the second derivative of position with respect with time, you could rewrite the equation to look something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFr \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 d(Fd)/dt = [d(m)/dt]*a\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot by any means a simple calculation for an atmospheric world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a non atmospheric world it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not as bad, I will demonstrate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed(Fd)/dt goes to zero (which is by far the hardest to figure out), and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll rearrange the equation to this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea = Fr/[d(m)/dt]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed(m)/dt again is mass changing with time, which when written as a function of time, could be represented as m0 - k*t, where k is a constant (0.1 ton/sec as an arbritrary example) and m0 is your original mass. So we have this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea = Fr/(m0 - k*t)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to the handy dandy kinematic equations you learn is high school physics class, you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to do any actual calculus here (don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know if you know it or not\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I might have already gone over your head). You may recognize this equation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex = vi*t \u002B 0.5*a*t^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere x is your displacement (ie position or altitude)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince vi (initial velocity) is zero, we can rewrite this as\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea = 2*x/t^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we have\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2*x/t^2 = Fr/(m0 - k*t)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERewritten as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex = Fr*t^2 / [2*(m0 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 kt)]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there you have it, an equation to represent your position with respect to time. Let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s plug in some numbers to try it out. Let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s assume your engine puts out Fr = 100,000N of force, and your change in mass rate is k = 100 kg/sec and your starting mass was 100,000 kg. At t = 10s you would be 202.02m off the ground. At t = 60s you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re 7659.57m off the ground, and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve done the math right, if anyone sees an error please point it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Yikes, well I already discovered one error in my work, I completely forgot to account for gravity, which is again another changing variable. So where I had written\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF = Fr \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Fd\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt SHOULD be\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF = Fr \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Fd \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Fg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere Fg = G*M*m / (x \u002B r)^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EG is a constant (6.67 x 10^-11 N*m^2/kg^2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EM is the mass of the body you are on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Er is the radius of the body you are on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex is your displacement above the bodies surface, which is what we were trying to calculate in the first place (or actually I see now you wanted velocity, not displacement, but the two are related). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, the math for this got quite messy quite quickly, and my head hurts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-22T21:09:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2013 09:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jokurr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
