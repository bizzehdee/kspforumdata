I don\u0027t want engineer stock because it keeps getting better. There are new data points being added every time a release is out (I love the new intake air readings) and that would almost assuredly grind to a halt if it were implemented as stock. If they are going to be implementing anything, hope for something that is pretty much complete and incapable of much more expansion. Alarm Clock falls in the same boat, V3 beta is a massive improvement over the old V2, it\u0027s still getting better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-14T13:51:51Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2014 01:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
