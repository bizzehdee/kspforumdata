Going off a deltaV map, it takes 870 m/s dV to land on Moho, so let\u0027s say you want 1000m/s just to be safe. It will take the same amount to get back into a low Moho orbit, so you need 2000m/s. Using only poodle engines, this means 44% of your mass has to be fuel. If you want to hit break even for ore, you need the same mass in ore, since it\u0027s a 1:1 mass conversion.

The large your ore ferry, the smaller the fraction of mass the converter is.\n\nKeep in mind that when ascending, you\u0027re carrying lots of ore, so the extra mass of the converter doesn\u0027t affect it that much.\n\nWhen descending, because you have the converter, you\u0027re not carrying the fuel needed to go back up.\n\nAlso when starting your ascent, all your tanks can be full (ore and LF\u002BO).\n\nI would definitely go for refiing on the surface.\n\nNow, you only need 870 dV to ascend to orbit.\n\nUsing a poodle, lets find your mass fraction needed:\n\n870= 350\\*9.81\\* ln (X)\n\nln(x) = 0.2534\n\nx = 1.288\n\nOnly 22.4% of your payload needs to be fuel for the ascent, if you refine on the surface.\n\n1x poodle produces 250 kN of thrust. Lets assume you want a starting TWR of 2.0...\n\nMoho\u0027s Gravity is 2.7 m/s^2.\n\nThus with on poodle, your craft mass on ascent should be 46 tons.... A refinery at \u003C4.5 tons represents less than 10% of this mass.\n\npoodle: 1.75 tons. Refinery: 4.2 tons (?)\n\nFuel for craft ascent\u002B tanks: 11.6 tons\n\nExcess mass budget: 28.45 tons for ore/mining equipment/batteries/solar panels/reaction wheels/command pods/whatever\n\nThat should get you over a 50% payload fraction\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That doesn\u0027t sound like returning more to orbit than used to get down and back up.\n\nActually, it does. He\u0027s just separating the mining equipment from the tanker to get a higher payload fraction\n\n-update-\n\nLets calculate a payload fraction assuming no self-refuel on the surface.\n\ndV cost is doubled: 870\\*2 -\u003E \n\n1740= 350\\*9.81\\* ln (X)\n\nln(x) = 0.5068\n\nx = 1.66\n\nNow 40% of you payload needs to be fuel for the deorbit and ascent.\n\nwhich means 9/8\\* 40 = 45% percent of your lander\u0027s mass needs to be fuel\u002B tanks for the descent\u002Bascent.\n\nOf those 46 tons a poodle can lift, 20.7 tons need to be fuel\u002B tanks just to get down and up.\n\nYou\u0027ve added 10 tons of fuel to avoid carrying a 4 ton ISRU convertor\n\n\\*Something seems wrong with my math, it shouldn\u0027t take less than double the fuel to get double the dV... what have I done wrong :/\n\n\\*ah, I see, in the 2nd case, its assuming a much lower dry mass. Use more fuel to push less mass.\n\nJust like the fuel won\u0027t double each time, especially when you get to really really bad mass ratios, like 40:1 or 80:1\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T18:57:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 06:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T09:38:56Z","Content":"Ok, so I read adinfinitum\u0027s post, and I see an obvious criteria that I left out (although he left soemthing out too: fuel tank mass).\n\nI\u0027m not being conservative, and not planning for 2,000 dV, just 1740.\n\nSo fuel needs to be 40% of your mass, not 44% as he calculated.\n\nHe pointed out that obviously, to break even, if 44% of your mass is fuel, then 44% of your mass needs to be ore to break even.\n\nSo, cutting the dV budget tighter, we\u0027ll use 40% fuel, and 40% ore to payback that fuel.\n\nThe best mass ratio on the LFO tanks is 9:1.
