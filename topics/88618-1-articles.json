Or can you just make them separate objects in the same blender project? If the latter, do they need to be setup in a parent/child heirarchy first? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no videos or guides that I can find that follow the process of creating a full-featured engine from start to finish, so if anyone has a step-by-step, that would be invaluable.

You don\u0027t need separate colliders though, unless you really want a moving collider. Many of the stock engines just use a single cylindrical collider for the entire engine, that includes the space taken up but the skirt/bell/nozzle. The LV-N is a great example of this. Try standing a ship right on the engine, with throttle at zero, and use your steering keys. You\u0027ll see the skirt pivot around, but the rocket doesn\u0027t tip over or rock around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fairing should NOT have a collider, IMHO.

From what I can see, you can\u0027t move any gameobject in relation to the models that are it\u0027s children, and so any nozzles I have look set up to pivot about their center of volume, not one end. is the fix to make the gameobject a child of the asset, like spanner says?
