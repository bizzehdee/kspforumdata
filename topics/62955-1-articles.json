Now HGR had its own LS module in it, but I removed that for my \u0022All-Pods-Have-ECLSS\u0022 module. And it works. The pod in the VAB has the O2 an cO2 it needs. But.. after docking the lander with the station around minmus.. it disappeared. Now only containing 1 02 and 1 c02.. idk what happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qDgQMdT.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022qDgQMdT.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve been pulling my hair out over this for over an hour now. Ive tried re-installing the mod using the supplied LS module, but nothing.. This ladner is supposed to go to and from the surface carrying data.. simple as that. What could be going on here? Has anyone come across this before with ECLSS? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther mods that pertain are maybe.. MFT, Lazor System ( just the plugin ), CrewManifest, .. and that\u0027s about all I can think of at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd.. having just discovered from my own picture.. cO2 IS working with the 600 capacity.
