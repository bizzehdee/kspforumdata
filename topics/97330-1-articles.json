Quick question for any people who play with NEAR or FAR:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard that an eve ascent takes something like 8.5-12 kilometers per second of delta V, and a jool ascent takes something like 40 kilometers. That is, in the current Denser-than-water souposphere. But what if you attempt these feats with NEAR or FAR installed? What are the delta V requirements then?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHANKS! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-21T03:32:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy Eve ascent test, from the ocean to orbit used ~7.5 km/s. Thing was, this was running at nearly terminal velocity the whole way and being very careful to not break the rocket in two, so you may want to bring a little bit more and go a little slower for your first launch. This also included a fair bit of dV for breaking burns to keep the heating and disassembly during entry from occurring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Jool, no idea, never tried it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
