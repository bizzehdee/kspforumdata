Doesn\u0027t sound like something even remotely simple to mod. There is just such a large collection of stats which are unique to each type of component, this sounds like it would be a nightmare just to write up the basic plan before coding even begins."},{"CreatedByName":"Loren Pechtel","CreatedById":157006,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-24T05:24:10Z","Content":"Sorry for the necromancy but the answer is still relevant and this thread was hit #1 from Google when trying to find it:\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128204-122-kerbal-research-development/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
