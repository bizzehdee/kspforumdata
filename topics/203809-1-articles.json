My hopper goes just too fast on descend for it to deploy... I did some research and i found some people talking about the fact that the capsule aerodynamucs were changed but the training were not updated. Is that it ? So it\u0027s normal or i\u0027m just plain dumb ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-14T21:38:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is pretty much it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few of the tutorials nowadays have issues like this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-15T09:54:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven in the main game getting into a nose down attitude with that design will cause the capsule to go too fast and for the chute to tear off or not be able to deploy.\u00A0 Going more horizontal, rather than straight up will help and using the WASD controls to get into a tail first or sideways configuration to increase drag will also help. If there was a decoupler on the ship the capsule by itself gets into a stable, high drag descent so it\u0027s not much of a problem in game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
