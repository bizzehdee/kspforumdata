I have searched the forums using site search engine and Google, and I\u0027ve read everything about it on the wiki.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I build a spacecraft with docked sections? I\u0027ve researched specialized construction and have the first clamp-O-tron docking ports but I can\u0027t figure them out exactly. I can put each of them on something, but I can\u0027t seem to figure out male or female, or putting two together. I\u0027m trying to build a lander that\u0027s docked like Apollo missions. I think I might be missing something obvious. Any help here would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Just started playing this game.
