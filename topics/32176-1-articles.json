Stitching is just a process of joining two stacks together (because the default joints are not strong enough) by using very short 3, 6 or 12 fold struts around the stack to connect it to the one above it. Next, attach a similarly sized orange booster in a 2 way symmetry to the sides of that main stack. strut it up to the center at the tops and bottoms. Add pairs of sepatrons to the side which will seperate it. remember that the center of the boosters mass when it\u0027s empty will be near the bottom. take that into consideration and but the sepatrons near the bottom too, to minimise booster rotation. Add a fuel line to that booster\u0027s bottom tank, leading to the bottom tank on the main stack. Duplicate that booster pair and add two more pairs around the center. connect the fuel lines in an asparagus-style and fix the staging. I know this is complicated, but I\u0027m going to make a video about it soon so stay tuned \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/CM2rt_klOvc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-09T23:05:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2013 11:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by nhnifong\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
