But landing on buildings with rockets, VTOLs, and helicopters is BORING. Been there, done that. So I set myself a challenge to get up there WITHOUT the use of any sort of flying machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDigging deep into my collection of odd parts, I noticed something I\u0027d never had a use for before, the \u0022Ball Bearing\u0022 from TT\u0027s Modular Multiwheels. This is a Damned Robotics Rotator that\u0027s had its motor stripped out so it\u0027s just a free-spinning joint. This insired me to create a trebuchet-type Kerbalflinger\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBEHOLD!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IKnGdlA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IKnGdlA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis monstrosity is basically a small probe core with a long string of box girders below and small fuel tank and radial engine above. It has a Ball Bearing on each side \u0022more or less\u0022 on the arm\u0027s CoM, which are connected to the towers. Capsules at the bottoms of the towers hold Kerbals as they work up their courage to take a ride.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mXuk3jK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mXuk3jK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere Jeb has left the capsule and strapped himself upside down into the lawn chair at the end of the arm. At his back is a radial parachute and under the seat is a decoupler. The spotlight arrays were added just to adjust the balance of the arm but they do make a nice light show at night \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce ready, Jeb fires up the radial engine and the arm begins to spin. Here\u0027s the windup....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CESNWO9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CESNWO9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the pitch!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b2yX819.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b2yX819.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s in the dirt well short of the plate. Ball 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say, this took MANY tries to get even half-way right. The whole machine is quite elastic so if you get it spinning too fast, Jeb gets splattered on the ground between the towers. Or, because it\u0027s not QUITE balanced, it will eventually shake itself to pieces if you let it run too long. So the trick is to get it going at the right speed and QUICKLY hit the decoupler before anything too bad happens, but you have to time it right to get the necessary altitude and distance. There are quite a few Jeb-shaped craters between the Launchpad and the VAB now, and also some Jeb-sized holes in the VAB wall \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut eventually I started to get the hang of it..

Not on the landing pad but all the stairways and ladders up there work so Jeb was able to climb the rest of the way himself.
