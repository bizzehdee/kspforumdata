I have a question regarding testflight. I am not a modder per-se but I find myself in the configs, closing and reloading the game more than actually playing it these days. I have a few questions for anyone knowledgeable enough to help me. Please keep in mind that I know next to nothing about coding, everything that I have done successfully in the files thus far is by either looking it up online or referencing a part that does what I want another part to do and inferring what code does the thing i want, transferring that to the part in question, load the game, if successful yay! If not, close game, back to the files, tweak, reload game. I just wanted you to get an idea of my experience. by the way I am playing KSP with RSSRO/RP1/Realfuels/TestFlight/\u002Bother mods\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCan anyone please write a \u0022fake\u0022 config that utilizes every one of the features so that I can take that as a template and utilize what I want from it?\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother huge question is, I heard, you used to have to construct engine test stands and test fire engines, but they changed it. I would love to have the option to do that. is there a way? how would I go about that? I would love to be able to have the option to develop an engine from the ground up like in real life.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI value everyone of you guy\u0027s time, I appreciate anyone who even reads this. I will await a response. Hopefully soon...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
