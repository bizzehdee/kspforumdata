The craft does pretty well until the edge of the atmosphere, where I have to switch to the rockets. I was originally using a LV-45, but that didn\u0027t work out, so i swapped it for any aerospike. I haven\u0027t tested the aerospike version yet, so i don\u0027t know if it will fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having mechjeb to control the jets so they don\u0027t flame out mid ascent. I only have three ideas. One: add MOAR intakes. Two: use only 2 turbojets. Three: get the canned air mod.

If you use 2 MK2 tanks instead of the 4 MK1 you save weight and get more fuel. If you don\u0027t care for visuals that much you can use the MK2 cockpit to save weight. Also, use either full wings or none, that bit won\u0027t get you much lift and the engine gimbal should be enough for maneuvering. You strut too much and the structural hardpoints are unnecessary. Lastly, the landing legs are overkill. Use the lighter ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
