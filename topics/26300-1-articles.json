This continual flexing causes the heat (just as bending a wire repeatedly will heat it up), especially for the moons close to Jupiter where the tidal forces are very strong, so Io gets a lot of heating, Europa gets less, etc...and we assume a similar effect will be going on with the moons of Jool. Now, tidal forces will also work to circularize the moon\u0027s orbit, so if there was only one moon that is small enough compared to its planet, it would eventually settle down into a perfectly circular orbit and the tidal heating would be much less (it would still occur at a lower level because tidal effects between the planet and moon will cause it to very slowly move away from the planet...and the planet will do some work on the moon to lock it into 1:1 orbit at its new slightly larger distance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of the inner three Galilean moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa, Ganymede), they are locked in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance. This is also the case with Jool\u0027s moons Laythe, Vall, and Tylo. In maintaining this orbital resonance, the moons tug on each other and affect each others orbits, so the eccentricity of their orbits do not stay perfectly circular. As a result, Jool does the tidal heating thing on them. (In KSP this would not actually happen because gravitational forces do not work between the moons because of the simplified physics model used in the game...and they have circular orbits...but if more realistic physics was at work, you would see a similar result there). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis heat works it way out of the moons in question, and that\u0027s what causes the volcanic and tectonic activity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cryocasm","CreatedById":5299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T12:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESure it could, you would only experience most of the water fleeing away to the side of the planet pointing towards Jool.
