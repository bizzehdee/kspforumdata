You can increase the heat flow through TIM by increasing temperature gradient. Since you want CPU to stay cool, you need to make external temperature positively frigid. You can either use thermoelectric cooler between CPU and liquid cooler, or you can put your liquid through a refrigerator. Both are done occasionally for extreme overclocking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday with heat pipes this is true, heat pipes works almost as well as water cooling downside is that they are solid so you are limited to 12 cm heat sinks and fans internally. water cooling lets you get past this up larger sizes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 years ago before heat pipes water cooling was more relevant as the traditional coolers don\u0027t work as well\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T04:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EToday with heat pipes this is true, heat pipes works almost as well as water cooling downside is that they are solid so you are limited to 12 cm heat sinks and fans internally. water cooling lets you get past this up larger sizes. \u003Cp\u003E10 years ago before heat pipes water cooling was more relevant as the traditional coolers don\u0027t work as well\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, but external heat sinks on yeolde water-cooled systems had the same limitation.
