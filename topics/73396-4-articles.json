I won\u0027t even go into the poor designs and lack of foresight in \u003Cem\u003E2010\u003C/em\u003E, but they serve as a view of what conventional science fiction was at the time.

That\u0027s the problem right there in a nutshell. I\u0027m sitting in a movie theatre. I don\u0027t have those notes, and I may not even have read the book. It\u0027s Kubrick\u0027s job to explain things to me or at least make the movie comprehensible. I shouldn\u0027t have to go find script notes to be able to say \u0022ah ok, now I see what\u0027s going on.\u0022 \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a kind of an intellectual boomerang I\u0027m gonna ask why do you feel that movies need to be made exclusively comprehensible on first or second time watching? You don\u0027t expect this from a painting, a poem, a song or a sculpture nor always from a book. You\u0027re expected to stare at Mona Lisa\u0027s smile after centuries and still ponder what it\u0027s really about or you can read a poem over and over and over, find new thoughts rising and new feelings. And not to mention authors like Sartre who can easily pour a lifetime of thoughts in a book. If a movie is not easily understood, why exactly is it not a good movie?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can agree that it\u0027s longwinded and difficult at times to watch and obviously the art of storytelling an conveying ideas through film has developed a lot in the last 40\u002B years. I can totally understand if someone doesn\u0027t like it. I don\u0027t like opera. It\u0027s incomprehensible, loud and boring with cliche stories. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever saying that Kubrick failed or that there\u0027s no plot is something that I think is a bit of an oversimplification. Just as I can\u0027t really say Pavarotti is a bad singer because I haven\u0027t got a clue what he\u0027s yodling about now. 2001 is not a movie made for quick entertainment, it\u0027s more philosophy and art and exactly as was inteded by the director. If Kubrick had failed, there would be no 10 page discussion. You couldn\u0027t get two pages from Transformers unless you start posting pictures of Megan Fox. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to see a REALLY long winded and boring movie, go watch Stalker or any other Tarkovski movie.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T13:26:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^^^this, why is it that films are always expected to be clear, concise and entertaining.

Original Trilogy, I mean. There\u0027s a saga that didn\u0027t need to go out of its way to explain every little nuance. It left so much to our imaginations, that fans were able to keep the fire going for decade and a half. Nobody knew how the war got started, but we could use what information we had to make an educated guess. People bickered about whether or not the Alliance was even the definitive \u0027good guy\u0027 in the whole ordeal. What exactly was \u0022The Force?\u0022 Was it an intelligent entity like some kind of \u0027heartbeat of the universe?\u0027 A collective unconscious? Did it have \u0022a plan?\u0022 How did Vader get hurt? How did Luke and Leia get hidden from him? People were gathering as much data as they could about the capabilities of Star Destroyers and the Death Star, trying to guess at what kind of resources and power would be required.
