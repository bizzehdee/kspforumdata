The process appears to encompass the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Kerbal goes EVA. This causes a Kerbal to become a \u0022vessel\u0022, and becomes the active vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Right clicking on an External seat and then \u0022board\u0022 when in range causes the kerbal to become a \u0022part\u0022 attached to the External Seat part\u0027s vessel and referenced in the seat\u0027s KerbalSeat Module as an occupant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. When leaving the seat, right clicking on the kerbal exposes the Leave seat action. Clicking this causes the kerbal to become a vessel again as the active vessel... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Finally, the user clicks on the board action of the next external seat. This causes the kerbal to again become a part, and the steps in 2 above occur again with the new seat part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo emulate this, I will have to fire the appropriate events, and allow unity to handle the callbacks. This means that I need to allow the frame to update as needed so that the callbacks are fired. So, I\u0027m going to have to create a persist model for the kerbal event states when EVA, and track the activity to ensure proper operations. This also means the the transfer will cause the scene to \u0022change\u0022 as the active vessel changes from ship to kerbal and back to ship...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething else I\u0027ve discovered is that when a kerbal is sitting in an external seat, it will appear in the SM part list, when the ship to which the kerbal is attached is the active vessel. Attempting to transfer the kerbal cause \u0022interesting issues\u0022... The transferr appears to work to an internal part, but the kerbal\u0027s \u0022body\u0022 remains, and now has a Kerbal count of \u00220\u0022. Switching away from the ship and back then generates repeating unhandled errors in KSP... I will have to fix that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not given up, but it will involve a fair amount of additional plumbing to make it happen and the addition of some handling code when the kerbal is the active vessel. Currently, my code causes SM to be hidden when a kerbal is the active vessel...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, in reference to Remote Tech command queuing, I\u0027m still looking at how to support that. Not forgotten, but deferred for the short term. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I\u0027ve made the necessary changes to correct the missing RT antennas, and a fix for the \u0022Unknowns\u0022 sometimes displayed in the hatch list of the Control Window.
