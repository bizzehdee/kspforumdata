One for perfectly ok part. And another for various degrees of damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, some gameplay affecting effects coudl be implemented. Impact on engine woudl decrease its maximum trust. Small bump en fuel tank woudl just add texture cracks on surface, but stronger coudl create leak that woudl additionally add small thrust in the place where gas or liquid is leaking (and kerbal coudl fix it on eva). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if devs are considering to implement on of these.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-25T15:38:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2013 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by kiwiak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T11:18:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsidering? Sure, I\u0027d say they probably are. Trouble is, KSP\u0027s already very resource-intensive on a lot of machines.
