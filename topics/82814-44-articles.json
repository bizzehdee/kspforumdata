It\u0027s to the point where I\u0027ve got a facility on Dres that contained all those mods (plus Kethane) in a single massive HX4 based structure, not to mention the troop transport in LDO that can carry over 600 Kerbals using B9 parts almost entirely... I might just decide to bow out and finish the few ships that only had MJ onboard and call it good enough for me. It\u0027s a little bit too bad for me, since I was planning to try to figure if Dres would make a nice home planet for production of my ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuess it\u0027s time to grab those screenshots and ship files and make some uploads soon. A few of those stock ships were fairly nice, IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Adding my ship catalog here, since I\u0027ve yet to do that. Also, ignore any typos you might see, some of this I was typing using my tablet, in which I turned off the autocorrect \u0027feature\u0027 due to massive annoyance at it destroying half my text.

The basic version is armed with 4 Rail Rods, 1 Hydra rocket pod, and 1 .50 BMG turret. There is a MechJeb unit placed in the frontal cargo bay, designed to enable fine control of the ship in the current forwards orientation. With a light fuel load, the ship has 1887 m/s dV, but can hold enough fuel to expand this to 4035 m/s dV. It is entirely possible to remove the weapons and allow this ship to be reclassified as an armored fuel tanker, though most of the fuel tanks are drawn from to power the engines. Care must be taken with operating this ship, as it can have an off center CoM very easily, though the SAS and drone units can help keep the ship pointed in the correct direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E277 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/xd2YQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

While they are very slow, their range is extraordinary. Militarily, the Nuclear Snake has a wide variety of applications, ranging from troop transport (28 Kerbals), drone carrier, refueler, and many more. This version has been armored for use in combat zones. Care must be taken in order to protect the vulnerable engine sections, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin orbit stats\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmpty: 7957 dV @ 0.35 TWR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E120T: 4093 dV @ 0.22 TWR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs shown, 558 parts.

Most of the modifications necessary to change what the ship is transporting is located in the frontal sections. The large central fuel tank is capable of having extremely large docking ports attached to it, though the factory installed port is a mere 1.25m port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA nice feature of the Hyperstar is the amount of space onboard for extra crew. This can be extended with a setup for crew transport, much like this variant has been. An extra bonus is the 4m cargo bay, capable of containing a wide variety of extra cargo. A rear cargo bay is onboard, thoigh the ship\u0027s reactor systems are locared there; thus it is ill advised to replace the contents of the rear bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis crew transport version can carry up to 42 Kerbals and has 5508 dV @ 0.40 TWR. 78 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures go here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-28T17:29:26Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2014 05:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by OCAdam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding in ship catalog\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
