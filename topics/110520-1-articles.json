This means that I can spam science and restore everything. So far, it seems that I have been limited by the amount of scientific records in the various capsules. As an example, I think I can only store one materials study in the mk1 cockpit and the inline cockpit. But the research laboratory can seemingly store infinite science! (or as long as I have been using it, it has not reached a cap). But, the science loses tons of value when transmitted, so I want to go retrieve it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I am so tightly limited by the capacity of the capsules, I have just thought of sending a transfer laboratory up there with a heat shield on it so that I can reenter with it, and retrieve all the sweet sweet science. That seems like a good idea, but a little counterintuitive. So is there anyway I can retrieve the science with capsules?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I haven\u0027t found any info on just how much science each capsule can hold. There isn\u0027t any list of how many Mits of data or how many of each science module each capsule can hold, so I was wondering if any of you all knew?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T20:34:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 08:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jeffdude\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T18:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe actual limit in the capsule is one result per experiment per location (as the experiment sees locations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you can launch into a polar orbit and get an EVA report over every biome, since EVA reports consider being over different biomes as different locations while \u0022in space near\u0022 a planet or moon. The thermometer, on the other hand, will only get one report \u0022in space near\u0022 since the surface biome doesn\u0027t affect the results that the experiment generates at that height.

So, if I return a science lab, can I bring multiples of each experiment from one location?

And while you can store the experiments in the lab, and return them, you don\u0027t necessarily get all the science that it says. It will read \u002B50science when you gather the data, but when you recover it, you only get one or two copies of that biome, and the rest are \u002B0 science. Well, I knew it seemed too good to be true that I could just keep spamming the materials moduels and getting crap tons of science!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T21:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the science you can get from any set of duplicates is capped, usually well below an extra 50% of the amount you get from the first one, though there are exceptions. The amount of science that it reports assumes that nothing gets turned in between the time you run the experiment and the time you turn it in, and if you\u0027ve got duplicates, then they can\u0027t all be the first one turned in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T21:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you put data into your science lab, it will not be deleted from your capsule AFAIK.

You can guess it from the length of the blue bar when you get the result. If the bar fills up the entire space available, it\u0027s a one-shot experiment.
