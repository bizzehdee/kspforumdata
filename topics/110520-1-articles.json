This means that I can spam science and restore everything. So far, it seems that I have been limited by the amount of scientific records in the various capsules. As an example, I think I can only store one materials study in the mk1 cockpit and the inline cockpit. But the research laboratory can seemingly store infinite science! (or as long as I have been using it, it has not reached a cap). But, the science loses tons of value when transmitted, so I want to go retrieve it. \n\nIf I am so tightly limited by the capacity of the capsules, I have just thought of sending a transfer laboratory up there with a heat shield on it so that I can reenter with it, and retrieve all the sweet sweet science. That seems like a good idea, but a little counterintuitive. So is there anyway I can retrieve the science with capsules?\n\nSo far, I haven\u0027t found any info on just how much science each capsule can hold. There isn\u0027t any list of how many Mits of data or how many of each science module each capsule can hold, so I was wondering if any of you all knew?\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T20:34:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 08:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jeffdude**"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T18:37:09Z","Content":"The actual limit in the capsule is one result per experiment per location (as the experiment sees locations).\n\nSo you can launch into a polar orbit and get an EVA report over every biome, since EVA reports consider being over different biomes as different locations while \u0022in space near\u0022 a planet or moon. The thermometer, on the other hand, will only get one report \u0022in space near\u0022 since the surface biome doesn\u0027t affect the results that the experiment generates at that height. It will, however, be able to store a second report if taken \u0022high above\u0022 the planet since that is a separate location.\n\nEven crew reports can be done this way, though since the capsule acts like a science part, you have to remove the results via EVA before you can run a second crew report."},{"CreatedByName":"KarateF22","CreatedById":143090,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T18:45:39Z","Content":"You can hold every single unique result in the game, keyword being unique.

So, if I return a science lab, can I bring multiples of each experiment from one location? It seems that I\u0027m able to store multiple materials studies from high over the mun in the lab, so presumably, if I land and recover, will I get science for each of them? Thanks.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWell, I found out. And while you can store the experiments in the lab, and return them, you don\u0027t necessarily get all the science that it says. It will read \u002B50science when you gather the data, but when you recover it, you only get one or two copies of that biome, and the rest are \u002B0 science. Well, I knew it seemed too good to be true that I could just keep spamming the materials moduels and getting crap tons of science!"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T21:24:17Z","Content":"Yeah, the science you can get from any set of duplicates is capped, usually well below an extra 50% of the amount you get from the first one, though there are exceptions. The amount of science that it reports assumes that nothing gets turned in between the time you run the experiment and the time you turn it in, and if you\u0027ve got duplicates, then they can\u0027t all be the first one turned in."},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T21:55:24Z","Content":"If you put data into your science lab, it will not be deleted from your capsule AFAIK. It will place a copy into the laband you can still return the experiment to kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T22:03:20Z","Content":"Some experiements are one-shot: returning one temperature reading will give you all the science point you can get for \u0022termperature in situation \u0026 biome\u0022.\n\nOthers can be repeated, but at diminishing returns. You can guess it from the length of the blue bar when you get the result. If the bar fills up the entire space available, it\u0027s a one-shot experiment. If the bar is shorter, this indicates how many of the available science points you will get. \n\nSurface samples from Minmus\u0027 Lowlands can yield up to 200 science points, but you only get 75% of the remaining points for every sample you return.\n\n- 1st sample: 150 points (50 remaining)\n- 2nd sample: 37.5 points (that\u0027s 75% of the 50 points; 12.5 still remaining after the second sample)\n- 3rd sample: 9.4 points\n- and so on\n\nThe quota for repeatables typically is 75-90%. Personally, I try to get every experiment in triplicate. That\u0027s probably over the top / not justified by the cost of sending either a third pod or a lab, but I can\u0027t help it. Though these days, I only return two and leave the third with a lab."}]}
