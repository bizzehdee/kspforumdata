With RPM, on the vessel view screen, as soon as I go to part selector, it selects the pod as the active part, and only lists parts directly attached to the pod. I cannot for instance, select any engines, solar panels, or anything else not directly attached to the pod. Pressing the back button just goes back to the main menu.

Something that would help with IVA-only flights is if you were able to transfer resources (fuel et al) between storage parts. Something like, select resource transfer option -\u0026gt; select resource -\u0026gt; select first tank -\u0026gt; select second tank -\u0026gt; start/stop pumping.
