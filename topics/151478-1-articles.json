Which parameters do you need and how hard it is to do. I\u0027m building a cargo plane and I\u0022m stuck trying got figure out the max payload potential to kerbin or minimus etc. I know how to calculate delta V once I\u0022m in orbit and flying in space. But not payload from kerbin to orbit. Particularly with a space plane flying most of the time with jet engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using a combined engine type also.

Total spaceplane mass roughly 4x payload, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) build a replica of your spaceplane with fuel as payload and launch it.
