If you posted one without a craft file, someone would probably ask, but your post wouldn\u0027t be ignored because of the lack of one. What people cared about was the images of the craft, at least for replicas. I think Cupcake and Rune\u0027s stuff got more downloads, since it was more functional. Some of the craft which I posted, and got many rep for, could not fly or work at all without cheats, so downloading it wouldn\u0027t give you an experience much different from looking at the pictures.\n\nI made and posted those crafts because it was fun, and I enjoyed sharing them and seeing what others had made, and I would order the feedback I got in order of importance like this:\n\n1. Someone using a technique of mine in something of their own\n2. Text replies\n3. Rep, likes\n4. Downloads of the craft file\n\nIf I had someone \u0022ransoming\u0022 the craft files that they had made for money, I would think it was odd that they were even bothering to make it if they wanted a reward external to building it, and I would feel the same way about asking for rep. I do think asking for rep would discourage me and others from both \u0022liking\u0022 the post and actually liking the craft. Honestly I would think the extra work of PM\u0027ing everyone who \u0022liked\u0022 it would not be worth the rep."},{"CreatedByName":"The Minmus Derp","CreatedById":187595,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-07T16:59:38Z","Content":"I agree."},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-07T18:14:15Z","Content":"Maybe make those posts in that thread? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"The Minmus Derp","CreatedById":187595,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-07T18:48:45Z","Content":"Ok."},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-08T00:02:10Z","Content":"When you like a post, do you get 1 reputation?"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-08T00:44:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 41 minutes ago, The\\_Cat\\_In\\_Space said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E When you like a post, do you get 1 reputation?\n\u003E \n\nNo, the poster to whom\u0027s post you liked receives it."},{"CreatedByName":"DeltaDizzy","CreatedById":150755,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-08T00:45:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just now, klesh said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E No, the poster to whom\u0027s post you liked receives it.\n\u003E \n\nor, simply put, when your post gets liked, you get rep.
