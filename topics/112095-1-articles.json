It also unlocks your technology tree as if magic, and lets you change the upgrade state of your buildings (currently all at the same time). Future plans are to set the reputation level.\n\n![IZKBSfa.png](http://i.imgur.com/IZKBSfa.png)\n\nForeword\n\nI have always been a fan of career mode in Kerbal Space Program. I\u0027ve played it more or less religiously. However, there comes a time when you have done a lot: built your stations, collected that tricky piece of science data from the outskirts of the Kerbol system. You feel like it would be nice to start over, but you do not want to spend all the time grinding science, but rather build nice rockets and fulfil contracts.\n\nEnter the greatest thing with career mode: the contracts. There are contract packs giving you hundreds of new things to accomplish. You can gain reputation, science or funds for this. You can be told to go to mostly anywhere in the Kerbol system, as well as building satellite networks around your planets. There will always be something for you to do.\n\nHere comes the dilemma that gave birth to this mod: Sandbox mode has no contracts. Science mode has no contracts. It is only in career mode that this wonderful feature is available.\n\nCareerLite\n\nI call this mod CareerLite - it allows you to play the game your way. As of version 0.1, the features are not many. It basically locks your funds to 99 999 999 999. And there is no way to stop it from doing so (well, if you do find a way, file an issue please!).\n\nOne can argue that the functionality is already in the game. You can go into the debug menu and add money, then go build your rockets. Yes, this is true. This is also how I did it before. However, the goal and scope of this mod will be extended.\n\nWhy would I use this?\n\nThere are many scenarios for this:\n\n\\* I want to play with infinite funds, no limit on science, but my Kerbals still need to level up.\n\n\\* I want to play with funds, contracts, but not worry about science.\n\n\\* I want to play an open tree career mode with funds, where I have to purchase the parts but not worry about science experiments.\n\n\\* I want to play a science mode career, where my Kerbals level up, but I do not want to worry about funds.\n\nI think you might see the idea here ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nFuture plans\n\nIn 0.6 and beyond, a couple of new features are planned.\n\nA way to lock your reputation.\n\nReleases\n\nAll releases will be made available on Github:\n\n[https://github.com/tivec/CareerLite/releases](https://github.com/tivec/CareerLite/releases)\n\n[Source is available on GitHub as well.](https://github.com/tivec/CareerLite/)\n\nThis plugin is released under the GPLv3 license.\n\nAs of version 0.4, this plugin depends on AstrotechUtilities, GPLv3 licensed and source [available on GitHub](https://github.com/tivec/AstrotechUtilities).
