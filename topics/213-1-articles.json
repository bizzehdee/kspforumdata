If you want to control it, level your orbit out at the top or bottom of the eccentricity by accelerating or decelerating to the circular orbit velocity. Once leveled out you can accelerate into a transfer orbit that will leave you an eccentric orbit with perigee where you started and apogee at the transfer target. Once at apogee you can level out by accelerating to the circular orbit velocity for that altitude. Lesson complete.

You then do the exact same thing a half orbit later to circularize the orbit. You want to burn to set your velocity at periapsis or apoapsis, when your vertical velocity is zero. Real burns take time, and you\u0027ll end up with some vertical velocity at the end of the burn (ideally you\u0027d start before reaching apoapsis or periapsis, but judging that is difficult with present instrumentation), but correcting the resulting near-circular orbit will take shorter and more precise burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve got plenty of propellant, you can shorten this a bit by burning straight toward or away from Kerbin to zero out vertical velocity as you cross the altitude you desire...this puts you at periapsis or apoapsis of a new elliptical orbit, and you can then burn directly into a near circular orbit from there.
