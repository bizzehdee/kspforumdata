I gave it more steering than that, includiing, on a launch that came after the attempt pictured, 4 fins. There are also 2 reaction wheels, a 1.25m wheel right under the command pod, and the probe hidden in the fairing has a small reaction wheel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint 2, I did attempt it with fins, and I always use the AV-R8\u0027s when I use fins. It still flipped about. However you suggest putting them on the boosters, and that I didn\u0027t do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint 3.The fairing is that size because of the orbital survey scanner on the top probe. If I try to keep the fairing to 1.25m it clips through or won\u0027t let me place it. I wound up launching it with 2.5m parts, although all I did was remove everything under the first tank under the lander, put a rockomax adapter on it, then launched 2 stage rockomax tanks/engines and fins.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint A, I did this. but only on the center stack.

The only way I fixed that permanently was when I learned about interstage fairings. I\u0027ve launched a few multi-probe rockets since then, and to make them smooth I\u0027ve had to use rockomax tanks. I was trying to avoid it for cost purposes, but less launch stress is helpful too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your thoughts and insights. I will definately incorporate the new info in my future launches\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt actually leads me to a different question.
