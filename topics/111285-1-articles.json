I have seen people call it the \u0022Remove control ship bug\u0022. I was on the Mun messing around and when I go left or right the ship turns with me and turns over therefore making EVA\u0027s almost impossible without tipping over the ship. I can see the engine gimbals turning when I press A or D so i know its a bugGoing to the KSC helps but it turns off the SAS making the ship very unstable.
