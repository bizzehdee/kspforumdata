I have seen people call it the \u0022Remove control ship bug\u0022. I was on the Mun messing around and when I go left or right the ship turns with me and turns over therefore making EVA\u0027s almost impossible without tipping over the ship. I can see the engine gimbals turning when I press A or D so i know its a bugGoing to the KSC helps but it turns off the SAS making the ship very unstable. I need help.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T19:28:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dspan\\_000**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dspan_000","CreatedById":144320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T19:28:31Z","Content":"Nvm fixed it myself"},{"CreatedByName":"nfpinto","CreatedById":143049,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:13:08Z","Content":"how did you fixed it? perhaps if you put a solution, someone with the same sort of problem can find your way to fix"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T02:08:29Z","Content":"This bug appears when there is trim input in the craft. Pressing any of the control keys causes SAS to unlock for all ships in physics range. So any ships that have trim input will rotate when the SAS unlocks. So it\u0027s not quite \u0022remote control.\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E how did you fixed it? perhaps if you put a solution, someone with the same sort of problem can find your way to fix\n\nYou fix it by switching to the vessel, and pressing MOD\u002BX (Alt\u002BX in windows) to zero out the trim state.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
