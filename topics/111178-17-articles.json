I have been working on a replacement version for this mod for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E series for several months. It started as an expansion pack for this mod but became a full re-write after Whitecat quit modding. It aims to completely re-write and majorly expand this entire mod from beginning to end. First for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E and then for stock. The beta of 622 contracts is available for testing over in this thread [\\[Wip\\] History of Spaceflight - Contract Pack for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173683-wip-history-of-spaceflight-contract-pack-for-rorp-0/)\n\u003E \n\nIf \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E we\u0027re updated to 1.4.2, I\u0027d just on this immediately!
