Tried to get some help from my little kompanions, but noticed that their piloting skills gained in space are not so helpful. So, here is my solution (points can be accepted independently):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. If possible, diverting space astronauts from airborne pilots, creating two different discipline. Of course, already existing pilots should be handled properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Skills for airborne pilots could give different assistance for driving the aircrafts. An example: Level 1 gives ability for level flight, Level 2 maintains heading, Level 3 Auto throttle for speed, Level 4 Navigation, Level 5 Auto-landing ability\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. The above point considers a similar but slightly different navigation system as used for space navigation. Flight planning shall really mean what it tells, inspired by real life air traffic solutions :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese so far in general, just a canvas for creating the mid-air career for the kerbals, can be refined in many ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS.: I know there already exist many solutions for autopiloting (MechJeb etc.), but I can imagine these features embedded in the vanilla too, at least on the mentioned way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-05T11:28:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Suggestions forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-06T01:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s really a space game.\u00A0 Planes are mostly in the game because of space shuttles and theoretical SSTOs.\u00A0 Plus IRL a lot of astronauts were airborne pilots.\u00A0 Finally, and most importantly, the Kerbal class system sucks.\u00A0 It should be removed, not expanded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-06T12:12:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t mind the option for \u0022fly level\u0022 - but I think it needs to be quite early in the ranks, or even a starter, for it to be useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Strategia mod offers the ability for pilots to improve fuel efficiency, maybe that\u0027s something that could be available at 5-stars?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-07T17:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, a\u00A0maintain current altitude and\u00A0pitch (relative to ground) function would certainly be welcome\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sereneti","CreatedById":163637,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-08T11:00:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Skill system sucks.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou had to fly to another planet, that the kerbals are usefull.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA pilot are more useless: you can use a drone -core and had all the things that a level 5 pilot can do. with less money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
