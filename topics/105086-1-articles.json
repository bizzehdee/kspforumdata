I haven\u0027t heard if the variable is editable in the persistence file, but I assume so. Which isn\u0027t to say that you\u0027ll be able to just say \u0022increase the ore the Mun\u0027s north pole.\u0022 You\u0027ll probably have to know the seed number that would generate said deposit."},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T02:19:54Z","Content":"Or just fiddle with the number (probably have to restart) and look at an insta-scan of the planet to see what\u0027s where, perhaps?"}]}
