If you include what was spent during Constellation on this number, as well as what we\u0027re going to spend on it by the time EM-2 lifts off, then sure it\u0027ll probably cost about that much (though you\u0027re still over by a billion provided the numbers stay consistent), but its not particularly fair to do so given the fact that Orion under Constellation was screwed over just badly as every other aspect of Constellation was. What we\u0027ve spent since then was to redesign and actually get the thing ready, and thus far we\u0027ve actually spent less and accomplished more in a smaller amount of time compared to Constellation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, we haven\u0027t invented some revolutionary new tech out of doing so, but we have done what Constellation set out to do originally in regards to the Orion, and thats simply to provide a safer, more reliable spacecraft that can be used to ferry crew to and from space. The capsule design fits this bill perfectly and efficiently. And regardless, Orion itself was never something that would have led to a new technology anyway, nor should have ever been expected to. It is a relatively simple spacecraft that has a simple purpose that plays a relatively minor role in the scheme of things. Trying to up the ante, technologically speaking, in the wake of the Shuttle program would have been the wrong the idea. Our technological progress as a whole needs to move forward a considerable way before we can try to make that leap from a spacecraft to spaceship. (IE, the difference between a throwaway pod named Endeavor that often gets forgotten and a spaceplane named Endeavor that\u0027s highly regarded and well known by the common man, even though the former technically accomplished something more historically important than the latter did)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure it sounds like we shouldn\u0027t have issues building one, but the problem is is that NASA hasn\u0027t built or seriously designed one in over 50 years, and in that time frame, they\u0027ve spent the vast majority of their time designing, flying, and maintaining a completely different type of space craft. This is the same reason why NASA has very few in-house engines, and why old F1\u0027s were being pulled off museum displays and studied. It simply isn\u0027t actually that simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo, its hardly silly. The US has lacked manned capability for years now and there\u0027s no real reason to outsource to Russia for this capability, especially when NASA is focusing more and more on deep space exploration as the private sector begins to enter LEO. Russia won\u0027t have manned deep space capability (and likely won\u0027t for a long long time, though I don\u0027t claim to know much about Russia\u0027s plans) and theres only one private company that\u0027ll be able to provide deep space capability and even that rocket won\u0027t be a perfect solution the problem either, as the Falcon Heavy is optimized primarily for LEO, and won\u0027t be able to deliver what the SLS will be able to deliver to any particular BEO location. Even when taking orbital construction into consideration, you\u0027re still not matching the SLS. The same number of SLS launches are going to deliver more to a particular location than the FH will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDragon and Orion have different purposes. Orion was never meant to be anything more than what it is, nor does it need to be. We don\u0027t need fancy bells and whistles for a spacecraft whose purpose is largely crew ferrying from Earth to a proper mission module/LEO and back. Reliability and safety is key for this purpose, and Orion will provide this in spades. From the very beginning, Orion\u0027s overall purpose was to replace the shuttle as a crew vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA has never deviated from exploration, and its only threw this overall purpose that its delved into so many different fields. They all ultimately go back to whats going to benefit space exploration and in turn benefit the planet as a whole. Nothing NASA is involved in of its own accord is something that won\u0027t eventually come back into (or come from, for that matter) the space program in one way or another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, all that being said, its no secret that Orion and SLS have huge problems in that they were projects that were dictated to NASA rather than something NASA chose to pursue of their own accord, and as such leads to problems of the lack of payloads and active goals. And this really isn\u0027t NASA\u0027s fault (its administrative issues aside). Much of the manned programs problems since it began have largely stemmed from Congress and/or the White House dictating the how, what, and why of what NASA can design and build. This is why the shuttle program grew to be as convoluted as it was compared to what it would have been, and this is why NASA is building a rocket without a truly active manned program in effect. What we\u0027re seeing now is pretty much the equivalent of building and designing the Saturn V without a Kennedy figure saying we need to be on the Moon in 10 years or bust, with the added strain that is keeping alive a vast infrastructure that was developed to support a spacecraft that wasn\u0027t ever fully utilized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn response to the post above me: Technically, NASA was already established in all but name when the Soviet space program popped up on the radar. NASA was essentially just NACA, but refocused towards space exploration. But no, to say that NASA has no more use is just woefully ignorant, because it literally ignores everything that NASA has done since 1969. And competition is only ever a good thing, regardless of what we\u0027re talking about, because in the end everybody else profits. (Unless we\u0027re talking Cold War arms build up type competition, but that\u0027s a special situation) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECancelling the manned spaceflight program is just ridiculous.

In addition to Falcon 9 Heavy, which begins flying next year, SpaceX are working on their next generation rocket, which is provisionally referred to as the \u0022Big Falcon Rocket\u0022 (BFR).

Meanwhile, once the ISS program ends, SpaceX and other commercial space companies are expected to sit back and do nothing while SLS and Orion paralyze NASA with crippling costs for many decades to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECasey Dreier painted an exceptionally pessimistic picture during a debate at the Mars Society Annual Convention in August. I had a chance to speak to him after the debate. His view is that SLS and Orion have too much political support to be cancelled, and that NASA are stuck with them for decades to come. His view is that SLS and Orion should be allowed to fly make-work missions in order to defer the cost of hardware needed for real missions for as long as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oo4-ros2yEk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T19:10:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003Cp\u003EOrion is reusable?
