[Here\u0027s a Reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1c5zmi/official_statement_on_expansions_dlc_and_the/) about it what I found on Google."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T19:07:47Z","Content":"@regex\n\nA post like that is exactly what I was thinking Squad needs to write to help clear everything up. With the game now in experimentals, Squad is going to be extra busy on top of their normal reticence to discuss these issues so I\u0027m not really expecting to hear anything from Squad, at least not until after the game releases. Hopefully at that point the devs will be more willing to talk about things after a post-release vacation.\n\nAt this point, despite my disagreements with Squad\u0027s decisions and my resulting posts voicing my concerns (and sometimes with a little criticism), I\u0027m really hoping for an excellent release. I want to be proven wrong and shown that my concerns were unfounded, above all I really just want to play an amazing version of KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"Renkov","CreatedById":139231,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T20:57:16Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been playing Kerbal for some time, but fairly new to the forums. I took the time to read this entire thread today, whilst my bosses weren\u0027t looking, and I get the impression that I\u0027m one of a few players who just love the game. I have no serious complaints about it. Yeah I\u0027d like some things fixed and changed, but those are petty gripes. I\u0027d like my fuel cap on my car to be a bit more secure but I wouldn\u0027t demand the company hold up all of production just to fix my little issue. And no, I don\u0027t play with mods. Some of them are really cool looking, but I want to play Squad\u0027s Kerbal Space Progam, not some one elses. Even if I did have a mod and bugs were popping up, I wouldn\u0027t hold Squad accountable. \n\nI do remember earlier on the issue with the big orange tanks and over heating. I was equally frustrated and annoyed with the large rockets wobbling about with the older SAS system. The infini-gliders are kinda fun, but those are gonna disappear as well with the new atmosphere system. Bugs are being dealt with. Full disclosure, I haven\u0027t come across any. \n\nSave that one time my space station mysteriously exploded and sent debris in all directions at 3/4\u0027s the speed of light. That was a notable day as all of my crew were back on Kerbin ready to launch again. Would Love to have heard Jeb explain that incident.\n\nEven that bug was before .25 and I want to say ARM. I like this game, I love what it does, and what it intends to do. I get the feeling that it isn\u0027t about a continual development cycle, it\u0027s about the players always wanting more regardless. I imagine if there was clouds and night time light pollution then some one would be demanding to hit birds on the way up, or to see Aura Borealis.\n\nIf an asteroid took out every member of Squad I\u0027d still be happy to play .9 as the final development. This game did so much more than I expected and taught me a lot about math and science. I hit a point where I was ready to do calculations and research before I launched a rocket. I hit that point honestly a long time ago, . The rest has been frosting."},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T21:18:26Z","Content":"\u003E If an asteroid took out every member of Squad I\u0027d still be happy\n\n![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T21:53:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t play with mods...
