This would also be useful with a stock solar system, as Eeloo would be significantly darker than a planet closer to Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T22:08:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe closest I\u0027ve ever seen is blizzy\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71536\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eambient light adjustment plugin\u003C/a\u003E.

IIRC the light levels on Pluto are comparable to a typical living room, and Sedna at its furthest still receives about as much light as a full Moon night on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sargent890","CreatedById":83887,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T03:23:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI looked at the Ambient Light Adjustment plugin, but it only seems to make a difference when it\u0027s dark, rather than on the amount of light that a planet receive during the day. I also did some research, and found that KSP uses a spline-based light level calculation system, but I want to see if I can modify this to use levels based on real-world equations, allowing for a more realistic results and completely dark rogue planets. Does anyone know how I might modify the existing calculations?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
