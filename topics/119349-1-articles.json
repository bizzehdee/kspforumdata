There\u0027s two I can recommend that you shouldn\u0027t have to pay to get into. If you want to bike, you should be able to get to Jetty Park up in the port if you leave early enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to use your car, there\u0027s also Kars Park across the bridge (the first one going across Banana River). Both sites will give you great views of the launch as they\u0027re more or less the closest you\u0027ll be able to get to short of getting into the Space Center or somehow the base itself. Sun shouldn\u0027t be too big an issue if the rocket launches when its supposed to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe absolute best place though is the Space Center as they specifically have areas set up for the best viewing of the launches. And its well worth the upfront cost to get in. And if you\u0027re coming here to see a rocket go up, why not spend the rest of the day at the center?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a shame I\u0027m working that day because I\u0027d hoped I would be able to come out and see it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"totalitor","CreatedById":69774,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-31T15:08:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I was there on 31 th October (launch was one day delayed). I was on Saturn V center and I looked the launch with small binocular. I took no pictures becouse there is not so much time to do all the things. Becouse it was the smallest version of Atlas 5 it was very fast climbing.
