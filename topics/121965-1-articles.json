They look distinctly 60s). A few 7-segment displays, less cartoony graphics on the interface. Less shiny, more matte. Mechanical looking devices like the altimeter should not look like a cartoon drawing of an altimeter. The flight U.I. is one of the oldest pieces of artwork in the game.

When you\u0027ve been working on a game for so many years, things like this become invisible; part of the furniture. They\u0027ve had plenty to keep them busy in the meantime, but now that the GUI is being overhauled, the time has come to evaluate what they want from the GUI. The difficulty is that they may not want to just bin the designs and start again. The GUI is as recognisable and iconic a part of KSP as the kerbals themselves, and in a large part defines the look and feel of the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XwmqOoxy5Sc/hqdefault.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hqdefault.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
