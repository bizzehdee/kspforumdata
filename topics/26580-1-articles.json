Nuclear fusion would be a good alternative, fuel wouldn\u0027t be burnt all at once but a series of micro nuclear explosions would give the spaceship enough thrust to reach impressive speeds using just Hydrogen isotopes as fuel since it\u0027s the most abundant element in the universe. Antimatter in my opinion would be a better resource, ok, since the collision between matter and antimatter provides bigger amounts of energy than nuclear fusion, but at this moment even 10 grams of antimatter is an amount way beyond our capabilities. Only a few years ago (2 or 3) CERN recreated a few hundreds of atoms of anti Hydrogen. To achieve 10 grams it takes too much time, power, and the cost would be unsustainable. As nyrath said, half of the fuel would be spent for \u0022breaking\u0022, and the maneuver would be similar to that on that you plan in KSP. Not exactly but this is the idea.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying that it wouldn\u0027t be possible thou.. At this moment best ways to travel long distances are plasma thrusters like the VASIMR, the solar sail or fusion engines (even if the last one is just a short term theory). I know nasa is working on a solar sail of the dimension of few squared meters, with the goal to make a squared kilometer one; the best method to burn fuel is to burn intermittently the fuel as some hall thrust ion engines do, at 50 - 60 hz, which is proven to save some fuel over time and to travel longer distances, instead of burning the fuel as a SRB or a liquid fuel rocket does.

What happened was i was low in the tech tree, only batteries. So i ran out of electric charge about halfway to Minmus, and had plenty of delta V so this is what i did. I cancelled my orbital velocity to about 0 m/s, and then I burned straight towards Earth. What happened was i had the pod left, but the kerbal experienced so much g-force that he died in reentry. So i reverted and here was my solution. I had to burn in such a way that i enter the atmosphere at a shallower angle so that I spread out the g-forces into the reentry and i received a slower entry so that I could actually survive the fall. So luckily i got back to kerbin in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe practical use for this thread is that you could, potentially do this to achieve interplanetary travel, but one problem is that you would have to aerobrake into an extremely dense atmosphere in order to save the delta V that you would use to slow your velocity into an orbit around a planet. The same problem is that you would experience the g-forces associated with entering the atmosphere of said planet (Jool for example) and travelling at over 4 km/s would most likely kill you. So yes, it is probably possible, but your reentry would have to be extremely shallow to do this from interplanetary speed, and would require a pretty dense atmosphere. For instance, if I were to reenter kerbin at around 4 km/s the reentry (shallow) would probably only slow me down to 1200-2000 m/s and that is alot for a parachute to handle before it lands. Hopefully this gives a little insight on how that would work in real life, or at least KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
