But my thought on a way to do it, since Star Systems is using a black hole, you could procedurally generate stars the same way asteroids are (unless they aren\u0027t, maybe terrain scatter would be a place to look). Then add in a class somewhere that gives the star a low chance of also generating planets, which then have a low-moderate chance to generate moon(s). I would have to learn how the orbiting mechanics work for celestial bodies (since deorbiting larger ones isn\u0027t possible, I am assuming they are on rails) before I could really determine if that would even be feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poryy","CreatedById":81075,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T10:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, planets are on rails and can not be deorbited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, hooray! 3000 downloads!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gawdin","CreatedById":116051,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T18:19:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the progress of Kopernicus, it seems like they will have documentation for all the variables their config is going to have.
