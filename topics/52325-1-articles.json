However, a friend of mine recommended DMP and I decided to check it out and try to set up my own server. I dislike the /modgen feature as I, actually, have no clue how to use it properly. Therefore, I decided to resurrect this project for the use of DMP. I noticed that they use the same mod.txt file, thus it won\u0027t be a big problem to reuse the exact same application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can easily rewrite the DMPmodcontrol.txt file like you are used to. As you know, spaceport has died and so has my download link. I created an account on Curse and I disliked this, therefore, I will host a download via my MEGA until I find a better solution.

However, when exporting, it suddenly skips the stock parts: ladder1, GooExperiment, mediumDishAntenna, telescopicLadder and telescopicLadderBay, without any good reason. I checked some popular mods and as far as I can tell it adds all their parts. Thus I added the above listed parts manually in code if Squad is checked. Till now, I can not find a fix for this.
