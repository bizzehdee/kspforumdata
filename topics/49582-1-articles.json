Yesterday I had a very lengthy mission (900 days\u002B) where I took a three man capsule on a tour of Kerbal\u0027s inner solar system. In total, I had five flyby events, one at Mun, two at Eve, one at Moho and one at Duna. Now I expected to get zero from the Mun encounter, and I had already flown by Eve once before so I expected a diminished return there as well. However, when the capsule made its way back to Kerbin I was surprised to find that I had received credit for one -and only one- flyby, that of Moho. It was so bad that none of the other encounters were even listed. Now in retrospect I remember a similar mission in which I flew by Minmus and Mun and only got points for one pass but this is a real problem now that I see it on a larger scale. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s just no getting around the fact that it would be inconvenient in the extreme to have to limit your manned encounters to one object in one context since the rest won\u0027t be counted. I have no idea if this is a bug or a feature (or who knows, maybe both), I just think it\u0027s something people need to be aware of. I learned my lesson that\u0027s for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T22:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JeanHavoc\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JeanHavoc\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHowever, when the capsule made its way back to Kerbin I was surprised to find that I had received credit for one -and only one- flyby, that of Moho.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this time (and I don\u0027t know if the devs will change it), you only get science from ship recovery for one of the places you went. You still get all the science you did in each of those places, so it\u0027s still worth doing, but you do need to keep in mind that if you\u0027re doing multiple flybys, orbits, or landings, you\u0027re doing it for the experiments, not the ship recovery science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
