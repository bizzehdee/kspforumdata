Successfully crashed a couple of probes on Mun and was setting my eyes on Minmus. There\u00A0\u00A0is a problem however. I cant seem to find information regarding planets in game anywhere. I even upgraded my tracking station to max level in hopes of getting some useful stuff, but it seems to have been a mistake.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EQuestion: \u003C/b\u003EIs there information anywhere IN GAME where I can know orbit periods, aka how many Kerbin days does planet/moon(in this case Minmus) take to rotate around planet/sun. Yes I CAN technically\u00A0smash the time warp button, watch and make an excel\u00A0spreadsheet. But cmon, it would be completely insulting! \u002B Missions are time limited so its not like time is free. I know that \u0022haha funny Kerbals are dumb\u0022, but I would expect at least this information to be provided somewhere.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.: \u003C/strong\u003E\u0022Lol go read wiki\u0022 is an expected answer and by that point there is no reason to be playing the game. The entire fun proposition of the game is figuring out stuff by yourself. Im just really hoping for minimal convenience factor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T23:28:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is not much in-game.
