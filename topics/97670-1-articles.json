I had known what it was, and what it\u0027s plans were, but I decided to click anyway. Strangely the last time I read anything about the Dream Chaser, it was apparently a cancelled project. But, today on the Wiki it mentions nothing about cancellation, and speaks about plans made or conversations in 2014. Was the Dream Chaser resurrected in some way? Or is this false? Please let me know, I am a big fan of the Dream Chaser and it is looking to be a beautiful peice of engineering!
