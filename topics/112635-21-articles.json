Most things should be self explanatory. As for the Catamaran parts, I have two suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Think about how you\u0027re building the ship and how nodes connect. My recommendation for your first Catamaran is to lay out the ship with the Catamaran deck first, then add in your hull parts underneath. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Remember, struts are your friend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your Catamaran ends up flopping around a lot, you built it wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Radar and GPS are in the Science tab and are merely nautical looking replacements for stock parts.

The file management utility I use on my machine (I hate Explorer) has a unique feature that allows me to calculate directory sizes. I\u0027ve gone through every directory in the pack and have identified a couple of areas where things were consuming entirely too much memory. One was a duplicate texture in the CVE parts which will be removed in the next release and the other is the RoRo\u0027s textures being entirely too large compared to the rest of the pack. While it\u0027s not a huge memory saving, the entire pack with the new parts above is still 106MB with .dds files, I just wanted to let you know that I am taking your suggestion seriously and am trying to be conscious of how much memory this monster is going to consume.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-19T13:38:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2015 01:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T14:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt works very well.
