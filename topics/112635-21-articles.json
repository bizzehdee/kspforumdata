Most things should be self explanatory. As for the Catamaran parts, I have two suggestions.\n\n1. Think about how you\u0027re building the ship and how nodes connect. My recommendation for your first Catamaran is to lay out the ship with the Catamaran deck first, then add in your hull parts underneath. \n\n2.
