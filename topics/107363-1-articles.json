{"TopicId":107363,"ForumId":25,"TopicTitle":"KEMA Drag Week - ROUND CLOSES 28TH MAY","CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:17:30Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:17:30Z","Content":"IT\u0027S HERE!!\n\nThe NEMA drag week has now arrived in the Kerbal Space Program world - the KEMA drag week! Build your most competitive dragsters in KSP and pitch them right here in this thread. Each dragster must abide by the rules and guidelines below, and the current round of entries closes on\n\n2ND ROUND IS OPEN - ENTRIES FOR THE 2ND ROUND CLOSE ON THE 28TH OF MAY!! --EXTENDED DATE!!--\n\nAny entries after this time will be included into the round that follows the current one. The player who can sustain a winning streak will hold the title of the KEMA Drag Strip King until such time that someone else is able to take them off of their podium!\n\n**THE RULES, GUIDELINES AND INFO:**\n\n- NO part clipping is permitted through the debug menu - part clipping is permitted but only to a feasible extent\n\n- Any dragster must be created using KSP version 1.0.2\n\n- No mods are to be used on any dragster\n\n- Each dragster must ONLY use solid rocket boosters for propulsion\n\n- Each dragster can carry a maximum of 500 solid fuel at any one time\n\n- Each dragster must have a minimum of 4 wheels\n\n- Each dragster must have a minimum of 2 wings (includes any wings, wing sections, winglets, control surfaces, etc)\n\n- All dragsters are to be submitted in craft file form - once entries are closed for the round, each dragster will be ran by myself to remove cheating and provide fairness (see point after next); videos will be provided of the highlights of the round\n\n- All dragster are to be given a name upon submission - this name will be shown on leader boards when testing is commenced.\n\n- When under testing, no input will be provided to the dragster. SAS will be turned on, thrust will be set to 0%, and the only input will be that to stage the dragster\n\n- The dragster must not leave the runway - leaving the runway results in a DNF for that run\n\n- Each dragster is run over 3 times, with all 3 run\u0027s scores being averaged to form the final scores\n\n- Dragsters are grouped into weight tiers as follows:\n\n = \u003C3t - Small tier\n\n = \u003E3t \u0026 \u003C5t - Medium tier\n\n = \u003E5t Large tier\n\n- Each tier has their own overall winners, with a separate final winner based on total amount of points\n\n- The dragster CAN become airborne on the runway, but only within reason (3-5m in height)\n\n- The dragster\u0027s weight is calculated as the initial weight, excluding the weight of parts attached to decouplers or other ejection methods\n\nSUBMISSION GUIDELINES AND DETAILS\n\nUpon submission, any special instructions to operate the dragster must be given. If no instructions are given, the dragster will just be staged whenever the current stage is depleted of fuel. Another note to submissions, is that ONLY a craft file is to be submitted - no videos or images are required but you may submit them if you like to show some testing of your dragster.\n\n**SCORING SYSTEM:**\n\nEach dragster is scored based on their km/h final speed at the end of the run, weight of the dragster (in tonnes)\\*\\*See guidelines for more info on this, specifically the last point\\*\\*, winglets on the dragster, wheels on the dragster, and any parachutes on the dragster. The formula for score generation is as follows:\n\n(Dragster speed x weight of the dragster) / (wings on the dragster x wheels on the dragster x parachutes on the dragster)\n\nIn the event that no parachutes are on the dragster, the parachute value is set to 0.5\n\nFor example, a 2t dragster, with 4 winglets, 4 wheels and 2 parachutes that reached a speed of 600km/h will receive a score of 37.5 in the small tier.\n\n**Q\u0026A!!**\n\nQ: Are A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S allowed?\n\nA:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E the airbrakes are allowed, but are not going to be very useful unless you link them to toggle during the staging - as I don\u0027t apply the brakes. I would most likely consider the airbrakes as a wing, as they apply a \u0022drag\u0022 in the way of what would be expected if a wing were to be placed vertically in place. So to answer your question properly, yes they are allowed, they are considered as wings, but I only stage the vehicle, so you\u0027ll have to find a way to use them with that in mind ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNote: these questions are questions that have been asked by people in the thread\n\n**LEADERBOARDS:**\n\nSMALL TIER:\n\n#1 - Cybersol - Kamikaze (2.7t, 1724km/h, 1163.7)\n\n#2 - Cybersol - Drag Bonsai (2.7t, 1764km/h, 386.45)\n\n#3 - FlipNascar - Betty\u0027s Purse (2.1t, 1123km/h, 65.07)\n\n#4 -\n\nMEDIUM TIER:\n\n#1 - QuesoExplosivo - Medium Dragster Mk2 (4.9t, 1512km/h, 916.91)\n\n#2 - QuesoExplosivo - Small Dragster Mk2 (3.0t, 1336km/h, 480.5)\n\n#3 - FlipNascar - Beryl\u0027s Trolley (3.4t, 1166km/h, 27.53)\n\n#4 - JO3 - Hare (4.1t, DNF)\n\nLARGE TIER:\n\n#1 - JO3 - Tortoise (343.3t, 69.1km/h, 5858.98)\n\n#2 - Plotz - The Lorry (15.4t, 1278km/h, 1631.11)\n\n#3 - ToTheMun (Me ![^_^](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png)) - Big Mac (29.8t, 630km/h, 991.67)\n\n#4 - QuesoExplosivo - Limo Dragster (86.1t, 259km/h, 929.16)\n\nOVERALL LEADERS:\n\n#1 - JO3 - Tortoise (343.3t, 69.1km/h, 5858.98)\n\n#2 - Plotz - The Lorry (15.4t, 1278km/h, 1631.11)\n\n#3 - Cybersol - Kamikaze (2.7t, 1724km/h, 1163.7)\n\n#4 - ToTheMun (Me ![^_^](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png)) - Big Mac (29.8t, 630km/h, 991.67)\n\nKEMA DRAG STRIP KING::: 1st round is not complete...\n\nMay the best dragster win!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T05:55:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 05:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ToTheMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T08:06:01Z","Content":"**HERE ARE THE RESULTS OF ROUND #1!!!**\n\nA fair few people entered, with rather cool and differing designs.

In response to your second question, any command is fair game. It can be unmanned or manned. And your last question... I\u0027m not entirely sure you read all of the guidelines or you might not have understood them properly, but I conduct all the runs with the vehicles, so no part mods. You can use any informational mods, but just remember that the crafts must be submitted here for me to do the runs of the dragster. No input is given to the craft, as stated in the OP.

So when you say the weight of the dragstar, do you mean weight at the start? or do you mean weight at the end of the race?\n\nAlso what do you mean by the end of the run? Do you mean the end of the runway? The designs submitted so far don\u0027t have their top speeds at the end of the runway because they don\u0027t have enough fuel to last that long. Or maybe you just mean top speed? In that case is the run over after top speed is achieved? can I break any of the rules after the run is over?\n\nAnd what do you mean by leaving the runway? do you mean we have to stop before the end of the runway? Or do you mean we just can\u0027t go off the side? If We have to stop before the end, then what counts as the end of the run? If I just run for 50 meters and stop does that count as a run?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T17:56:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Serassa**"},{"CreatedByName":"plotz","CreatedById":140852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:32:27Z","Content":"I have interpreted this challenge as counting towards the \u0022F3\u0022 mission top speed."}]}
