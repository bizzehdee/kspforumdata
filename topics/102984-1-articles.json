The thing is, dreaming can get pretty absurd. So what\u0027s the weirdest dream you ever had?\n\nWell, for me, I was on an aircraft. Perhaps an A320 or something similar-looking. I heard the news about Jupiter being destroyed from a probe crashing to it (I know it\u0027s incredibly inaccurate!) , and debris from it was going to produce a meteor shower.\n\nSo.. I was in the airport, nearby a balcony. The meteor shower started. It was full of KSP-like asteroids in flames, raining down in clusters. And it was about the same size of the Moon from eye perspective. It was going by slowly, and it was very clear to see. It was beautiful, although morbid, because one of the most beautiful gas giants in the Solar System was gone.\n\nThen I was awake.\n\nWhat about you guys?"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T18:20:10Z","Content":"I was fighting a bear in my front yard naked.

I don\u0027t remember when it happened.\n\nI\u0027ve had tonnes of awesome dreams, like flying and trains and asteroid apocalypses and deadly swimming pools and floating glass dome restraunts and underground zombies and exploding weird tent things and trains and train stations and trees and underground pipe fish and lots more.\n\nI\u0027ve also had some horrorfying dreams. I don\u0027t find them scary any more.

But there was one outlier, it was one that recurred every so often in my childhood (not happened for a long time). Nothing particularly scary happened, it would be quite abstract in fact, visually/experientially. But there would be an intense feeling of pure dread permeating the dream and I would often \u0022half-wake-up\u0022 and be unable to tell the size of my surroundings - IE: \u0022Am I in a bedroom or am I in a tiny tiny box that just looks like a bedroom from the inside.\n\nIt terrified me.\n\nOther:\n\nI have died in my dreams, so that myth is busted. It was definitely a death, a nuclear weapon went of right next to me. I experienced it as everything going white, and I woke up after this occurred.\n\nGet blown away by the wind quite a lot in my regular dreams. Also occasionally get in fights where my punches are completely ineffectual (classic anxiety dream I think).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-07T11:18:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2016 11:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by p1t1o**"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T12:45:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 31.03.2015 at 4:21 AM, daniel l. said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I was a cat\n\u003E \n\nI can understand you.
