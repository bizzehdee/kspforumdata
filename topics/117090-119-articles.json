This actually results in much more appropriate simulation for angled wheels and when running into an angled surface (ramp) or the proverbial wall with front-facing wheel-derived bumpers.  So if you run into a ramp ----\u003E /   the application of force ends up in the direction orthagonal to the orientation of the terrain ----\u003E \\ /, regardless of the orientation of the suspension (other than that they need to be pointing somewhat in the direction of the surface to even catch the raycast...but that is a raycast vs. shape-cast problem).\n\nGoing to do a bit more testing and playing with it; likely need to adjust the suspension force exerted for the angle that the suspension is positioned at... but looks like I\u0027m making a bit more progress.\n\nStill likely just going to re-rig the wheels and try and use the stock modules; but stuck at work at the moment and nothing better to do (well.. besides work..) than to play around with some wheel physics ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T21:32:27Z","Content":"More thinking / thought on it:\n\nUsing the hit.normal and orientation of the surface hit seems to be key in properly applying forces.  Now I just need to figure out how to get the orientation of the surface from the hit position/raycast information (semi aligned to the vehicle/wheel..).\n\nLooking like I can likely solve that problem given a bit more work and thought on it... and research/learning of a few things.  Just plugging in the code to use the straight surface-normal solved many of the edge-cases that had me worried; and if I can find how to get a properly oriented surface transform that will likely solve the rest of the problems I\u0027m experiencing."},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T20:37:08Z","Content":"it seems like a very good direction, you might end up fixing and upgrading unity wheel mechanics to the whole new level ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) keep up good work Shadowmage ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T21:43:20Z","Content":"Wheels... ughgh.. going to be a not-so-short and definitely bumpy road getting these worked out.\n\nGot the suspension-giving-lateral-forces stuff figured out; base the force from the suspension on the normal of the surface hit.  Now angled suspension works about as it should, or at least doesn\u0027t cause any more strangeness.\n\nNext problem to solve is to stop the thing from sliding down a hill sideways; the dynamic friction model works on movement/velocity.. meaning it can only react to existing velocity, it can\u0027t keep a velocity from diverging from zero (only make it converge towards zero).  Have not seen any attempt to solve this in any of the other \u0027alternate wheel collider\u0027 solutions...\n\nHit a bit of a breakthrough on how to apply static friction; or rather to stop the sliding down hills due to the suspension and hit normal interaction.  Now I separate the \u0027normal\u0027 force into those opposing the input velocity and those affecting sliding on the surface.  Currently I\u0027m simply negating the sliding components, but it seems that I can check these vs. a friction constant to see if it would \u0027break loose\u0027 and start sliding.  From there dynamic friction comes into play.\n\nSo... progress...  slow and often painful... but progress.\n\nIts already much more usable than the U5 wheel-collider component.... at least it doesn\u0027t cause things to shake, shimmy, jitter, spaz out, or launch themselves into orbit.

I wanted to make sure this is repeatable before I waste your time by submitting stuff that you cannot reproduce. But, I do have a feeling it is an issue with KJR, due to the simple fact that when I first tested the last build that came out, I only had stock, sstu and KJR and that\u0027s when this happened. So, my guess is that KJR is playing havoc on your integrated docking ports. But, the funny thing is, it only happens when you launch two sstu pods up on one rocket and do a docking maneuver in orbit, like an Apollo CM/LM hard dock. I can launch two SSTU Ares I\u0027s up and dock them together with no problem. \n\nBut, I will -try- to do this without KJR and see if it makes a difference. While I\u0027m at it, i will test to see if it\u0027s just the docking ports, or just the ones that are integrated onto your command pods. If I come up with different results, I will then post a bug report with all the information I have and logs to follow. \n\nBut a quick way to test?

I think I better leave that to the professional(s) at SSTU. Wish it was just a simple matter of scolding one of the two between the petal adapter and KJR and tell them to play nice.\n\u003E \n\nKJR does some cross-part jointing, and it will join parts on either side of a decoupler to each-other.  The petal adapter is a weird breed of decoupler with its node setup, and likely not something KJR was anticipating.  Might also just be because of some of the changes to joint code in KSP or joint mechanics in Unity itself (as the problem did not exist in 1.05 that I can remember... but I never did get much time for extensive testing).\n\nI\u0027m -guessing- that KJR adds a joint between the internal payload and the top payload, and between the top payload and the part below the petal adapter, and between the internal payload and the part below the petal adapter.  One of these is likely not being severed properly when the top part is decoupled.\n\nI haven\u0027t yet tried it with stock docking ports with a similar setup... but will be doing it soon so as to eliminate the SSTU ports/pods from the equation (leaving just the petal adapter as the only suspect)."},{"CreatedByName":"AliceM","CreatedById":157010,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T02:23:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 hours ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Does any one else have a bug with RS-68 engine cluster with more than 3 engine ?

I wanted to make sure this is repeatable before I waste your time by submitting stuff that you cannot reproduce. But, I do have a feeling it is an issue with KJR, due to the simple fact that when I first tested the last build that came out, I only had stock, sstu and KJR and that\u0027s when this happened. So, my guess is that KJR is playing havoc on your integrated docking ports. But, the funny thing is, it only happens when you launch two sstu pods up on one rocket and do a docking maneuver in orbit, like an Apollo CM/LM hard dock. I can launch two SSTU Ares I\u0027s up and dock them together with no problem. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But, I will -try- to do this without KJR and see if it makes a difference. While I\u0027m at it, i will test to see if it\u0027s just the docking ports, or just the ones that are integrated onto your command pods. If I come up with different results, I will then post a bug report with all the information I have and logs to follow. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But a quick way to test? I did put an sstu apollo style test craft with sls parts (Orion and an LC3). Just launch and orbit it, then try and dock with it. It has nothing but stock launch clamps and sstu parts. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But, with the new patch release, We\u0027ll see if it works or not. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT: KJR is the culprit, indeed.
