That is, highly elliptical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found that, for just 120dv, I can make a manoeuvre node that provides an intercept with Tylo, which happens to be the first stop. However, that intercept involves an orbit that goes out nearly double the length of Tylo\u0027s orbit and comes screaming back at a weird angle, guaranteeing a very high cost capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, I can burn fuel lowering my ap to something closer to Tylo\u0027s, and then plan a much less expensive capture. The question is, which is these will be more efficient?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realise the default answer would be \u0022aerobrake at Jool\u0022 but I\u0027m playing with DRE, and through trial I\u0027ve found this thing explodes if I try to shave off more than 100m/s each lap. In other words, that would be a very slow and painful aerobrake.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T12:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you get the Tylo intercept, you\u0027re coming to it from certain direction - but you can still pass on its prograde side, retrograde side, above it, or below it. Selecting which way you\u0027ll come to Tylo is matter of a few m/s in corrections when done at the right time and place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf one pass sends you in much higher orbit, then passing it on the opposite side is going to send you in much lower orbit - that\u0027s what gravity slingshots do. But ultimately, the speed at which you\u0027ll be passing Tylo is the same. So if you\u0027re going to stop there, then just make sure you\u0027re passing it on the right side to be able to enter your Tylo parking orbit easily, then brake at periapsis. The lower your periapsis will be, the less dv you\u0027ll need to close your orbit within Tylo\u0027s SOI (but the more dv you\u0027ll need to make it circular).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T14:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShouldnt it be easier/take less dV to establish orbit around a moon when moving prograde relative to its movement?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, you are orbiting the planet with x m/s when entering the moon\u0027s SOI that is rotating around its planet with y m/s - if you are coming in prograde, your orbital velocity relative to the moon will be x-y m/s - retrograde it will be x\u002By m/s, so you would have to burn longer to establish an orbit, no?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T14:49:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShouldnt it be easier/take less dV to establish orbit around a moon when moving prograde relative to its movement?\u003Cp\u003EI mean, you are orbiting the planet with x m/s when entering the moon\u0027s SOI that is rotating around its planet with y m/s - if you are coming in prograde, your orbital velocity relative to the moon will be x-y m/s - retrograde it will be x\u002By m/s, so you would have to burn longer to establish an orbit, no?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot when you\u0027re coming from outside.
