I made a spiffy little rover which I intend to return with the lander. The rover has a jr docking clamp on the top, and lander has a jr docking clamp on the bottom for it to drive under, hitch up and go on it\u0027s merry way. However, After then designing the lander and loading the rover in as a sub assembly I can\u0027t link them with the docking ports. Or any part of the entire rover other than the root part. How can I get around this? I\u0027d rather not have to redesign the entire thing to get around this silly problem or have it be an issue with future projects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Any ideas of how to get around this without the use of mods? The root part of the rover is what the entire structure of it is built around so I can\u0027t see how I could change it without deleting the entire design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-04T01:28:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2014 01:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by BoogieMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T08:28:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had buttloads of problems with this as well. Usually I either (sorry to say) end up rebuilding with a different root part or I think I\u0027ve had limited success with dividing things in two and saving them as separate subassemblies to be assembled after loading, although it sounds like you wouldn\u0027t be able to split it into 2 neat parts. Either way makes your brain hurt trying to think of ways around it. I\u0027m guessing your root part is a Rovemate or piece of plate or something, have you tried removing the docking port from the subassembly and then building it on to the lander? Sorry I can\u0027t help more, I agree this problem sucks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T08:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlways try to start building with docking ports not those command thingy\u0027s.... saves a lot of time and nerves \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and there also was a handy mod around where you could choose a new main part... let me take a look... ah \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43208-0-22-Oct17-SelectRoot-Set-a-new-root-part-0-22-fixes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E i don\u0027t know if this still works in 23.5 :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T09:35:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a select root mod that will let you change the docking port to the root part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BoogieMan","CreatedById":109275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T01:29:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, looks like I\u0027ll grab that mod since there is no simple way to deal with it after the fact in vanilla.
