They\u0027re undocked, but still stuck together at the ports. Switching to the Space Center and back will sometimes find them separated as if the undock was successful, and other times, both ships will kraken out on me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than go the usual route of posting logs and tediously trying to find a clue, I\u0027d like to take a more broad approach. Has anyone else experienced this, and if so, was it related to a specific mod and fixed by removing it? I run a ton of mods. Probably too many. This, though, feels like it\u0027s less to do with the usual memory issues from running so many mods and more to do with some sort of conflict. Given the amount of mods I have, doing the one-by-one remove and check procedure would take the better part of my evening. That\u0027s why I\u0027m asking you guys first. If that doesn\u0027t help, then I\u0027ll post the logs and go from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T11:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last version of Kerbal Joint Reinforcement was plagued with docking related problems that were fixed in the newest release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jonrd463","CreatedById":116868,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T12:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust saw it was updated in CKAN.
