I never developed a dll file for ksp, but i am well familiar with API concept in unity, the few times i looked into ksp mods, it looked like the API can have some touches with better and more calls to make life easier for developers.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E5- How will this update affect shaders and those mods developing shaders (like textures unlimited)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E6- The screens from early game play shows some threes around KSP, why not adding the concept we have with kerbal constructs? I mean more non functional buildings around ksp that would serve as eye candy? after all, if community goes for something that has 0 function in game, means they want to see it when they launch a ship\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E7- visual effects and some features that can become internal mechanics, things like docking port alignment indicator, scatterer, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, SVT and some more functional mods that can be always inside ksp as internal functionality but is never there ( I can list at least 50 mods like that ). I know that adding these may cause internal maintenance for them every now and then, but let\u0027s face it, the only real reason that many of these mods need maintenance is because of unity.dll update between ksp versions these days, so, having them as internal functionality, may need no maintenance after adding them as game mechanics\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E8- Kopernicus, another functionality that main developers can look into it. Having binary planets in ksp2 have some promises\u00A0but still, if the main issues with this mod remains (like when you don\u0027t have sun as the center of everything) I would ask them why not looking into this and try helping community more ( I know that they had done a lot with co-working with modding community, but if you ask me, it could be much better )\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAfter all, with some major upgrade like what we are facing with (ksp 2) there are lots of things we can talk about and that is why i started this thread.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-11T06:53:07Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2020 06:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Jiraiyah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-19T13:54:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223726890\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022190949\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221578725538\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002297667\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jiraiyah\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/11/2020 at 6:52 AM, Jiraiyah said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E1- We all know that they say the ksp game is reprogrammed in many sections from the ground up.

KSP doesn\u0027t have an API in the traditional sense. Devs just tend to leave methods as public and let us have at it, most of these methods are (usually) badly documented if at all. 99% of making a plugin is finding a class/method that looks like it *might* do what you want, then searching github to see how other people used it \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
