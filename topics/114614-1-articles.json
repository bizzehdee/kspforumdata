When my engine gimbals, the nozzle (which is the parent of the thrustTransform and the gimbal object) and the effects seem to be moving from different origin points. I have them set to the same place in Blender, though I do notice in unity the Z transform location is different. They still visually appear to be in the same location.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![l7ItdmD.png](http://i.imgur.com/l7ItdmD.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![usb7Atj.png](http://i.imgur.com/usb7Atj.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![7JI8pEC.png](http://i.imgur.com/7JI8pEC.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Mp1PZHn.png](http://i.imgur.com/Mp1PZHn.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T18:18:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T22:19:07Z","Content":"This structure will work:\n\nempty \u0022gimbalTransform\u0022 -\u003E is parent of -\u003E Mesh Nozzle \u0026 Empty \u0022thrusttransform\u0022\n\nlike this\n\ngimbalTransform\n\n-\u003Enozzle\n\n-\u003EthrustTransform\n\nset the engine thrust and FX to *thrusttransform*, and the gimbal to *gimbalTransform*.\n\nAlso note that \u0022exhaustFlames\\_blue\u0022 fx for enginefx has a built in offset.

On a whim, I unparented the whole gimbal assembly (the empty gimbal object, the nozzle, thrustTransform, and smokepoint) from the engine body and instead parented it only to the part tools object, and that seems to have it working correctly. Somehow, that doesn\u0027t seem like the right solution though. \n\nThis works:\n\n![fwBARxd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fwBARxd.jpg)\n\nThis doesn\u0027t:\n\n![J0NbHAK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/J0NbHAK.jpg)\n\n![yYvdqpi.png](http://i.imgur.com/yYvdqpi.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T19:42:36Z","Content":"There\u0027s really no harm in parenting the transforms however you want, as long as the one that is referenced in the gimbal module is parent to anything you want to have actually steering.

I believe it\u0027s official scientific function is \u0022thoughtitlookedneat\u0022, which sometimes produces oooo-on\u0027s and aaaah-on\u0027s.
