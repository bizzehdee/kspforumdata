Clicking this commands form the popup menu do nothing. Also if I finifsh the mission and landing on the planet, I\u0027m unable to return my vessel to the Space Center or just got back to the Space Center. So I\u0027m stuck on this mission and can\u0027t finish it. I must shutdown the game completly and reload my last working quicksave of this mission. After that I\u0027m able to quicksave form some time, but the save gets messed ob again after some time and I\u0027m again stuck in this mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Titan696","CreatedById":167264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-06T15:42:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you just docked? I docked last night to swap out a scientist for 2 engineers which ended up on my science station, I did all the nasty and docked them and was stuck just like you. I tried everything but the only thing i could do was quit out and it loaded back to the last auto save/quicksave. Which I have just re done and successfully done a blind docking at night and again the moment im docked I can\u0027t do jack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: just to note that disconnecting from my station still didn\u0027t let me save (was wondering if it was the combined ships parts hitting the limit), but my quicksave is now only a few minutes behind the dock and not while in orbit of kerbin. Looks like re fuelling is not an option, I loaded the save and aborted the dock and it seems fine, didn\u0027t need to restart the game like when nodes crash.
