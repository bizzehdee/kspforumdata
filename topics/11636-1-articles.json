Our in game ship builder allows players to construct their ship piece by piece. Each module can be destroyed individually and if a ship\\\u0027s engines are destroyed, it will be left drifting. If the hull piece containing a reactor is knocked out, everything that reactor powered will be useless (unless another reactor can pick up the slack). While in space flight, interactions between objects are governed by the physics engine. Running into an asteroid at high speed will damage your ship and could send you careening off into space. Slowly approaching the asteroid and then throttling up will allow you to accelerate the asteroid. And if that asteroid just happens to be heading toward a space station... well, the results should be spectacular. But be careful who you anger. The faction who owned the station will remember your little stunt and may be gunning for you in the future. On the other hand, their enemies may appreciate your resourcefulness and be more open toward you.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe demo is out now so you can try it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s going to be a Unity-based Space Trader with ships that you customize and build yourself.
