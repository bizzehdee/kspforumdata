I am very much on the fence, if i can agree to that decision, though. I dont quite see the difference between waiting and repeating. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake EVA-report for example - the first time you are orbiting the mun with a manned capsule, you will, most likely, repeat the following steps, for about 5 (give or take) times:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- click EVA on the pilot\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s portrait\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- tilt the cam, so that you can actually see the pilot hanging onto his ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- right-click the pilot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- click EVA-report\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- choose \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4keep data\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 from the pop-menu\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- press \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4f\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 to bord the ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- right-click the capsule\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- click \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4review EVA-report\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- click \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4transmit data\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E YMMV, but i find that pretty tedious, and while it does give me something to do, i dont think it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s much fun doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the suggestion is to leave the pilot out there, and he\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ll keep two data-counters increase their value. The first counter displays the amount of all data gathered on this \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4experiment\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 (/\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4report\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 or whatever) ever, and is never reset during the same game. The second is the amount of gathered data on this EVA (in this case). Both would rise as time passes during EVA, with a speed depending on the first (if its low, increase will be faster - and vice versa). Once you are not satisfied with the increase anymore (or the experiment had to be broken off, due to change in the environment - e.g. you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ve left orbit around the mun, while the EVA was still ongoing), you go back inside the capsule, and the gathered data (2nd counter) can be sent with one order.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4balance\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 this in a way, that after a couple of minutes (2-5, maybe, depending on player preference and playstyle, and the experiement at hand, as well as possibly kerbal-skills), you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d find the yield not being worth the waiting time, unless you really dont have anything better to do and really want to squeeze the last bit of science out of this experiment. And you know what - i\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d simply make it not being affected by time-warp. Yeah, i know, doesnt seem logical. But this is a game. So: When you switch to time warp, everything may go faster, but your data-accumulation rate would remain the same. Gameplay reason: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you end up switching time-warp on and off, it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ll not improve immersion (compared to non-effect data-accumulation) and just throw you back from where we started: Pushing a lot of buttons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know what else? If experiments took time, each kerbal (/probe core) could run one at the same. Meaning a fully manned 3 men capsule could have two goo-containers and a materials bay running and accumulating data at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in detail, it would go like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Not only crewmen, but also probe-cores get a representation in the lower right - add scrollbuttons that hide when they are not needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4IVA\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 in those representations becomes \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4PIL\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 for piloting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Each science module gets its own 3-letter-abbreveation and gets intergrated into this IVA/EVA button array of the crew portraits, if noone is assigned to it (e.g. have one button for each type on board with at least one of its type being \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4vacant\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Assign a crewman or probecore to any free science module by presssing the corresponding button in the portrait - that\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s basically starting the experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Each science module also becomes part of the part-list on the left-side (stages). Accumulation of data is being presented here for any active module, pretty much akin to heat-bars. Tooltips tell details.**\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Click the part (or bar) of any active module to transmit the data it accumulated since last transmission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- End data-accumulation by simply reassigning the crewman/probecore\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pilots gather crew-report data automatically as long as their are not busy flying (e.g. for any 10 second interval without steering input the required pilots gathers some, the idle pilots always do).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Science modules can be used to conduct another experiment and hold its data, even when the store is filled with the data of a previous one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once an ongoing experiment\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s conditions have changed (altitude, SOI, etc.) the untransmitted data gets stored and the assigned crewmen/cores start working on a new experiment. If there are untransmitted \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4left-overs\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 again (e.g. when the storage of the corresponding module has already been used up), the one of higher science-value gets stored, the other discarded. If you hit the module\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s icon or bar for transmission and there is a \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4leftover\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 in store, you get prompted wether you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d like to send this as well and thus empty storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Result: Assign everyone to his/her/its station and let things run pretty much automatically. No repeated clickfests. No right-clicks at all. Almost no pop-ups. Some sort of point to skylabs and space-stations. A nice tie-in for a skills-system and ways to differentiate kerbals from cores***. A pilotless (because its pilot, man or machine, is doing some experiment instead) vessel cannot be controlled.

Simple probecores could suck badly in accumulation rate while using a lot of energy when conducting experiments. And so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
