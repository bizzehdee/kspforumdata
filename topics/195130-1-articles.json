Welcome to our forum, and I have most your question to the questions subforum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you look at your choices for crew on that mission, you will see someone whose job is listed as \u0022tourist.\u0022 This is the person you need to take to a destination. The contract tells you what the destination is. Put that person on a ship, fly it to the destination, then land back on the home planet. That will complete the mission.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-29T01:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that you can\u0027t send tourists outside your ship so if you need to transfer tourists and VIPs between ships(to a lander for example) they will need to be docked together to allow internal transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
