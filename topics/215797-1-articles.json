Playing a new career, I get some way through the game (roughly attaining orbit of mun) when the game crashes out of career mode at the end of a mission and into sandbox. At this stage, it decides all my save files (as I saved incremental versions in case) are corrupt and deletes them, so I\u2019m left having to start my career from nothing again (for the third time now )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid131","CreatedById":227544,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-14T22:55:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame thing happened to me, twice now. This is completely unexcusable and very frustrating. I\u0027m sure ksp technical support could care less and offers no help to anyone that this happens to, Which Is Allot. This is a know problem and makes the game worthless in my eyes at well as a waste of money. I\u0027ve never seen a games tech. support not be able to retrieve someone\u0027s career. Simply NOT OK, KSP.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
