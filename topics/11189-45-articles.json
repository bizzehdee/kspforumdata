Thanks for the extra screenies, sorry about the crash landing, I feel bad now! I find that flipping happens a lot with canards when the fuel is used changing the balance. Its because the center of mass moves back behind the center of lift, so it wants to fly backwards. This, is why I always try to balance without canards these days. Center of lift needs to be just far enough behind COmass. Lift off is then easy if you get the rear undercarriage in the right place, just behind the COM and control surfaces some distance behind the COM, then canards become unecessary unless you want them of course. In any case congratulations on your Advanced Pilot Precision Award with Skylon. \n\nkahlzun thanks for your mission report, congratulations on your Advanced Pilot Precision Award with Rapier\\_Test\\_Rig.
