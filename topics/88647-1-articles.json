Secondly, the most expensive thing with -30 and lower is dampers get stiff and damage themselves if you ride over bumps (and ice bumps are abundant in winter).

After the engine cools below some threshold, it turns on for a minute. Monthly fuel usage raises 4 or 8 times in winter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Put heat insulation coat on the engine right after you turn it off. Next 12 hours it\u0027s warm enough to start normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) In army, they just drain oil and coolant in pales and bring them indoors, as well as the battery. Sometimes they heat them up before putting back. But this is too much work for a city dweller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Electric heater, exhaust heat exchanger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you didn\u0027t take care ahead, there are workarounds:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Ask someone to \u0022light a cigarette\u0022, which means you connect your dead car\u0027s batteries to his working car, and run the starter as long as you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Use electric air heater (like in the photo above)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) If nothing helps, heat up the engine with fire.
