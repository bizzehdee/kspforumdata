After I figured out how to get my ship carrying the rover to the Mun orbit I\u0027ve been having a rather difficult time landing it. I just have trouble slowing it down. It seems like I can\u0027t hit the \u0022speed sweet spot\u0022 if you will. Since the rover is controlled by the probe computer it means it\u0027s quite small and very light and it can\u0027t handle a big impact and the little engines that are on it don\u0027t seem to slow it down enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I would love if some of you would share some tips and tricks on landing small rovers on Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your advice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest regards, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAxel Nova\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T20:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can do more of your braking higher up so there\u0027s less speed to shed at the last minute, but that can waste a lot of fuel.

Put 4 of the small radial engines, a probe core, a few small fuel tanks, and a decoupler/docking port above the rover. When you land, just decouple the skycrane from the rover and crash the skycrane into the ground. This will have a very high TWR, but it will not have much delta-v, so use your orbital stage to do as much slowing down as possible before you decouple it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T00:35:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend looking at the stock \u0027Rover \u002B Skycrane\u0027.
