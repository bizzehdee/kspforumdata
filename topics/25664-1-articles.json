However, there is a reoccurring problem; it seems like I can\u0027t attach all three docking ports to both tri-couplers in the VAB. I tried to build it first by putting three ports on a tri-coupler (facing upwards), rotating and placing three ports on top of those, and placing the second tri-coupler to that. It seemed to stay together during flight, but when I got orbit and tried to undock the two parts, tow of the three docking ports on one of the top tri-coupler fell off and floated away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like you have to attach docking ports DIRECTLY to tri-couplers for them to stay on, so what I did by just placing the tri-coupler on top of three upside-down ports didn\u0027t work. I\u0027ve been fiddling around with this for quite some time and have only managed to attach two ports directly to the top tri-coupler. Does anybody have a way to actually get all three ports to stay on the damn thing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking port structure I\u0027m trying to accomplish:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be an easy fix, but some strange stuff happens to the attach nodes when I try to move it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022html\u0026gt;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OdinYggd","CreatedById":26917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T02:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat happens because the current ship structure is a tree shape that does not allow loops. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to counteract it is make sure all of your docking ports are anchored securely to the parts they attach to, although only one of them can be actually attached in the VAB the others should grab fairly quickly once it gets out to the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paleorob","CreatedById":60059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T02:32:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse stack separators instead of the lower ports?

What you can do is save one of the tri-couplers and it\u0027s properly attached docking ports and recall it many times as necessary. In this case by loading 2 in and connecting them they\u0027d both have all their ports properly attached. Haven\u0027t found another way round this issue sadly, short of launching the two parts separately. Of course if you don\u0027t need to keep one of the sections and it will be discarded, don\u0027t use the ports at all, just have the other ports on the other section lock directly onto a tri-coupler on the other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T06:07:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrist: watch the video it shows first the wrong way, then the correct way to connect them\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristavius","CreatedById":60879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T06:30:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh sorry, missed your post...
