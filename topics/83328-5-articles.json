Your position, while not being equal to mine, at least it is coherent: if you can\u0027t do it all by yourself, either being the piloting or the development, you are cheating, but if you can do it and only skip those to cut the tedium of the repeated task, it is not ... I can\u0027t say I agree, but it is atleast a better standing ground than others have stated through the times.

You know, THAT is real life, KSP is a game. There is literally nothing actually at risk in flying a plane into a building or into the ground in KSP.

The code BTW, was there to prevent a possibly not sane Gagarin ( the effects of being in LEO were literally unknown \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ) to assume control the ship ). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClaw was just pointing out that automation is everywhere in the aerospatial and aeronautical worlds since ages and the trend from quite a while ago is to go more automated ( in fact, one of the issues of the aeronautical world now is that planes appear to be \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E automated and that the pilots as a average are losing skills to deal with any issue that makes the computers have errors, like what happened in Air France 447 crash, where apparently the pilots in charge at the time both didn\u0027t recognize a autopilot unusual reaction ( caused by a temporary icing in the speed sensors of the plane ) and , more seriously, didn\u0027t recognized a clear stall situation and acted in the less adequate way possible. The only person that recognized the situation, the senior captain, came to the cockpit too late to save the situation ). His point is that in his opinion there is no point of forcing people to be in a harder position while in a game where they fly rockets and planes for fun than in a real life plane where you have hundreds of souls on your care just because. Your point about seriousness and risk, while trying to a awnser to Claw \u0022seriously\u0022 , it is in quite a tangent on his point IMHO ...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-31T14:38:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2014 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by r_rolo1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T14:31:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Felsmak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Felsmak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI fail to understand why you care so deeply about how other people choose to play their copies of the game.
