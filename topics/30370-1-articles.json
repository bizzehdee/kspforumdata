Try attaching a radial attachment part (the one that looks like a broken docking port and is described as such) to a girder first. Then you can attach stuff to it easily, esp ram intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T09:34:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to \u0022FLIP\u0022 a girder segment, so that the pivoting end would be the one to \u0022stick\u0022 onto the other object. This way, that pivoting end becomes an attachment point. Download my \u0022Black Mamba\u0022 craft file from Spacecraft Sharing section, and see how I attached my 8 intakes onto the fuselage using this method. Disassemble it piece by piece so you get to see how to flip the girders using the WASD (sometimes plus SHIFTkey, if you want incremental angular adjustments) keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd before I forget, for this method to work, you must first press ALT-F12, then find the \u0022disable part clipping\u0022 checkbox, and check it.

How do I change the [unanswered] tag on this message to [Answered]? There is no obvious way for me to do it. In any case, rodion_herrera gave exactly the right answer. To attach parts all over the place, disable part clipping. You can then attach to both the inside and outside of either end of a girder section.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
