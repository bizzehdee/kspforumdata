I think it\u0027s well worth using such a framework from the get-go, with simple username/password authentication to start. Supporting additional authentication methods might require some additional work to make sure there\u0027s always a sensible username available, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022avivey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022avivey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA UID for each mod: It will make your life MUCH easier to assign each mod a random, 4- or 5-digit identifier\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s something to be said for URL slugs, too.

Accordingly, the KAS slug is \u00220-18-2-kas-kerbal-attachment-system-v0-1\u0022 which probably doesn\u0027t do wonders for SEO. A brief note about this (\u0022don\u0027t include versions or anything else that might change over time\u0022) on the mod submission page might do the trick. Providing other IDs could be useful for URL shortening, but string keys are perfectly sufficient for internal use. In any case, it\u0027s important that if there are multiple URLs to a mod (e.g. /kethane and /12345), one URL should have a permanent redirect (HTTP 301) to the other. This indicates to search engines that they\u0027re the same entity. In my personal opinion, numeric identifiers are unnecessary here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would like it to have some \u0022workability\u0022 - I\u0027m thinking a way to get a tag of the latest release (in the form of a txt), for autoupdaters.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis falls into the API category.
