And a hefty number of adapters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added parts I made to my latest install and parts I desperately thought I needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Size1 to 1/2 transition fuel tank, very useful\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Size2 to 3 Aerodynamic tanks, 3 different sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Satellite core with a better reaction wheels and built in battery and solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Long size2 tank that transitioned to size1 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI modded these\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Poodle to size1, and increased ISP to 470 (Centaur FL10-B-X), Atm curve adjusted accordingly, reduced thrust in accordance to size. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Basic rover wheel, reduced size and moved to early game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E These are some of the things I think are fair game but haven\u0027t made yet:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Satellite core described above, but with MechJeb built in. (one reason I haven\u0027t done this yet is I frequently use to controllers, one pointing up and the other pointing down in the final stage because of design limitations)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The current thermonuclear engine has a rather feeble ISP, its hardly worth swapping a ISP 470 for the nuke. Need a bigger engine with ISP above 1000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The ION drive is feeble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Needs a better solar extensions, seriously the current solar panels are nothing but frame-rate theives, better to mod a small panel, increase its mass and output than use those kraken fodder. Im thinking here a solid plate on top of a truss much like the MGS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK so here are my ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVASMIR like ion drive basically a tank, two circum-axial RF generators, the acceleration unit and a nozzle, 8000 ISP. Since Xenon is expensive and Argon is actually used I was thinking about using LF as Propellant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECentaur like 3 engine upper stage tank-engine combo with a payload mounting system (including the fairing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECentaur like 9 engine upper stage combo for size2 loads. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience core- A science facility built to be operated by the pilot. It would be a cockpit and science lab in one. complete with a basic set of solar panels, reaction wheels. Designed to be coupled to VASMIR. The core would run for 6 months but would need to be resupplies every 6 months with whatever to keep running. All data transmissible to earth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESingle component telescope - Not a pitch together something, but a Hubble variant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUngrade telescope variants. What ever you want, high frequency, low frequency, polarization, cosmic radiation, exotic particle, dark matter interacter (lol). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETelescope Packager. This would be a mounting platform for serviceable telescopes, complete with parallel facing docking ports of various sizes to mount experiments such as Gamma-ray observatory or Cosmic ray detector. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsteroid Intercept tool. The current tool is basically a free flux device. This device would intercept an asteroid and attach itself by drilling a hole to its center of gravity and then orient the asteroid to its center of gravity down the central axis of the tool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELander Science Core. The problem with the current mobile processing lab is that it is passive science unit. We need a lander unit that is capable of drilling and processing samples and only once the samples are processed then are the processes samples and data returned to earth. This unit could be manned or unmanned. There could be a layers function, for instant drilling for 1 minute yields 1 layer, 1 hour 2 layers, 1 day 3 layers, 1 week 4 layers, 1 month 5 layers, Each layer adds the same amount of science as 1 surface sample. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoffkerbal telescope core. This seems to give the mun a purpose to stay, a core telescope part that can be appended to build more and more massive scopes capable of a small amount of rotation but very much higher degree of resolution than a space telescope. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot on my fair game list-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResonance drive - not proven\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarp drive - not possible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar sails - speculative. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFusion reactors - too preliminary\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELithium-chlorine-hydrogen tri-fuel engines or any engine that produces more than 500 ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn space fuel extractor - nope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEM drive - not efficient enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm trying to come up with ideas of parts to make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think that the game is missing in terms of space parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T07:53:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think what we need is MK3 plane cockpit (heavy lifter subsonic planes and replicas with space shuttle cockpit?
