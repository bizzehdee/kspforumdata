There\u0027s a fixed number of pixels on your screen. If you\u0027re displaying a flag as part of a normal scene within KSP, it\u0027s not going to be taking up anything remotely close to 2500x1600 physical pixels (unless you\u0027re on some sort of cinema-sized, megabucks, zillion pixel screen and GPU). I\u0027d estimate that you\u0027d need about a 12000x8000 pixel screen and graphics card before that size of flag was actually worthwhile, and that would probably cost over US$100,000, if not vastly more. The largest worthwhile size is approximately the physical pixel size (slightly larger is ok, massively larger is entirely pointless and wasteful, gaining little to no benefit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImage resolution is always strictly capped by the physical devices rendering the image. There are anti-aliasing technologies, and similar, which can approximate virtual pixels slightly beyond the physical, but ultimately pixels are discrete physical units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Daze\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Daze\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2) The point is that: Can i be sure that in next update this will works?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably not, since it\u0027s unreasonably large, way beyond any reasonable design expectation for flags in KSP.
