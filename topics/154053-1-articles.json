I just sent a refueling ship to a ship without a docking port landed on the Mun. I brought an engineer with an inventory full of components to build a docking adapter and have landed within range of my contraption-to-be, but I just found out I don\u0027t have a screwdriver in the engineer\u0027s inventory so I can\u0027t assemble anything. I usually have the screwdriver defaulted into Seat 0\u0027s inventory on my saved ships, but I guess I overlooked it this time.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t normally cheat through problems in-game unless the problems come from an issue introduced by the game, and I think this incident counts...\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d like to know how I can hack a screwdriver into this Kerbal\u0027s inventory.
