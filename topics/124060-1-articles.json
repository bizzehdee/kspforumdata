Sooo... but have yet been able to get captured by duna\u0027s gravity (i will provide a link to a couple of pictures i posted to my Facebook of my current location) hopefully i can get some help on how to get captured by duna\u0027s orbit, and if you can help me try to make it as detail as possible so i can\u0027t potentially mess it up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.facebook.com/ECEricCrierie/posts/898650403552551\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.facebook.com/ECEricCrierie/posts/898650403552551\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T03:36:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst things first, your job will be easier if you use a good launch window so that you arrive at Duna with a low relative velocity. There is a good tool at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz\u003C/a\u003E that can help you plan this. The orbit you have pictured is going to arrive at Duna with a pretty high velocity (you can tell because your path is crossing Duna\u0027s like an X, rather than being nearly parallel). That doesn\u0027t mean that it\u0027s necessarily impossible, just that you have a lot of velocity to kill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet your periapsis as low as possible while you\u0027re still a long way from Duna. Coming in fast like that, either your ship has to be packing a lot of dV (many kilometers per second), or else it needs to be designed to be able to withstand a fairly brutal reentry so as to aerobrake into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat sort of ship are you using? How much dV does it have? Mass? Heatshields? Airbrakes? Additional context would be helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climentina","CreatedById":152399,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T17:25:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should make the adjustment on the way there,100 more days before you reach the orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T17:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, set up a node as soon as possible infront of your ship and tweak it to try and lower your Duna apoapsis, its probably the radial handles. Ideally into the upper atmosphere, 35 always used to be my number for a Duna firstpass but its been a version or so. Fold solar/comms and orient retrograde for aerobraking. Spend your dV retrograde at periapsis (or as you climb after if you need solar/comms back out). Dont start too much before the periapsis or you will be lowering it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna doesnt do much aerobraking, you gotta get deep for the thick stuff but i dont recall offhand where the new cutoffs are. 35 is definitely in air, but definitely wont land you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as the orbit closes (is still elliptical) you can cut engines and make more aerobrake passes to bring yourself down close to circular, then you raise that apoapsis back out of the atmosphere and voila!.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt-Coulson","CreatedById":119711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T16:05:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdding to the previous comments, and generalising for the sake of being relevant: I recently launched a 2.5m diameter payload to Duna, and aerobraking at roughly 15km (plus/minus 1km) using a 2.5m heatshield captured me entirely from interplanetary speed. My vessel had a mass of approximately 50 tonnes (50,000KG). As has been mentioned, you\u0027ll need to correct for this intercept beforehand, but it\u0027s perfectly ok to fine-tune your Duna periapsis once you are inside the SOI. So long as you have an intercept with the SOI, you\u0027re laughing, so to speak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may even need to burn a little at periapsis if you cut it too fine, so be ready for that! And, to be quite honest, you don\u0027t need a heatshield. Duna\u0027s atmosphere is quite placid when compared to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
