I know I completed a contract for a Minmustationary contract (and had to have a certain feature \u0022in view\u0022).

KSP doesn\u0027t include N-body physics. If you are orbiting the Mun you shouldn\u0027t leave the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence (unless it is doing something weird like leaving and catching you again. I may have seen that).
