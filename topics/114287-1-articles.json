My problem is that I don\u0027t have a clear understanding at all of exactly how drag is modeled in 1.0.3/4, and I can\u0027t seem to find a good explanation of it sitting around anywhere. For example, are all wings alike in terms of lift vs. drag? Are wide wings draggier than narrow ones, as they would be IRL, or does it not matter? For non-wing parts, is the key consideration just cross section wrt oncoming air, or does the shape matter? If anyone has a link to a basic discussion of this, I would really appreciate it, because I\u0027m basically in the dark about how to improve my design\u0027s aerodynamic performance right now.
