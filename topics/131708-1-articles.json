In other words, you are looking at the trajectory from a different point of view before the maneuver node than after. The best idea here is to wait until you have changed frames of reference (in other words, entered Minmus\u0027 sphere of influence) and then start planning your next node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may ask: \u0022how do I know that I can safely wait?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe answer to that is simple, because there are only two things you need to look at. The first thing is whether or not you have an encounter at all - whether your trajectory is passing through the target\u0027s SoI. Seems unnecessary to point out? Well, wait until you get that one edge case where the patched conics algorithm glitches out and only draws a flickering image of an encounter, which disappears during timewarp even though you are going straight through the SoI... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0 Hopefully that\u0027ll be fixed in 1.1. Until then, make sure you are 100% confident you are actually getting an encounter, even if the game may sometimes appear to \u0022forget\u0022 it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second thing you need to look at is whether or not you have a periapsis during your encounter. If you do not have a periapsis displayed anywhere inside the target SoI, that means you are on a collision course with said body and you \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E want to plan a course correction at some point (you still have plenty of time to do this after arriving in the target SoI, by the way). If you do have a periapsis - congratulations, everything is just fine! There\u0027s nothing more you need to check. You can, if you want, try to raise or lower said periapsis, but as long as you have one at all, you can calmly and safely cruise to your encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is true for \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E encounter with \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E celestial body in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022getting into orbit\u0022 part is too, by the way. Capturing into orbit around a celestial object simply involves a retrograde burn at your encounter\u0027s periapsis. (Now you know another reason why having one is important!) This is another reason why your planned orbit may have looked screwy: you did not plan your maneuver node at periapsis. While it is possible to capture into orbit at any other point, too, fuel usage increases drastically because you need to include a significant radial component into your burn - and it makes planning the burn complicated as well. It\u0027ll be like coming to a full stop and then re-accelerating sideways to orbital velocity. Very inefficient. No, you want to do it at periapsis, where your burn is automatically perfectly aligned with the orbit you intend to reach (zero radial component, pure retrograde burn).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a rule of the thumb, rockets burn more efficiently deep inside gravity wells (\u0022Oberth Effect\u0022), which means that the lower your periapsis is, the less fuel you will need to capture into orbit. That is especially true for missions designed to land on the target body, which will eventually want to nullify the entire orbit under engine power. You will often see recommendations to choose a very low encounter periapsis for this reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-09T08:25:26Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2016 08:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-09T08:26:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t understang what this node is, just delete it a redo it.
