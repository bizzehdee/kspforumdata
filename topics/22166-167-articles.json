I believe the formula is 2.5 units of kethane becomes X units of fuel where X is the output listed. So a heavy converter is faster than a medium converter whilst about as efficient (apart from monoprop and xenon where there are tangible differences).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T17:46:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to edit kethane deposits and how many deposits generate on a planet or moon?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*starts devising evil plan to raid the Urania system and fuel the Kerbal space program for eternity*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T20:47:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deadpangod3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deadpangod3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there a way to edit kethane deposits and how many deposits generate on a planet or moon?\u003Cp\u003E*starts devising evil plan to raid the Urania system and fuel the Kerbal space program for eternity*\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes!
