Running with mods can greatly increase the memory footprint of KSP. I suspect that the big parts packs are the biggest memory consumers because the textures probably eat up tons of space.\n\nIf all of that is true, chances are what you\u0027re seeing is a side-effect of KSP running out of memory. I\u0027d expect your game just crashes a lot too.\n\nI\u0027ve found that there\u0027s three ways of running KSP: with DX9, DX11, or with OpenGL. You can select which one by using command line options when you start KSP. (Both Steam and CKAN have options to set the command line arguments if you start the game that way.)\n\nDX9 is the default and is what you\u0027re using if you haven\u0027t explicitly set it up to run with one of the other graphics interfaces. DX9 uses, by far, the most memory. If you\u0027re running Windows and using any big mod packages and haven\u0027t changed the graphics interface, you\u0027re at best running on the ragged edge of having memory problems. More likely, your game is crashing a lot and you\u0027re seeing all sorts of weird problems.\n\nOpenGL uses a lot less memory, but it\u0027s slower and the graphics aren\u0027t as good. (It may also be a bit buggier than DX9 or DX11. Fix one class of bugs, add another set of bugs. Not 100% sure about this.)\n\nDX11 also uses a lot less memory (although more than OpenGL, I think), but its speed and quality seem to be equivalent to DX9. DX11 is what I\u0027m using as it seems to clearly be the best of the three options.\n\nThe command line arguments for these three options are:\n\n-force-opengl\n\n-force-d3d9 \u003C-- Default option\n\n-force-d3d11 \u003C-- Best option\n\nI also use -single-instance to prevent accidentally launching the game twice.\n\nThis might have nothing at all to do with your problem, but if you\u0027re running Windows, you might want to try this."},{"CreatedByName":"Pibue","CreatedById":147962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T11:04:42Z","Content":"Hi, sorry for not mentioning:\n\nI use following System:\n\n-Windows 8.1 (64-Bit)\n\n-Intel i7 with 1.80/2.40 GHz\n\n- 8 GB - Ramm\n\n- Installed over STEAM\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A shot in the dark here:\n\u003E -force-d3d11 \u003C-- Best option\n\nI tried this, but it wasn\u0027t a solution.\n\nSo I did some further testing.\n\n1st step: Landing -\u003E Traking station -\u003E back to ship =\u003E no bug.\n\n2nd step: activate drills -\u003E Tracking station -\u003E back to ship =\u003E no bug.\n\n3rd step: beginn harvesting -\u003E Tracking station -\u003E back to ship =\u003E no bug.\n\n4th step: harvest up to 2400 ore -\u003E Tracking station -\u003E back to ship =\u003E no bug.\n\n5th step: aktivate IRSU -\u003E Tracking station -\u003E back to ship =\u003E no bug.\n\n6th step: transform ore -\u003E fill up to 43200 liquid fuel \u002B 52800 oxidizer -\u003E Tracking station -\u003E back to ship =\u003E station loads shows up for a second and then the game black out and freezes.\n\n7th step reload game: normaly the base sinks in the Mun, this time it \u0022just explode\u0022 after loading the ship."},{"CreatedByName":"AG5BPilot","CreatedById":146044,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T11:30:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 7th step reload game: normaly the base sinks in the Mun, this time it \u0022just explode\u0022 after loading the ship.\n\nThat problem, at least, might have a solution.
