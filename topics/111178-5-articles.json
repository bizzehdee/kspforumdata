And after that try to colonise mars maybe (like mars one or the Zubrin concept). Also im plaing OPM and i wonder if it would be possible to make some missions for them, maybe like the mars missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK to condense all of this i guess im asking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Will you include some tourism like it is planned from Virgin galagtic or so ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Will you include the future nasa missions to mars and other planets, and earth science satelites/ asteriod ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Will you include rough concept missions like Mars one colony etc ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Also would you be willing to build onto the Mars colony missions and make some for the OPM mod ? to colonize farther out ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for this !\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T19:55:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ManuxKerb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dunadirect","CreatedById":121854,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T03:27:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ManuxKerb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ManuxKerb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat tech tree would you recommend ?\u003Cp\u003EDoes your tree generate enought science for using it solo or do i have to launche other non-mission-missions for science ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027ve just been giving myself 60 science at the start of a career, and then doing the \u0022get science from kerbin\u0022 stock contract for the last five to let me start off with probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Escience can be pretty sparse, if you don\u0027t allow yourself EVAs until you do contracts with them.

In the mean time I would like to thank Duna for the invaluable help in his Github repo! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ManuxKerb, I have made the missions in chronological order based on agency so a certain agency set of contracts (e.g the Pioneer program) must be completed after its chronological predecessor (Sputnik-1), however this allows for missions to be progressed faster on some programs than in real life (For example later on, the soyuz missions along side the STS missions (Soyuz 1 - T-30 could be completed before launching STS-2) this is just so that people who want to only play a russian or american set of missions can do up to a certain point) the system I have at the moment causes issues with inter connectivity, so I will take your ordered flights idea into consideration when I release the individual and full packs. ( So basically I would have a purely chronological progression for the full pack and then no order limits on the separate packs (E.g the STS missions or the Apollo program). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Sorry for not replying to your previous issue either, each contract has a cool down duration (Most are around 10 in game days) So you may have to wait a little while for new contracts to appear, If you don\u0027t see any new contracts after say 45 days then please let me know and I can have a look. By the way, some cool down durations are much longer for some Probe missions and the gaps after the wake of STS-51-L and STS-107 (due to the real life gaps). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope everyone is enjoying the mod and soon I hope to gather the courage to leave the sunlight and return to my modding cave for some serious work!
