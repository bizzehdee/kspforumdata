For KSP 1.04 im planning to do a full playthrough with your missions.\n\nWhat other contract packs would you recommend to use with your pack ? Or is it intendet to be played solo. Does it kill the stock contracts ? (I think it should! as they would interfere quite badly)\n\nThe same goes for mods. What mods would you recommend to use for the best play experience ? Are thre required mods (like cacteye 2 for Hubble and so on ?)What tech tree would you recommend ?\n\nDoes your tree generate enought science for using it solo or do i have to launche other non-mission-missions for science ?\n\nI like to play realisticly but also with fun and beyond the space travel we know can come up with.\n\nMy idea of playing would be: Using the Seti Tech tree to start unmanned, then play your missions (start with V2 etc), after your missions go beyond that, first with comercial spaceflight like tourism (like in stock, deliver to sub orbit and station) then onward with the first Orion/mars missions (there is also a rover mission planned for 2016 and 2020 to mars). And after that try to colonise mars maybe (like mars one or the Zubrin concept). Also im plaing OPM and i wonder if it would be possible to make some missions for them, maybe like the mars missions.\n\nOK to condense all of this i guess im asking:\n\n- Will you include some tourism like it is planned from Virgin galagtic or so ?\n\n- Will you include the future nasa missions to mars and other planets, and earth science satelites/ asteriod ?\n\n- Will you include rough concept missions like Mars one colony etc ?\n\n- Also would you be willing to build onto the Mars colony missions and make some for the OPM mod ? to colonize farther out ?\n\nThank you for this !\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T19:55:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ManuxKerb**"},{"CreatedByName":"dunadirect","CreatedById":121854,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T03:27:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What tech tree would you recommend ?\n\u003E Does your tree generate enought science for using it solo or do i have to launche other non-mission-missions for science ?\n\ni\u0027ve just been giving myself 60 science at the start of a career, and then doing the \u0022get science from kerbin\u0022 stock contract for the last five to let me start off with probes.\n\nscience can be pretty sparse, if you don\u0027t allow yourself EVAs until you do contracts with them.

In the mean time I would like to thank Duna for the invaluable help in his Github repo! \n\n@ManuxKerb, I have made the missions in chronological order based on agency so a certain agency set of contracts (e.g the Pioneer program) must be completed after its chronological predecessor (Sputnik-1), however this allows for missions to be progressed faster on some programs than in real life (For example later on, the soyuz missions along side the STS missions (Soyuz 1 - T-30 could be completed before launching STS-2) this is just so that people who want to only play a russian or american set of missions can do up to a certain point) the system I have at the moment causes issues with inter connectivity, so I will take your ordered flights idea into consideration when I release the individual and full packs. ( So basically I would have a purely chronological progression for the full pack and then no order limits on the separate packs (E.g the STS missions or the Apollo program). \n\n Sorry for not replying to your previous issue either, each contract has a cool down duration (Most are around 10 in game days) So you may have to wait a little while for new contracts to appear, If you don\u0027t see any new contracts after say 45 days then please let me know and I can have a look. By the way, some cool down durations are much longer for some Probe missions and the gaps after the wake of STS-51-L and STS-107 (due to the real life gaps). \n\nI hope everyone is enjoying the mod and soon I hope to gather the courage to leave the sunlight and return to my modding cave for some serious work!

The first satellite launched, Vanguard 1, was the first to be solar powered, and though communications with it died in 1964 it remains the oldest human made object still in orbit today; even it\u0027s spend third stage rocket is still orbiting! I launched my own version of Vanguard 1 and intend to leave it in orbit for the remainder of my current game, even though my original Sputnik (or \u0027Kerputnik\u0027 as I called it) had a stable orbit, albeit with a periapsis almost down to 50km, which come to think of it might have caused it to burn up eventually, had I not manually deleted it already.\n\nEDIT: One further point; I just accidentally completed the mission to launch Explorer 1 by switching to flying my Vanguard 1 satellite. Perhaps on your next review of all contracts you could ensure they all have the \u0027must be new vessel\u0027 parameter where appropriate?\n\nKeep up the good work!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T17:13:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 05:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gerishnakov**\n  \nFurther information to add"},{"CreatedByName":"Whitecat106","CreatedById":140086,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T14:03:10Z","Content":"Hi everyone!\n\nFirst of all, an apology for my latency (again!) y\u0027know - Pesky real life stuff... \n\nIts been a while but I have just updated the pack, this update includes some separation of the pack into three main groups; this means that now everyone can play whichever mission within a reasonable amount of time (rather than completing 398 contracts!). The groups are currently 1940-1975, 1975-1998, 1998\u002B. \n\nSome minor bugs have been found and fixed! \n\nThanks for all the help everyone, I shall be updating to 1.4.0 soon, this will involve fixes for all \u0027Must be new vessel\u0027 requirements as just mentioned by gerishnakov along with fixes for Rover missions etc as previously mentioned in this thread. Bear with me and all will be fixed! However I would ask that testing of the pack as it is, especially the missions that no one has tried before (shuttle, mir, iss etc), be carried out before I update (since now I pretty much have to sift through almost 1000 files on each round of additions/fixes) so I want to fix everything (as best as I can) in one big go rather than do this again in a week or two! Since I do want to add more detail and substance to the existing missions and eventually more missions to the pack! \n\nThanks everyone! Enjoy! \n\nWhitecat106, \n\nP.S sorry if I have messages from anyone I have not replied to, I have been using a mobile for the last few weeks and messages don\u0027t like my phone!
