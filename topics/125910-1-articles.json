When I clicked to transmit the data, a message popped up saying \u0022transmission starting\u0022 and then nothing else happened. The antenna didn\u0026#39;t move, no more messages came up about the progress of the transmission, there was no electric charge consumption. However, the experiment itself was gone. I tried this on several other experiments with the same results. For some reason, I quicksaved at this point, ran into other problems later, and reverted back to this quicksave. When I did that, suddenly the antenna and transmission thing worked fine and all the experiments I\u0026#39;d tried to transmit earlier were queued up and all went off in sequence. So, while there are some intended mechanics that prevent you from transmitting if you don\u0026#39;t have enough battery, there\u0026#39;s also a bug that mimics that behavior. If you know you\u0026#39;ve got enough battery, change scenes or reload a recent save and see if that solves the problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn another note, a welcome change to antennae in 1.05 is that you CAN finally queue up transmissions. It used to be that you had to wait for the antenna\u0026#39;s entire animation to come to an end with it retracted again before starting your next transmission. If you tried to transmit a 2nd experiment while the antenna animation was still going, that 2nd experiment would be lost and you\u0026#39;ve have to run it again. No longer. You can queue up as many transmissions as you want, provided you have sufficient battery.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Masiong","CreatedById":153818,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T00:35:17Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Harry Rhodan\u0027][URL]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76793-1-0-4-ScienceAlert-1-8-9-Experiment-availability-feedback-%28July-13%29?p=2293463\u0026viewfull=1#post2293463[/URL][/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat patch worked, thanks!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027Geschosskopf\u0027]That said, I have also had a problem where the antennae just refused to work, even with adequate battery for the transmission.
