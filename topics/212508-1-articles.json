The first Kerbal Space Program was my first game I ever bought on the PC back in 2013 and has always captivated my interest in the cosmos. KSP2 has been on my watchlist since it had been officially been announced and now I am glad it\u0027s here. I only wish I could really enjoy it now.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI could really only manage to play the game for roughly an hour as launching rockets completely tanks my FPS. Even while on the lowest settings, I can only achieve ~3-5 FPS when launching from Kerbin, in orbit of Kerbin (or in low orbit near any celestial body). Map view appears unaffected. If it was something like, 15-20 frames, that\u0027s doable enough for me, but alas, that is not the case. So, I have to wait longer, at least until the roll out some optimizations. Perhaps it has something do with render distances or something.\u00A0 I do feel the UI could use some refinement, particularly the parts selection. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s just me, but I feel it takes up too much space and that icons are too big. For me, I prefer a more condensed UI, but others may like it. There was also the matter of camera manipulation. I felt it was a little... clunky? Perhaps I am just too used to the first KSP\u0027s controls.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow that I got the only bad thing out of the way, I\u0027d like to get to what I do enjoy. The new sounds are fantastic, especially for the rockets. Their implementation of rocket booster noises from actual recorded footage is pretty much spot on. The fidelity of the game is gorgeous. Much to my GPU\u0027s suffering, I did max out the graphics to look at some of the views the game had to offer. Curse my old Vega 64! Moving on, the build menu is quite nice, I like the retro aesthetic to it and perhaps in the future, the UI can be customizable. The models themselves look fantastic and well made, and I very much look forward to the future content including their interstellar parts! I had managed to build a general design of the rocket and do a flyby of the Mun on my first launch (woo!) and it made me excited for what the developers have in store.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOverall, I wish I can enjoy what KSP2 has to offer, even if it\u0027s less than KSP1, but until some optimizations come, I\u0027ll just have to keep track of the updates. That\u0027s my only issue with this game, that I can\u0027t really play it.\u00A0 That\u0027s just my thoughts regarding the day one release of this game, and I definitely look forward to its future.\u00A0 Thanks for taking the time to hear my little thoughts and rant, fly safe out there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BobbyDausus","CreatedById":226123,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T23:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe performance is horrible indeed,unacceptable,but also there are some good things i like as well,even tho\u00A0 i can\u0027t play the game....Sounds are amazing and to be fair,i like the UI,not as bad as other people say.I also like the parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostElement","CreatedById":78368,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T23:40:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224240956\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212508\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677281902\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022226123\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BobbyDausus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, BobbyDausus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe performance is horrible indeed,unacceptable,but also there are some good things i like as well,even tho\u00A0 i can\u0027t play the game....Sounds are amazing and to be fair,i like the UI,not as bad as other people say.I also like the parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a shame that the performance is quite poor, but the developers did state the game is far from ready.
