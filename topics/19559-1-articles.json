I have a relatively strong processor, Intel i5 @ 2.67 Ghz. I have an adequate amount of RAM, 4GB. But my graphics card is rather out dated and crappy. It\u0027s a nVidia GeForce 9500 GT. Which is less than I\u0027d like to have. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo run KSP rather lagless-ly? I have to turn all shaders off, and run it at around 800x600 resolution which leaves major black space on my 1920 x 1080 monitor. While watching the game run it takes around ~500MB of RAM, and puts around a constant 12% load on my CPU, yet still lags with any sort of graphical stimulation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts on of this is definitely the case, or what cards I should look in to, or any information you could possibly have for me! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, Andrew.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-18T05:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a 9500GT before my current setup. It ran the game, but launches were slide shows. The game really needs a lot of VRAM as you add more parts. The game also hasn\u0027t had a good optimization recently so it\u0027s bound to need top end hardware to run smoothly. Eventually they will optimize the code and give more video options to tweak your settings for a smoother running game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starsky","CreatedById":50448,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-18T05:33:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt runs well at 800 x 600, but I\u0027d like to run it at a higher resolution and it just won\u0027t do it.
