However, high Isp has the disadvantage of lower thrust, which is not good if you want to escape the gravity-well of a planet of large mun. Therefore sometimes you want to lower the Isp. One simple but effective solution to this problem, might be to simply increase the flow rate. By increasing the flow rate, the propellant should eventually have less time to heat up, resulting in a lower exit temperature and therefore a lower Isp. \n\nNow the question is, is this assumption correct?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T10:47:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 10:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T23:31:12Z","Content":"a) you do not want to use high ISP engines to escape the gravity well. that\u0027s what SRBs are for.\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) yes, higher flow rate means less ISP. no, lower ISP does not causally correlate to higher thrust. you would not gain any thrust by this method.\n\n\u0022specialization\u0022 is the keyword. one engine to lift off, high thrust, low ISP, another engine for orbital/deep space with low thrust, high ISP.\n\nI guess your approach would make sense if - and only if - your goal would be to have as few engines as possible. having only one multipurpose engine might save weight... but I do not think we have one..."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T01:19:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E no, lower ISP does not causally correlate to higher thrust. you would not gain any thrust by this method.\n\nYou absolutely would, because energy is quadratic on exhaust velocity, while thrust and I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E are merely linear.

I mean, we ***know*** there\u0027s basically no limit - you can keep adjusting the reactor geometry to produce a more energetic fission reaction until the reactor itself glows white and explodes with a flash. You don\u0027t *have* to have the various safety measures that civilian power reactors have - you could make your nuclear engine run just a hair short of exploding like a fizzled fission bomb.\n\nSince you can relatively easily increase power output, you\u0027d compensate for the increased power by increasing the propellant flow rate. More thrust at the same ISP, reactor design is just more dangerous. Now, one problem with this is what happens when the burn is over? How do you stop the reactor from getting so hot it sends out a cloud of fuel vapour?"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T21:42:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Pollution from a NERVA, as I understand it, would be minimal, as the nuclear fuel stays inside the engine and isn\u0027t exhausted.\n\nThat\u0027s true if your fuel is hydrogen. But with random atmospheric gas, you are likely to be producing secondary radiation. Think radioactive dust after a nuclear explosion. That dust didn\u0027t come from the bomb, but from irradiated environment. Many perfectly stable and safe isotopes have capability of capturing neutrons from a radioactive source and becoming radioactive themselves. So if you just scoop up atmo and run it through an NTR engine, you are going to be leaving a radioactive plume. Hard to tell if it would be significant, but the risk is definitely there.\n\nNow, Russians are currently working on a variation of NTR which does not use direct heating. They have a reactor that generates power, and an electric heater in the heat exchanger. So the propellant never gets close to the radiation source. That engine only exists on paper at the moment, but this is the sort of setup you can safely use in an atmosphere.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Something like thermal turbojet?

Now when I am thinking about it, something like NERVA-aerospike hybrid would have been the best.\n\nYou might have a bypass section in your turbine, similar to a typical turbofan, which would supplement TWR. You\u0027d want to be able to disable bypass and go to a ramjet mode at some point, though. In fact, a thermal version of SR-71 Blackbird jets is probably your best bet.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T21:45:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 09:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by K^2**"},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy12","CreatedById":103022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T21:54:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Now, Russians are currently working on a variation of NTR which does not use direct heating.
