However, high Isp has the disadvantage of lower thrust, which is not good if you want to escape the gravity-well of a planet of large mun. Therefore sometimes you want to lower the Isp. One simple but effective solution to this problem, might be to simply increase the flow rate. By increasing the flow rate, the propellant should eventually have less time to heat up, resulting in a lower exit temperature and therefore a lower Isp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the question is, is this assumption correct?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T10:47:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 10:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T23:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ea) you do not want to use high ISP engines to escape the gravity well. that\u0027s what SRBs are for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E yes, higher flow rate means less ISP. no, lower ISP does not causally correlate to higher thrust. you would not gain any thrust by this method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022specialization\u0022 is the keyword. one engine to lift off, high thrust, low ISP, another engine for orbital/deep space with low thrust, high ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess your approach would make sense if - and only if - your goal would be to have as few engines as possible. having only one multipurpose engine might save weight... but I do not think we have one...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T01:19:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022heng\u0022 data-cite=\u0022heng\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eno, lower ISP does not causally correlate to higher thrust. you would not gain any thrust by this method.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou absolutely would, because energy is quadratic on exhaust velocity, while thrust and I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E are merely linear.
