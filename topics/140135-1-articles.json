Mods like Pathfinder, UKS, KPBS, and others are no different. It comes down to what your interests are. Pathfinder is aimed at players like me who are semi-casual, who want base building aspects in the game, and who see them as a means to support their exploration efforts but also not get in the way. The mod is built around the premise of \u0022we\u0027ve just planted boot prints and flags, now what?\u0022 This is a question that all the base building mods try to answer, to be honest. For Pathfinder, the idea is that you set up temporary bases via EVA- which means KIS/KAS is a prerequisite- and then outfit the empty modules with equipment. It\u0027s also based around the bootstrap and jerry-rig nature of the old west; several parts can be converted after launch to serve different functions. Need a geology lab? As long as you have enough equipment, you can convert that unused habitat into one. Build a generator out of a storage box. Convert a Chuckwagon into a greenhouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve built a lot of configurable options into the mod, because my play style might not match yours. For instance, you can opt out of the need to have enough equipment on hand to reconfigure a module, opt out of the need for an engineer, and (for those parts that break), the need for resources to repair the module, and you can even decide whether or not the parts can break. It also has three different play modes: Default, with all the bells and whistles, Simplified, with a simplified production chain for those who want just a bit of complexity and/or are just starting out, and Pristine, which does away with all the converters in favor just having nice looking parts. You can select your play mode at the space center; just decide which one you want to use, and restart the game. Your bases will adjust accordingly. The other options are configurable both at the space center and in flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou also have science options: core samples give you some science and a chance to improve- or worsen- resource extraction rates in the current biome. The geology lab can unlock the biome and generate science. It also lets you conduct studies that might improve your production rates- or worsen them- for the current biome, based upon gaining a better understanding of the composition of the local resources. And you have an orbiting satellite that gains science by continuously monitoring and cataloging the planet\u0027s resources. And once you\u0027re done improving drilling and production to your liking, you can continue to do geology studies and either publish your research for reputation, or sell the research for funds. Or you can ignore the geology studies altogether, and stick with the base level efficiencies, and not bother with publishing or selling your research.

Especially since you are talking about two of my must have mods.\u00A0It really depends of what you want to do and your computer capabilities. If you want to build a realistic base with a minimum of mods, it favors kpbs , you just need stock and this mod. However, for realism kpbs would probably be in phase two colonization, as inflatables would be used for mass and weight consideration. For realism sake and if you are bldg an initial asteroid base pathfinder is the way to go. However, once you add a life support mod, ( and you computer can handle it), here is when the integration the nils and angel had done to their mods, that makes them a sight to behold. The ability to reconfigure labs, drills, etc.mtjet pathfinder brings to Kbps\u00A0really brings the ability to build realistic self sustaining bases, specially with the chem lab. \u00A0I have not tried mks as I just started experimenting with life support. But it you have the memory capacity, I\u0027ll recommend you use both Kbps and pathfinder together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
