Cause if so i can find it, and if it doesnt exist id appreciate of someone made a mod to do this (id do it myself but im very busy with real life stuff and dont expect much freetime in the next few weeks)."},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T17:21:51Z","Content":"\u002B1\n\nthis definitely should get a switch in the stock cheat menu"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:38:31Z","Content":"I\u0027d like this as well, currently to attach ground lights pointing up at my craft from the pad I need to use clamps or trusses laid along the ground.
