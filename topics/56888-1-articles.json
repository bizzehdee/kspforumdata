Make some science instruments that drip-feed an amount of science while the game is running and the instrument is active. Say 0.01 units per game day per instrument base rate, as a suggestion.

Voyager 2 is still providing useful new data, there\u0027s no reason a Kerbal probe should be any different. Sure, that means that someone could build their first probe with a single instrument, put it in $random_escape_trajectory and wait.

Current game mechanics allow for the sun to be divided into regions so I could take multiple gravity readings as I orbit and get an overall idea of the Sun\u0027s gravitation field, yielding large research benefits. A new game mechanic could allow for two additional opportunities to gain research from gravity readings around the sun. 1) A continuous gravity scan which lasts a minimum of several months and is disrupted by any change in the probe\u0027s orbit. This shows short-term fluctuations in the Sun\u0027s gravitational field. 2) A second set of gravity scans around the Sun taken at least 5 or 10 years after the original scans, and then perhaps again every 5 or 10 years. This shows long-term fluctuations in the Suns\u0027 gravitational field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you combine this mechanic with a mechanic allowing instruments to wear out after so many scans or after a period of time, it allows for ongoing research of dynamic forces in the universe without allowing someone to simply spam science instruments into the sky. There is no point in sending 20 identical probes to the sun at once, you\u0027ll only get research credit from 1 set of scans. On the other hand, you can\u0027t do all your research with 1 probe because it\u0027s going to wear out before it\u0027s time to start taking long-term scans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thought, some things aren\u0027t very dynamic. After you\u0027ve taken two dozen seismic readings of the Mun, you\u0027ve learned pretty much everything you\u0027re going to learn even in terms of long-term trends. I think there should still be a limit to how many long-term readings you get to benefit from...of course, it would still be cool if you crash things into the Mun and have a pre-placed seismic sensor feel the effects...but probably impractical from a coding standpoint, and how many research points do we really need anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T07:29:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022technicalfool\u0022 data-cite=\u0022technicalfool\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou expose the science bay or canister once for its normal science value, then it carries on slowly dragging science from the biome as long as it\u0027s powered and active.
