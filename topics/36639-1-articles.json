This runs KSP well, at least with the pretty basic aircraft/rockets that I have been designing. If I upgrade I will of course go to a much more modern processor (Intel Ivy Bridge or Haswell), so the increase in CPU processing power will be assured. But what happens if I stick with my HD 6670 graphics card? This card, while somewhat old, is I believe still significantly faster than any current integrated graphics (Intel or AMD). I guess the integrated graphics issue isn\u0027t really relevant since I have no problem going with a discrete card. My real question is will upgrading from the HD 6670 to a more-modern discrete card actually provide any major benefit to the speed of KSP in its current form? My general impression is single-threaded CPU performance is king for the current version of KSP, but really how much does the graphics card matter? Nothing I\u0027ve been able to find with searching has seemed to answer this question. Mostly people assume a more-powerful graphics card will be better, but there doesn\u0027t appear to be any quantification of what the KSP speed gains will be as we move up the graphics card ladder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs another data point, I have a Sony laptop with a 2.0 GHz dual-core mobile Intel T6400 processor (a \u0022Penryn\u0022 model, one \u0022tick\u0022 newer than my E6600, but probably not much difference other than clock speed and graphics card). This laptop uses the integrated Intel \u0022GM45\u0022 graphics, which is I believe at least three generations below the current Haswell integrated graphics level. So the graphics performance is pretty pathetic. This laptop plays KSP poorly (stock, with no addons, and with simple airplanes/rockets that my 9 year-old son designs). The CPU clock is 2.0 GHz vs 3.0 Ghz on my desktop, but the serious reduction in KSP performance on the laptop seems greater than can be explained by the CPU clock speed difference. This seems to point to a major influence of graphics card performance, at least when comparing old Intel GM45 integrated to discrete AMD HD 6670 on a CPU that is 33% slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t play many other games, so if I can be convinced that my current HD 6670 discrete graphics card isn\u0027t an issue for KSP, then I will be happy to keep it and save the money of a graphics card upgrade.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the input, and I hope this will provoke responses that provide concrete information on KSP performance vs graphics card type (understandably tainted by many other factors such as CPU model, RAM size/speed, hard drive type, etc). Now that I think of it, maybe I should start a new thread on this. But being a newbie I am hesitant to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: this is something I just thought of - is there a \u0022FPS\u0022 test in KSP that we can run to give an indication of performance under somewhat-controlled circumstances?

I thought it would run correctly with low settings, but I\u0027m getting very low FPS with a 235-part ship. The VAB is OK even with better graphic settings, but it gets terrible outside or even on the Space Center screen (where you chose the building to use) despite CPU usage not exceeding 20%, so I guess it is really graphics-related here. Graphic settings are already on the lowest, so I\u0027m wondering whether I could manually edit the .cfg to lower some settings even more, like terrain details, or anything else that would be relevant and effective?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also get very long loading screens (much longer than on my desktop PC, i5, 4 GB, SSD) which surprises me because of the amount of RAM I have and the fact KSP is installed on the SSD.
