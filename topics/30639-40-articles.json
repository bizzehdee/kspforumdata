I have considered KW Rocketry pack, but not sure if I have the RAM to run it, seeing as I had to run the texture reduction pack for B9.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pa1983","CreatedById":58328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T17:46:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have seen the MK 4 fuselage on youtube and its easy to find with google but it seems like its no longer being developed. Cant find a forum thread for it either and its ugly beyond reason so I have decided not to use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the reduction pack for B9 and unless you run higher then 1920x1080 and want to zoom in on individual parts theres realy not much difference and I save like 600Mb ram using it so KW rocketry can easily fit it. I use a howl bunch of mods and use about 2.4Gb of ram.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realy dont hit the 4Gb limit but rather other problems I have discovered that causes the game to crash with a ton of mods. Dont know why tough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 64bit linux port hates B9 pack or mods in general not sure. 19 out of 20 times it wont load B9 pack and just print abort on the terminal after it crashes. But when it do load it works just fine. Seems to me there s some kind of race condition or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea the B9 pack needs to be tough trough better I think. If I could make mods, I can model a LITTLE bit but not enough atm but that I could probably learn. But I have a hard time finding a good mod guide that is up to date for 0.22 and has all the steps needed to make say an engine, wing etc once you created a model in blender. I would try to do some sort of system that had clearly defined rules for wings and fuselage pieces so they fit in a variety of ways. Not that is easy but it should be a bit like lego so it scales well. Feels like B9 and a lot of mods just have parts with different size and shapes that just fits in a very specific order and thats a problem. Craft looks ugly or needs a ton of adaptors to fit one cockpit with one fuselage. My favourite cockpit dont fit well with my favourite fuselage etc. Annoying as F.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWing peaces also leaves some things to be desire. I like the delta wing look of the Shuttle but most wing parts I ahve used in KSP tends to favour more traditional aircraft style wings. Dont make sense to me. Might work as well or better but I want some style to not just a A380 SSTO look alike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I suck at modelling, not to good at keeping the poly count down and doing good textures. I just model from time to time so never realy get in to it to much. I do have a wacom bambo but same problem there, only use it maybe 1-2 months every year at the most.
