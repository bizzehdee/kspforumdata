This game, however, was based on the \u003Cem\u003ECommand and Conquer\u003C/em\u003E engine, so it managed to be reasonably good without having to re-invent much. And it used genuine 3D modeling (rather than rotating sprites), which was more demanding for computers to handle but allowed one to use the landscape itself as part of the strategy for conquering an area. If anything, I\u0027d like to see this re-done with more modern computational capabilities in mind, because the intense computational requirements meant that some landscapes were a bit sparse and/or small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd on a little side rant. Yeah, if I ever had the opportunity to see it, I\u0027d certainly see that show live.

(Those joints at the top of the stilts look pretty wheel-y to me.) They also don\u0027t look like the sort of thing that would cause the sense of inscrutable dread I get out of the novel. All that said, though, there\u0027s an opening cinematic in the game where a tripod blasts an oncoming locomotive that I \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally\u003C/strong\u003E happen to like.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T14:20:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nikolai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nikolai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s the case, maybe they just \u003Cstrong\u003Eforgot\u003C/strong\u003E that sterilizing needles and/or blood was a thing they needed to do.
