This is going to be my first 0.20 release and it\u0027s not a ship, it\u0027s several! I figured it was time to update my station architecture. This time only two craft files, but that is only because you only need two launches to assemble a fully functional, six-module space station. But first, let\u0027s see the finished product, with room for 13 kerbals (only one included), three big grey tanks of fuel (only one full after assembly), and more monopropellant and docking ports (of all sizes) that you will know what to do with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/I6L9cCf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I6L9cCf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022I6L9cCf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that is only one of the possible configurations. See, there are two craft files, a station core pack, and an expansion pack. With the first launch, you are basically buying a minimally functional monolithic space station with a little manned tug/observation module (You can/will use it later on the space station construction) and lots of expansion docks. Here it is on the pad, nicely packed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/2bX8GFW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2bX8GFW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222bX8GFW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here it is on orbit (you will have to use fuel form the station tanks to at least circularize, the launch is extremely tight). Notice I have already relocated the tug to free the front probe ports:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/UJ6mE3Q\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UJ6mE3Q.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UJ6mE3Q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen comes the second launch, the expansion pack. It comes with two solar array wings, a habitat module for six kerbals, a big fuel tank, and a drive unit to push everything uphill (probed so you can dispose of it if you want, or relocate it to another port in the the station). You could keep on launching more expansion packs and try different station configurations (as big as your computer allows you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ), but I just made do with two launches to test out everything, though I will probably increase it later for the greater fuel capacity. On the pad, also with the important bits covered, using an uprated version of the same launcher:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/pHjquKR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pHjquKR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pHjquKR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section has a drive pod with a Skipper and has lots of torque from the two cupolas inside, so finishing orbital insertion and proceeding to a rendezvous is a breeze:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/5eo2cGO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5eo2cGO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225eo2cGO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can grab the solar panel arms with the manned RCS tug during assembly, and that\u0027s how I started:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/IvEZJjM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IvEZJjM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IvEZJjM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then (after picking up both solar panels in one go and having a bad time with an unbalanced tug with a load way too big), I got a bit bored of stuff drifting apart and proceeded to dock everything together and pick stuff up one by one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/EfAUgQi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EfAUgQi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EfAUgQi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end both ways are workable, but if you need ASAS to move around, I\u0027d recommend docking stuff one by one using the whole extra tank \u002B drive pod as your tug, then detaching the portion you don\u0027t want in that port and proceed to the next. You can imagine than with more expansion packs launched, the possibilities are endless. You could keep on making the solar arrays bigger and assemble the tanks in a cross on the bottom, or try something completely different. You won\u0027t run out of docking ports, and you have tugs to move around pieces of all sizes, if you use the drive units as tugs for the big ports, and the observation cupola for the regular ones. Or, you know, you could put your own stuff inside the payload shroud and make your own custom modules, or take out all that is under it out and use the big tank\u002Bdrive pod as a tanker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDOWNLOADS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/wk4dc6a4qwtf548/Station_Core_Pack_%28Stock%29.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStation Core Pack\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/b90dcw1qbh73d1v/Station_Expansion_Pack_%28Stock%29.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStation Expansion Pack\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
