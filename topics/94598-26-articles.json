At least the ships load because the info for the old parts is still there. Again, thank you for this. I can just replace parts on a launch by launch basis.

In previous versions it was not necessary to use fuel lines to connect the antimatter, being on the same stack always worked. I alsot weaked the reactor to start off with an amount of lqdHe3 so it had all it\u0027s fuels. I tried with both ktech solid state as well as direct conversion generators for the AIM reactor. The reactor would activate and deactivate, but used no resources, produced no thermal power or charged particles. Waste heat was distributed between the fission reactor, the radiators and the AIM reactor, so connections were there, the thing just wouldn\u0027t do anything and wouldn\u0027t display any fuel-deprived messages. I also tried shutting down the fission reactor and the attached generator. The reactor/genny combos were located on opposite poles of the single stack \u0027vessel\u0027 seperated by several parts. It just flat wont turn on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest I cannot remember the exact version I was using prior to updating yesterday and the day before. It would have been something from a week ago, friday or sat last week. Or maybe not. I know the ship I built that I keep talking about (S.S. Novara, pics on my steam profile, jhook777...) had the liquid cooling radiators and nitrogen tanks but the generator attached to the reactor is the 3.75m variety (not the \u0027large electric generator\u0027 variety). So, yeah... sorry I\u0027m not used to posting on forums, when I encounter problems it\u0027s usually one someone else has already posted about....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yemo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Yemo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@jihook:\u003Cp\u003ESorry to hear that, experienced something similar myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then, I copy paste my KSP folder before installing a major update, takes a few minutes in the background (and leads to having 3 or so KSP copies around), but if something does not work out, I can just switch back to the KSP backup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the empathy and proposed solution. Much appreciated. Regretfully, I am limited by hard drive space; I cut/paste KSP to a microSD card and cut/paste another game when I want to play it. Only room for one or two at a time. I make periodic backups of my save files and am pretty good about rescuing kerbals and recovering/scuttling ships if I know an update is going to invalidate a ship in flight. Please note, this isn\u0027t what happened. I didn\u0027t lose any ships. The only issue I\u0027m actually experiencing is the issue with the AIM reactor.

Everything else I\u0027ve tested works as of .7.10. I understand you didn\u0027t touch the AIM reactors, but something is wonky and I\u0027m unable to identify what I might have done wrong in installing (and reinstalling from scratch).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only things related to KSPI that I saw in the error console were a bunch of warnings about RDTechnode or something like that in regards to not finding certain techs. I ignored most of that... then there was this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Log]: [KSP Interstellar]: MicrowaveSources initialized\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Log]: [KSPI] - InterstellarFissionMSRGC.MaximumThermalPower exception: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Log]: [KSPI] - InterstellarFissionMSRGC.MaximumThermalPower exception: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly exceptions I saw when I started a new sandbox game, built a craft that was basically a probe core, science unit (for antimatter production) a fission reactor and generator (3.75m gas core and equivalent genny), radiators, antimatter storage, and the AIM reactor. In previous versions it was not necessary to use fuel lines to connect the antimatter, being on the same stack always worked. I alsot weaked the reactor to start off with an amount of lqdHe3 so it had all it\u0027s fuels. I tried with both ktech solid state as well as direct conversion generators for the AIM reactor. The reactor would activate and deactivate, but used no resources, produced no thermal power or charged particles. Waste heat was distributed between the fission reactor, the radiators and the AIM reactor, so connections were there, the thing just wouldn\u0027t do anything and wouldn\u0027t display any fuel-deprived messages. I also tried shutting down the fission reactor and the attached generator. The reactor/genny combos were located on opposite poles of the single stack \u0027vessel\u0027 seperated by several parts. It just flat wont turn on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest I cannot remember the exact version I was using prior to updating yesterday and the day before. It would have been something from a week ago, friday or sat last week. Or maybe not. I know the ship I built that I keep talking about (S.S. Novara, pics on my steam profile, jhook777...) had the liquid cooling radiators and nitrogen tanks but the generator attached to the reactor is the 3.75m variety (not the \u0027large electric generator\u0027 variety). So, yeah... sorry I\u0027m not used to posting on forums, when I encounter problems it\u0027s usually one someone else has already posted about....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the empathy and proposed solution. Much appreciated. Regretfully, I am limited by hard drive space; I cut/paste KSP to a microSD card and cut/paste another game when I want to play it. Only room for one or two at a time. I make periodic backups of my save files and am pretty good about rescuing kerbals and recovering/scuttling ships if I know an update is going to invalidate a ship in flight. Please note, this isn\u0027t what happened. I didn\u0027t lose any ships. The only issue I\u0027m actually experiencing is the issue with the AIM reactor. And, it\u0027s mind boggling because there\u0027s no reason there should be a problem with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/85214-Shtirliz72\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EShtirliz72\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObvi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot crying, bellyaching.
