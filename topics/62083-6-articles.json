For instance, Rune\u0027s Far Star. This approximates the advertised performance but doesn\u0027t duplicate it. When I engage the drive on the launch pad, it does climb smoothly and stays pointing straight up, which is way better than my own designs have accomplished. However, it doesn\u0027t stay directly over the Launchpad. Instead, it accelerates slowly to the east while climbing steadily at 5m/s. Because it\u0027s moving east, it\u0027s definitely moving horizontally. If it was geostationary it wouldn\u0027t move sideways and if it was letting Kerbin rotate under it, it would appear to be going west. And then there\u0027s how it works in space. Engage the drive and all legs instantly break after providing only a split-second of thrust, not enough to change the orbit more than a couple of meters. And following the repair instructions Rune posted doesn\u0027t work--the legs still instantly break again even with ESC pushed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey! Lots of people have reported stuff like this, and all I can say is, I did the best I could taming the beast! First, the perfect vertical climb can only be achieved if you are pointing perfectly vertical and all the legs are working. A slight lateral deviation will create slight lateral speed, but the weird behavior of giving a lateral component just enough to keep yourself synchronous if you don\u0027t accelerate laterally still happens. As to in-orbit results, well, I did say the Drive engages correctly less than 20% of the time. The way I make it work is just by quicksaving before turning it on and then quickloading until it works without a hitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the repair mechanic, all I can say is that it is tricky. In fact, the game glitched yesterday and stopped pausing the game when I pressed ESC, so repeated operation may indeed bug it out. But I\u0027ve done it several times, so finagling things should eventually work, it just takes a bit of practice. Also, note you can hit repair without the kerbal moving away from the capsule, still hanging to the ladder, which means you can actually thrust with broken legs just by hitting repair insistently and put-putting along. The kerbal won\u0027t fall! Manual setting, you could call it, and I\u0027ve used it during emergencies (i.e: I\u0027m still suborbital and the drive broke).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and my machine is an i5, so I think you are much better set than I am, computing power-wise.

A small amount of creeping in the direction of prevailing external forces (gravity, engines) is to be expected.
