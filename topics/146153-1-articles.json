I\u0027ve played ksp for just under 1000 hours now, pretty well got plane design under wraps. Got my joystick working now, and i\u0027ve been using a trak ir substitute (free track opentrack) but for some reason ksp won\u0027t accept it despite the company that made what i use to headtrack showing actual footage of him using it in game as you would with any other game, such as arma 3. However even though it functions flawlessly in arma 3 for me it won\u0027t work in ksp at all! The final thing that has been liquiding me off a lot lately is that shadowplay won\u0027t pick ksp up. Thanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the vid for reference:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzmkJ2UWsGg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzmkJ2UWsGg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
