I don\u0027t think that\u0027s relevant, it\u0027s just here for completeness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried playing KSP after upgrading, and framerate was in the dumps. Factor of four or five decrease. This was only when looking at the ground, however. Looking at the sky fixed all that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So what,\u0022 you say, \u0022you were just using too high terrain detail for your hardware and should either upgrade your PC or knock down the settings.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot so. See, playing around with terrain detail sliders and more fine controls in the settings.cfg file did not help my framerate issues. One thing, however, did. That was the EVA_ROTATE_ON_MOVE = False line in settings.cfg. Suddenly my lag was gone and I could play smoothly again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there was another weird effect. The south pole of Kerbin now looks like grey ice. It\u0027s very different from the previous ice texture that was there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo just to summarize: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA_ROTATE_ON_MOVE = True: Low framerate, almost unplayable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA_ROTATE_ON_MOVE = False: My accustomed high framerate, all ice is now grey rock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I suppose my support question is... what the deuce? How can I have both my previous, accustomed performance AND have ice look like ice? And, almost more importantly for my curiosity, how in the world did this unrelated flag have any impact whatsoever on the terrain and how did it knock my performance back up to its correct level?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW I\u0027ve tried this with a couple of repeated trials. Flag off, ice gone. Flag on, ice back and slow. It\u0027s a pretty clear correlation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T01:39:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust to be absolutely sure, you \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E playing a stock installation? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re quite right, though; that flag shouldn\u0027t change any graphics settings whatsoever.
