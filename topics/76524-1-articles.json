I\u0027m new to this forum and to KSP. First I was wondering about getting the game or not, when luckly a friend sent me a key as a gift via Steam. I couldn\u0027t be happier: what a great game it is. Surely, it\u0027s not a game for the masses, but it clearly has potencial and at the present moment the Mods increase a lot it\u0027s play value. I was already enjoying flying and discovering my rockets and it\u0027s designs (and crashing them, of course lol), till I first deployed a sattelite in a stable orbit over Kerbin. What an achievement! The sense of gratification when I saw it opening it\u0027s antennas was amazing! That bring me to the point: antennas. I\u0027ve noticed in a lot of videos and websites teaching how to build a probe (including the game\u0027s wiki) the guidelines recommending placing more than one. Fore instance, one \u0022major model\u0022 and four of the smaller, \u0022stick-looking\u0022 ones (sorry, I\u0027m still not fully used to all the names). The websites I read stated that if you use more than one antenna in a probe and activate an experiment (such as the Mysterious Goo or Junior Lab experiment), you could transmit it several times at once (one for each antenna). This would replace the need of five visits to do the same experiment (due to diminishing returns) or the weird solution of assembling a ship with five of the same modules just to perform an experiment. I\u0027ve tried the \u00225-antenna\u0022 technique on a new probe, but it didn\u0027t work. Am I missing something? How exactly is this done? Is there really any benefit of bringing more than one antenna in your ship/probe? Or is that just a matter of aesthetics? Thanks a lot!

Other antennae from other mods - SCANSat, Kethane, have their own (usually mapping) purposes but are quite different parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T20:21:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SmaugBR\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SmaugBR\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAm I missing something?

SmaugBR\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re not missing anything, the people that are saying to do that to get more science are. When you get a science popup, the amounts of science displayed for that experiment is assuming that no science for the same experiment/biome gets turned in before you turn these results in. If you watch the amount of science you get for transmitting, you\u0027ll see that even if they all transmit at the same time through different antenna, only the first one to complete gets full value, the next gets a lot less, the one after that even less, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for having multiple antenna to queue up reports, this works in theory, but in practice runs into a problem. Yes, if you send a report, it will go to the first antenna it finds that isn\u0027t busy, IF the antenna isn\u0027t busy at the time you queue the report for transmission. If all antenna are busy, it just dumps the report on the first antenna it finds. So if you queued up 10 reports to get sent out 5 antenna, it would give one report to all 5 antenna, then dump the remaining 5 on the same antenna, giving you an end result of one antenna with 6 reports to transmit and 4 antenna with 1 report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reasons to go with multiple antenna are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) If you\u0027re using RemoteTech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) If you\u0027re about balancing your center of mass (guilty as charged)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Asthetic preference\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) You\u0027ll be splitting up the craft at some point\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmaugBR","CreatedById":114192,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T21:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm...
