The weight distributable cargo I believe it is. if you right click say for example the \u0022ranger anchor hub\u0022 and enable weight transfer, it banns you from entering connected living spaces or pods attached to it or any mannable unit past the point the \u0022weight transfer enabled\u0022 part is located in your base. it took me FOREVER to figure out that THAT was causing the problem... I destroyed \u0026amp; rebuilt my base 3 times..... so much wasted time...... so yea just a heads up if you are unable to select a mannable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E part during crew transfer, THATS why. Turn the option off and all is well. You can enter your pods again. No need to blow up your base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikeloeven","CreatedById":175283,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-11T03:25:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have TweakScale

just don\u0027t know for sure that I did them \u0022properly\u0022.\u00A0 I also don\u0027t know if RoverDude would approve so I can PM them to you if you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was coming about a couple of those parts actually.\u00A0 Is anyone aware of fuel flow issues with the 5m to four 2.5m or four 5m parts?\u00A0 It seems like after reloading if I have four fuel tanks connected, some of them won\u0027t be connected to the other tanks while one or two still are.\u00A0 I\u0027ve been able to reliably reproduce this but before I got all crazy with the bug reporting I figured I\u0027d find out if I\u0027m just doing something wrong.\u00A0 Basically, I have a tank, the adapter, and four more tanks.\u00A0 In \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel flow looks fine.\u00A0 When I launch at least one tank will not be part of the flow anymore.\u00A0 If I save and reload then it can be visualized.\u00A0 The example I just described had 3 tanks isolated and one tank still flowing correctly after saving and reloading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a known issue?\u00A0 Is there maybe something I\u0027m doing wrong?\u00A0 This happens with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks, stock tanks, KW tanks, KSPIE, etc.\u00A0 Doesn\u0027t seem to matter.\u00A0 I thought maybe there was a config option that might be doing it but I\u0027m not able to see anything off the bat.\u00A0 I\u0027m happy to do any further testing or troubleshooting if it helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit:\u00A0 So I was looking at it some more and maybe my description is wrong.\u00A0 It seems like the bottom tanks become feeder tanks so maybe I need to set fuel flow manually?\u00A0 Not sure how to do that or if it\u0027s possible.\u00A0 Here are the fuel flows from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E if it helps visualize.\u00A0 Hopefully this doesn\u0027t make it more confusing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle

on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E adapter looks normal.\u00A0 Hopefully that helps.\u00A0 Am I doing something wrong?\u00A0
