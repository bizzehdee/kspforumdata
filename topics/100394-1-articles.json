I\u0027m a UI designer and frontend web developer, but completely new to modding games. I spend so much time in KSP though, I can\u0027t help but notice some UI tweaks I\u0027d like to try out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have some development experience, though mostly with web languages. Are there any tips or tutorials on doing a mod that touches the UI of the game itself? Even just the ability to replace underlying image assets would be perfect, but I wasn\u0027t able to find anything obvious by hunting through the directories of the game folder and couldn\u0027t find any mods I could base my work off. Alternatively, are there any developers who\u0027d like to team up with a designer to try a GUI mod out?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orum","CreatedById":97814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T14:45:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022commanderCH\u0022 data-cite=\u0022commanderCH\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre there any tips or tutorials on doing a mod that touches the UI of the game itself?

The stock UI is done with ezgui and as far as I know you can\u0027t insert, move or edit stuff easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not even sure there are many mods that uses ezGUI for their UI. Maybe Lazor System, I can\u0027t look at its code right now so I can\u0027t check.
