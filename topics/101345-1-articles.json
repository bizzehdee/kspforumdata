The trouble is, I\u0027m not sure where best to begin learning. The internet is like a vast ocean, and a good learning resource a particularly rare fish--one can reel in catches while still coming up empty-handed. A good education is key to becoming proficient in a field, but without outside advice, a layman\u0027s eyes cannot easily differentiate between quality learning tools and sub-adequate ones. I know many people who frequent these forums are well-versed on the subject, and it is my hope that you might share with me and others the best resources you know of for learning the concepts and math behind physics and its sub-fields.\n\nMany thanks! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T01:26:44Z","Content":"What\u0027s KSB? :|\n\nOr, do you mean KS**P**?\n\nIt uses patched conics for orbital projections.

It doesn\u0027t cover orbital mechanics, but if you\u0027ve ever wanted to know exactly where the specific impulse numbers come from, how a liquid rocket responds to your throttle commands faster than a jet engine, why monopropellent doesn\u0027t need oxidizer, or what an Eastman Kodak rep does when you tell him you need a hundred pounds\\* of *god damn* *dimethyl mercury to fire as reaction mass*- then read this book.\n\n\\*This was, for me, as an organic chemist and chemical safety officer, the most ...??!! moment in the whole book- but the scary thing is, there are so many incidents mentioned that come very nearly as close."},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T19:04:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)\n\u003E You know if you want the notes, power-points, and often times lecture videos from MIT\u0027s courses on the subjects.\n\u003E \n\u003E Though that XKCD comic is absolutely true.

I strongly recommend you to any [kind of introductory orbital mechanics page](http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm), but it surely depends of your background ... if you aren\u0027t familiarized with basic Newtonian physics, [you might need to get a look there earlier](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/newton-gravitation/gravity-newtonian/v/introduction-to-newton-s-law-of-gravitation)"}]}
