It\u0027s a very unconventional rocket design and the weight distribution is quite... goofy. The gimbal is negative 2 degrees due to some quirk in its flight characteristics I discovered during testing. When the gimbal was set to a positive number all command inputs during flight were reversed or backwards; I would steer left but the nose would go right and so forth. Fortunately I was allowed to set the gimbal to a negative number and it fixed the steering issue. Relatively speaking the Anvil IX has a very high gimbal range compared to its two smaller cousins. I found that no matter now many wings/fins I put onto the body that I couldn\u0027t develop enough aerodynamic counter force to fight the inevitable tip-over during flight. I\u0027m not sure where that came from considering all of my rockets flew like a bloody dream before KSP 1.0. As a result I needed to overdo the gimbal to allow the Anvil IX to use it\u0027s engines to keep it pointed in a straight line. The side effect (which I am sure you experienced) is that about half way through the launch the Anvil IX becomes very, very sensitive to steering input. That is caused by a combination of the massive thrust to weight ratio coming from burning all of that fuel and the high gimbal range. I was able to solve that issue myself by progressively backing off the throttle little by little during the launch and keeping the T/W manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually surprised you were able to fix your launch challenges by simply locking the gimbal. Did you also add other control methods (wings/fins) to offset the loss of engine steering? I\u0027d love to see your variation of the Anvil IX and to understand how you managed to make it work for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe First Light will be coming back for sure. However, it\u0027s towards the end of my current to-do list. I\u0027ve been neglecting the Dune Raider and Fire Hawk too long and I want to bring those up to my current standards. It also makes sense from a development standpoint because the Dune Raider fits inside of the Fire Hawk and the Fire Hawk fits inside of the First Light. I need to design all of them before I can design any of them if that makes sense. Might as well start at the little guy and work my way up. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T04:36:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Absolution\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Absolution\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI\u0027ve had some success by reducing thrust as it gets close to that magical moment.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s exactly what they do in the real world\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T06:05:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReducing thrust makes sense. I think the gimble thing worked for me because I\u0027ve given up on performing gravity turns in atmosphere with any rocket in the new stock aero. If overresposiveness is the issue, then it was fixed by locking the gimble and letting the SAS only use torque wheels for any stabilization needed... and I just let it fly straight up until it reached 30,000 m and was all but out of the atmosphere. I think I had four of the solid boosters on it, and four of those new stock giant wings that are all but useless for anything as they\u0027re meant for a 747 and would never be used on a space plane. Put em right on the bottom in an attempt to increase drag down there and keep the bottom where it\u0027s supposed to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only thought was that the issue was arising from the fuel being contained all in a single component (which is quite convenient for building purposes and part count), and that as it was used up (reaching ~ half a tank or so, as that was when issues started) the center of mass wasn\u0027t really moving like it does in \u0022normal\u0022 rockets. In a regular rocket as the tanks empty they drain from the top down, and you lose weight up top and your center of mass shifts.. which can make your rocket flip over as the aero forces (drag) on the top end gets more leverage as your center of mass drops. With these, the tanks are all a single component so they won\u0027t behave in exactly the same manner. Not quite sure exactly what effects that would have though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smurfalot","CreatedById":72587,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:02:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI downloaded Core solutions, but noticed it no longer has Fire Hawk and Dune Raider are they available separately now or what?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Absolution","CreatedById":4156,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T02:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Smurfalot\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Smurfalot\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI downloaded Core solutions, but noticed it no longer has Fire Hawk and Dune Raider are they available separately now or what?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the moment they have been removed from my pack due to KSP 1.0.

Several things should leap off the page at you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Less track-day-bro. More Sci-Fi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple of reason why I went this way on the new design. First, the new design takes up fewer polygons (~1100 vs ~2400) despite the fact I have 3D tread included. Second, the tire is now bi-directional so it wont matter which side of the chassis you put it on; it will still work. That means no more awkward mirrored tire parts and confusing assembly. I also want to make this tire fit on future body parts I make for the Dune line of rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Less suspension?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe suspension arms, which were never animated anyway, will become an integrated part of the main chassis. I would love to make the suspension arms travel up and down like the real thing (which I think is possible is KSP) but I only have a very basic understanding where to begin. I choose not to spend my time investigating that particular feature at this time. Hopefully I can do it in a future update but for now it is what it is. Also, by putting the suspension arms on the chassis it helps me make one tire mount to all four corners easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Real tread!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy old tire model/texture was very, very rudimentary. It had no normal, a very crummy texture and no smoothing. It worked okay but was, generally, very indicative of where my skills were at when I first did it (ie no skill). I\u0027ve learned a lot about normal maps since then and they just wont cut it for what I want to do for my tires. I am forced to use a 3D tread but I think I\u0027ve settled on a very low-poly but still very neat looking design. It\u0027s one of those subtle features that make the tire convincing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BiNILZ8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BiNILZ8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimultaneously with the Tire I have also begun working on optimizing the design for the chassis. The original concept behind the Dune Rovers was to make a series of common parts and the player would only need to swap out key parts to make several different designs. This is how real car manufacturers do things; their similarly sized vehicles tend to be based on one common chassis. I never followed through with the original plan but since I am revising the whole Dune Raider variant it makes sense for me to follow through with it now. Once I am done you will only need to pull off the \u0022Raider\u0022 body and then drop on the \u0022Crawler\u0022 body to switch between the \u0022Dune Raider\u0022 and the \u0022Dune Crawler\u0022. Everything else, or as much as I can, will be common between them. Easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA general note with my work so far is that there should be a significant optimization occurring. I wasted so many polygons on pointless and inefficient design features it\u0027s embarrassing! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E All told the Dune Raider was about 13,000 polygons when fully assembled. I\u0027m not sure just how far I can go with the optimizing but I think I can reduce the poly count by at least 25%. No promises. However, I\u0027ve never known the Dune Raider to be unstable or cause undue lag for players so maybe I will take the opportunity to add in some more detail and keep the poly count about the same. I am not sure where I want to go with that yet but I have some ideas on some details I would like to add.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore teasers as I progress in the re-design!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck and have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T04:53:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 04:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Absolution\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neutrinovore","CreatedById":72520,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T07:38:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s a lot more \u0027extraplanetary rover wheel\u0027 looking than the previous version, Abso...
