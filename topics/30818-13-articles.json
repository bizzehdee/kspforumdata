As the craft goes faster and the CoL shifts back I shift fuel towards the rear of the craft to keep the CoL and CoM where I want them. I usually design most of my craft with a partially empty tank for this very reason. Which is how some modern supersonic aircraft do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your flap issue, that is a pretty simple one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will want your flaps to be inline with your CoL or as close as you can get them to it, this will help to generate lift and not push the nose down. I found that you can also add leading edge slats for thin wings that help also. I used them on one of my delta wing designs a while ago and got the landing speed down to 60m/s an take off around 65m/s.

Your descent from that point depends on the craft, but usually once I\u0027m used to how a craft behaves I can glide all the way to the runway from there.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a capsule, don\u0027t try bombing it out of the atmosphere like one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022New\u0022 ( last played seriously with 0.22, they are still new ) ion engines are a major surprise - after launching a small mun lander with one out of a smaller spaceplane ( didn\u0027t want the hassle of designing a rocket ) I thought that seemed a rather excessive launcher, so I started removing things... and eventually arrived at something that can scrape a stable orbit if it\u0027s empty, but really all it needs to do is hop out of the atmosphere long enough to get rid of it\u0027s payload and give me enough time to get *that* into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty cheap too ( just under 50k after the sat cost in the pic below is removed ), no idea what the upper payload limit is - if the payload is fairly heavy I could always add a tank in the bay anyway. I\u0027d do it entirely with jet engines but I can\u0027t find any suitably big ramjets, and I haven\u0027t got round to doing a reaction engines Scimitar yet, no idea really how to make that perform \u0026amp; still fit in with all the other available engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/q5x1xW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7579/15803878740_88f7b2a717_b.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://farm8.staticflickr.com/7579/15803878740_88f7b2a717_b.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/pq76t9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8571/15368990634_aa04c9fe45_b.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://farm9.staticflickr.com/8571/15368990634_aa04c9fe45_b.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/q5xUpm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8605/15804053170_949ddf53fa_b.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://farm9.staticflickr.com/8605/15804053170_949ddf53fa_b.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote periapsis in the last one, still plenty of time to get the payloads in stable orbits though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat craft is so light you could get away with almost half the wing you have there, and could get away with a little bit more fuel this would give it the ability to reach orbit on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know because I have a craft not to much bigger than that, that is my light cargo SSTO.
