The problem is floating-point math inaccuracies. All physics in game is calculated relative to the current vessel. As another vessel gets further away from the current one, the physics calculations get increasingly inaccurate due to rounding errors. A piece of debris re-entering on the opposite side of Kerbin for instance, would be so far away the calculations would be complete nonsense. This means orbital decay cannot use any drag model which requires physics calculations, which means the current drag model, and any future drag models are pretty much out of the question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FluffyBob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FluffyBob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrom the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Atmosphere#On-rails_physics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E Wiki\u003C/a\u003E:\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If a ship is \u0022on rails\u0022 (meaning it\u0027s further than 2.25 km from the actively-controlled ship) and its orbit passes through a planet\u0027s atmosphere, one of two things will happen based on atmospheric pressure at the ship\u0027s altitude:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E below 0.01 atm: no atmospheric drag will occur \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC the ship will be completely unaffected\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 0.01 atm or above: the ship will disappear \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat simply isn\u0027t the case.
