I even tried using Mechjeb but the same thing happens, I get to about 20 feet above the surface and then BAM, flip and explosion. I tried different landing spots and I tried using mechjeb to the last minute and then taking over manually but it continues to happen. The only thing I can think of is that I am trying to land near the water and there is some bug and the water is under me even though to me it shows the water is a long ways off.

Even if it centers your mass correctly for landing mechjeb has already planned its landing and tries to land as if you still had the tank hence the flipping. Work around for that is when you are fairly high up and already did your deorbit burn turn off mechjeb drop the tank and turn it back on which will make it reset its landing guidance though it may throw you off target a bit (never far).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said when it comes to landing on eve I say chutes.
