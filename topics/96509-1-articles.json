Also, this isn\u0027t quite news, I just was reminded of it by randomly finding the article that first informed me of its existence, but it\u0027s been true for at least a couple of years. There was actually a post on these forums about a month ago on a specific part of it, but it only had 2 responses and didn\u0027t really communicate the idea, so here we go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the boring disclaimers out of the way: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMIT course materials are free online!\u003C/a\u003E Anyone can have unlimited free access to all sorts of lectures and assignments (and probably videos, I haven\u0027t looked around yet much) without so much as even signing up for an account. You can learn things, it\u0027s great!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now for the KSP link (meaning the first thing I went to), the Introduction to Propulsion Systems class. While I know a lot of people on these forums don\u0027t yet have a full education of tricky physics and mathematics, Wikipedia can be helpful for a lot of things, and you can take your own time. It\u0027s also not perfect for sure, learning is (hopefully) a lot more difficult without a teacher and in some of these cases, the book they expect you to be looking at (replaced by Wikipedia?), but it\u0027s still a nice thing to have around. There are literally hundreds of courses, it\u0027s just... really cool. Also, it\u0027s a good several dozen thousand dollars per year cheaper than the real thing, which certainly doesn\u0027t hurt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are you waiting for?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T01:43:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, MIT is one of them... but people should be aware \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u0027ll obtain no formal degree from them\u003C/em\u003E.
