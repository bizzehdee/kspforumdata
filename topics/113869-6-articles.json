If you saved your Squad with the name \u0022Fred\u0022 everything is in a folder named \u0022Fred\u0022. I have not seen any sign of any of the name/description fields at the beginning of \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022 mattering. I have two distinct games with different folder names, and it is the folder names which are displayed when you select a Squad at the start.\n\nI know that different operating systems make a compressed file from a folder in different ways. Windows still can use a .bat file, whiich is a crude form of Unix shell script, and you could have a desktop link to that file which would back up the saves and then run KSP. But it gets a bit hairy if you want to make a compressed file in Windows, using just the Windows compression code.. Rocket Science is easier."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T17:46:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I sure hope that the 1.1 vs that is planed as next release would be better I gave up on 1.0.4 as it has to many issues (for me personally, I never encounter such a unstable update when it comes to mod compatibility) and will keep playing 1.0.2 till something is done.\n\nThose expectations are not realistic. Updates have frequently resulted in mod issues that have to be resolved by modders. It\u0027s just in the nature of updates.\n\n1.1 is just as likely, if not more, to break mods.\n\nGive it time, and modders will update their mods to maintain compatibility."}]}
