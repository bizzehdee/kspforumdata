I\u0027m thinking on developing a mod featuring all sorts of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E parts, including these modular segments with engines. Now, I have much lower modding skill than linuxgurugamer and his advanced modular \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E system, so I got the idea (in the 2013 post) of making this simplified modular \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E system work like a liquid fuel stack, with the segments being caps and the motor nozzles acting as engines, with a custom resource (titled Solid Propellant or something), and replicating the characteristics of real SRBs (can\u0027t be stopped, thrust curve, blah blah blah).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think?
