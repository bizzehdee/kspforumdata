That\u0027s why everything is scaled down so much in the stock game. Larger, more realistic solar systems would also require a thirty minute ascent to orbit, which seems awfully boring to me. I imagine that would be especially so considering a more realistic model would add (and necessitate) autopilot features, too. In addition to introducing even greater performance issues, the larger values for numbers would also accumulate (relatively) greater round-off errors during calculations unless some dramatic changes were made. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, truly accurate aerodynamic and thermodynamic simulations require too much computational power. The same could be said for simulating orbits using an n-body simulation. What was added in the 1.0 patch already kills performance, and that\u0027s pretty far short of what\u0027s used in the real world for engineering applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if it\u0027s only the engines and other parts that are made more realistic, then all parts would be incredibly overpowered compared to the smaller solar system currently implemented. So the scale of everything else would need to be increased as well, and for reasons already explained I\u0027m not so fond of that idea. This isn\u0027t even to mention that if parts were more realistic, our choices of propulsion would be severely limited. Most applications would work best with ion engines with their millinewtons of thrust or absurdly overpowered NERVAs five times the thrust and an additional 50 seconds of isp. That would seriously outperform everything, making all the tough design decisions in the stock game trivial.

Your mode of travel through the system is modeled on real orbital mechanics.

Life support, communications, etc. should all be things which should be opted in/out when you start a new game. Larger celestial bodies/distances, ideally would also be controlled by a slider (ie, Planet sizes 0% - 100%), but still the Kerbal\u0027s system (I imagine the technical requirements for Squad to install such a system my make it impractical/impossible with the current program). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur Solar system however, I think would be perfect for DLC, as well as differently constituted solar systems.

In my view it\u0027s overcomplicated. Having ten different configs for every engine, having different engines which use the same fuel and oxidizer but in a slightly different ratio, that kind of stuff adds little to gameplay, it\u0027s just jumping through more hoops. Abandoning standard part dimensions makes stock builds a mess and makes the base RO feel incomplete and wanting even more mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s room for more realism in KSP and some aspects of RO I like - variety of fuels, limited ignitions, need for ullage. But overall I feel Realism Overhaul is not the way to go about it. There\u0027s a difference between attempting to be a realistic game and attempting to simulate the real world, and KSP is better off being the former.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for paid DLC, I\u0027d pay for \u003Cem\u003Ehigh quality planets\u003C/em\u003E.
