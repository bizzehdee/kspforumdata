The game crashes right after loading. Sometimes the error log says \u0022KSP.exe caused an Access Violation (0xc0000005)\u0022 and other times it says \u0022mono.dll caused an Access Violation (0xc0000005)\u0022. I think the first error is probably just out of memory, but Im not sure about the second. On the off chance I can get KSP to launch, it starts at 3.3GB (Which is about the limit). I have my texture quality to quarter (sometimes it resets I think, but last time thats what I set it to) and I\u0027ve removed lots of parts. I\u0027ve also used AutoPruner, but Im not sure if that does anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EError log with Mono.dll: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8pnska-_NTbVVYV0dwdnd3Rzg\u0026amp;authuser=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8pnska-_NTbVVYV0dwdnd3Rzg\u0026amp;authuser=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EError log with KSP.exe: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8pnska-_NTNFdhQU05VV9uSm8\u0026amp;authuser=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8pnska-_NTNFdhQU05VV9uSm8\u0026amp;authuser=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brigadier","CreatedById":147109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T15:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my limited experience, my mono.dll error was caused by my setting s too high a screen resolution.

I installed ATM Aggressive and I loaded up the game at 1.8GB, and launched a rocket (and then launch clamp attack) so I reverted to the VAB and it just closed, no crash popup. I go and look at the error.log and it says it was mono.dll again. Ill try the AA first, because I like to have my game fit the whole monitor\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Death Engineering","CreatedById":68528,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T19:33:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENVidia GT755 here and constant mono.dll crashes when running nearly any graphic enhancement mod.
