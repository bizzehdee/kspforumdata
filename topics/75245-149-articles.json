I have a 480GM dish pointing to Kosmodrome ground and im not getting a connection with line of site. Im only as far as the moon in RSS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eupdate...for those of you using a community config, you must change the antenna node in the config file from 7.5\u002Be07 to a 75e\u002B07 . This will put you around 750 mega meters which is almost double the moon distance.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This should solve any problems with you dishes losing connection on such a short leash.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-15T09:28:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2015 09:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lextacy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efound it\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ss8913","CreatedById":94747,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T11:20:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022themody\u0022 data-cite=\u0022themody\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI also found that i cant transit Science from my Mobile Processing Lab while Remote Tech is installed.
