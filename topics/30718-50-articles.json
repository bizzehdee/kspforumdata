By the side of the road, dewbells stretched towards the new day, their goblet shaped flowers unfurling into carpets of golden petals. The Berelgan stretched out before him; neatly regimented grids of crop fields reaching all the way back to the old fashioned manor house buildings, toylike in the distance. Behind them, the glass domes of the Dunan agronomy complex glinted in the morning sunlight.

Erlin opened the gate and walked over to it, retrieving a measuring tape and laboratory field notebook from his poncho as he went. He squatted down by the sapling and wrapped the tape around its trunk being careful not to disturb the still-delicate leaf clusters. Nodding to himself, he made a note of the trunk diameter then measured its height. Finally, he pulled a magnifying glass out of his pocket and examined the leaves at length, occasionally jotting down entries in his notebook.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EDropping his notebook back into its pocket, Erlin fished out a waxed paper package from his inside pocket and sat down by the gate, gazing contemplatively at the sapling. He unwrapped his breakfast and took a slow bite of egg and greenleaf roll. \u003Ci\u003ELooks fine above the soil. Only average height and diameter for its age but that\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u003C/i\u003E His eyes dropped to the patch of bare earth around the base of the young Kerm tree. \u003Ci\u003EIf only we could see what\u2019s happening down there.

A mash of talc and sweat glued her hands to the exercise bars,\u00A0their arched middle section shaped to provide headroom for the exerciser and, Val thought privately, resembling an upside down set of handlebars from her first tricycle.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe brace around her midriff and lower back itched abominably. Val finished her chin-ups, swung her feet forward and carefully lowered herself onto the set of steps placed under the exercise bar. Stiffly, she climbed down onto the grass and stood for a moment, working her exercise top back and forth under the brace. It helped a little.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EOther pieces of exercise equipment dotted the lawn like pieces of abstract sculpture, most of them supporting a sitting, standing, or in many cases folded over, kerbal dressed in soft grey running trousers and matching top. Many of the kerbals were wearing braces of varying sizes and designs, some of them also wearing their clothing knotted at the shoulder or hip, the better to stop an empty sleeve or trouser leg from catching on anything. Hospital staff kept a discreet watch, intervening only when necessary. Tall hedges screened off the exercise area, ensuring a degree of privacy for them and their charges.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EGusden followed Al through a leafy archway and stood quietly by the hedge, watching the other kerbal come to terms with what he was seeing. One of the hospital staff spotted them and walked over to greet them, eyebrows lifting slightly at the sight of Gusden.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CGood afternoon, Fleet Commander.

He saw the grey garbed figure limping towards them and, relieved, got politely to his feet. Gusden followed suit, smiling faintly at the look on the newcomer\u2019s face.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CAt her convenience, the kerbal says, when he\u2019s the one turning up early. Make this quick please, Gusden, before these ever-so-fetching garments stick themselves to me permanently.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CAs you wish,\u201D said Gusden mildly, ignoring the incredulous expression on Al\u2019s face. \u201CAlthough you might be more polite to our guest after he\u2019s come all this way to meet you. Val \u2013 meet Al Kerman. Al, this is Commander Valentina.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAl dipped his head. \u201CGood to meet you, Commander.\u201D He studied the other thoughtfully, taking in her cropped black hair and deep, copper-brown eyes, wrinkled at the corners and sizing him up just as thoughtfully. Somehow the unflattering grey exercise-wear and heavy spinal brace around her middle only added to her air of calm authority.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAnother of the hospital staff hurried up with a poncho and handed it to her respectfully. Val smiled at him in thanks and worked it over her head, scowling briefly as it rucked up over her brace. \u201CSo, what can I do for you, Al?\u201D Val narrowed her eyes. \u201CAl Kerman \u2013 I know that name.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CPossibly,\u201D said Al. \u201CI flew Cloudrunners once upon a time. PM1 \u2013 and then PM2. PM2 was the better plane by far,\u201D he added blandly.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CProduction model 1\u2026\u201D Val looked at him with sudden respect. \u201CAre you still flying for C7?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CNot unless you count desks,\u201D Al said dryly. \u201CI\u2019m mostly a manager these days.\u201D He glanced around before turning to face Gusden. \u201CPerhaps we could find somewhere quieter, sir?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EGusden nodded. \u201CAgreed. Is your back well enough for a short walk, Commander?\u201D Curiosity piqued, Val nodded. Gusden eyed her for a moment then led the way through the hedge and across the hospital lawn to one of the small, Doreni style formal gardens that dotted the grounds. \u201CThis should be sufficient.\u201D He gestured at Al. \u201CPlease continue.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CWe\u2019re building spaceplanes,\u201D Al said. \u201CAnd we\u2019re going to need pilots for them. Current state of the art is our Skyhawk single-seater rocket plane but even stretching the envelope as far as we can, it ain\u2019t useful for much more than a single hop into the black and a dead-stick landing. But we\u2019re working on something just a bit bigger.\u201D Val listened in fascination \u2013 and growing excitement \u2013 as Al sketched out the details of the MACE air-breathing rocket engine. \u201CIt\u2019s an old idea \u2013 looked good on paper but\u2026\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EVal rolled her eyes. \u201CPaper planes always look perfect and fly perfect \u2013 on paper.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAl favoured her with a rare grin. \u201CExactly. But this time, we\u2019re thinking the real deal is going to look even better. The engine is specced and tested. Airframe construction for the demonstrators is on-going. We\u2019ve got a long string of problems still to solve before we\u2019re anywhere near a production model but the first task is to get that engine into a fuselage and get that fuselage into the sky. Then we\u00A0get it past the sky.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EVal\u2019s eyes lost their focus. \u201CWhy?\u201D she asked at last.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CLots of reasons,\u201D said Al. \u201CSome of them aren\u2019t important and most of them I can\u2019t tell you about anyway. Yet. But the big one is Starseed. If that\u2019s ever going to work, we\u2019re going to need a lot of kerbals in orbit \u2013 and putting them there three at a time in an oversized tin can just ain\u2019t going to cut it.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CSo we fly them there,\u201D said Gusden softly.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CAnd we bring the plane home again,\u201D finished Al. \u201CCheck it over, refuel and relaunch. So \u2013 what do you say, Commander? How would you like to come fly for us?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EVal stared at Gusden\u2019s unperturbed expression. \u003Ci\u003EThat figures\u003C/i\u003E. \u201CWhat about Ferl and Cal?\u201D she said.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EA shadow flickered behind Gusden\u2019s eyes. \u201CWe\u2019ll look after them,\u201D he replied. \u201CWe can\u2019t afford to lose good, able bodied kerbals and even if Cal can\u2019t set foot in a cockpit again without getting the shakes, there\u2019s more duty slots ground-side than we have people to fill them.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u201CSo why do I get to get out?

The fibres followed them, no more able to resist than a flower could resist growing towards the light. Flurries of signals poured along the hairlike threads as they met and touched.

At a hundred, then a thousand, then still more points, the fibres twisted together.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMeshing.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe signals intensified, racing out from the contact points like the waves from a handful of gravel tossed into a still pond.

Thirty-eight sets of memories suddenly crammed into a single consciousness with no time for reason or rationalising. The explosion faltered, abruptly sucked down into a spiralling maelstrom of doubt, panic and then naked terror. Collapsing inward, triggering a last desperate message, a frantic cry for help before the inevitable shattering.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0And in a final silent scream, a tsunami of black spots flooded over the leaves of thirty eight young Kerm trees.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EGerselle jammed her head into the leaf cluster.

Distantly he felt her momentary panic disappear, felt her resolve as she reached out in welcome to the fragments of Kerm mind despite their terror crashing through her.

An image of a Kerm tree appeared, cupped within Enely\u2019s hands. The tree shimmered, became thirty eight trees surrounding a lone kerbal. A beam of light rayed out from one tree, reflected off the kerbal and connected to a second tree. Another, differently coloured, beam bounced off the kerbal, linking two more trees together.

Jonton sensed confusion then a sudden spark of curiosity. One shard shivered, rocked violently for a moment then burst free, soaring over to Enely\u2019s trees and trailing a cloud of smaller shards behind it. A stab of pain lanced through him and he heard Gerselle crying out. A second and then a third shard broke free, trailing glittering fragments behind them.

At last the leaf hairs slipped free of Jonton\u2019s scalp and he flung himself across the sleep room to Gerselle\u2019s side. \u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EShe lay unmoving, eyes rolled back into her head.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe steel band around Jonton\u2019s middle constricted. He lifted Gerselle\u2019s wrist, feeling for a pulse and almost collapsed with relief. It was there; thready, weak but clinging to life. For an instant, hope flared but then the awful last moments of Communion came crashing home. The shattered fragments of Gerselle\u2019s mind whirling past; her pain searing through the link; her last terrified plea for help. Numbly, Jonton let go of her wrist and watched her hand flop nervelessly onto the bedspread. Blank white eyes stared at him and his brief moment of hope guttered and went out.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMechanically, he climbed onto the bed beside his life partner and cradled her in his arms.

Filaments and fronds of \u003Ci\u003Esomething\u003C/i\u003E still oozed from them, blindly crawling towards their neighbours. The larger fronds lay quiescent, turning brown at the edges. He reached out to the nearest shard, trying to touch the memories within but they swirled beyond his reach like a swarm of bees seen through frosted glass. He bent closer, nerves thrumming, alert to the faintest sound or scent.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe filaments quivered and lashed out, smothering Enely\u2019s face. Panic-stricken, he cried out, only to find his mouth unable to close. He \u003Ci\u003Efelt\u003C/i\u003E the fronds crawling over his eyes, blocking out the mindscape, insinuating themselves through the delicate tissues between eyeball and skull. His hands hooked into claws, fighting the urge to rip out the thick tangles of filaments, that his screaming mind insisted were crawling up his nostrils and down his ears. Then the sickly queasy wriggling stopped and suddenly Enely could \u003Ci\u003Esee\u003C/i\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAnd\u003Ci\u003E hear.\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAnd\u003Ci\u003E smell.\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EHe hugged the shard to his chest, wincing at the discordant snarl of sensations, and staggered over to the half-formed presence in front of him. He held out the shard, feeling it flow under his hands, filament encrusted icicle morphing into a warm, sinuously folded form. Enely came \u003Ci\u003Eforward\u003C/i\u003E, leaving his kerbal self behind, his entire consciousness reaching out, flowing over the piece of Kerm like a protective film. Probing, feeling, searching for the missing pieces, for the seams between \u003Ci\u003Ethese \u003C/i\u003Ememories and \u003Ci\u003Ethose\u003C/i\u003E, for the subtle links between \u003Ci\u003Ethis\u003C/i\u003E concept and \u003Ci\u003Ethat\u003C/i\u003E instinct.

The shard melted against him, flowing into a compact rippled mass, trailing ropes of quivering, iridescent mind-stuff behind it. Under his direction, the ropes spread out, coiling through the growing Kerm mind, holding the mass in place. As he retreated from it, Enely felt a twinge of unease in the back of his mind.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EOne by one, the shards fitted into place, brown-edged pieces washed clean and made whole again. But with each new gap filled, each new connection made, Enely struggled against growing unease, that swelled into fear and threatened to spill over into outright panic. Squabbling voices clamoured in the back of his mind, each shouting to be heard over the rest. The Kerm mind shuddered, newly stitched mental seams beginning to unravel under the strain.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003EStop!\u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe squabbling continued unabated. Silently, Enely berated himself. \u003Ci\u003EShouting at an untrained mallek never solved anything\u003C/i\u003E. One at a time he began talking back to the voices, offering a quiet word, or the mental equivalent of a soothing pat or a scratch behind the ears, to each. \u003Ci\u003EThe malka can smell fear - agitated drivers make agitated malleks.

Enely summoned up an image of a hilltop dotted with Kerm trees. \u003Ci\u003EThis is what your kerbals see. Many trees - but only one Kerm. \u003C/i\u003EWith an effort, he flipped back to the image of overlapping soil tapestries. \u003Ci\u003EOne world - one Kerm\u003C/i\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe voices fell silent. Then a curious sensation raised the hairs on the back of Enely\u2019s neck and rippled upward. All around him, thousands of individual memories swooped and spun about each other. Touching, aligning and merging, reorganising themselves into new, more compact structures and in doing so, making space for other memories to join the great dance. Waves of thought flowed through the Kerm mind, healing, tightening, snipping out redundancies. And like a cloud of interstellar gas collapsing under its own mass, the contracting mind began to glow, grew ever brighter and then ignited.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELight shone all around Enely and a single voice called to him.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026lt;kerbal?\u0026gt;\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003EYes - I am kerbal\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026lt;there were more kerbals.

Patbro plodded on, insensible to the occasional wave or friendly greeting from one or other of the villagers.
