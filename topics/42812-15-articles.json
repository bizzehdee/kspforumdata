I have built an SSTO fuel carrier, using the B9 Aerospace pack, procedural fairings and stretch tanks. With the wing attached to the surface of the tank, I can attach things like engines and air intakes to the surface of the wing. Then I stretch the tank a bit, and try to attach another engine to the wing, and while the wing is still visible, the engine just won\u0027t attach. However, it can attach to a space about five meters below the wing. If I detach the wing and then reattach it, it fixes the problem. Stretch the tank again, and the problem recurs. Reattaching the wing is not always an option, since it consists of a combination of symmetric and asymmetric components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been able to reproduce this without the procedural fairings.

Think of hex-shaped 3/4 arc torodial fuselage with mounting markers at several points. Good for weird-looking space-stations, vehicles and other special purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPossible bug\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso pay attention to potential bug when trying to use markers on polygon cross-section part, example 7 radial markers on 6-sided surface. It could be fixed by forcing marker radial count to match polygon symmetry count.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-12T18:55:09Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2014 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by fatcargo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Elast second additions\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DasBananenbrot","CreatedById":70900,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T18:41:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fatcargo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fatcargo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#DAA520;\u0022\u003EIDEAS\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESymmetrical cross-section tanks\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, tanks come as round, but why not have tanks and fuselages with 3,4,6 or 8-sided cross-sectional area ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EXenon fuel\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease add Xenon Fuel resource to available fuels.

This would allow creation of \u0022pie-slice\u0022 parts or plumbing-like knee-joint parts.
