But i was thinking it could be pushed further:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, Launching one probe to the moon wont make a space agency famous. Not launching anything will cause them to disappear into the history books. So, perhaps making it more difficult to gain rep at first? Maybe if you don\u0027t launch any missions for a while your reputation drops? (no more focusing for 5 years on one mission. want to meet that transfer window? Plan accordingly)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when you launch a mission it can be dedicated to one or many contracts, and some contracts cannot be completed without first declaring that a mission is for that contract. If the mission fails the first time, so do the rewards if you complete it next try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do others think?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-08T02:01:15Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2014 02:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AlphaSpartan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emisinformation\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
