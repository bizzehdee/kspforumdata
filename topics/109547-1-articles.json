I\u0027m sure others had thought of this, but I couldn\u0027t find any posts about it and wanted to share. So, I give you my fuel asparagus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/534019341034379651/A340E167655A767DFD1CD3371391CE9F1F930504/\u0022 alt=\u0022A340E167655A767DFD1CD3371391CE9F1F930504\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing very cheap, I don\u0027t like traditional asparagus designs because dropping valuable parts (engines) hurts. So, I removed the engines and used a central Skipper engine instead with just the fuel tanks in an asparagus array. Added a Hitchhiker module for carrying more kerbals, since I had to use a brand adapter anyway. Just the Skipper saves you around 3,000 versus an array of nine Reliants, and in practice more since you can recover the Skipper. This build gets 4 (or more if you ditch the drone core and go with a cockpit) kerbals into orbit with a fairly substantial amount of fuel left. It\u0027s good for early on in career when you don\u0027t have a lot unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s nice for putting multiple tourists into orbit and/or picking up stranded kerbonauts because of its seating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Starts very slow, but don\u0027t worry... It gets there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Since you won\u0027t be queued to drop tanks by an engine flame-out you need to watch the fuel levels as you fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Rarely a fuel tank will fall wrong and clip off the engine connector, usually on the gravity turn. Maybe some well-placed struts could prevent this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*The large number of parachutes is due to how it tends to land: auto-cutting some, then tipping over. The extra chutes on the top seem to help with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m definitely open to suggestions on improving this, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s far from perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T20:16:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by afoolishmoon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
