In order for voxelization to occur, all the meshes/colliders used need to be listed in the same reference frame. Doing this requires me to first get the mesh, then transform ALL its points into that reference frame. Since it takes (I believe) 12 multiplications to transform a single point, and then that has to be done to the THOUSANDS of points for each of the meshes, it makes more sense to cache a separate list of transformed points; this reduces the overhead for each voxelization to somewhere between 1/2 and 1/25 of what it would be, depending on how detailed the meshes are. So basically, it\u0027s necessary to make voxelization viable at runtime. However, that means that whenever the shape changes, something needs to inform FAR of that. I believe I did tell NathanKell what he needs to do to make that work, and Crzyrndm should be aware of what\u0027s needed as well, so pParts and pWings should be compatible as soon as nuFAR is out for reals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ll deal with the saving of flight GUI data better.

You should know that I\u0027m playing with arrow keys. So... I have a nice little craft for Kerbin missions, capable of vertical takeoff/landing, and can go well above 1000m/s at about 17-20km height. When I get up to cruising speed and altitude, I have to turn input damping off, because pitch input is needed to keep the crafts nose above level AoA. However, when i used the keys, the plane pitches up too much. Then I let the control go, the nose falls too low, and I have to correct it again by pitching up, and the cycle starts again. If i hit the button quickly enough, and at the right rate (effectively PWM-ing the pich input), I can, ofc keep the plane in level flight, but this needs continous input, and it gets very very irritating on a 10-20min flight, not to mention longer ones. Sometimes magic happens, and SAS somehow catches my idea, and keeps the plane in level flight, but you need a full Mun, and Kerbin to be in perfect line with Duna and Eve for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DebatedNothing","CreatedById":79974,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T18:40:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a version that can be used with 1.0.2 atm?

FAR works with fairings. There are as far as I can tell no issues with stock fairings, but, as with other procedural parts mods, procedural fairings would need to inform FAR about shape changes, what they don\u0027t do (yet). So, to be sure that your FAR data is correct, attach the fairings so they get the correct shape, remove (but don\u0027t delete) them, and re-add them again. Then, check the debug voxel display in the FAR window.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T09:17:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ss8913\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ss8913\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWith the voxelaeroport build, how does one display speeds in IAS/EAS instead of ground-m/s ?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn-flight GUI, flt settings, click flt data, select air spd.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T09:23:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOpened up the FAR thread, saw a bunch of posts celebrating the release of the new version, started my happy dance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I realised that I\u0027d accidentally opened up a bit of the thread from a year ago, which was coincidentally just after an old new FAR release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bakase","CreatedById":134737,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:03:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOpened up the FAR thread, saw a bunch of posts celebrating the release of the new version, started my happy dance.\u003Cp\u003EThen I realised that I\u0027d accidentally opened up a bit of the thread from a year ago, which was coincidentally just after an old new FAR release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo download the dev build.
