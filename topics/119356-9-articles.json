I lose track of who has which word balloon color. (I wonder if people do the same thing in my story sometime--so I do try to use the name-labeled portraits and have people call each other by name when I can) Also the plot doesn\u0027t really have a strong enough hook. Jeb has a master plan to explore space and Mort is against it... OK, a classic setup, I know because I used it. But what does it mean? What consequences does any of this have for the main characters? These aren\u0027t things you can just explain with a couple of words in a panel--you have to give your characters enough depth for them to stick in the readers\u0027 minds and then the readers will care about them as much as you do. And I know you\u0027re going to ask how to do all this, but I can\u0027t tell you. No one can. My recommendation is to simplify and focus your story on one or two--no, \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E key theme and build everything clearly around that.
