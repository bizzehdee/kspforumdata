KSPTOT is more complex because it offers a much more diverse suite of tools that can tackle a very wide range of problems. If you were to use KSPTOT and Alex Moon\u0027s calculator for the same basic plotting, you\u0027d get usable results from either of them.

I track my mission trajectories very closely since the game will change things whenever I load craft and if I don\u0027t touch the craft again for a while the propagation of those changes over a long enough time depending on the orbit can make a difference. So every time I head back to the tracking station or perform a maneuver or SOI change I save the SFS file.
