DRE lowers the max temp of most parts, your RCS thrusters should be on the sides of your aircraft, not the bottom (Unless there is a specific reason for it) something else to consider is your reentry angle, spend more time in the upper atmosphere, make S-curves high up, Bleed off as much energy as you can before coming in, you are probably going to have to travel most of the way around KErbin before you drop low enough for heating.
