I\u0027m unable to continue that flight.\n\n**Reproduction steps:** This is how I got to this problem:\n\n- Launch a rocket with 3 command pod MK1s on top of each other\n\n- Jeb as pilot, and 2 tourists (Shelbro and Cermy) from a contract that want an orbital flight\n\n- Once in orbit, burn retro to start reentry\n\n- After burn, eject fuel tanks and engine, leaving only the 3 command pods on top of each other (and some chutes of course)\n\n- I noticed that these pods didn\u0027t have any drag, even at 5k altitude they didn\u0027t slow down. Probably a FAR bug (I used the latest \u0022Fanno\u0022), so I press Alt-F4 to try reentry again (I play on hard, no revert flight, but I make an exception with Alt-F4 for obvious bugs...)\n\n- I reload the game, go to space center to redo the reentry, hoping that the bug only occurred once\n\nIn the space center I can\u0027t click the button with my flight (it\u0027s the only flight in progress). Nothing happens. Double clicking in the map also has no effect.\n\nWhen I look at the crew roster, I see Jeb is still an assigned pilot, but Shelbro and Cermy are available for a flight, even though they should be on board of that flight.\n\nIn the output\\_log.txt I see an unhandled exception related to crew seating in the space center view:\n\n*[Tracking Station]: SetVessel(Contract Orbiter)*\n\n*(Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 56)*\n\n*[PlanetariumCamera]: Focus: Contract Orbiter*\n\n*(Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 56)*\n\n*ArgumentOutOfRangeException: Argument is out of range.*\n\n*Parameter name: index*\n\n *at System.Collections.Generic.List\u00601[internalSeat].get\\_Item (Int32 index) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E*\n\n *at KnowledgeBase.CreateVesselCrewList (.Vessel v) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E*\n\n *at KnowledgeBase.OnMapFocusChange (.MapObject target) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E*\n\n *at EventData\u00601[MapObject].Fire (.MapObject data) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E*\n\n *at PlanetariumCamera.SetTarget (.MapObject tgt) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E*\n\n *at SpaceTracking.SetVessel (.Vessel v, Boolean keepFocus) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E*\n\n *at SpaceTracking\u002B .MoveNext () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E*\n\n*(Filename: Line: -1)*\n\n*NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object*\n\n *at KnowledgeBase.UpdateVesselInfoList (.Vessel v) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E*\n\n *at KnowledgeBase.FixedUpdate () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E*\n\n*(Filename: Line: -1)*\n\nThe log files and my save is available at [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6OjJwPwNBdBcUdjLWYzS2RKNFE/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6OjJwPwNBdBcUdjLWYzS2RKNFE/view?usp=sharing)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWhen looking at my save file, I notice that 5 other Kerbals are Assigned, instead of the ones I remember taking along. Also in the TAC Life Support logging I can see Shelbro and Cermy being on a flight, while the contract of Shelbro and Cermy is Active instead of offered for the others.\n\nOr are Kerbals Assigned when the contract hasn\u0027t been accepted yet?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nUpdate: I did some editing of my save file:\n\n- update all 5 tourists from non-accepted contracts to \u0022available\u0022\n\n- update Shelbro and Cermy to \u0022assigned\u0022\n\n- update the idx of Shelbro and Cermy from -1 to 0 (the same as Jeb)\n\nNow I can resume the flight again. I don\u0027t know if I broke something else though... ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAnd after retrying the reentry, no zero-drag bug occurred... but it still might be good to investigate the tourism issue ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
