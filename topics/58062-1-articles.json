New systems would provide the opportunity to yield new and interesting worlds without oversaturating the Kerbol system. For example, a hot gas giant orbiting really close to the sun would be very challenging and fun to explore, but in order to credibly make room for it in the Kerbol system you\u0027d have to remove Moho, which is also a challenging and fun location to explore. Adding a new star system would alleviate that particular development obstacle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think of other star systems as the next logical progression in the game\u0027s built-in difficulty curve. Once you can get to Jool there\u0027s really no more challenge to be gained by adding other planets. You\u0027ve already proven you can do it. Other star systems are a unique challenge because now you need to pack an incredible amount of delta-v, which then opens up the scene for fantastic new end-game technologies such as the warp drive that Harvester himself described as a real possible feature once upon a time. It\u0027s folly that a game like KSP be completely realistic when it already pushes the envelope with unrealistic technology like the super compact NERVA and RAPIER engines, and the unrealistically efficient ion engines. The precedent has clearly been set that gameplay will always win out over realism, and other star systems being in the game can only enhance gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just a shame that my opinion doesn\u0027t matter and the devs will probably never even read this thread let alone acknowledge the great feedback it contains. :/\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-29T00:14:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2013 12:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tntristan12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bekiekutmoar","CreatedById":23500,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T00:53:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think in 2014 the development of KSP will continue but in a slower rate.
