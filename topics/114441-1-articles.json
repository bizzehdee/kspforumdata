Here\u0027s a picture:\n\n[http://imgur.com/Dugy0BY](http://imgur.com/Dugy0BY)\n\nSomeone suggested clicking on the lock symbol on the upper right corner to toggle debug mode but it doesn\u0027t seem to solve anything.\n\nI am using the Unity 4.2.2 and parttools 0.23, so could it be i\u0027m using the wrong versions?\n\nAny help would be appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T09:31:31Z","Content":"Hmm, I\u0027ve never seen PartTools look like that.. You\u0027re using correct Unity and PT\n\nTry creating an empty GameObject in the scene and adding PT to it.

In the very top right corner of unity, under the word layout, you\u0027ll see a padlock. Beside that are some horizontal bars with a drop down. Make sure that \u0027Normal\u0027 is selected and not \u0027Debug\u0027"},{"CreatedByName":"Mallikas","CreatedById":147085,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T11:52:09Z","Content":"I think NecroBones was right about incorrect install, i downloaded unpacked parttools files from the parttools thread and replaced the files in my project folder with them. \n\nUnity then updated itself and the write function appeared and exports the model as .mu file.

Check that you\u0027ve not got and mesh colliders etc without a mesh filter applied to an object, and remove that animator component - KSP doesn\u0027t support it."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T15:34:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think NecroBones was right about incorrect install, i downloaded unpacked parttools files from the parttools thread and replaced the files in my project folder with them. \n\u003E Unity then updated itself and the write function appeared and exports the model as .mu file.

I just happened to be digging around, saw another thread about the debug mode and checked on my copy. It looked a lot like what you were seeing. And it\u0027s not the actual lock symbol, it\u0027s the 3 bars beside it."},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T01:08:36Z","Content":"For future reference, I found why the write button was missing:\n\nIf you have two copies of part tools in your assets folder, that happens. A nice gotcha if you import a package that includes part tools!"}]}
