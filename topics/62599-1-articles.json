Let\u0027s talk only about technical matters of the subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever I think about nuclear propulsion systems, two designs often came to my mind: Nuclear Thermal Rocket or Nuclear Pulse Propulsion, both having been studied as project NERVA and Orion, respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater, I thought of a different design. This one would work similar to NTR systems, in which nuclear fuel is reacted to heat a different propellant(say, hydrogen). However, instead of a typical nuclear reactor, it had a simpler combustion chamber with no means to retain the fissile material. Instead, products of the nuclear reaction is ejected, being part of the exhaust, hence open-cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are the possible advantages and disadvantages of such propulsion systems? How would it perform in comparison to NERVA and Orion systems? Also, what technical challenges the propulsion system might impose?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T01:18:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe two I can think of off the top of my head (I\u0027ve been playing this game way too much), are the gas core fission rocket (basis of the Discovery One\u0027s rocket in 2001) and the Spherical Torus Fusion engine. I believe both can either run in open or closed cycle. The open cycle has the advantage of being more efficient, but the disadvantage of spewing out radioactive particles with the propellant. Probably fine for deep space, as the space ship is going the other way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor NASA\u0027s take on an entire ship based on the Spehrical Torus Fusion engine, take a look at the \u0022Discovery Two\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050160960_2005161052.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050160960_2005161052.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an open cycle solid fission system, I would expect it to be more efficient than a NERVA.
