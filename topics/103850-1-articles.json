For example, i\u0027m in the tutorial about orbiting the moon and i don\u0027t understand why and how apoapsis and periapsis work for getting to the moon orbit. So a different translation in my language or the other people respective languages will help.

If such a great game like KSP release it\u0027s 1.0 that should be translated into several languages."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T18:27:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E i don\u0027t understand why and how apoapsis and periapsis work for getting to the moon orbit.\n\nFunny thing is here, those ain\u0027t English words~ That\u0027s all Greek stuff..literally. A lot of science jargon is ancient Greek or Latin or whatnot, and sounds weird even to native English speakers at first ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nThat being said, it\u0027s probably too late to localize it for 1.0. That\u0027d have to be 1.1 or 1.2 or such, unless Squad\u0027s been secretly working on it already without telling us."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T02:24:04Z","Content":"The game may eventually have versions in other languages, but that is far down the road.
