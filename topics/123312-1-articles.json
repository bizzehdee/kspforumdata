There is very little reason to have them on if the gear isn\u0027t down, and for those that do want them on for maybe rendezvous or something, THEY can reassign it. Overall I think that is the exception, not the rule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing a little further out in suggestions, I\u0027d like to see a few new default groups that can be used in Tier 2 SPH. Toggle Flaps and Toggle Spoilers would be nice, though given the method for configuring control surfaces, there should be no default actions for them, just groups the user can work with. Those actions are almost essential for many pilots and shouldn\u0027t be restricted to Tier 3 SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-18T18:43:38Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2015 06:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T19:20:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022passinglurker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022passinglurker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhat\u0027s the config line that would do that exactly? looking at stock spot lights the don\u0027t seem to have any special configuration leading me to believe the behavior is hard coded\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, dang.
