When you are taking off from the mun or any other body without an atmosphere it is best to start turning immediately save to avoid hitting mountains due to this. For atmospheres you might just want to burn straight up but after a certain point a gravity turn is a must.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T08:16:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kinnison\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kinnison\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAfter ascending and having my apoapsis reach the desired level, I kind of think that the Less i need for a Circularization burn, the better job i did at efficiently ascending. or am i deluding myself?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty much, yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most efficient ascent is one where you reach your apoapsis at the same time your apoapsis reaches your desired height AND your periapsis also does so (i.e. you gravity turn directly into a fully circular orbit and don\u0027t need any circularization burn at all). In practical application this is so difficult when launching out of an atmosphere that even MechJeb can\u0027t do it, because the optimal ascent profile is unique for each individual rocket. And the difference between the optimal ascent and a slightly suboptimal one, where you do a bit of apoapsis surfing while circularizing and your apses are maybe a kilometer or two off from your desired ideal, is really just a few percent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, if you can achieve two thirds of your orbital velocity by the time your apoapsis is where you want it and you cut your engines off to coast, you\u0027re doing decently. That\u0027s about 1500-1600 m/s for Kerbin. If you can do three quarters (1750\u002B), that\u0027s excellent and only a small number of people even bother with more accuracy than that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-05T08:21:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2014 08:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T10:09:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually shoot for 2000... but then again I\u0027m obsessive.

The trick is to watch your time to apoapsis. Pitching down past the horizon and backing off the throttle both will decrease it.
