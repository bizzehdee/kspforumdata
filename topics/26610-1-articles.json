I just downloaded a life support mod, and have been phasing in the parts as I replace older missions with new. The problem is the base was ment to be permanent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other problem is each \u0022building\u0022 was made by modifying one default design, and wasn\u0027t saved individually, so I can\u0027t just reload then and hyperedit them to where the originals are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to make it so it looks like they didn\u0027t change.
