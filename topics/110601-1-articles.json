However, I\u0027m coming up with ship designs and ideas to get to places for free. \n\nMods I use are MechJeb, which I prefer over KER for my own reasons, and [FMRS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292-1-0-2-Flight-Manager-for-Reusable-Stages-%28FMRS-v1-0-00%29) which lets you recover the jettisoned Atlas by controlling it until it lands, and then go back to the separation time and continue using the main ship. It basically lets you do more than one thing at once, but one thing at a time. I also use Quantum Struts to allow the Space Plane to get re-strutted every time it docks with the Roamer. And finally I\u0027m using Atomic Age for the nuclear engines. The stock one didn\u0027t cut it, I needed a smaller one and a bigger one, and Atomic Age delivered ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI first had to come up with refueling logistics in space using Minmus as a mining resource. I have a tanker in orbit around Minmus which I\u0027ve filled using this VTOL/rover/miner/refinery:\n\n[![aaX6DHZl.png](http://i.imgur.com/aaX6DHZl.png)](http://imgur.com/aaX6DHZ)\n\nIt\u0027s effective and only takes a few trips to fill it ([More info and pics of it here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119038-Showcase-Miners-miners-miners-everywhere-Post-your-pics-here?p=1943094\u0026viewfull=1#post1943094))\n\nHere\u0027s [the Roamer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122162-Showcase-Show-me-Piggy-Back-ships%21) being launched. Because of the offset aerodynamic shape and CoM, I had to offset the engine on the coupler and reinforce it with struts. It works! Also note that the Roamer fuel tanks are mostly empty which brings its weight down to under 60t.\n\n[![kTWJqKOl.png](http://i.imgur.com/kTWJqKOl.png)](http://imgur.com/kTWJqKO)\n\nThe launcher that gets the Roamer in space is the only thing that\u0027s lost. Since the Roamer will remain in space for all future missions, this is a one-time loss.\n\n[![GST1IEWl.png](http://i.imgur.com/GST1IEWl.png)](http://imgur.com/GST1IEW)\n\nUsing slightly angled fins on stages makes them naturally pull away from the center stack without needing Sepratrons. As you can see in the image above and below, I had to install a brace on the center docking port that reinforces the weaker MK2 tanks.\n\n[![COEh00Jl.png](http://i.imgur.com/COEh00Jl.png)](http://imgur.com/COEh00J)\n\nWinglets on a nosecone that are attached to the Roamer\u0027s front docking port made a difference in control during launch. With the aero overlay enabled, you can see them pulling their weight.\n\n[![N1MEwHUl.png](http://i.imgur.com/N1MEwHUl.png)](http://imgur.com/N1MEwHU)\n\nThe last stage has Sepratrons because of the high speed at this point. I had first tried angling the fins more but this caused drag and instability, and broken fins.\n\n[![8xBFJkpl.png](http://i.imgur.com/8xBFJkpl.png)](http://imgur.com/8xBFJkp)\n\nSeparating nosecone, ditching launch vehicle and moving on to Minmus to top up the tanks.\n\n[![Ks9y2DBl.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ks9y2DBl.png)](http://imgur.com/Ks9y2DB)\n\n[![Uz432rCl.png](http://i.imgur.com/Uz432rCl.png)](http://imgur.com/Uz432rC)\n\n[![YSWipTel.png](http://i.imgur.com/YSWipTel.png)](http://imgur.com/YSWipTe)\n\nDocked with the fueling station parked in a 100km orbit. Now it\u0027s time to get the Space Plane here.\n\n[![ByXT8BBl.png](http://i.imgur.com/ByXT8BBl.png)](http://imgur.com/ByXT8BB)\n\nThis is the first real flight of the [Atlas JetPack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122382-Atlas-Jetpack-Get-your-non-air-breathing-SSTO-s-into-orbit-with-this%21) after several dozen failed test flights. \n\n[![oGgszYyl.png](http://i.imgur.com/oGgszYyl.png)](http://imgur.com/oGgszYy)\n\n[The Atlas](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122382-Atlas-Jetpack-Get-your-non-air-breathing-SSTO-s-into-orbit-with-this%21) is the top part with the wings at the rear. It carries with it the Space Plane \u0022Happy Rooster 2\u0022, which is a non-atmospheric version of [Happy Rooster](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122266-Happy-Rooster-MK2-SSTO-with-6-ton-payload-capacity), named so after its vertical canard on top of the cockpit (Removed in version 2, but placed on the Atlas). Seen in the pic below is the Atlas\u0027 recovery method. Lots of chutes. This lets the Atlas slowly fall back down into the ocean for recovery as the Rooster goes into orbit.\n\n[![rhdAst7l.png](http://i.imgur.com/rhdAst7l.png)](http://imgur.com/rhdAst7)\n\nJust barely past the KSC islands and already burning up!\n\n[![5rw7Awml.png](http://i.imgur.com/5rw7Awml.png)](http://imgur.com/5rw7Awm)\n\n42KM\u0027s up and already flying at over 2000m/s with an Apoapsis of 85KM\u0027s, the Atlas says goodbye.\n\n[![JZszcMUl.png](http://i.imgur.com/JZszcMUl.png)](http://imgur.com/JZszcMU)\n\nFrom here it\u0027s a quick switchover to the Atlas to deploy the chutes and land in the ocean for recovery. After which, I use FMRS to go back to the moment of separation and continue flying the Rooster (Sorry, didn\u0027t take screenshots, but it was boring anyways lol).\n\n[![jlMZGd6l.png](http://i.imgur.com/jlMZGd6l.png)](http://imgur.com/jlMZGd6)\n\nCoasting....\n\n[![3RH0jz8l.png](http://i.imgur.com/3RH0jz8l.png)](http://imgur.com/3RH0jz8)\n\n100x100ish orbit, still over 2000 dV leftover.\n\n[![RbYzkRhl.png](http://i.imgur.com/RbYzkRhl.png)](http://imgur.com/RbYzkRh)\n\nOff to Minmus\n\n[![tedfsB7l.png](http://i.imgur.com/tedfsB7l.png)](http://imgur.com/tedfsB7)\n\nDisconnected the brace from the bottom of the Roamer, which I should have done much earlier.\n\n[![NUWrjg4l.png](http://i.imgur.com/NUWrjg4l.png)](http://imgur.com/NUWrjg4)\n\nComing in to dock up under the Roamer, very, very, very slowly...\n\n[![2oTLgvSl.png](http://i.imgur.com/2oTLgvSl.png)](http://imgur.com/2oTLgvS)\n\nSloooooowwwwwllllly now.....\n\n[![D8aafXJl.png](http://i.imgur.com/D8aafXJl.png)](http://imgur.com/D8aafXJ)\n\nAnd done!
