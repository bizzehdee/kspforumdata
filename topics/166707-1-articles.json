By that time, other space agencies will either have changed focus to building other hardware or will have worked on developing their own reusable rockets. Somewhere in there (knock on wood) congress will give NASA the go-ahead to construct a spaceship in orbit powered by a nuclear thermal rocket (like \u003Cem\u003EDiscovery\u003C/em\u003E in 2001: A Space Odyssey) which will be targeted at either a Venus flyby (as a test flight of sorts) or a mission to Jupiter. The modules will be launched on whatever big rocket is available at the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoon after, reusable rockets like the BFR (maybe 12m or 15m variants) will make jaunts out to Jupiter as well after refueling on Mars, but these will find their limits and for serious exploration of the outer planets. \u003Ci\u003EDiscovery\u003C/i\u003E style ships will eventually make their way to Saturn and (longer term) Uranus or Neptune.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy 2100 (optimistically) I think we will have landed people on some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and have sent at least manned flybys of Venus and Mercury. We will also have bases/cities/whatever you want to call them on Mars and the Moon. Somewhere at the end of the time period multiple countries will be seriously be considering (knocks on wood) a space elevator (which in my mind wouldn\u0027t actually get built for a hundred years, but by 2100 it will have gone from \u0022impossible\u0022 to \u0022possible with enough money.\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what do you all think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-20T23:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot of future (manned) spaceflight is going to be defined by how, when, and who lands humans on Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf BFS is successful (and in particular successful to the degree SpaceX hopes its going to be) then big spaceship-like vehicles are going to dominate manned spaceflight going forward, and whether we send them or use them to construct dedicated vehicles for further exploration would be up in the air. Not sure how far BFS could be sent out on its own.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf NASA gets there first using more classical hardware, then thats likely going to remain the dominant scheme, just scaled to meet whatever goals are next.\u00A0 Titan or Europa would be the next step out into the frontier after Mars, but at the rate we\u0027re committing to space exploration within this century would be pushing it to reach the surface of either of those moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf some other entity like China or Russia gets there first, as unlikely as it is, its very possible we could see another space race spurred on by the massive PR problem whatever the current administration at the time would be dealing with if that happened to ensure American dominance.\u00A0 Likely by dumping money on NASA and/or SpaceX to get flying.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, re-usability is going to be further refined at least on the American side of things. At the rate we\u0027re going and presuming payloads see a ramp up, by the 2030\u0027s/2040\u0027s we\u0027re likely going to see cost of space access not be much more than the cost of what you want to put in space. When that becomes a thing, it would behoove NASA and other entities interested in space exploration to put more of their budgets (whatever they may be) into payloads, which in turn means more exploration.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd we also have to remember that 2100 isn\u0027t -that- far away.\u00A0 Things like space elevators or manned exploration of the outer planets isn\u0027t likely to happen unless we also see a HUGE increase in exploration funding. This could happen as a result of the re-usability bit, but even then. The more ambitious the idea is the more costly and long winded its going to be even if you\u0027re dedicated to actually doing it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-20T23:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do I think?
