Node-attach a docking port to the end of a Mk2 cargo bay. Try to translate it up or down a smidgeon. It will leap sideways and lock there.\n\nSimilarly, try to attach a docking port to the floor of a Mk2 bay, then move it a bit. It will jump downwards so that it clips through the outer skin. Ditto for, say, a basic jet mounted on a cubic strut inside a cargo bay (standard VTOL usage). You can place it without without it clipping through the underside, but the second you try to translate it will leap irreversibly downwards."},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T09:06:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Seriously you don\u0027t have this problem?

Although I do recall re-loading a ship file when I had boosters radially attached to an NRAP and finding the radial decouplers inside the NRAP weight. No offset used, they just reloaded that way.
