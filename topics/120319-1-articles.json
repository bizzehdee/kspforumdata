On any given moon, I land the miner on its wheels so it doesn\u0027t matter if I\u0027m on a slope. I normally use the airplane wheels, which have those cool 100% energy efficient lights XD. Landing on airplane wheels also has the benefit that you can save some delta V (30-50 m/s)by landing with some remaining velocity. Use can use the brakes to dissipate the energy. This is, of course, not relevant for mining rigs with an ore converter, since you have an unlimited supply of fuel if you land on the right spot... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever.. lifting off (from the moon) does require some extra torque from reaction wheels, since the engine is oriented horizontally (assuming you\u0027ve landed on a flat area)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmmm...space plane... am allergic to those \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E :\u0022\u0026gt; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ripper2900\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ripper2900\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA little trick I\u0027ve used in a couple of landers, is to use the heavy landing legs, and rotate them a click or two outwards. Granted, it doesn\u0027t look really super, and when retracted, they\u0027ll be partly inside.
