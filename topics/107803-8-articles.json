ForScience! seems to work fine with [x] Science! I got confused because on my other science game, I must have run out of things to collect science from with that vessel.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-11T06:37:04Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2022 06:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by FloppyRocket**"},{"CreatedByName":"FloppyRocket","CreatedById":173990,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-16T00:16:10Z","Content":"Is there a bug in ForScience! such that it gives EVA science experiment credit even if the ship/kerbal aren\u0027t carrying the EVA Experiments Kit?
