Look for lifting surface entry. \n\u003E \n\u003E Also I have a patch on page one for people to test with better flying characteristics. Compare this cfg to the normal one in the mod , have a play around with it.\n\u003E \n\u003E Aero has not been midified.\n\u003E \n\u003E Are you using FAR?\n\u003E \n\u003E Also as I stated a while back I have a stock FAR version coming. I already have it with RO but is incomplete. Wings are seperate.\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E I might sound bias but it flies very well in my game. If I have to then I will take off the wings. But I did like the idea of one piece.\n\u003E \n\u003E I guess with wings seperate it can be FAR-able and wont need seperate version\n\nIm not using far. It flys very well but is touchy. For me it can be sent into a flap spin pretty easily by nosing up when im coming in to land after re entry. in older versions it used all body lift. And it would fly backwards. I updated today and now its all standard lift. So i wasnt sure if you changed something. im using the one piece in the screen shot.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-19T22:37:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2015 10:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by XxDARKWOLF67Xx**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristonwilson12","CreatedById":136353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T22:36:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Anyone watching this tomorrow?\n\u003E Japanese HTV-5 launch\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2015/08/18/japanese-cargo-rocket-rolls-out-for-wednesday-launch/?linkId=16393813](https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2015/08/18/japanese-cargo-rocket-rolls-out-for-wednesday-launch/?linkId=16393813)\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/wp-content/uploads/sites/240/2015/08/jaxa_htv5_blog2.jpg](http://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/wp-content/uploads/sites/240/2015/08/jaxa_htv5_blog2.jpg)\n\n![5c2e5a22de.jpg](http://puu.sh/jHrqb/5c2e5a22de.jpg) launched mine as well"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T22:40:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://puu.sh/jHrqb/5c2e5a22de.jpg](http://puu.sh/jHrqb/5c2e5a22de.jpg) launched mine as well\n\nAhh I love seeing things like this.
