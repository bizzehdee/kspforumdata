The main menu was fine so I decided to open the mun orbit scenario and guess what? EVERYTHING WAS BLACK!! Well not exactly I could see the mun but it was very dark and I could see my ship (barely) and the same thing happened in the station one scenario. I tried exploring the darkness (because my map was just all black) and basically nothing happened my kerbal flew around a bit and I put him back inside the ship. When I closed my game and opened it again everything was back to normal. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this glitch?
