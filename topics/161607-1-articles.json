I built a small little boat and put it out to sea, and when it hit the water, it simply went under the water, and didn\u0027t float. I had no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E issues, it wasn\u0027t heavy, and it was small, but why make a boat parts mod, if the parts don\u0027t even float? Boats are suppost to float, not to sink. Submarines do that, not boats. I now use them in space and have made them larger and have many levels so they look like space cruisers and frigates and everything, but why don\u0027t any of the boat parts float?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-05T04:30:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry this, I\u0027m guessing the version you have is old.
