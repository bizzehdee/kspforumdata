While I add antennas for my immersion, I never encountered the necessity to build up a com network. Always got control over the vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame goes with EC. I didn\u0027t recognise the loss of EC when moving a probe with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E or extracting the antennas. There is just no use to fuel cells, solar panels, etc atm - at least I never experienced running out of EC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo question now: is it already implemented?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKind regards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-13T23:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry driving a rover without source of EC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, probes can get out of range but those are very large distances we\u0027re talking about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
