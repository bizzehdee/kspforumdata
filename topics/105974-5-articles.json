And you gessed correctly with the russian rockets but I need to do reseach since I want one that uses the same guidance and yes the M-31 is gps guided. Before that however im going to update my models and textures to match the quality of the base mod. Ive already done the AIM-54 and the M-31 was built to that standard from the start. Eventually I also want to get the booster stages work on the rgm 184, RIM-174, and nike as well.
