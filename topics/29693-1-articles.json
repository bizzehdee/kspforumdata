Maybe just like an in-game checklist sort of idea, the mod filling it in and keeping a record within the game when you fill certain criteria, like first time in orbit, all the way to multi-planetary landings and returns with all Kerbals alive and accounted for... Could be something simple that just gives a sense of achieving things \u0027one step at a time,\u0027 adds that sort of success feeling, and gives an idea to set goals on as you develop more ships and stations... Could even give challenges too, for example; flyby three planets in one flight, or put a station composed of so many parts in orbit around a specific body, the possibilities are endless... Either way, I wholly back this endeavour! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hubbazoot","CreatedById":21881,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T20:58:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking right now I\u0027ll set it up to it calls the server and asks it if there\u0027s any new data, and will update accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tek_604","CreatedById":59699,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T14:35:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea might be to see if someone can write a plugin to interface with the ribbons server.
