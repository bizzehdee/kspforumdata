The physics is single threaded and as such bound to a single core. So the only thing that lets you add more parts (with physics, we will get back to that) without lag is a faster core. memory is important and KSP has some memory leaks that cause crashes, like scene changes, but the basic game uses 2.1GB which is easily available in most modern systems. On windows the most it can use is 3.5GB (because it is 32bit only).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome parts are essentially physicsless, in that they add their mass to the parent part and no other computation is done on them. Take the OXSTAT solar panels, you can put thousand on a craft and not really lag it, try a couple of hundred wing panels and you will have a totally different experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo on your 64bit 6GB A8 system there will be plenty of RAM available for KSP, and no TSR is going to matter, you can easily see how much available RAM you have and as long as there is more than 3.5GB available then memory will not be an issue, until KSP hits it\u0027s own hard limit of 3.5GB and crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour advice would be relevant for someone with 4GB of RAM and lower, but know also that the amount of RAM does not determine your FPS, instead that is bound by the speed of your core and the number and type of parts on your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T15:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBest way to avoid bloatware is to have a system built instead of buying one from the Big Box store.
