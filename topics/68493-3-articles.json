Kipard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cpt. Kipard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk fixed. Can I get some constructive feedback?\u003Cp\u003Eedit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just realised something. This and the previous engine are ion engines. They shouldn\u0027t even have effects like the one in that video should they?
