I\u0027ll explain in a little more detail than I usually do...\u003Cp\u003E\u0022On Rails\u0022 - When craft are not within physics range (~2.5km) of the ship being controlled, they are put into a state called \u0022On Rails.\u0022 Craft are put on rails to simplify physics calculations for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft that are \u0022On Rails\u0022 get deleted for basically two reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) On an airless world, they get deleted when striking the terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) On worlds with an atmosphere, they are deleted when the ship encounters \u0026gt; 0.1 atmospheres of pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Kerbin, 0.1 atmospheres is about 23km altitude. So any craft experience more than 0.1 atmospheres (which means is below ~23km on Kerbin) and is \u0022On Rails\u0022 (also known as outside Physics Range) is deleted. Period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people have been adding on the statement \u0022and isn\u0027t being controlled.\u0022 This is redundant, because any ship the player is controlling \u003Cem\u003Edefines\u003C/em\u003E the center of physics range. It is impossible for the ship the player is controlling to \u0022go outside of physics range\u0022 because physics follows the ship being controlled. The statement \u0022isn\u0027t being controlled\u0022 has been mistaken to mean \u0022without a probe core (or MJ, or whatever),\u0022 but that\u0027s not the case. In stock, craft deletion on atmospheric bodies follows these two rules, and no others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022On Rails\u0022 and greater than 0.1 atmospheres.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully that clears it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, there are several mods that will refund money automatically for stages that are deleted. DebRefund and StageRecovery are two that I can think of off hand. There are also mods that extend physics range beyond 2.5km, though I don\u0027t know of any current ones off hand. (TTNeverUnload was one, but I think that\u0027s old.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow!
