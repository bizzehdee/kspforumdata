Beautiful graphics, music, story... it\u0027s just a great game through and through. Original game price: 50-80$ for cartrige (N64) and 40$ (3DS remake)\n\n4- Team Fortress 2\n\n - Fun fast paced online FPS with varying classes, weapons, gamemodes, and maps. Source engine, made by Valve, just fun to play. Price: Free to Play (with ingame purchases)\n\n3- Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap\n\n - Fun game to sit down and play. Short game, fun and a real chill-out-game for bieing not so difficult, and is a hidden gem for the GBA. Price: 30-50$ (No remakes... yet.)\n\n2- KS\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 err... Pok\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9mon Emerald\n\n - First Pok\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9mon game I have ever played. Playing through it over a summer on an emulator was probably the best experience I have ever had. Most fun mobile game I have ever played. On my favorite console aswell. Price: 30-50$ (GBA) and 40-50$ (3DS remakes Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, but I suggest original Emerald)\n\n1- To the Moon\n\n - This game is shockingly deep, with a interactive yet linear storyline that will and has driven people (including me) to tears of both sadness and happiness. Thats all I\u0027m gonna say about this game, because spoilers. 10$. Steam. Get it. Now."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T12:45:31Z","Content":"5 - Spore.
