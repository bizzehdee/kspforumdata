Shuttle re-entry can be tricky to learn, but looking at how the real shuttles did it actually works pretty well.

This varies a bit based on your construction of course but I found it happens pretty consistently starting at 11m/s. Granted that\u0027s a pretty hard landing, I\u0027m not implying it\u0027s a bug or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes quite a bit of practice, but keep at it!

I really like the current three-node set up, but for those of us who are making Buran-type parasite shuttles, or, as I have done, a single large engine on a shorter shuttle, there kind of needs to be a central attachment node, so that 2.5 meter engines don\u0027t clip through the upper part of the shuttle.
