Not to mention the commonplace rapid unplanned disassembly. I\u0027ve taken the lessons I\u0027ve learned with the Arkingthaad series of large tower landers, and am currently applying this to SSTO construction.

Don\u0027t get burnt out on another big project Whack!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust make sure you have center of lift/thrust behind center of mass. Usually the primary wings are near the arse end to balance the bulky weight of the engines. Be sure to disable yaw on all your wings but tail wings. It will rip a big multi-part plane apart trying to use to many control axis on a single control surface. Try making multiple control surfaces for individual functions (pitch/roll/yaw). Landing should be easy. Land on the engines, gently use SAS to flip it onto the wheels, or RCS. Those landing gears are strong, don\u0027t be worried about dropping on them. I actually made a pretty ******edly large rover back in the day out of the Modular Multiwheels mod that I forgot all about. It was slightly smaller then what you have there and landed on the mun (and returned, punching it up a mountain to get a return trajectory LOL) with that profile. The entire thing was made out of entirely cheater parts (Modular Multiwheels, Deuterium, B9/TV Wings, etc). but the proof of concept exists IMO. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Good luck\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-14T16:34:33Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2014 04:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonik\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Col_Jessep","CreatedById":4071,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T17:30:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you can get away with less structural elements for the amount of fuel you want to carry.
