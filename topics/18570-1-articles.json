They are akin to the real-life Apollos 8 and 10 missions, where the command modules (etc.) orbited the Moon but did not attempt to land. There are a few other practice runs posted here that involve landing on Kerbin in place of another planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse of the fuel bug is not allowed. Do not run your engines at less than 66% of their maximum power. Do not run your engines at less than 80% of maximum power for more than ten minutes total time. (Running at 0% is not limited as it provides no fuel-bug advantage.) If attempting this challenge on 0.17 or later, disregard these instructions as the fuel bug is only present in 0.16.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse good judgement and avoid mods that allow you an unfair advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Build a rocket able to get into LKO and return with a parachute--minimal bells and whistles. This is your Kerbin Reentry Module, or KeRM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Build a rocket able to escape Kerbin\u0027s gravity and enter a solar orbit. This is your Interplanetary Excursion Module, or IEM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a) The IEM should not have the capacity for safe return to the surface of Kerbin (i.e. no parachutes/landing gear/legs and no attempts to land it on Kerbin after liftoff.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E The final stage (containing the command module) should not be decoupled from the final engine stage--they are one and the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E c) Overall, your should be designed/equipped with long missions in mind. Several fuel tanks in the final stage are recommended (but \u003Cem\u003Eoptional\u003C/em\u003E.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E d) The KeRM should have enough crew slots to accomodate the crew of the IEM, and the IEM should carry at least 2 passengers (mod parts that add extra seating are allowed.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Launch the KeRM and \u003Cem\u003Eoptionally\u003C/em\u003E get it into an orbit with as little eccentricity and inclination as possible (this will make it easier to reach it later.) Any reasonable orbital maneuvers are allowed, but you must have enough fuel to deorbit later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Once the KeRM\u0027s orbit is satisfactory, its crew should abandon ship by any means necessary.

Put yourself into a keliocentric orbit that differs from Kerbin\u0027s by at least 1Gm. Have fun up there. Perform zero-gravity experiments and EVAs. Try a sundive. Pretend you\u0027re actually travelling to another planet. Whatever. Make sure you\u0027re up there for at least 200 days--the longer the trip, the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Return the IEM to Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence and enter orbit around Kerbin. Be careful--if your orbit upon return is retrograde relative to the orbit of the KeRM, you will need to correct it before circularizing or you\u0027ll most certainly run out of fuel. Of course, you could try it the other way around, it\u0027s just not recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Rendezvous with the KeRM and transfer your crew to it. Wave goodbye to the IEM. You did bring your goodbye-waving kerchief, didn\u0027t you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Deorbit and safely return to the surface of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a) Extra points the closer you land to the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E If at any point during your return your crew experiences more than 8Gs, assume they were converted to a delicious creamy green paste, and that the mission has ended in failure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-04T03:25:58Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2012 03:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by grynspan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETweaks to the formula\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hremsfeld","CreatedById":23422,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-03T23:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be clear:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut Rocket A into LKO and empty it of kerbanauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESend Rocket B out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI; Make it have an apoapsis of at least 1Gm = 1,000,000 km further than Kerbin\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturn Rocket B to Kerbin\u0027s SOI and establish an orbit.
