As Ayn Rand said: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident which everybody has decided not to see.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople choose what they believe, often dismissing any evidence presented to them against their view, or showing them they may want to reconsider their approach towards the topic. Take climate change for example: A significant amount of people still refuse to acknowledge the effect humans are having on the planet despite 97% of scientists saying it\u0027s real, despite seeing flash-flooding and drought, despite seeing countless graphs and charts showing the huge difference between natural change and change caused by humans. They look only for the information that confirms their original belief (confirmation bias).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem is humans are terrible at looking into the future and seeing the outcome of things. We are far more likely to act on matters that affect us at the moment. If something is going to take some time to change something we say: \u0027I\u0027ll deal with that later\u0027. This often leads to cases where it is too late to act.

They see wars on T.V. and think that only happens in foreign countries. They see natural disasters destroying homes and believe they are immune.
