One thing in particular, do you use vessel viewer? There are settings accessible through the MFD to set the refresh rate lower to offset some of the work load on your processor. But as for just the visuals.... You may need to turn down your settings. I have a few tips and tricks on my thread linked in my signature to help with graphics setup as well as a few other things if you are interested."},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T21:38:07Z","Content":"Hmmm will this work if I am using ven\u0027s revamp?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T21:42:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hmmm will this work if I am using ven\u0027s revamp?\n\nHas for me."},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T22:10:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Has for me.\n\nI\u0027ll give it a try."},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T23:16:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hmmm will this work if I am using ven\u0027s revamp?\n\nIt does work with the revamp."},{"CreatedByName":"chase_p1","CreatedById":127665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T02:34:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Anyone know what the ***\u0022AVAS CTL\u0022*** toggle does?\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/UvfPJaI.png](http://i.imgur.com/UvfPJaI.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Thank you SO much for making this mod!
