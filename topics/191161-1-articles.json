I\u0027ve just come back to KSP after around a five year hiatus. I thought I had read somewhere awhile back that with REMOTE Tech that it would connect to multiple different launch sites around Kerbin and not just the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. HOWEVER. I don\u0027t see any of the other launch centers and I only have connection to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. WHAT do I need to do to be able to view these other launch sites?
