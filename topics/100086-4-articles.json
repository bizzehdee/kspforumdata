But first, a couple of the tugs in Duna orbit needed to be docked to Duna Space Station. During the Laythe mission, it was generally Thompbles who took care of the thankless tasks of remotely piloting ships in orbit...and so it shall be on the Duna mission as well.\n\nThe BANT D1 Tug that had carried the Base, a Fuel Fido, and a Fuel Station to Duna, had only its rack of four Small Science Lander probes left attached. It also had a lot of propellant remaining, and that would be added to the stores at Duna Space Station. A relatively small burn put the BANT into an elliptical phasing orbit. After a seven orbits of waiting, tiny burn at periapsis and apoapsis targeted the intercept with Duna Station, and a final burn matched velocity with the Station to complete the rendezvous.\n\n![Q70Jthk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Q70Jthk.jpg)\n\nAt Duna Space Station, the BANT D1 was backed in to dock with one of the Senior docking ports in the lower tier of ports. The rear Kerbodyne S3-7200 Tank of the BANT would become part of the Space Station after the Tug later returns to Kerbin, increasing the fuel storage capacity of the station and extending the docking port further from the Station axis.\n\n![RmoGUMq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RmoGUMq.jpg)\n\nNote: I generally don\u0027t go in for mods with lots of parts, but I do like several mods that add or improve some visual or user interface features. One of these is the Lazor Docking Cam mod. This makes docking more fun (none of that constant shifting around of your viewpoint to make sure everything is lined up). Plus I can\u0027t imagine my kerbals being able to do a lot of the remote piloting of ships that I have them do without having some cameras onboard to help them see what they are doing. I hope SQUAD adds small external cameras and docking port cameras to the list of KSP features in the future.\n\nThe other tug that had completed its payload delivery mission was the SP Tug A double tug that had delivered the two DunaDog aircraft. Three of its Rockomax X200-32 Fuel Tanks were still full (as well as the nacelle tanks), and that propellant would be added to the Space Station as well.\n\n![HFry2UB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HFry2UB.jpg)\n\nEventually, another S3-7200 Tank will be added to complete the symmetry of the Station (the other BANT tugs are in polar orbit, so they won\u0027t be added to the equatorially-orbiting Space Station). But for now, SP Tug A was docked to the remaining open port on the tier of Senior docking ports.\n\n![bG0yMqx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bG0yMqx.jpg)\n\nBelow: Today\u0027s work on the Space Station is finished.\n\n![XsXgEEs.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XsXgEEs.jpg)\n\n**Surface Stuff**\n\nThompbles: \u0022Kurt, while the geologists are doing their initial digging in the dirt around the Base area, I want you and Nelemy to prepare all of the rovers and planes for their test missions. Top off their tanks and verify that all systems are working.\u0022\n\nNelemy: \u0022Dude, I\u0027ll check out the Fuel Station first!\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022OK.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Also check the parachute systems on Duna Lander 1. Aldner said that there wasn\u0027t an immediate response from the parachute deployment action while we were landing, and he had to use the alternate staging deployment method...but that\u0027s not going to work again when we need to hop that Lander.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Probably a software glitch. I\u0027ll check its SFS file settings against those in Lander 2.\u0022\n\nBelow we see Nelemy driving one of the Duna Fido rovers over to check out the Fuel Station. Unlike on Laythe, on Duna the kerbals can use their rocket packs to move between vehicles. The rocket packs struggle in Duna\u0027s gravity compared to low gravity moons, so they aren\u0027t going to be great for flying long distances, but they\u0027ll get the job done for short hops. This meant that various vehicles, such as the Fuel Station, could be designed without extra ladder parts.\n\n![A9fbif9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/A9fbif9.jpg)\n\nNelemy re-packed the Fuel Station\u0027s parachutes for neatness (it\u0027s not planned to hop it later), but his main interest in checking over the Fuel Station was to visit the Goo. All of the Fuel Stations are equipped with a Goo Canister to monitor Duna surface conditions, and this canister had been opened automatically upon landing.\n\nNelemy: \u0022Hey, little Goo-Dude! Are you enjoying your new home on Duna? Huh...Hey, Nelemy calling Hellou. Come in Hellou-dude.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022What\u0027s up, Nelemy?\u0022\n\nNelemy: \u0022The Goo looks like it\u0027s blushing. Do you think it\u0027s embarrassed about being on Duna?\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022No, Nelemy...that\u0027s probably just the very fine dust. It blows around easily and gets on everything. What is the Goo doing?\u0022\n\nNelemy: \u0022Just pulsing a little. I think its happy. The GooCam is working, so I\u0027ll have it send its report back to KSC.\u0022\n\n![ytlvnJS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ytlvnJS.jpg)\n\nMeanwhile, Kurt was driving the Fuel Fido over to the DunaDog planes. The Fuel Fido handles and corners well with its grippy wheels, but you do have to be careful when stopping because it has more of a tendency to tip than the Laythe rovers with their longer wheel base. You just have to remember to slow down with reverse throttle before braking to a halt.\n\n![kP1whXZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kP1whXZ.jpg)\n\nIt is my contention that the Claw units contain refueling hoses that Kurt can string to nearby vehicles to facilitate refueling. But the in-game mechanic is just to dock the Claw to some handy surface and transfer fuel. For the DunaDogs, the easiest place to grab with the Claw is any of the four ion engines on the back. This had all been tested in the \u0022Duna Yard\u0022 back at KSC, of course...you don\u0027t want to find out something like this isn\u0027t going to work AFTER you get your ships to their destination.\n\n![kTHQPjF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kTHQPjF.jpg)\n\nI really do wish SQUAD would just give us hoses for surface refueling. Even if they don\u0027t want to add some fancy graphics and game mechanics for kerbals to connect up hose (although I hope they do), they could add a feature that allows fuel transfer between any nearby ships with the standard right-click-on-the-tanks method.\n\nThe relatively new feature that allows you to right-click to select many tanks at once so that fuel can be transferred out of one and into all of the others simultaneously is certainly handy. Below, Kurt is transferring Xenon from the Fuel Fido (which has four Xenon tanks on its underside) to the port row of six Xenon tanks on the DunaDog. The DunaDog had used very little Xenon during landing, so this went quickly. Afterwards, Kurt topped off the DunaDog\u0027s starboard Xenon tanks, and topped off the main FL-T800 Fuel Tank of the plane (to replace the propellant used during retro fire and landing).\n\n![mdxh9Q8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mdxh9Q8.jpg)\n\nKurt next undocked and moved the Fuel Fido over to DunaDog 2 to similarly top off its tanks.\n\n![EagFT39.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EagFT39.jpg)\n\nAfter DunaDog 1 was fueled up, Aldner did some short-range taxiing tests to check out the rover capabilities of the plane. An important limitation became apparent when the plane\u0027s batteries rapidly depleted: You must be very careful about Ike eclipsing the sun! As seen from Duna, Ike is about five degrees wide (ten times the size of our Moon as seen from Earth), so eclipses last a fairly long time, during which your solar panels are useless. When roving, eclipses just mean you have to stop and wait a while...but if a DunaDog is in flight and relying on its ion engines to stay aloft, an eclipse could be fatal (depending on what terrain is below). So DunaDog missions will need to be carefully planned with the location of Ike in mind.\n\n![JWSBGgX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JWSBGgX.jpg)\n\n**Polar Pilot**\n\nAldner: \u0022Thompbles says we can do a DunaDog test mission now. I\u0027ll flip you for the honor of doing the first mission, Hawk.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Fair enough, Buzz. Did you bring a coin to Duna?\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Umm...no. But it\u0027s traditional to have Kurt pick a random number. Closest guess wins...and the loser can drive Hellou on her rover expedition to the north.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Hey, I\u0027m right here! How rude.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022I mean...the winner flies the plane...and the second-place winner gets the honor of escorting our dear geologist north.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022OK. I\u0027m thinking of a number from one to three million. Hawk gets to guess first.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022I\u0027ll take 1,500,000.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022I\u0027ll have...1,499,999.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022The number was 1,479,940. Aldner wins.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Have a good flight, Buzz. And I get Chickadee all to myself. It\u0027ll be just like the good ol\u0027 days on Vall.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Have you picked a name for your plane yet?\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022I\u0027m naming it \u0027Aragorn\u0027.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Ah...a DunaDog named after a D\u00FAnadan. Only you would think of that. I\u0027m happy you still remember things from the book I loaned you during the Laythe mission.\u0022\n\nBelow, Aldner took off the next morning while the sun was high in the sky, but while there was still plenty of time before Ike would eclipse the sun. Alas, no jet engines on oxygen-less Duna, so the takeoff run was powered by the rear 48-7S rocket engine (which is toggled on/off via action group 1).\n\n![KZ1fZtl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KZ1fZtl.jpg)\n\nThe takeoff seemed very slow, with the tri-plane lifting at less than 35 m/s but rising very slowly. This was partly because of all the lag around the Base area, but mostly because the terrain slopes upward as you head north from Duna Base.\n\nAldner: \u0022Gear up. Climbing slowly.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Roger, Aldner. Have a safe flight.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Thanks, Friendly Flight Controller. One thousand meters on the altimeter...I\u0027m firing the ion engines. All four are hot and looking good.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Roger. Remember to keep the sunlight angle on your wings in mind at all times.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Yes, Mother Hen. Fifteen hundred meters. Rocket engine off. The silence sure is weird. Looks like I used about 10 percent of the rocket fuel for the takeoff. Climbing slower now.\u0022\n\n![RTHiBhB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RTHiBhB.jpg)\n\nTwo minutes into the flight, Aldner was passing through 2,900 meters, still climbing slowly. The plane was tooling along at a non-hair-raising speed of under 88 m/s. Because things were moving slowly, most of the flying was done a 2X physical time warp. It was also handy to click on one of the solar panels to monitor the sun exposure. Thus far the photovoltaics were providing all the power needed by the ion engines at full throttle.\n\n![A5t3sR8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/A5t3sR8.jpg)\n\nHellou: \u0022Chickadee calling Aragorn. Aldner, you remembered to turn on all the science instruments, right?\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Yes, Assistant Mother Hen. All scanners running. Thirty-five hundred meters.\u0022\n\nThe main reason for the existence of the DunaDog planes can be seen on the underside of the Aragorn. There are four generic science instruments on the plane\u0027s belly, which represent a High-Resolution Surface Camera, a Multi-Spectral Imaging Scanner, a Cosmic Ray Induced X-ray Emission Spectrometer, and a High-Sensitivity VanAllen Detector. While the BirdDog rover/planes were the primary exploration craft on Laythe, the DunaDog rover/planes are primarily for gathering swaths of low altitude data in support of the Duna Fido surface rovers.\n\n![ppqhnsr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ppqhnsr.jpg)\n\nThe parachute mast of the DunaDog also has science instruments mounted on it, including an Infrared Spectral Analyzer, two different Catalytic Detectors, and the excitingly-named Particulate Accumulator With Laser Zap Analysis Probe.\n\n![RphHwI9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RphHwI9.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022I\u0027m at four thousand on the altimeter, but that large lumpy red thing below me is still trying to get close. I wonder if it wants to be friends with me?\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022I\u0027d advise against that, Aldner.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Yeah. I\u0027m passing to the west of a big lump...I should clear the shoulder ridge. Still climbing at about 10 meters per second on the ions.\u0022\n\n![UaVylKL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UaVylKL.jpg)\n\n![6JE0Wbf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6JE0Wbf.jpg)\n\nA minute later...\n\nAldner: \u0022Uh oh. No you don\u0027t.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Problem?\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022The vast lumpy red thing was getting too frisky. I had to use a burst of rocket power to climb faster to get away from it. That single rocket engine seemed kind of anemic during takeoff, but it sure is sporty relative to the ions.\u0022\n\n![AmfdIyR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AmfdIyR.jpg)\n\nBy the time Aldner got to 5000 meters (at about 6 degrees North latitude), he was safely above most of the surrounding terrain, even if only by a few hundred meters as he passed over ridges. At this point he leveled off and started experimenting with finding an optimal cruising altitude and speed for the DunaDog. About 5300 meters with a pitch angle of 20 degrees seemed to work well with the four ion engines at full throttle, giving a cruising speed of around 165 m/s.\n\n![4MZCmX2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4MZCmX2.jpg)\n\nAldner continued experimenting with the cruising altitude for a long time. He got the plane cruising along as high as 6300 meters, but that required angles of attack near 40 degrees, without a lot of increase in horizontal speed.\n\nAldner: \u0022Oh, hey! Ice!\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Your wings are icing up?\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022No, Oh Amusing One...I can see the ice cap on the north horizon. I\u0027m currently at 35 degrees north latitude. I think I\u0027ll go have a look at it.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Copy that. Remember to watch your sun exposure.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Sure thing. It\u0027s at 90 percent now.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Yes...but it\u0027s the sun angle when you are RETURNING that is the concern. You are clear to go as far north as 60 degrees latitude...but the engineers back at KSC advise against going further north than that.\u0022\n\n![Zvt1gP2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Zvt1gP2.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022White and lumpy. Not at all like the smooth ice cap on Laythe. Forty-four point three North. Still over sixty-one percent Xenon remaining.\u0022\n\n![mpmeGBF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mpmeGBF.jpg)\n\nAt about 45 degrees north latitude, Aldner passed over the boundary of the polar cap and continued North.\n\nAldner: \u0022I thought the all-red landscape was getting kind of boring, but this all-white terrain gets a bit dull after a while, too. Forty-nine north...Xenon at fifty-seven percent.\u0022\n\n![uAKQbLm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uAKQbLm.jpg)\n\nAbout 38 minutes after takeoff, Aldner was approaching is target distance (the planets in KSP really are pretty small).\n\nAldner: \u0022Xenon down to 50%. Shutting down the ion engines. Ooops...went a little below half there...but the plane will be lighter on the way back, so that shouldn\u0027t be a problem.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022What\u0027s your location?\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022A little short of 58 degrees. I really wanted to get to sixty North. I\u0027ll do a little burn with the rocket motor.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022You don\u0027t have to go all the way to sixty.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Ah, but if I can make a 120-degree round trip, it will mean the DunaDog can do an around-Duna trip in three legs.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022True.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022OK...looks like I didn\u0027t need the extra boost. I\u0027m going to easily glide past sixty North now. I\u0027ll land to get some surface samples for Hellou and Kelby.\u0022\n\n![DfBKYia.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DfBKYia.jpg)\n\nAldner pitched up hard to lose speed. When the speed dropped to 110 m/s (at an altitude of about 1.4 km above a relatively smooth patch of ice) he deployed the parachutes (action group 5).\n\n![HpGHBw0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HpGHBw0.jpg)\n\nThe belly engine was activated (action group 2) and it was used to further decrease the forward speed. The Aragorn touched down at 5 m/s just north of 62 degrees North latitude.\n\n![IEyN4kD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IEyN4kD.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Landed safely, no problems. Belly engine deactivated. Liquid propellant now at eighty percent. I\u0027ll get out and have a look around.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Remember to re-pack your parachutes.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Yes, Mom. First thing on the list.\u0022\n\nOut on the ice, Aldner did a walk-around to see that his plane was OK. It wasn\u0027t a particularly memorable location, so he decided to not plant a flag.\n\n![zXBmuag.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zXBmuag.jpg)\n\nHellou: \u0022Hellou calling the Aragon.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Hi, Hellou. I\u0027ve only been gone a little while, and you missed me so much you had to call. How sweet!\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Right. I\u0027d like you to get two core samples. Also dig a small trench and take pictures. Get plenty of surface samples.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022I miss you too. But I\u0027m not staying here long...I have a deadline with the sun. Anyway, I\u0027m already digging the little trench. Huh...the ice is nice and white on top, but it\u0027s kind of pink underneath.\u0022\n\n![y1Evxvh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/y1Evxvh.jpg)\n\nAfter about 30 minutes of sampling, Aldner got back into the Aragorn to prepare for his return trip.\n\nAldner: \u0022All right. I have the plane turned around. It handles well enough in rover mode on the ice. Time for a quick snack and then I\u0027ll be heading back.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Roger.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Have you got all the surface samples taken care of?\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Yes, Ma\u0027am. The ice cores are in the insulated holders under the wings, the surface samples are in the little freezer, and two chunks of ice are in my cold drink.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022You\u0027re drinking the polar ice? We haven\u0027t tested it yet.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Yeah...I\u0027m testing it now. If there\u0027s any bugs that are going to kill us here on Duna, it\u0027s best to find out now. Besides...having a drink that doesn\u0027t contain recycled pee is nice. Hmmm. Duna tastes good. OK...heading back now.\u0022\n\nFor takeoff, Aldner used both the rear rocket engine and the belly engine to shorten the takeoff roll (also because he was at 2900 meters of elevation). The plane pitches up pretty quickly after takeoff with the belly engine on.\n\n![dojOsk5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dojOsk5.jpg)\n\nAt 100 meters over the ice, Aldner switched on the ion engines (with the rear rocket engine still burning) to see how they would do. With the plane facing south, pitched up to climb, the sun exposure on the solar cells was weak (about 10% at 10 degrees, and 5% at 25 degrees), so the batteries were rapidly draining with the ions at full thrust.\n\nAldner: \u0022The ions are drinking the batteries fast. I\u0027m using the rocket engine to gain altitude.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Watch out...asymmetrical \u0027flameouts\u0027 of the ion engines can cause the plane to yaw.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Yeah, that\u0027s what I was gonna say, but I\u0027m too busy here to use long words like asymmetrical.\u0022\n\n![WSatYYb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WSatYYb.jpg)\n\nAt 4500 meters, with over 1600 meters of air below him, Aldner switched off the rocket engine and leveled off to see what he could do with just the ion engines.\n\nAldner: \u0022I\u0027m flying on just the ions now. Pitch at 10 degrees. Sun exposure 33 percent. But that\u0027s still draining the batteries. I\u0027m throttling back to two thirds.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Copy that. Keep me informed when you have the time. We have a good link through the polar comsat.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Hmmm. If I cut back to half throttle and pitch down a little for a slow descent, I can get the batteries to charge. If I get too low, I\u0027ll use some of that precious charge to goose the ions.\u0022\n\n![gEQOaMS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gEQOaMS.jpg)\n\nThings were a bit tense there for a while, but it got easier and easier as the plane flew further south. By the time Aldner was approaching the edge of the ice sheet, he was able to set the throttle of the ion engines up to 100% with a sun exposure of over 50%.\n\n![cljlcaM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cljlcaM.jpg)\n\nOnce he was back into sunnier climes, Aldner was able to do some more cruise testing, and found that the now-lighter DunaDog could cruise along at over 200 m/s at around 6000 meters. With the Duna Base set as the target, it was easy to guide the plane toward that marker...but he was basically paralleling his previous path back south.\n\n![GkDHrNV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GkDHrNV.jpg)\n\nAbout 24 km out from base, cruising along at 208 m/s at 5200 meters, Aldner cut back the ions to half power to begin his descent. As he approached the Base area, the sun was past noon, but still a long distance away from its eclipse by Ike, so there would be no problems with that.\n\n![jE0Q4nS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jE0Q4nS.jpg)\n\nAbout two kilometers out, at an altitude of 1500 meters, Aldner toggled the ion engines off. There was still over 11% of the Xenon remaining.\n\nAldner: \u0022Tower, this is Aragorn requesting a flyby.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Negative, Aragorn, the pattern is full. But you\u0027re going to anyway, aren\u0027t you?\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Well, it\u0027s hard to buzz the tower when you\u0027re gliding. Passing over at 200 meters.\u0022\n\n![UCAs2XT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UCAs2XT.jpg)\n\nAldner overflew the Base, then circled around in a glide to head in from the west. This required a little burst from the rocket motor, but he got the plane lined up to pass just south of the surface vehicles, gliding over at 72 m/s at 220 meters altitude...then deployed the chutes, which immediately opened fully.\n\n![HIdXPt8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HIdXPt8.jpg)\n\nRear engine off...Belly engine activated...and with judicious burts of the belly rocket, Aldner touched down at 4 m/s.\n\n![1c9waGH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1c9waGH.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Down safe. Wheels stop. Less than fifty meters from Lander 2. That was one-hundred and twenty-four degrees of travel, ladies and gents, with eleven point five percent of my Xenon and fifty-four percent of my LFO remaining. Celebration at the main Base module.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Roger. Good work, Aldner. But get your plane refueled and buttoned up before thinking about a party.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Aye, aye, Cap\u0027n. I\u0027ll get out a re-pack the chutes first.\u0022\n\n![v5b7Ngk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/v5b7Ngk.jpg)\n\n...And this is where one of the strangest bugs I\u0027ve ever encountered in KSP happened. When I pressed the EVA button to get Aldner out of the cockpit, there were suddenly TWO kerbals, both flying off, tumbling through the air toward the south from the DunaDog. They bounced and skidded to a halt on the ground with the furthest on about 50 meters from the plane. When I clicked on them...they were BOTH labeled as Aldner Kerman.\n\n![re756fT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/re756fT.jpg)\n\nI did a quicksave...but when I tried to switch to the Space Center, that didn\u0027t work and the game hung up. I have often had weird things happen just before KSP was about to crash due to memory leaks filling up the space available to the program (things like having ships mysteriously crash and report that they had hit faraway objects...or textures going seriously wonky), but this is the weirdest one. When I restarted the game, there were still two Aldners. Some people suggested that I keep both Aldners as a fortuitous bounty from the Kraken to make up for all the negative bugs that have happened over the years... But I revert from bad bug occurrences, so it would not be fair to keep my new Aldner. I will have a little fun with him before I throw him back, however.\n\nBack to the story...\n\nAldner got up and dusted off the red dirt.\n\nAldner: \u0022Yo, Thompbles. Something strange just happened. As I was getting out of the plane, I suddenly got knocked off into the air...\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\* Nothing but static on the radio \\*\\*\\*\n\nAldner: \u0022Aldner calling Thompbles. Can you read me?\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\* Still nothing but static on the radio \\*\\*\\*\n\nAldner: \u0022Aldner calling anybody. Can anybody hear me. I think my receiver may be broken.\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\* Still just static \\*\\*\\*\n\nAt this point, Aldner noticed the other kerbal to the north of him, so he started walking that direction. He muted the radio channel, since there appeared to be something wrong with his radio...but he knew that when got closer to the other kerbal, the short-range IR comm system would automatically kick in...assuming that wasn\u0027t also broken.\n\nAldner: \u0022Hey, the strangest thing just happened to me. When I was getting out of the cockpit, I suddenly...\u0022\n\nAldner stopped when he realized that the other kerbal was not one of his crew mates. He approached more slowly, looking over the stranger carefully.\n\n![dl6TGV1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dl6TGV1.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022OK, buddy. Who the hell are you and why are you wearing my spare suit?\u0022\n\nOther Aldner: \u0022I am a solid projection created in your likeness when you came in contact with the Duna Moving Equatorial Marker\u0027s surface trigger. I am not wearing your suit; it is just that this projection looks identical to you to facilitate communications. You have nine questions left.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Is this some kind of joke? And what do you mean I have nine questions left?\u0022\n\nOther Aldner: \u0022This is no joke. I am a projection generated by the Duna Moving Equatorial Marker. Like all the other markers, I am here to give you clues to locating the planet of the Creators. But the Creators did not intend to make this quest easy, because they want only a persistent and intelligent race to find their planet...so, as with the other markers here on Duna and elsewhere, there are limits to the information I can relate...and in my case I am limited in the number of responses I can give. You have seven questions left.\u0022\n\n![MEG5Du3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MEG5Du3.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Ohhhhkay. This is above my pay grade, and my radio is broken. I\u0027m going to need you to come with me to that Base vehicle over there.\u0022\n\nOther Aldner: \u0022There will not be time. The energy required to maintain this solid projection is substantial, and the Marker will soon move out of range. You have less than ten minutes remaining to question me. Also, sorry about the radio interference; that is a side effect of the solid image generation field.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Damn. OK...who are these \u0027creators\u0027 you\u0027re talking about?\u0022\n\nOther Aldner: \u0022The Creators are the race of beings that created your race. They inhabited this system long ago, but one of their experiments in mass teleportation went awry. The failure sterilized all intelligent lifeforms in the system and ripped their planet from its orbit. As one of their final acts, they seeded your planet with lifeforms that they hoped would evolve into intelligent creatures to carry on with their work. So they left clues for you to find their planet and acquire their advanced technologies. You have six questions left.\u0022\n\n![5nhrZJj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5nhrZJj.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022OK. Where is the creators\u0027 planet?\u0022\n\nOther Aldner: \u0022There are some questions I can not answer, and that is one of them. But the clues to the location of the Creators\u0027 planet can be found at the other anomalies on Duna and elsewhere...\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Wait...so I wasted a question just because you refuse to answer it?\u0022\n\nOther Aldner: \u0022No. Questions that I am not allowed to answer do not count against your total. But the question about the asking of questions does count. You have five questions remaining.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Ah. OK...Where are the other Duna markers located?\u0022\n\nOther Aldner: \u0022I can not give you their exact locations, but I can tell you that they emit intermittent pulses at pi gigahertz. You can locate them that way. You have four questions remaining.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022OK...Now we\u0027re getting somewhere.\u0022\n\nBelow, the two Aldners were join by a third kerbal, whose approach was unnoticed until he got into IR comm range.\n\n![ppfwA4X.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ppfwA4X.jpg)\n\nNelemy: \u0022Dude! Thompbles says your radio isn\u0027t working, so we\u0027re supposed to find out what\u0027s going on. But it looks like Kurt got here fir...Dude! That\u0027s not Kurt! That\u0027s another Aldner! Dude! Why are there TWO Aldners??\u0022\n\nOther Aldner: \u0022I am a projection generated by the Duna Moving Equatorial Marker. I was generated when Aldner came in contact with the surface trigger beam. I am here to answer questions about the location of the Creators\u0027 planet. You have three questions left.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022No! Stop! Don\u0027t answer any questions that guy asks you!\u0022\n\nOther Aldner: \u0022I must answer any question asked by anyone, as long as I am not prohibited from answering that particular question.\u0022\n\nNelemy: \u0022Dude...quit being mean. Why can\u0027t I ask questions?\u0022\n\nOther Aldner: \u0022You are allowed to ask questions until the question limit is reached or until this projection can no longer be maintained. You have two questions left.\u0022\n\n![DsKV0vK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DsKV0vK.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Nelemy...Look...just don\u0027t ask any questions. Just don\u0027t say anything. I\u0027m not being mean here. This guy is some sort of alien projection, and he\u0027ll answer questions about the location of the home planet of a super powerful alien race that has advanced technology that we can go get.\u0022\n\nNelemy: \u0022Wow, really? Even advanced snack technology?\u0022\n\nOther Aldner: \u0022Yes, really. And, yes, the Creators had the technology to make a wide variety of very tasty and nutritious snacks in vast quantities. Those were you final two questions.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022No, wait...!\u0022\n\nOther Aldner: \u0022I may be able to appear again in the future if trigger conditions are met, but this session has ended.\u0022\n\nAnd the Other Aldner vanished with an audible \\*pop\\*.\n\n![96MYJgL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/96MYJgL.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Arrrrgghh.\u0022\n\nNelemy: \u0022Um...Dude. Am I in trouble?\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022You\u0027re gonna be when you have to explain to Thompbles what happened just now.\u0022\n\nNelemy: \u0022But...Dude. I was confused. I panicked. I...I guess I should have stunned both of you to be sure.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Stun us with what? Now you\u0027re just blithering. Come on...I still have to safe the systems on the Aragorn.\u0022\n\n![UebWpp5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UebWpp5.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Nelemy...why are you walking that way. Is your leg hurt?\u0022\n\nNelemy: \u0022Um...No, Dude. But you have to walk like this so as not to attract the sandworms.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022OK...I think you\u0027re a little frazzled. You just go over to the Base and tell Thompbles what happened. I\u0027ll be over as soon as I get the Aragorn buttoned up.\u0022\n\n![TCTlziK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TCTlziK.jpg)\n\nBelow, after Aldner re-packed the DunaDog\u0027s chutes, he tried getting in and out of the cockpit again several times to see if anything strange would happen. Nothing weird happend. But when he got back into the cockpit, the radio was blaring in there with messages from Thompbles for Aldner to turn his suit radio back on and get his butt over to the base module to explain what Nelemy was blabbering about.\n\n![KDpyJxP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KDpyJxP.jpg)\n\nBack at the Base, there were many questions and explanations and disbelief (until they checked Aldner\u0027s and Nelemy\u0027s suit cam recordings). Then there were protracted discussions with KSC. Then there was a gag order placed by the KSC on saying anything about this to the press. Then there were more meetings and contingency plans explained. Oh what a bother while I\u0027m just trying to peacefully explore Duna. But enough said about this event for now. I don\u0027t want to be violating any gag orders.\n\n**Return to the Routine**\n\nAfter a couple days\u0027 delay, it was back to the routine work for the crew. Duna wasn\u0027t going to explore itself, you know.\n\nAldner got back to the his DunaDog and raised the nose gear to put in in rover mode, then drove it over by the Fuel Station. Kurt then drove over with the Fuel Fido. The normal procedure would be for the Fuel Fido to dock to the Fuel Station to load up on propellants, then undock and move over to dock with the DunaDog to transfer the propellant to the plane. But the Fuel Fido has only four Xenon tanks, so this would require several iterations. The boys wanted to try out an alternate plan.\n\n![RDPXXUM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RDPXXUM.jpg)\n\nFirst, Kurt docked the Fuel Fido to the DunaDog, which was aligned with its rear end toward the Fuel Station. Then Kurt dragged the DunaDog along with the Fuel Fido as he docked to the Fuel Station. Voil\u00C3\u0192\u00C2 ! One big happy ship for easy transfer of propellants.\n\n![PIOKzdH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PIOKzdH.jpg)\n\nBelow, we see where I tried to use the same technique of transferring Xenon from one tank on the Fuel Station to many tanks at once on the DunaDog...but while this technique worked well when the tanks each need only a little Xenon, it turned out to be easier to select individual recipient tanks when they need lots of Xenon.\n\n![stUU99o.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/stUU99o.jpg)\n\nAfter all the tanks of the Aragorn were full, Kurt undocked from the Fuel Station and backed off. Then he undocked from the Aragorn and drove away. No planets were destroyed by annoying Claw bugs -- just remember to NEVER dock your active vehicle to the Claw of an inactive vehicle (or world-shattering KA-BOOMs can occur, as I found out on Laythe).\n\n![8ptYmFI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8ptYmFI.jpg)\n\nThe next job Kurt performed was docking to Duna Fido 2, which Adly had named \u0022Dune Buggy,\u0022 to fill up its tanks. The four FL-T100 tanks of that rover were partially depleted from the retro and landing burns. Adly and Kelby were going to test out the Fido by making a long trip to the east...and just in case they needed to hop the rover back to Base, they wanted to be sure it had full tanks.\n\n![ZvmQLBE.gif](http://i.imgur.com/ZvmQLBE.gif)\n\n![c8Izb05.gif](http://i.imgur.com/c8Izb05.gif)\n\nKurt: \u0022There you go, boys! All gassed up. Did you need me to clean your windshield?\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022No, that\u0027s fine, Kurt. But I\u0027ll certainly recommend your service station to all my friend visiting Duna. We\u0027re off!\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022See you in a week or two, Kurt.\u0022\n\n![mgI9sPs.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mgI9sPs.jpg)\n\nAdly and Kelby headed off to the east, with Kelby the geologist riding on top in the \u0022Granny Klampett chair\u0022 where he could get a better view of the surrounding terrain.\n\n![uDQmjBm.gif](http://i.imgur.com/uDQmjBm.gif)\n\nThe terrain to the east was a continuation of Kelby Planitia, the relatively flat basin where Kelby first landed on Duna long ago, and where the current mission set up their main Duna Base. So the terrain was pretty gentle for the initial test of the Duna Fido rover. It soon became apparent that the rover could safely zip along this rolling terrain at 30 m/s, and (happily for me) could easily tolerate 3X physical time warp. The way parts of the rover jerked around relative to each other when the rover hit bumps at high warp was somewhat disconcerting (which is why I decided not to cruise along at 4X), but it seemed to tolerate the warp much better than I remember my older versions of the rover doing (they used to sag quite a bit at high time warps). I suspect that this may be the result of the stronger joints we have nowadays in KSP.\n\n![qEKl7ab.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qEKl7ab.jpg)\n\nWhile Adly and Kelby were headed east, Emilynn and Hellou were driving on an expedition to the north into the Shield Wall Mountains, which Hellou had named. She was also the one who named their Duna Fido 1 rover \u0022Jessica.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Why \u0027Jessica\u0027? Not that I mind...it\u0027s a pretty name.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022I named it after Jessica Atreides, a Bene Gesserit from the *Duna* book.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022So her last name isn\u0027t Kerman?\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022No. In science fiction stories, they often use alien naming systems where not everybody has the last name Kerman.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022You sure read some weird stuff, girl. All strapped in back there?\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Yes. But please drive carefully.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Sure thing, Chickadee. I\u0027ve got precious cargo on board.\u0022\n\n![sWnYNtb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sWnYNtb.jpg)\n\nThe drive into the highlands was more challenging that the drive across the lowlands. The wheels on the Duna Fidos have less traction than the grippier ruggedized wheels, but that also makes it less prone to try to flip during braking. All the fuel onboard and the shorter wheelbase does make the Duna Fidos more susceptible to tipping than my previous Fidos, so it requires more care to drive (always slow down before braking). Because of the lower friction of the wheels, it\u0027s necessary to toggle the SAS off during turns (by holding down the \u0022F\u0022 key)...but that also makes it more liable to tip, so don\u0027t turn rapidly when moving fast.\n\nThe Jessica could tolerate 2X physical time warp on the rougher terrain (and 3X in flatter areas), but high time warps will make the rover slide downhill. This \u0027skating\u0027 effect at time warp speeds does make the rover less susceptible to tipping when brakes are applied.\n\nThe rising terrain did limit the rover\u0027s speed to around 10 m/s, and steep slopes required attacking them at an angle with a switchback maneuver (where a grippy wheel rover would be able to drive directly upslope).\n\n![II6Aued.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/II6Aued.jpg)\n\nNOTE: I\u0027m using my same Rules For Driving Rovers on my Duna mission as it did on my Laythe mission. That is to say, I expect that my kerbals are going to drive along at a safe speed, taking several days to do a drive I perform in an hour or so at high time warp and hair-raising speeds...Because I get bored driving slow at 1X, even with my trusty audiobooks to entertain me. So I will push the limits of safe driving into the insane driving regime. If I make it through a leg of the journey without incident, all is good. If I wipe out during a leg of the journey, I have to repeat it...preferably at a safe speed, because if I wipe out again when trying to be careful, it\u0027s an official occurrence in the game.\n\nAlso note that the Fido design includes a single-kerbal lander cabin that represents a space where the kerbals can stretch out one at a time and get some more comfortable sleep or wash their hair or whatever...all to make long rover expeditions less grueling.\n\nNothing hair-raising happend on the drive north...mostly because the rising terrain limited the speed of the rover. Below, we see the Jessica passing a nice hill.\n\n![dAro9Ek.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dAro9Ek.jpg)\n\nBeyond the hill, our heroines found a moderately level area at about 4100 meters elevation, 5.33 degrees north of the equator.\n\nEmilynn: \u0022We\u0027ve arrived at that level area you wanted, Chickadee.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Thanks, Emi. Jessica rover calling Duna Base. Hellou calling Thompbles.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Thompbles is busy right now. Can I help you ladies?\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Yes, please. We found a nice area at 5 degrees 21 minutes North, 42 degrees 10 minutes East. I\u0027d like you to send down a Science Lander.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Sure thing. I\u0027ll have to check the Station position, but I think I can deliver that for you in 45 minutes.\u0022\n\n![m3XVuux.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/m3XVuux.jpg)\n\nKurt remotely separated one of the Science Lander Probes from the Space Station and set it to land at the coordinates specified by Hellou. The Lander has more than enough delta-V to shift its orbital plane for a landing in the highlands near the Jessica rover.\n\n![UdfS8hV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UdfS8hV.jpg)\n\nThe Science Lander has two ROUND-8 Toroidal Fuel Tanks and one Rockomax 48-7S engine. The plane shift and retro burn was nominal, and the the probe dropped into the highlands (the target site indicated by the yellow arrow in the image below).\n\n![OceUbr4.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OceUbr4.jpg)\n\nMost of the work slowing down the probe and lowering it straight down was handled by the parachutes, so only a little thrusting was need for a gentle landing.\n\n![niA9ivX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/niA9ivX.jpg)\n\nThe Science Lander touched down 2.4 kilometers north of the Jessica, and Emilynn quickly covered that distance in the rover.\n\n![TeUBHIF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TeUBHIF.jpg)\n\nThe Map View below shows the location of the Fido 1 rover and the Science Lander (north of the Base in Kelby Planitia), and the Fido 2 rover with Adly and Kelby currently off to the east of the Base.\n\n![BwSQr3i.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BwSQr3i.jpg)\n\nHellou gathered SCIENCE from the Lander\u0027s bevy of instruments (being sure to say hello to the Goo as she had promised Nelemy she would).\n\n![wKdrYAz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wKdrYAz.jpg)\n\nEmilynn: \u0022There\u0027s still plenty of fuel left in the Lander. We can have it hopped down to the midlands so we can grab some more science from it on our way back. I\u0027ll go re-pack its parachutes.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Sounds great, Emi. Oh! Here\u0027s a beautiful rock!\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Oh? This one has a different shade of red?\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022No, no. All of these rocks aren\u0027t red. Come look. The rocks all look red because they are covered in this very fine iron oxide dust...but look what happens when I brush that off.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022It\u0027s green!\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Indeed. Those are some fantastic olivine crystals. Now where did you come from, my beauty?\u0022\n\n![RaBJvjh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RaBJvjh.jpg)\n\nThe next day, Emilynn and Hellou were ready to continue their journey. But before leaving, Emilynn wanted to watch the Lander take off for its hop south.\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Jessica rover calling Duna Base. Are you ready to hop that Lander?\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Roger, Hawk. Ready when you give me the all clear.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022OK, Jaymack. I have my Chickadee safely in her nest. Boost away.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Roger. Launching now.\u0022\n\n![LvUISrP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LvUISrP.jpg)\n\nThe fuel tanks on the Lander probe were over two thirds full, so it was easy to lob it south and tweak its trajectory to land in the relatively narrow band of midlands biome north of the Base. Things got unexpectedly exciting after the probe gentle touched down on a slope, and started to roll end over end down hill. But the rolling was pretty gentle, and didn\u0027t seem to damage the Lander. After half a dozen rolls, some judicious use of the reaction wheels brought the probe to a stop on its legs. Good enough.\n\n![UcbDVbH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UcbDVbH.jpg)\n\nEmilynn and Hellou took the Jessica a bit further north along the ground track of Aldner\u0027s DunaDog flight, but it wasn\u0027t long before the rover test was declared a success, and our heroines headed back south.\n\nIn fact, this is when the drive got more exciting (happily so for Emilynn...less so for our fretful Hellou). Going downhill, the Fido can easily reach speeds over 40 m/s if you aren\u0027t careful, and the steeper slopes require both reverse throttle and brakes applied to keep the speed in check. The rover \u0027caught some air\u0027 several times on the drive downslope, much to Emilynn\u0027s delight (she enjoys an exciting ride). This actually went quite well at 2X time warp.\n\n![8F3ST7h.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8F3ST7h.jpg)\n\nOn their way south, they stopped off at the repositioned Science Lander (where the second Goo canister had been exposed), and picked up more SCIENCE.\n\n![akmy31O.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/akmy31O.jpg)\n\nThen our heroines made the rest of the trip downhill out of the Shield Wall Mountains to Duna Base, where the boys welcomed them home with the best party ever thrown on Duna.\n\n![DN116gG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DN116gG.jpg)\n\nKelby and Adly missed the party because they were still roving east of the Base. Kelby had tried to find the location of his original landing on Duna, but couldn\u0027t seem to find any spot that looked as flat as he remembered his landing site was. They also ordered a Science Lander for delivery to a spot ahead of them so they could gather wonderful lowland biome SCIENCE.\n\n![thqzxOX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/thqzxOX.jpg)\n\n![DDqy4vL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DDqy4vL.jpg)\n\nAdly: \u0022Looks like the Science probe came down 23.2 kilometers east of us. Let\u0027s go get it.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022OK. I\u0027ll ride on top again.\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022Sounds good.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022I\u0027m getting some lousy reception of the football playoffs on my pad up here.\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022Hmm...none of the comsats is currently in optimal position...let me extend the high gain. That\u0027ll help.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022It\u0027s a shame when you can\u0027t get decent game coverage on an alien world. The engineers need to plan better for these important contingencies.\u0022\n\n![0wmroXB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0wmroXB.jpg)\n\nLuckily, the boys arrived at the Science Lander at halftime, so they were able to get in some quick science gathering before the second half.\n\n![kOLlTnh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kOLlTnh.jpg)\n\nThat\u0027s it for this episode. Next time I think we\u0027ll be doing some long distance hopping and setting up for some more distant explorations.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-20T19:21:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2016 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T11:26:42Z","Content":"Fun fact: Astronauts onboard the International Space Station claim that recycled pee coming out of their life support system tastes better than supposedly \u0022clean\u0022 water from their home faucets.

But that Probe still had most of its propellant remaining (it required about one quarter of its fuel to de-orbit and land), so while Kelby dug around in the dirt getting samples, Adly repacked the parachutes of the Probe so it could be hopped downrange.\n\n![6JpTEKH.gif](http://i.imgur.com/6JpTEKH.gif)\n\n![QjaR1hq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QjaR1hq.jpg)\n\nAdly: \u0022Dune Buggy to Duna Base. The Lander Probe is repacked and ready to hop. Kelby would like it sent to the midlands area straight east of us, if it can go that far.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022I\u0027ll see what I can do for you.\u0022\n\nIn the real world, of course, NASA would insist that their astronauts move back to a very safe distance before launching a rocket...but kerbals like an up-close view of the fun:\n\n![02LSLcI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/02LSLcI.jpg)\n\n![MqxSsRo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MqxSsRo.jpg)\n\nBelow, the Map view (with biomes visible) shows that the hop almost went too long...but the landing point moved back a bit due to aerodynamic drag.\n\n![s06sPQQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/s06sPQQ.jpg)\n\nOoops...I forgot to add an action group to the lander probes for deploying the parachutes, so I had to do that with right-clicks.\n\n![5uevwkB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5uevwkB.jpg)\n\nA little fuel was held in reserve for the final braking under the parachutes, and the probe landed safely. But did it drop into the Midlands, or overshoot into the Lowlands? Well...oddly enough, when the second Goo canister was activated, it reported that the probe was in the HIGHLANDS biome...that can\u0027t be right. The Midlands should be next to the Lowlands.\n\n![cXqO0hi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cXqO0hi.jpg)\n\nAdly and Kelby started the 27.1 km drive to the lander probe\u0027s new location. But when they drove up onto a small mountain in their path, they went from Lowland biome (the blue) directly into Highland biome (the cyan area on the map). So something is definitely wrong here.\n\n![Mwzpp5y.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Mwzpp5y.jpg)\n\n![AKhieiU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AKhieiU.jpg)\n\nWhen the *Dune Buggy* drove into the green area on the map, the program reported that they were in the Midlands biome. When Hellou and Emilynn explored to the north of Duna Base, the green Midlands came first, and then the cyan Highlands. So it appears that somebody has mislabeled the biomes in the area Adly and Kelby were exploring. SQUAD, you might want to fix this.\n\n![cbvbWR8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cbvbWR8.jpg)\n\nThe guys reached the lander probe for the second time without incident (they were also reporting the location as Highlands when it should be Midlands), and gathered more SCIENCE from it.\n\n![6cfS7Np.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6cfS7Np.jpg)\n\nContinuing eastward, the drop in elevation allowed the rover to get up to speeds near 40 m/s, allowing it to catch some air as it went over bumps...but nothing the rover couldn\u0027t handle. When they reached the next Lowland area that stretched on for hundreds of kilometers ahead, Kelby named it Adly Planitia after his fellow explorer.\n\n![64boJj7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/64boJj7.jpg)\n\nI\u0027m sure the guys stopped often so that Kelby could explore the surface in detail.\n\nAdly: \u0022So, are you finding anything interesting in the big stretch of sand dunes you named after me?\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022It\u0027s a lot like what we found back at the Duna Base area. Under the sand is mudstone and sandstone. These planitia are dried up seabeds.\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022Any fish fossils?\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022No...but, there is an outcrop of what looks like shale over here. Drive the rover over this way so I can use the lab module\u0027s core sampler.\u0022\n\n![watNSMz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/watNSMz.jpg)\n\nHeading ever further east, Kelby analyzed his rock samples in the lab/hab cabin while Adly drove (but at a more sedate pace that you see me driving the rover along in the GIF below)...\n\nKelby: \u0022Well, we have hit the jackpot.\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022There\u0027s gold in them thar hills?\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022No. Better. That ice from the bottom of the last core sample...it\u0027s kethane clathrate.\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022Tasty?\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022No, but it\u0027s one-stop shopping for your rocket propellant needs. You can release the simple hydrokarbon that\u0027s trapped in the ice crystal structure by melting the ice, and liquify the it for use as a propellant. And then you can electrolyze the water to get LOX. And the Hydrogen can be used to make even more kethane using a process invented by Sabatier Kerman.\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022Very nice. I *do* get all the mineral rights for this basin because you named it after me...right?\u0022\n\n![LTiHscL.gif](http://i.imgur.com/LTiHscL.gif)\n\nWhen I last drove over this area of Duna using the unmanned Fido KED rover to circumnavigate Duna (back when we first got rover wheels in version 0.19), the terrain here was perfectly flat...and I could let the rover drive along unattended by placing a weight to constantly press down the \u0022i\u0022 key (I remap the rover controls to the i,j,k,l keys). After the makeover Duna received, this area is now rolling sand dunes...but I could still let the rover drive along unattended (this time with the help of MechJeb\u0027s Rover Autopilot to maintain the speed) without worrying that it would go too fast and wipe out. So, rather than send Adly and Kelby back to base, I decided to send them all the way across Adly Planitia to see how the far edge looked (previously it was an impressively steep wall).\n\nOver in the eastern part of Adly Planitia (see map below), the boys camped out for a couple days to watch Ike set and rise. Ike is tidally locked to Duna (and vice versa), but because of its slightly elliptical orbit, Ike shifts back and forth about 8 degrees during the Duna day. In the image below, you can see the sun coming out from behind Ike just before sunset...and then during the night, Ike dipped below the horizon...and then Ike rose back into the sky after dawn.\n\n![nHUXqCR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nHUXqCR.jpg)\n\n![CIrcDkR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CIrcDkR.jpg)\n\nThe steep incline that used to mark the eastern edge of Adly Planitia is long gone. Now the terrain just gradually gets hillier as you head eastward up out of the Lowlands. At least the transition from Lowlands to Midlands to Highlands happens in the correct order here. Unexpected note: If you have the display of biomes turned on in Map view, then Ike shows up in Duna\u0027s sky all covered in colorful biome colors (so I had to keep turning off biome display when I wanted to take a regular picture with Ike in the sky).\n\n![j9Vc5Ex.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/j9Vc5Ex.jpg)\n\nDriving up into the Midlands allowed our heros to see Ike again (it had slipped below the horizon from the lower elevations at the eastern edge of Adly Planitia). Also, the bumpier terrain made it easier to catch some air when driving fast (but the increasing slope made it harder to drive fast).\n\n![RENTC03.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RENTC03.jpg)\n\n![UL7reB3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UL7reB3.jpg)\n\nEventually, the terrain got even steeper as the Fido rover transitioned into the Highlands. The slope was steep enough to slow the Fido down to a crawl...but not so steep that it was necessary to drive back and forth in a switchback path. A rover equipped with the grippier wheels would zoom right up the slope, of course.\n\n![xGFMGJp.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xGFMGJp.jpg)\n\n![2gq3AqQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2gq3AqQ.jpg)\n\nAdly: \u0022Dune Buggy calling Duna Base.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022This is Duna Base. How goes your uphill climb?\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022We\u0027re doing fine. Kelby has some different kinds of rocks to look at, apparently. He\u0027s going on and on about \u0027igneous this\u0027 and \u0027plutonic that\u0027. He\u0027s happy as a clam.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Glad to hear it. Are you going to start driving back?\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022Well, that\u0027s why I\u0027m calling. Rather than driving back along that same route, how about we bump up the schedule for setting up the East base? I\u0027m sure Kelby will be happy to mess around in these highlands while you drop in the ships, and then we can hop to there from here.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Sounds fine to me. I\u0027ll get working on delivering your equipment right away...but it\u0027s going to take a few days waiting for the orbit alignments.\u0022\n\nThe map view below (switching between regular and biome view) shows the location of the Fido rover in the highlands.\n\n![88DY9DA.gif](http://i.imgur.com/88DY9DA.gif)\n\nEast base will be an exploration outpost set up in Fido Canyon, named for the landing spot of the unmanned Fido KED rover that long ago circumnavigated Duna. Setting up the base involved sending in a Lander (so the guys have somewhere more comfortable to live than the Fido rover), and a Fuel Station and Fuel Fido (to re-fuel ships). Those assets were sitting up in polar orbit (so that they could be dropped anywhere on Duna).\n\nThe first step was to separate the Duna Fido 3 rover from the BANT 6 ship. This rover would be left in polar orbit so it can be sent down to the surface as needed in the future. Removing the rover freed up the Duna Lander 3 vehicle, which was separated and moved away from the BANT under remote control.\n\n![gVM5tkN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gVM5tkN.jpg)\n\n![xAk6pKx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xAk6pKx.jpg)\n\nThen there was the wait until the landing site moved under the Lander\u0027s polar orbit. This would be a lot less boring if SQUAD would allow faster time warps in lower orbits. As is, I switched to one of the comsats and ran time forward, then switched back to the Lander as the landing site was nearing its orbital plane. Then came the retro fire, entry (no flames), and parachute assisted landing. Sorry...the alignment of the orbits required landings shortly before sunset, so the pictures aren\u0027t as good as one might like.\n\n![HZpHXWh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HZpHXWh.jpg)\n\nThe Lander touched down about 850 meters from the old Fido KED and its lander. OK...comfy living facilities were in place!\n\n![VYv7R2t.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/VYv7R2t.jpg)\n\nThe next asset came from the BANT 4 \u0026 5 ship, which is in a higher polar orbit. The idea was that the higher polar orbit (with its lower orbital velocity) would require a smaller plane shift burn to put the payload on target...but it also means that the orbital period is longer, so the chances are lower that you\u0027ll get a close alignment as the target site passes below the orbit (since the ship may not be close to the retro fire position when the base is passing under its orbit). But the alignments weren\u0027t bad. Below, we see the Fuel Station 2 separating from the double-BANT.\n\n![kROoWRk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kROoWRk.jpg)\n\nAfter waiting for the orbital plane to align with the target site, the four Rockomax 24-77 engines performed the retro burn and small plane shift needed to target the Fuel Station in to the site (you can see that the trajectory is leading the site so that Duna\u0027s rotation will carry the site under the trajectory just as the ship lands).\n\n![dTvxtuM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dTvxtuM.jpg)\n\nFor the first time in all my Duna aerocapturing, aerobraking, and entry maneuvers for this mission, we get to see entry flames as the Fuel Station falls in from its higher orbit. The eight parachutes and the four 24-77 engines landed the heavy tank onto the surface of Duna. The Fuel Station landed a little over a kilometer from Lander 3.\n\n![FQaNQI1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FQaNQI1.jpg)\n\nThe next asset dropped was Fuel Fido 2 to work in conjunction with the Fuel Station. Below we see the Fuel Fido separating from the double-BANT. (If you forgot what \u0027BANT\u0027 stands for, it\u0027s \u0022Big Advanced Nuclear Tug\u0022...just so you don\u0027t have to go back and look.) Then there was another wait for the landing site to align with the orbit. Each of these landings had to be made a day apart because only one ship could be taken care of during each landing window. The place where the landing site passes under the orbit on the other side of the planet is in darkness, so I didn\u0027t want to use that location...because the \u0027automatic landing radar\u0027 that determines when to fire the landing rockets consists of my eyeballs watching the screen, and most of these payloads don\u0027t have landing lights (to save on part count), so landing in darkness is contraindicated.\n\n![0TQ5m3W.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0TQ5m3W.jpg)\n\nThe little FL-T100 tank on top of the Fuel Fido is there as a spacer in the payload stack...but the vehicle was sent down with that tank full so that after retro burn, the fuel from the FL-T100 tank could be moved to replace some of the fuel used for the retro burn. Then the small tank was jettisoned (to smash onto the surface).\n\n![cF8apQs.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cF8apQs.jpg)\n\nThe six parachutes and two Rockomax 48-7S engines on the Fuel Fido set the vehicle down 528 meters from the Fuel Station, a little over a kilometer from Lander 3, and about 1.5 kilometers from the old Fido KED. OK! The infrastructure for Fido Canyon base was in place and ready for the exploration crew.\n\n![hCRiZns.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/hCRiZns.jpg)\n\n![nHvMLRk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nHvMLRk.jpg)\n\nIt was time to hop the *Dune Buggy* rover over to Fido Canyon. When fully fueled, the Duna Fido rovers can hop 11 degrees around Duna using half their fuel (counting the little extra it takes to soft-land under the parachutes). So, a Duna Fido could hop 11 degrees from base, and later hop 11 degrees back to base, and be refueled. But a fully-fueled Duna Fido can also reach Duna orbit...so if you want to use over half the fuel, it can be hopped to ANY point on Duna from any starting point. And if you have fuel for the rover waiting at the new landing site, the rover can later hop elsewhere. Part of reason for setting up the outpost bases is to position fuel reserves around Duna for making hops.\n\nThe hop from the Highlands east of Aldy Planitia to the Fido Canyon base required 68.6% of the *Dune Buggy\u0027s* fuel. The hop trajectory (shown below) took about 13 minutes from boost to landing.\n\n![LChNBsh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LChNBsh.jpg)\n\n![KtTDMEC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KtTDMEC.jpg)\n\nBelow, the *Dune Buggy* heading in toward Fido Canyon. The landing used parachutes and the rover\u0027s two 48-7S engines. The boys look a tad worried there, but that\u0027s just because they were coming in about 5 km short. But, hey, it\u0027s a rover; it can drive the rest of the way.\n\n![dDlJGSs.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dDlJGSs.jpg)\n\n![IOGON93.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IOGON93.jpg)\n\nAdly repacked the *Dune Buggy\u0027s* parachutes, and then they headed over to the other vehicles, with Kelby riding on top to get a better view of the terrain.\n\nKelby: \u0022Do you want to go directly to the Lander?\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022The old Fido KED is on the way...let\u0027s stop a check that out first.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022Sounds good.\u0022\n\n![jKdW7tQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jKdW7tQ.jpg)\n\nAdly: \u0022Hey, the old rover looks like it\u0027s in pretty good shape. I thought it would be buried in dust.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022Apparently the winds are occasionally strong enough to blow the dust off of it. I\u0027ll fly over and check out the rover and its lander.\u0022\n\n![aXZdzD0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/aXZdzD0.jpg)\n\nKelby: \u0022This old lander still has lots of fuel on board. Jeb\u0027s Junkyard makes some really great tanks. Ah...and almost a full RCS tank.\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022I have no need for the monopropellant, but remind me to drive the Fuel Fido over later and steal the fuel.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022Our rover looks kind of stubby compared the old KED. I\u0027ll check out the KED next.\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022Yeah, the longer wheel base would be nice. I guess that was more important when they had to be sure the rover was stable enough to make it all the way around Duna and back to its starting point.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022Hey...there\u0027s something in the cockpit. Ah...it\u0027s a big bag of stuff strapped into the pilot\u0027s seat. I guess it was to represent the weight of a kerbal. Let me get it unbuckled. Ah, ha! Snacks and survival gear.\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022Bring it on over.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022OK. The KED\u0027s readouts are all green...I\u0027ll drive it over to the Lander and see how it performs.\u0022\n\nSeveral minutes later, the boys had both of the rovers over by the Duna Lander 3, and they were able to move in, stretch out, and party away on ancient discontinued snack items.\n\n![1g7zuaz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1g7zuaz.jpg)\n\nThe next day, Kelby wanted to dig around in the dirt, but Adly convinced him drive over to the Fuel Fido first so that Adly could check it out. All systems on the Fuel Fido were fine, so Adly used it to refuel the *Dune Buggy*.\n\n![h59dsGf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/h59dsGf.jpg)\n\nThen, while Kelby took the *Dune Buggy* to go hunting for interesting rocks, Adly drove the Fuel Fido over to the the Fuel Station to fill up the Fuel Fido\u0027s tanks. Then he drove the Fuel Fido over to Lander 3 to top off the Lander\u0027s tanks.\n\n![ovPLsoG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ovPLsoG.jpg)\n\n![AUZSyYU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AUZSyYU.jpg)\n\nAfter that, Adly drove the Fuel Fido over to the old Fido KED lander and grabbed its remaining fuel and oxidizer. Waste not, want not.\n\n![0vVu7gQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0vVu7gQ.jpg)\n\nLater, back at Lander 3:\n\nAdly: \u0022Did you have fun poking the rocks?\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022Yes. The center part of this valley is full of sediments, but there appear to be some very interesting outcrops of rock up on hillsides, possibly even some karbonate rocks.\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022These karbonate rocks are good, are they?\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022Well, one theory for why Duna has such a thin atmosphere is because of karbonate rock formation back when the planet still had liquid water. So finding a lot of those rocks could verify that theory. But I don\u0027t want to go blindly looking around on the hillsides...so I\u0027d like to call in one of the DunaDogs to make some scanning flights.\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022OK. I\u0027ll get Thompbles on the horn and requisition one of the birds.\u0022\n\n![UQrS3rA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UQrS3rA.jpg)\n\nBack at Duna Base, everybody was getting into the spirit of the \u0027Early Deployment\u0027 of the exploration outposts. Partly this was due to the possibility of more exciting terrain to explore (the Duna Base site was chosen to be a safe equatorial location...but it\u0027s rather geologically unexciting). But partly it was because the only pulses at pi gigahertz that had been picked up from possible alien artifacts were coming from the hemisphere to the West of Duna Base. The pulses were weak, and only picked up about once a day by the low polar orbit ships...so it was going to take a while to get a good fix on any of them.\n\nEmilynn said she\u0027d prefer to be the DunaDog pilot for the soon-to-be-set-up West base, so it was Aldner who was sent East to Fido Canyon. He got ready to leave the next morning.\n\n![t4Y6b5G.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/t4Y6b5G.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Hey there, Little Buddy. I\u0027m off to seek my fortune in the mysterious East.\u0022\n\nNelemy: \u0022Um...Dude. How do I know you are really you?\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022What?\u0022\n\nNelemy: \u0022How do I know you aren\u0027t some kind of alien projection trying to trick me?\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Well...I don\u0027t keep telling you how many questions you have left each time you ask a silly question.\u0022\n\nNelemy: \u0022Oh! Right! That\u0027s smart thinking, Dude.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022That\u0027s why I get paid the big bucks. Well, gotta go. You take care of everyone around here while I\u0027m gone.\u0022\n\nNelemy: \u0022Oh, I will. Say hi to the Fido Canyon Goo for me, Dude.\u0022\n\n![2v56QYi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2v56QYi.jpg)\n\nThe thing about flying an ion-powered plane is you have to always keep in mind the sun\u0027s position in the sky. And if you want to make a LONG flight, you have to consider where the sun will be during the whole flight. This is especially true if you are flying East, against the direction of the sun\u0027s motion in the sky, since this will shorten the amount of daylight available to you.\n\nDuna Base, for reasons of lowland flatness and cosmic significance, is located at *42* degrees East longitude. Fido Canyon base is located 111 degrees east of there at 153\u00B0E longitude. So Aldner would need to takeoff when the sun was fairly low in the east from Duna Base, and hopefully land before the sun gets too low in the west from Fido Canyon. Aldner\u0027s flight north showed that the DunaDog will operate, if somewhat touch-and-go, with the sun 28 degrees above the horizon ahead of the plane. So he decided to take off from main base with the sun up 30 degrees above the east horizon:\n\n![MXyohE0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MXyohE0.jpg)\n\nThe initial climb out from Duna Base put the solar panels of the *Aragorn* at zero sun exposure, so Aldner made that climb on rocket power alone (no ion engines) until he passed 6,300 meters, two minutes into the flight. Then he switched over to ion power and pitched down.\n\n![dKdgzcE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dKdgzcE.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022The four ion engines are good...but they\u0027re sucking down the battery charge too fast, even at 43% sun exposure. I\u0027m cutting back to half throttle.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Roger, Buzz. Keep talking...I\u0027m taking notes for my flight.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Hmm...If the battery charge drops too fast, I can pitch down a little to get enough sun exposure to stop that...but then I\u0027m losing altitude. Pitch up to decrease the drop...but then the battery charge drops. OK...looks like I can keep things fairly steady at around forty-six thousand...no...I\u0027m still slowly losing altitude.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Remember, you have a few bumps in the terrain out in front of you at thirty-two hundred meters.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Yeah. But I have a lock on lander probe 2 to show me where those are.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Hellou wants you to verify that the scanners are all on and functioning.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022They are. Doesn\u0027t she trust her software hack that automatically turns them on whenever the DunaDog is airborne?\u0022\n\n![TcU9Wiz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TcU9Wiz.jpg)\n\n\\* 10 minutes into the flight \\*\n\nAldner: \u0022I\u0027m getting a better sun angle, so it\u0027s easier to keep a charge on the batteries. I\u0027m bumping the throttle up to two-thirds.\u0022\n\n\\* 20 minutes into the flight \\*\n\nAldner: \u0022This is better. I\u0027m at full throttle, and I can still keep climbing...if I pitch down occasionally to charge the batteries.\u0022\n\n\\* 28 minutes into the flight \\*\n\nAldner: \u0022OK! Home free. Full throttle, and I can keep the batteries fully charged even when climbing slowly. Looks like the excitement is over now. Maybe I should take a nap.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022I can fly your plane remotely if you need some shut eye.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Thanks, Hawk...but we better not. I don\u0027t want Thompbles docking my flight pay for slacking off.\u0022\n\n![tnU166A.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tnU166A.jpg)\n\nSo the flight settled down into the tedious stretch. Below we can see Aldner at about the halfway point, with comfortably over half of his Xenon left (and 70% of his LFO), so there weren\u0027t any worries about making it to his target. You might be a bit concerned that the sun will be pretty low in the west when he gets over to Fido Canyon...but remember that the sun will be behind him, giving excellent sun exposure on the top of his wings when the plane is in its normal pitched-up attitude...so no wories.\n\n![DMcLZ7X.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DMcLZ7X.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022I\u0027ve passed out of Adly Planitia and I\u0027m over the highlands. The ground is a lot closer and more interesting here.\u0022\n\n![aLuD5GY.gif](http://i.imgur.com/aLuD5GY.gif)\n\nAldner: \u0022The ground is getting a bit TOO interesting up ahead. What\u0027s the highest elevations along my path again?\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022Assuming you\u0027re on course, there should be a crater rim with elevations of 6.6 kilometers.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Ah, yes. I think I\u0027ll use some rocket boost here.\u0022\n\n![3hWrQQn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3hWrQQn.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Hey, that *is* some impressive terrain. Nice crater wall. Ooops...I think I overdid the boost a bit. Rocket engine off.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022How is your LFO level?\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022At sixty-six percent. I\u0027m heading up through a cloud bank. Yeah, I goosed her a bit much...I\u0027m over nine thousand meters altitude. But it looks like the plane isn\u0027t going to be able to cruise at this altitude...dropping back down again.\u0022\n\n![Buf9Vbn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Buf9Vbn.jpg)\n\nWhen Aldner approached Fido Valley, he had to climb again (more gradually, just using the ion engines) to above 6,500 meters to clear the western wall of the valley. The sunlight angle on the valley floor was fairly low, but the sun exposure on the solar cells was still excellent (since the top of the wings were angled toward the sun), so the batteries were staying fully charged.\n\n![w9tOVCu.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/w9tOVCu.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022This is Aragorn Airlines flight zero zero two calling Fido Canyon tower. Requesting clearence for landing on runway zero nine.\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022Hey there, Aldner. We haven\u0027t actually constructed the runway yet, but you have permission to land...as long as it\u0027s not on top of us.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Roger, Fido Canyon tower. I\u0027ll see what I can manage.\u0022\n\nAldner cut the ion engines 19 km from the outpost (you\u0027ll notice that the throttle setting is still at 100% -- the ion engines were just toggled off). After passing over the Lander, the Aragorn was still at 4,600 meters (having only recently cleared the wall of the valley), so Aldner pitched up and toggled on the belly engine. When the speed dropped to 100 m/s, he deployed the chutes (which were reefed at that altitude), and descended.\n\n![EucwEWH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EucwEWH.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Annnnd... touchdown! Just to make you guys feel safe, I landed thirteen kilometers away. Yeah...I meant to do that. Let\u0027s see... Flight time: One hour and five minutes. Thirty-one percent of my Xenon remaining, and fifty-seven percent of my LFO.\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022Not bad. Drive on over and we\u0027ll sell you some fuel.\u0022\n\n![gAb1plq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gAb1plq.jpg)\n\nAldner put the Aragorn into rover mode and drove over to the other ships. Then before doing anything else, he repacked the DunaDog\u0027s parachutes.\n\n![Dyx3KcS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Dyx3KcS.jpg)\n\n![rhfvVG2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rhfvVG2.jpg)\n\nAdly docked the Fuel Fido to the rear of the Aragorn, and then dragged it over to the Fuel Station so that the Xenon and Liquid Fuel/Oxidizer tanks could be filled up. Then they returned to the Lander and had a party in honor of the new Fido Canyon base, treating Aldner to some suspiciously old snacks.\n\n![pdj4JST.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pdj4JST.jpg)\n\nBelow: A picture of the Fido Canyon base the next day when the lighting was better.\n\n![RollmBf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RollmBf.jpg)\n\nThat worked out well. So it was time to do it again...only out West. With some differences. Step one: Drop in Fuel Station 3 from the polar-orbiting double-BANT.\n\n![T1X9gxq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/T1X9gxq.jpg)\n\nAgain, the target location was a canyon (for the easy access to interesting terrain) with a low elevation (to make landing easier) at about 60\u00B0W longitude. This puts it 102 degrees of longitude away from the main Duna Base. Hellou chose the name for the site: Barsoom Canyon.\n\n![2s1zzF2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2s1zzF2.jpg)\n\nThe landing had to be made late in the day at the landing site, but at least this gave a nice view of Ike low over the eastern horizon.\n\n![dzCAPNZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dzCAPNZ.jpg)\n\nEvery Fuel Station needs a handy Fuel Fido, so that was dropped in from polar orbit the next evening. Again, the small FL-T100 tank on the top of the rover was mainly there as a spacer in the payload stack, but after retro burn the fuel from that tank was transferred to the rover\u0027s tanks, and then the small tank was jettisoned and allowed to to head in for a crash landing.\n\n![AumWZpD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AumWZpD.jpg)\n\nThe Fuel Fido touched down 882 meters from the Fuel Station.\n\n![lMiEKWq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lMiEKWq.jpg)\n\nBut now for something a little different. Hopping the Duna Lander 2 hab/lab and the Duna Fido rover *Jessica* over to Barsoom Canyon would require most of the fuel available in the Barsoom Valley Fuel Station to refuel them. This would be a waste of the limited fuel assets on the surface, considering that there are much larger supplies of fuel available...in orbit! So the hopping of those vehicles were made via Duna Space Station.\n\nNelemy Kerman was assigned the job of moving the *Jessica* to Barsoom Canyon. The *Jessica* had its fuel tanks topped off earlier, since it will require a full fuel load to make it up to the station (with a safety margin). Nelemy flew over to the rover, got inside, checked the systems, and boosted for SPAAAAAAAAACE!\n\n![sOjXcKp.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sOjXcKp.jpg)\n\n![n6CnGDI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/n6CnGDI.jpg)\n\nThe *Jessica* made it to orbit with 12% of its fuel remaining...plenty to do a rendezvous with the Station.\n\n![NGcCXiL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NGcCXiL.jpg)\n\nDocking with the Space Station was routine. The rover only has a Junior docking port, so Nelemy docked it to a Junior port on one of the BANTs. There are also Junior docking ports on the large tanks that the BANTs will leave behind when they depart from the Station...but the Junior port out on the end of the BANT was handiest here. Refueling the *Jessica\u0027s* two FL-T200 and four FL-T100 tanks was a drop in the bucket compared to the fuel reserves available on the Station.\n\n![7U01lew.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7U01lew.jpg)\n\nIt was Kurt\u0027s job to pilot the Duna Lander 2 up to the Space Station with Hellou onboard. The tanks of this Lander had NOT been topped off on the surface. The Duna Landers have plenty of fuel to deorbit and land on the surface of Duna, and then re-boost back to orbit with a big safety margin. Topping off its tanks would have meant just carrying extra fuel back up into space (and wasting fuel in the process of lifting it).\n\nKurt: \u0022You all strapped in down there, Hellou?\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Yes, Kurt. Let\u0027s go visit exciting places!\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Well, first we have to go visit Nelemy up at the Space Station...but then we\u0027ll go to new places.\u0022\n\n![DENUko1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DENUko1.jpg)\n\nRendezvous and docking with the Space Station went as planned. They would be spending a few days on the Station while Kurt made some modifications to the radio hardware so that it could be better used to track down transmissions at pi gigahertz.\n\nNelemy: \u0022Hey, Dudes! Welcome to the Space Station.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Hi, Nelemy. What have you been doing up here?\u0022\n\nNelemy: \u0022Checking through the snack inventory. Why don\u0027t we have any proper yellow mush onboard? It\u0027s all kind of greenish-yellow this mission. I like the nice yellow stuff we had on Laythe.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Oh...I think they had to add some supplements to it for health reasons.\u0022\n\n![uFp88tu.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uFp88tu.jpg)\n\nThe Lander made it to the Station with its tanks over 27% full. Kurt took care of refueling the Lander. (I know that the Lander is a bit overkill in its capacity, but when I designed it I wanted it to have a good chance of still working after the threatened version 1.0 engine nerfings.)\n\n![PvawjfC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PvawjfC.jpg)\n\nWhen it came time to return to Duna, the landings were able to be made in full daylight and close together (since the Station is in an equatorial orbit). Below, Nelemy separated the *Jessica* rover and landed it at Barsoom Canyon, pretty close to the Fuel Station there.\n\n![MNP2Faj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MNP2Faj.jpg)\n\n![Vt3s7mB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Vt3s7mB.jpg)\n\nOn the next orbit, Kurt and Hellou separated Duna Lander 2 from the Space Station and landed it at Barsoom Canyon.\n\n![yAUGFg6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yAUGFg6.jpg)\n\n![w4AcrY9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/w4AcrY9.jpg)\n\n![0gtYGdD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0gtYGdD.jpg)\n\nBelow: Kurt\u0027s view out of the Lander window after touchdown.\n\n![972YXGM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/972YXGM.jpg)\n\nAfter landing, Kurt climbed out to repack the parachutes of the Lander. You can also see how much fuel was used for retro fire and landing (less than 8% of the total amount of LFO on board). Kurt also reminded Nelemy to repack the parachutes on his rover.\n\n![OCSrunf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OCSrunf.jpg)\n\n![B4PTLA1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/B4PTLA1.jpg)\n\nThe final member of the Barsoom Canyon exploration team was Emilynn Kerman. She would fly out in her DunaDog, which she named *Amelia* after Amelia Kerman, one of the first female aviators.\n\n![BtzvQMw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BtzvQMw.jpg)\n\nFlying west from Duna Base has a complicating factor that Aldner\u0027s flight east did not: Ike. It is necessary to wait until AFTER the daily solar eclipse before starting out (because a solar eclipse happening when your ion-powered plane is in the air is a BAD thing)...but if you wait too long, you\u0027ll have illumination problems. So Emilynn was sitting in her plane, ready to go as soon as the sun came out from behind Ike.\n\n![BaQEPhu.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BaQEPhu.jpg)\n\nBelow, Emilynn taking off on rocket power, heading west.\n\n![9qn6lxI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9qn6lxI.jpg)\n\nAt 4,700 meters, she switched from rocket power to the ion engines, then started leveling off. The batteries were draining a bit fast, so she used another 10-second burst of rocket power to help the plane stay level at 5,300 meters. The sun angle must have been better for this flight than for Aldner\u0027s, because Emilynn didn\u0027t need to reduce the throttle on the ion engines at any point.\n\n![lZ2d0Xe.gif](http://i.imgur.com/lZ2d0Xe.gif)\n\nMost of Emilynn\u0027s flight west was over lowlands and midlands with a maximum elevation of 3,600 meters. After passing over the midlands, the view of a canyon running down from the northeast into the lowlands was interesting.\n\n![91R0Z6m.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/91R0Z6m.jpg)\n\n![rkiJtoa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rkiJtoa.jpg)\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Amelia calling Barsoom Base. I\u0027m approaching the highlands that border the north side of your canyon.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Be careful, Emi. Some of that terrain is at six-point-three kilometers.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Roger, Chickadee. I\u0027ve been gaining altitude slowly to be sure I don\u0027t try to fly through the really hard stuff, but I\u0027ll get low enough to get a good look at it. The scanners are all running.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Thank you.\u0022\n\n![bqopI61.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bqopI61.jpg)\n\n![iU2jg6v.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/iU2jg6v.jpg)\n\nEmilynn: \u0022There\u0027s a peak off to my left, but hills ahead have a more gentle rise. My navicomp has a lock on your Lander\u0027s longwave beacon.\u0022\n\n![x1NefOb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/x1NefOb.jpg)\n\nEmilynn: \u0022OK, I\u0027m passing over the highest part of the ridge. Radar altimeter reads two hundred thirty. Hmmm...Looks like a lot of red stuff...big surprise. Hopefully the recordings will tell you more than that. I should be landing in ten minutes.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Roger, Hawk. We\u0027ll roll out the red carpet for you.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Thankie, Jaymack. Not that I\u0027ll be able to see it.\u0022\n\n![vcWBOQA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vcWBOQA.jpg)\n\nEmilynn passed over into the Barsoom Valley and cut the ion engines 28 kilometers away from the base. There were some higher mountains to the north that looked interesting, but there wasn\u0027t a lot of time for sightseeing just then: She needed to lose altitude. Aldner had a long west-to-east shot when landing at Fido Canyon, but Emilynn could not afford to overshoot by as far as he did because Barsoom Canyon is narrower and runs northwest-southeast.\n\n![mWnHYtV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mWnHYtV.jpg)\n\nAt an altitude of just under 1,500 meters AGL, still about 1.8 km from the base site, Emilynn deployed the parachutes.\n\n![S0hgjRg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/S0hgjRg.jpg)\n\nEmilynn overshot the base by 5 km and touched down on a moderate slope. The DunaDog started rolling backwards, but she used a short blast from the rear rocket engine to stop its motion and applied the brakes.\n\n![Z2uLUcM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Z2uLUcM.jpg)\n\nEmilynn: \u0022The *Amelia* has landed safely, boys and girls. Flight time fifty-six minutes. Xenon remaining...a little under thirty-four percent. Liquid fuel remaining...over sixty-four percent. I think it might be more efficient to use up more liquid fuel early on so that the ions are more efficient pushing a lighter plane.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Yes...but then you\u0027d be really sad if you came across some big mountains in front of you and didn\u0027t have the fuel to spare to boost over them.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022True. I\u0027ve got her in rover mode and I\u0027m heading over to you. Say, you have a nice view of Ike from here.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022We knew you were coming, so we put up decorations.\u0022\n\nTen minutes later, Emilynn rolled the *Amelia* into camp.\n\n![Ht1qg7F.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Ht1qg7F.jpg)\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Nice digs you\u0027ve got here. Where\u0027s the Fuel Fido? Amelia is a might thirsty.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022We left it over where it landed so you\u0027d have fewer targets to hit, just in case you decided to drop in for a pinpoint landing. I\u0027m remotely driving it over here now. But we can wait to fuel up your plane until tomorrow...Nelemy has your welcome party all ready.\u0022\n\nEmilynn: \u0022Well, that\u0027s great...since I\u0027m a might thirsty myself.\u0022\n\n![LjBnSU3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LjBnSU3.jpg)\n\nSo while the kerbals are having the biggest party ever thrown in Barsoom Canyon, let\u0027s have a look at their location on the map view below. The Barsoom Base ship icons are the only icons visible on this side of Duna. All of the others (the main Duna Base, with Thompbles left minding the store alone for now), the Fido Canyon base (147\u00B0 away if you continue west...I wonder if a DunaDog could fly that far?), and the ancient FidoPup RCS rover.\n\n![VjeZQY6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/VjeZQY6.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-20T19:28:04Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2016 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro**"},{"CreatedByName":"macdjord","CreatedById":5630,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T07:18:43Z","Content":"@Brotoro: The incorrect biome readout is probably because you were right on the edge of two biomes. If I understand correctly, the biome map you\u0027re looking at there doesn\u0027t just *label* the biomes, it *defines* them: when the game needs to determine what biome you are in, it looks at that map (or rather the .gif from which that map is generated), finds your current coordinates, and checks what colour that point is. However, the .gif has a finite resolution; if you\u0027re right at the boundary between two biomes, the game ends up picking up both adjacent pixels and averaging them, and sometimes the average colour ends up being neither of the two biomes in question."}]}
