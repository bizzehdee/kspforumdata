But first, a couple of the tugs in Duna orbit needed to be docked to Duna Space Station. During the Laythe mission, it was generally Thompbles who took care of the thankless tasks of remotely piloting ships in orbit...and so it shall be on the Duna mission as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe BANT D1 Tug that had carried the Base, a Fuel Fido, and a Fuel Station to Duna, had only its rack of four Small Science Lander probes left attached. It also had a lot of propellant remaining, and that would be added to the stores at Duna Space Station. A relatively small burn put the BANT into an elliptical phasing orbit. After a seven orbits of waiting, tiny burn at periapsis and apoapsis targeted the intercept with Duna Station, and a final burn matched velocity with the Station to complete the rendezvous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Q70Jthk.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q70Jthk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt Duna Space Station, the BANT D1 was backed in to dock with one of the Senior docking ports in the lower tier of ports. The rear Kerbodyne S3-7200 Tank of the BANT would become part of the Space Station after the Tug later returns to Kerbin, increasing the fuel storage capacity of the station and extending the docking port further from the Station axis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RmoGUMq.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RmoGUMq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: I generally don\u0027t go in for mods with lots of parts, but I do like several mods that add or improve some visual or user interface features. One of these is the Lazor Docking Cam mod. This makes docking more fun (none of that constant shifting around of your viewpoint to make sure everything is lined up). Plus I can\u0027t imagine my kerbals being able to do a lot of the remote piloting of ships that I have them do without having some cameras onboard to help them see what they are doing. I hope SQUAD adds small external cameras and docking port cameras to the list of KSP features in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other tug that had completed its payload delivery mission was the SP Tug A double tug that had delivered the two DunaDog aircraft. Three of its Rockomax X200-32 Fuel Tanks were still full (as well as the nacelle tanks), and that propellant would be added to the Space Station as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HFry2UB.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HFry2UB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, another S3-7200 Tank will be added to complete the symmetry of the Station (the other BANT tugs are in polar orbit, so they won\u0027t be added to the equatorially-orbiting Space Station). But for now, SP Tug A was docked to the remaining open port on the tier of Senior docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bG0yMqx.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bG0yMqx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow: Today\u0027s work on the Space Station is finished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XsXgEEs.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XsXgEEs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ESurface Stuff\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022Kurt, while the geologists are doing their initial digging in the dirt around the Base area, I want you and Nelemy to prepare all of the rovers and planes for their test missions. Top off their tanks and verify that all systems are working.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelemy: \u0022Dude, I\u0027ll check out the Fuel Station first!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKurt: \u0022OK.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022Also check the parachute systems on Duna Lander 1. Aldner said that there wasn\u0027t an immediate response from the parachute deployment action while we were landing, and he had to use the alternate staging deployment method...but that\u0027s not going to work again when we need to hop that Lander.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKurt: \u0022Probably a software glitch. I\u0027ll check its SFS file settings against those in Lander 2.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow we see Nelemy driving one of the Duna Fido rovers over to check out the Fuel Station. Unlike on Laythe, on Duna the kerbals can use their rocket packs to move between vehicles. The rocket packs struggle in Duna\u0027s gravity compared to low gravity moons, so they aren\u0027t going to be great for flying long distances, but they\u0027ll get the job done for short hops. This meant that various vehicles, such as the Fuel Station, could be designed without extra ladder parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A9fbif9.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A9fbif9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelemy re-packed the Fuel Station\u0027s parachutes for neatness (it\u0027s not planned to hop it later), but his main interest in checking over the Fuel Station was to visit the Goo. All of the Fuel Stations are equipped with a Goo Canister to monitor Duna surface conditions, and this canister had been opened automatically upon landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelemy: \u0022Hey, little Goo-Dude! Are you enjoying your new home on Duna? Huh...Hey, Nelemy calling Hellou. Come in Hellou-dude.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHellou: \u0022What\u0027s up, Nelemy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelemy: \u0022The Goo looks like it\u0027s blushing. Do you think it\u0027s embarrassed about being on Duna?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHellou: \u0022No, Nelemy...that\u0027s probably just the very fine dust. It blows around easily and gets on everything. What is the Goo doing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelemy: \u0022Just pulsing a little. I think its happy. The GooCam is working, so I\u0027ll have it send its report back to KSC.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ytlvnJS.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ytlvnJS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, Kurt was driving the Fuel Fido over to the DunaDog planes. The Fuel Fido handles and corners well with its grippy wheels, but you do have to be careful when stopping because it has more of a tendency to tip than the Laythe rovers with their longer wheel base. You just have to remember to slow down with reverse throttle before braking to a halt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kP1whXZ.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kP1whXZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is my contention that the Claw units contain refueling hoses that Kurt can string to nearby vehicles to facilitate refueling. But the in-game mechanic is just to dock the Claw to some handy surface and transfer fuel. For the DunaDogs, the easiest place to grab with the Claw is any of the four ion engines on the back. This had all been tested in the \u0022Duna Yard\u0022 back at KSC, of course...you don\u0027t want to find out something like this isn\u0027t going to work AFTER you get your ships to their destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kTHQPjF.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kTHQPjF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really do wish SQUAD would just give us hoses for surface refueling. Even if they don\u0027t want to add some fancy graphics and game mechanics for kerbals to connect up hose (although I hope they do), they could add a feature that allows fuel transfer between any nearby ships with the standard right-click-on-the-tanks method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe relatively new feature that allows you to right-click to select many tanks at once so that fuel can be transferred out of one and into all of the others simultaneously is certainly handy. Below, Kurt is transferring Xenon from the Fuel Fido (which has four Xenon tanks on its underside) to the port row of six Xenon tanks on the DunaDog. The DunaDog had used very little Xenon during landing, so this went quickly. Afterwards, Kurt topped off the DunaDog\u0027s starboard Xenon tanks, and topped off the main FL-T800 Fuel Tank of the plane (to replace the propellant used during retro fire and landing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mdxh9Q8.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mdxh9Q8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKurt next undocked and moved the Fuel Fido over to DunaDog 2 to similarly top off its tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EagFT39.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EagFT39.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter DunaDog 1 was fueled up, Aldner did some short-range taxiing tests to check out the rover capabilities of the plane. An important limitation became apparent when the plane\u0027s batteries rapidly depleted: You must be very careful about Ike eclipsing the sun! As seen from Duna, Ike is about five degrees wide (ten times the size of our Moon as seen from Earth), so eclipses last a fairly long time, during which your solar panels are useless. When roving, eclipses just mean you have to stop and wait a while...but if a DunaDog is in flight and relying on its ion engines to stay aloft, an eclipse could be fatal (depending on what terrain is below). So DunaDog missions will need to be carefully planned with the location of Ike in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JWSBGgX.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JWSBGgX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EPolar Pilot\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Thompbles says we can do a DunaDog test mission now.

Did you bring a coin to Duna?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Umm...no. But it\u0027s traditional to have Kurt pick a random number. Closest guess wins...and the loser can drive Hellou on her rover expedition to the north.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHellou: \u0022Hey, I\u0027m right here! How rude.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022I mean...the winner flies the plane...and the second-place winner gets the honor of escorting our dear geologist north.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKurt: \u0022OK. I\u0027m thinking of a number from one to three million.

Aldner wins.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn: \u0022Have a good flight, Buzz. And I get Chickadee all to myself. It\u0027ll be just like the good ol\u0027 days on Vall.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKurt: \u0022Have you picked a name for your plane yet?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022I\u0027m naming it \u0027Aragorn\u0027.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHellou: \u0022Ah...a DunaDog named after a D\u00FAnadan. Only you would think of that. I\u0027m happy you still remember things from the book I loaned you during the Laythe mission.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, Aldner took off the next morning while the sun was high in the sky, but while there was still plenty of time before Ike would eclipse the sun. Alas, no jet engines on oxygen-less Duna, so the takeoff run was powered by the rear 48-7S rocket engine (which is toggled on/off via action group 1).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KZ1fZtl.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KZ1fZtl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe takeoff seemed very slow, with the tri-plane lifting at less than 35 m/s but rising very slowly. This was partly because of all the lag around the Base area, but mostly because the terrain slopes upward as you head north from Duna Base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Gear up. Climbing slowly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022Roger, Aldner. Have a safe flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Thanks, Friendly Flight Controller.

The silence sure is weird. Looks like I used about 10 percent of the rocket fuel for the takeoff. Climbing slower now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RTHiBhB.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RTHiBhB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo minutes into the flight, Aldner was passing through 2,900 meters, still climbing slowly. The plane was tooling along at a non-hair-raising speed of under 88 m/s. Because things were moving slowly, most of the flying was done a 2X physical time warp. It was also handy to click on one of the solar panels to monitor the sun exposure. Thus far the photovoltaics were providing all the power needed by the ion engines at full throttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A5t3sR8.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A5t3sR8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHellou: \u0022Chickadee calling Aragorn. Aldner, you remembered to turn on all the science instruments, right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Yes, Assistant Mother Hen. All scanners running. Thirty-five hundred meters.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main reason for the existence of the DunaDog planes can be seen on the underside of the Aragorn. There are four generic science instruments on the plane\u0027s belly, which represent a High-Resolution Surface Camera, a Multi-Spectral Imaging Scanner, a Cosmic Ray Induced X-ray Emission Spectrometer, and a High-Sensitivity VanAllen Detector. While the BirdDog rover/planes were the primary exploration craft on Laythe, the DunaDog rover/planes are primarily for gathering swaths of low altitude data in support of the Duna Fido surface rovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ppqhnsr.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ppqhnsr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parachute mast of the DunaDog also has science instruments mounted on it, including an Infrared Spectral Analyzer, two different Catalytic Detectors, and the excitingly-named Particulate Accumulator With Laser Zap Analysis Probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RphHwI9.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RphHwI9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022I\u0027m at four thousand on the altimeter, but that large lumpy red thing below me is still trying to get close.

At this point he leveled off and started experimenting with finding an optimal cruising altitude and speed for the DunaDog. About 5300 meters with a pitch angle of 20 degrees seemed to work well with the four ion engines at full throttle, giving a cruising speed of around 165 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224MZCmX2.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4MZCmX2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner continued experimenting with the cruising altitude for a long time.

If there\u0027s any bugs that are going to kill us here on Duna, it\u0027s best to find out now. Besides...having a drink that doesn\u0027t contain recycled pee is nice. Hmmm. Duna tastes good. OK...heading back now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor takeoff, Aldner used both the rear rocket engine and the belly engine to shorten the takeoff roll (also because he was at 2900 meters of elevation).

With the plane facing south, pitched up to climb, the sun exposure on the solar cells was weak (about 10% at 10 degrees, and 5% at 25 degrees), so the batteries were rapidly draining with the ions at full thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022The ions are drinking the batteries fast.

Keep me informed when you have the time. We have a good link through the polar comsat.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Hmmm. If I cut back to half throttle and pitch down a little for a slow descent, I can get the batteries to charge. If I get too low, I\u0027ll use some of that precious charge to goose the ions.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gEQOaMS.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gEQOaMS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings were a bit tense there for a while, but it got easier and easier as the plane flew further south. By the time Aldner was approaching the edge of the ice sheet, he was able to set the throttle of the ion engines up to 100% with a sun exposure of over 50%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cljlcaM.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cljlcaM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce he was back into sunnier climes, Aldner was able to do some more cruise testing, and found that the now-lighter DunaDog could cruise along at over 200 m/s at around 6000 meters. With the Duna Base set as the target, it was easy to guide the plane toward that marker...but he was basically paralleling his previous path back south.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GkDHrNV.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GkDHrNV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout 24 km out from base, cruising along at 208 m/s at 5200 meters, Aldner cut back the ions to half power to begin his descent.

When I pressed the EVA button to get Aldner out of the cockpit, there were suddenly TWO kerbals, both flying off, tumbling through the air toward the south from the DunaDog. They bounced and skidded to a halt on the ground with the furthest on about 50 meters from the plane.

I have often had weird things happen just before KSP was about to crash due to memory leaks filling up the space available to the program (things like having ships mysteriously crash and report that they had hit faraway objects...or textures going seriously wonky), but this is the weirdest one. When I restarted the game, there were still two Aldners. Some people suggested that I keep both Aldners as a fortuitous bounty from the Kraken to make up for all the negative bugs that have happened over the years... But I revert from bad bug occurrences, so it would not be fair to keep my new Aldner. I will have a little fun with him before I throw him back, however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to the story...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner got up and dusted off the red dirt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Yo, Thompbles. Something strange just happened. As I was getting out of the plane, I suddenly got knocked off into the air...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*** Nothing but static on the radio ***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Aldner calling Thompbles.

He muted the radio channel, since there appeared to be something wrong with his radio...but he knew that when got closer to the other kerbal, the short-range IR comm system would automatically kick in...assuming that wasn\u0027t also broken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Hey, the strangest thing just happened to me.

Like all the other markers, I am here to give you clues to locating the planet of the Creators. But the Creators did not intend to make this quest easy, because they want only a persistent and intelligent race to find their planet...so, as with the other markers here on Duna and elsewhere, there are limits to the information I can relate...and in my case I am limited in the number of responses I can give. You have seven questions left.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MEG5Du3.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MEG5Du3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Ohhhhkay.

The energy required to maintain this solid projection is substantial, and the Marker will soon move out of range. You have less than ten minutes remaining to question me.

They inhabited this system long ago, but one of their experiments in mass teleportation went awry. The failure sterilized all intelligent lifeforms in the system and ripped their planet from its orbit. As one of their final acts, they seeded your planet with lifeforms that they hoped would evolve into intelligent creatures to carry on with their work. So they left clues for you to find their planet and acquire their advanced technologies.

Then there were protracted discussions with KSC. Then there was a gag order placed by the KSC on saying anything about this to the press. Then there were more meetings and contingency plans explained. Oh what a bother while I\u0027m just trying to peacefully explore Duna. But enough said about this event for now. I don\u0027t want to be violating any gag orders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EReturn to the Routine\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a couple days\u0027 delay, it was back to the routine work for the crew.

Kurt then drove over with the Fuel Fido. The normal procedure would be for the Fuel Fido to dock to the Fuel Station to load up on propellants, then undock and move over to dock with the DunaDog to transfer the propellant to the plane. But the Fuel Fido has only four Xenon tanks, so this would require several iterations. The boys wanted to try out an alternate plan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RDPXXUM.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RDPXXUM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, Kurt docked the Fuel Fido to the DunaDog, which was aligned with its rear end toward the Fuel Station. Then Kurt dragged the DunaDog along with the Fuel Fido as he docked to the Fuel Station. Voil\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A0!

Then he undocked from the Aragorn and drove away. No planets were destroyed by annoying Claw bugs -- just remember to NEVER dock your active vehicle to the Claw of an inactive vehicle (or world-shattering KA-BOOMs can occur, as I found out on Laythe).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228ptYmFI.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8ptYmFI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next job Kurt performed was docking to Duna Fido 2, which Adly had named \u0022Dune Buggy,\u0022 to fill up its tanks. The four FL-T100 tanks of that rover were partially depleted from the retro and landing burns. Adly and Kelby were going to test out the Fido by making a long trip to the east...and just in case they needed to hop the rover back to Base, they wanted to be sure it had full tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZvmQLBE.gif\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZvmQLBE.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022c8Izb05.gif\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c8Izb05.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKurt: \u0022There you go, boys!

So the terrain was pretty gentle for the initial test of the Duna Fido rover. It soon became apparent that the rover could safely zip along this rolling terrain at 30 m/s, and (happily for me) could easily tolerate 3X physical time warp. The way parts of the rover jerked around relative to each other when the rover hit bumps at high warp was somewhat disconcerting (which is why I decided not to cruise along at 4X), but it seemed to tolerate the warp much better than I remember my older versions of the rover doing (they used to sag quite a bit at high time warps). I suspect that this may be the result of the stronger joints we have nowadays in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qEKl7ab.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qEKl7ab.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile Adly and Kelby were headed east, Emilynn and Hellou were driving on an expedition to the north into the Shield Wall Mountains, which Hellou had named.

The wheels on the Duna Fidos have less traction than the grippier ruggedized wheels, but that also makes it less prone to try to flip during braking. All the fuel onboard and the shorter wheelbase does make the Duna Fidos more susceptible to tipping than my previous Fidos, so it requires more care to drive (always slow down before braking). Because of the lower friction of the wheels, it\u0027s necessary to toggle the SAS off during turns (by holding down the \u0022F\u0022 key)...but that also makes it more liable to tip, so don\u0027t turn rapidly when moving fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Jessica could tolerate 2X physical time warp on the rougher terrain (and 3X in flatter areas), but high time warps will make the rover slide downhill. This \u0027skating\u0027 effect at time warp speeds does make the rover less susceptible to tipping when brakes are applied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rising terrain did limit the rover\u0027s speed to around 10 m/s, and steep slopes required attacking them at an angle with a switchback maneuver (where a grippy wheel rover would be able to drive directly upslope).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022II6Aued.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/II6Aued.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE: I\u0027m using my same Rules For Driving Rovers on my Duna mission as it did on my Laythe mission. That is to say, I expect that my kerbals are going to drive along at a safe speed, taking several days to do a drive I perform in an hour or so at high time warp and hair-raising speeds...Because I get bored driving slow at 1X, even with my trusty audiobooks to entertain me. So I will push the limits of safe driving into the insane driving regime. If I make it through a leg of the journey without incident, all is good. If I wipe out during a leg of the journey, I have to repeat it...preferably at a safe speed, because if I wipe out again when trying to be careful, it\u0027s an official occurrence in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note that the Fido design includes a single-kerbal lander cabin that represents a space where the kerbals can stretch out one at a time and get some more comfortable sleep or wash their hair or whatever...all to make long rover expeditions less grueling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing hair-raising happend on the drive north...mostly because the rising terrain limited the speed of the rover.

After the makeover Duna received, this area is now rolling sand dunes...but I could still let the rover drive along unattended (this time with the help of MechJeb\u0027s Rover Autopilot to maintain the speed) without worrying that it would go too fast and wipe out. So, rather than send Adly and Kelby back to base, I decided to send them all the way across Adly Planitia to see how the far edge looked (previously it was an impressively steep wall).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver in the eastern part of Adly Planitia (see map below), the boys camped out for a couple days to watch Ike set and rise. Ike is tidally locked to Duna (and vice versa), but because of its slightly elliptical orbit, Ike shifts back and forth about 8 degrees during the Duna day. In the image below, you can see the sun coming out from behind Ike just before sunset...and then during the night, Ike dipped below the horizon...and then Ike rose back into the sky after dawn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nHUXqCR.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nHUXqCR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CIrcDkR.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CIrcDkR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe steep incline that used to mark the eastern edge of Adly Planitia is long gone. Now the terrain just gradually gets hillier as you head eastward up out of the Lowlands. At least the transition from Lowlands to Midlands to Highlands happens in the correct order here. Unexpected note: If you have the display of biomes turned on in Map view, then Ike shows up in Duna\u0027s sky all covered in colorful biome colors (so I had to keep turning off biome display when I wanted to take a regular picture with Ike in the sky).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022j9Vc5Ex.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/j9Vc5Ex.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDriving up into the Midlands allowed our heros to see Ike again (it had slipped below the horizon from the lower elevations at the eastern edge of Adly Planitia). Also, the bumpier terrain made it easier to catch some air when driving fast (but the increasing slope made it harder to drive fast).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RENTC03.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RENTC03.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UL7reB3.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UL7reB3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, the terrain got even steeper as the Fido rover transitioned into the Highlands. The slope was steep enough to slow the Fido down to a crawl...but not so steep that it was necessary to drive back and forth in a switchback path.

Setting up the base involved sending in a Lander (so the guys have somewhere more comfortable to live than the Fido rover), and a Fuel Station and Fuel Fido (to re-fuel ships). Those assets were sitting up in polar orbit (so that they could be dropped anywhere on Duna).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first step was to separate the Duna Fido 3 rover from the BANT 6 ship.

This would be a lot less boring if SQUAD would allow faster time warps in lower orbits. As is, I switched to one of the comsats and ran time forward, then switched back to the Lander as the landing site was nearing its orbital plane. Then came the retro fire, entry (no flames), and parachute assisted landing.

The idea was that the higher polar orbit (with its lower orbital velocity) would require a smaller plane shift burn to put the payload on target...but it also means that the orbital period is longer, so the chances are lower that you\u0027ll get a close alignment as the target site passes below the orbit (since the ship may not be close to the retro fire position when the base is passing under its orbit). But the alignments weren\u0027t bad.

Then there was another wait for the landing site to align with the orbit. Each of these landings had to be made a day apart because only one ship could be taken care of during each landing window. The place where the landing site passes under the orbit on the other side of the planet is in darkness, so I didn\u0027t want to use that location...because the \u0027automatic landing radar\u0027 that determines when to fire the landing rockets consists of my eyeballs watching the screen, and most of these payloads don\u0027t have landing lights (to save on part count), so landing in darkness is contraindicated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220TQ5m3W.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0TQ5m3W.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe little FL-T100 tank on top of the Fuel Fido is there as a spacer in the payload stack...but the vehicle was sent down with that tank full so that after retro burn, the fuel from the FL-T100 tank could be moved to replace some of the fuel used for the retro burn.

When fully fueled, the Duna Fido rovers can hop 11 degrees around Duna using half their fuel (counting the little extra it takes to soft-land under the parachutes). So, a Duna Fido could hop 11 degrees from base, and later hop 11 degrees back to base, and be refueled. But a fully-fueled Duna Fido can also reach Duna orbit...so if you want to use over half the fuel, it can be hopped to ANY point on Duna from any starting point. And if you have fuel for the rover waiting at the new landing site, the rover can later hop elsewhere. Part of reason for setting up the outpost bases is to position fuel reserves around Duna for making hops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hop from the Highlands east of Aldy Planitia to the Fido Canyon base required 68.6% of the \u003Cem\u003EDune Buggy\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E fuel.

But partly it was because the only pulses at pi gigahertz that had been picked up from possible alien artifacts were coming from the hemisphere to the West of Duna Base.

And if you want to make a LONG flight, you have to consider where the sun will be during the whole flight. This is especially true if you are flying East, against the direction of the sun\u0027s motion in the sky, since this will shorten the amount of daylight available to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna Base, for reasons of lowland flatness and cosmic significance, is located at \u003Cem\u003E42\u003C/em\u003E degrees East longitude.

So Aldner would need to takeoff when the sun was fairly low in the east from Duna Base, and hopefully land before the sun gets too low in the west from Fido Canyon. Aldner\u0027s flight north showed that the DunaDog will operate, if somewhat touch-and-go, with the sun 28 degrees above the horizon ahead of the plane.

Radar altimeter reads two hundred thirty. Hmmm...Looks like a lot of red stuff...big surprise. Hopefully the recordings will tell you more than that. I should be landing in ten minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKurt: \u0022Roger, Hawk.

There were some higher mountains to the north that looked interesting, but there wasn\u0027t a lot of time for sightseeing just then: She needed to lose altitude. Aldner had a long west-to-east shot when landing at Fido Canyon, but Emilynn could not afford to overshoot by as far as he did because Barsoom Canyon is narrower and runs northwest-southeast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mWnHYtV.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mWnHYtV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt an altitude of just under 1,500 meters AGL, still about 1.8 km from the base site, Emilynn deployed the parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022S0hgjRg.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S0hgjRg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn overshot the base by 5 km and touched down on a moderate slope. The DunaDog started rolling backwards, but she used a short blast from the rear rocket engine to stop its motion and applied the brakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Z2uLUcM.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z2uLUcM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn: \u0022The \u003Cem\u003EAmelia\u003C/em\u003E has landed safely, boys and girls. Flight time fifty-six minutes. Xenon remaining...a little under thirty-four percent. Liquid fuel remaining...over sixty-four percent. I think it might be more efficient to use up more liquid fuel early on so that the ions are more efficient pushing a lighter plane.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKurt: \u0022Yes...but then you\u0027d be really sad if you came across some big mountains in front of you and didn\u0027t have the fuel to spare to boost over them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn: \u0022True.
