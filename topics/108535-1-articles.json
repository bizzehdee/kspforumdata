I liked the mod because it was nice and simple. You click on one pipe, click on the next and connect your 2 crafts together. This was perfect for bases. I\u0027m not looking for anything else. Now in 1.0.2 i cant find KAS any more. Theres a lot of mixed info on KIS what it comes with. Some say if you want to run KAS you also need KIS. I\u0027m looking only for the pipes that connect the crafts together, i\u0027m not looking for anything special nor am i looking for a mod with hundreds of parts just so i can get the pipes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny feedback?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T04:05:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 04:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tripzter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T04:13:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is KAS thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-90-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-10\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-90-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-10\u003C/a\u003E but yes some is changing over to KIS not sure what all will stay with KAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here is KIS thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-0-90-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-0-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-0-90-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-0-0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the grab is getting changed over to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripzter","CreatedById":75335,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T04:25:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight but does the KAS .90 work for 1.0.2?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T04:32:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKAS is coming, I\u0027ve been watching the development updates and it is not abandoned or anything, fear not and be patient. No, 0.90 does not seem to work in 1.0.2. It as severe issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKIS is an inventory management system which can work side-by-side with KAS and will be a partially included in KAS eventually, however currently it is not required. If you recall using KAS before, it has/had a text based GUI for adding stuff to the KAS toolboxes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKIS replaces that with graphical (read: icon based) system with new toolboxes (among other things). KospY has said the toolboxes will eventually be replaced in KAS with the KIS toolboxes but I don\u0027t think the \u0022other things\u0022 I mentioned will be included in KAS and will still need KIS to operate. (though I could be wrong on that, I think that is the plan) In any case it is not a requirement at this time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T04:40:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 04:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
