In the Minecraft modding community, a lot of mods use \u0022AdFly\u0022 to distribute their mods. They might make a few cents per view out of it, or something, I don\u0027t know the details of it all since I\u0027ve never distributed a mod, but say, for example, some modder makes a pack, distributes it with AdFly, but thoughtlessly didn\u0027t indicate a license for it. Say he intended to be the sole distributor, either because of the money, or because he felt like his work was \u003Cem\u003Ehis\u003C/em\u003E work, alone, and didn\u0027t want other people modifying it. Then, we have a modpack like this one come along, and start innocently repackaging the mod with another one - suddenly, the original modder\u0027s AdFly account isn\u0027t the source of distribution. Unpleasantness in the community ensues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not such a far fetched scenario, really, as it happened a couple of times with Minecraft mods. License agreements are important, and the default position of any work is \u0022All rights reserved\u0022, or so it should be considered, to keep yourself out of the legal hot water. If a modder wants to allow free distribution, or other specific channels of distribution, there are licenses for that, numerous Creative Commons variations, like BY-NC-SA (attribute to the original author, non-commercial use only, derivative works must be distributed under the same licensing).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-01T00:19:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gulinotm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gulinotm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am not trying to argue about anything nor am i demanding it be changed, i\u0027m just stating my opinion on this.\u003Cp\u003EThe difference between this and your examples of a movie making money or claiming a Beatles song is yours is that you\u0027re not selling these parts and you are not claiming they\u0027re yours, so that doesn\u0027t really hold up.
