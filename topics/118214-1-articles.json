Each building around the Kerbal Space Center gives a different result when you do scientific experiments next to it. Granted, it is not *much* science, but it is very low risk and easily accessible. It makes a good method of testing various new scientific apparatus as you unlock them, returning a bit of your investment to get them in the process. \n\nRemember that for most instruments, you can take multiple readings if you have a Kerbal go EVA, float up the the meter, right click on it and select the option to take the data. Then you return the Kerbal to the command module, the data gets stored in there, and you can take more readings again. The big exceptions to this are the Mystery Goo Container and the Science 9000 Jr, which will be rendered inoperative if you remove their data, unless you have a scientist on your crew who can clean the units out after removing data to let them perform additional experiments. \n\nSome kinds of experiments can only get new data in very general conditions, others in very specific conditions. The EVA reports, for example, are different both on the surface of and just above every different biome. You will probably quickly exhaust your possible EVA reports in low Kerbin orbit, but your next goal should be EVA reports in low orbit of the Mun and Minmus. The nice thing is you can keep going in and out of the command pod and gathering new reports as your orbit carries you across different biomes. Use some small inclination adjustments to put yourself on a course over different biomes. In fact, I would recommend you avoid landing on your first orbit over Mun and Minmus. Just try to orbit and observe for a while, then return with the data. Once you get back, you will have a lot of science to unlock with and more options when you go back for your landing, making those future missions easier."},{"CreatedByName":"Cheesehead64","CreatedById":149609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T17:59:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Make sure you are not attaching parts too close to the exit hatch, sometimes when you send them to eva if they clip another part it will send them FLYING.\n\u003E Also, you can get a different EVA report from space above each different biome (water, desert, grasslands, etc).\n\u003E \n\u003E Dont forget about all the science around KSP.

Any recommendations?\n\nKSP was a typo, he means KSC which means Kerbal Space Center, i.e. where you launch your rockets.\n\nMun and Minmus are the moons of Kerbin, the planet where the Kerbals live.\n\nAs for quick science at the beginning of the game, you need to make the most of biome-specific experiments. A biome is an area or zone on a planet or moon. If an experiment is biome-specific it means it will give you unique results when performed on different biomes. KSC is its own biome and has several \u0022sub-biomes\u0022 as already mentioned, such as the launchpad and the runway as well as each of the buildings (including the flag-post!). Of course the science to be had at KSC is pretty low, but since there\u0027s a lot of biomes it adds up. You can use 2 capsules attached to the bottom of each other as an impromptu rover by laying it on its side and using the roll controls (Q and E on the keyboard) to move around. Attach whatever science experiments you have or you can just do Crew Reports, EVA Reports and Surface Samples at each place.\n\nNext, launch a manned craft into a polar orbit (i.e. launch north or south instead of east). As you orbit, you will pass over different biomes. The polar orbit means that as the planet rotates you will pass over different areas. You can effectively cover the entire planet this way if you spend enough time up there. Whenever you pass over a new biome, go on EVA and get an EVA report. You can easily gets TONS of science this way in a single flight. You will need a mod (I recommend Kerbal Engineer) to know which biome you\u0027re at at a glance. But you can kind of tell easily because the biomes correspond to changes in geographical features. Examples of biomes on Kerbin are grasslands, shores, water, mountains, deserts. If in doubt, perform an EVA report and see where it says the report was performed. \n\nAnother trick is to make small suborbital research rockets. Strap your science experiments on top of an SRB with a probe core and a parachute and launch in different directions. If you don\u0027t have the control surfaces unlocked yet you can vary which way you launch by rotating your craft in the VAB (where you build rockets); to do this select the entire rocket by Shift\u002BClicking it and then pressing Shift\u002BWASD to rotate it in small increments. You will likely land on a different biome each time you launch and can get more science like that.\n\nIf you already unlocked the Science Jr., use it as much as you can. It yields lots of science compered to the other experiments. \n\nThis should be enough to get you on your way to the moons, where experiments start to yield more substantial amounts of science.\n\nLet us know if you have other questions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T18:44:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 06:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A\\_name**"},{"CreatedByName":"sebbemann","CreatedById":141208,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T20:39:27Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been there too.

Create a small rocket with science jr and a couple of mystery goo to the north pole, the mountains and so on. When you have more powerfull rockets, do the same thing in space during a stable, circular orbit. After a while of grinding this way, you\u0027ll have better and bigger rockets so you can travel to other planets, where the science reward is much greater."},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T21:34:38Z","Content":"As others have said, the game has a steep learning curve.
