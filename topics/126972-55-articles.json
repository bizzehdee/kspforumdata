After all these years? He turned back to face him, to look deep into those eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Albro?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The one and only. So very nice to be remembered, especially by the famously dead Thomlock Kerman.\u0022 The old kerbal chuckled. \u0022Please, do come in, my very old friend. We have much to discuss.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170701_0135_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022568\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170701_0135_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I...\u0022 Thomlock started to ask something, but his mind was a torment of questions. He put his hands up in frustration and walked towards the very old kerbal who sat at the center of the universe. Of course it\u0027d be Albro. Who else? He couldn\u0027t help but laugh. \u0022Y\u0027know, it figures. Here I am, all this time, all those years stuck in a tiny capsule in space, and somebody went and made you Space Emperor, or some nonsense like that. Nice throne you\u0027ve got there, friend. Fits your megalomaniacal, bigger-than-Jeb personality perfectly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlbro scowled at him. \u0022I was the first true Bad-S, not that halfwit junk peddler. I should\u0027ve been first in space, not you, and I should\u0027ve been on the first rocket instead of Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, we both know you\u0027d be just as dead as Jeb. Speaking of which, how are you even alive? The kerbals at Laythe said you\u0027d died. You must be, what, one hundred and thirty? Forty?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022One hundred twenty eight, if you must know. Still two munths older than you. And, no, they used very specific words. They said I had \u0027passed on.\u0027\u0022 The smiles returned, now with even more wrinkles. \u0022And so I have. I have passed on from the Park and into this new life.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Seriously? What kind of life is this? You get to, let me guess, sit in a spinny chair and spy on kerbals all day? There\u0027s kerbals back home that get to do that too, and they never leave their parent\u0027s basement.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Look here, you sarcastic little twit. If you\u0027d prefer I can stop now and drop you back on Vall. With or without your helmet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok, Mr Big Spinny Chair, what\u0027s this Park you mentioned?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbal Space Program, The Theme Park. \u0027Back home,\u0027 as you put it.\u0022 Albro cleared his throat. \u0022You see, Thomlock, we were created as toys. As an amusement, a pastime, an escape. Our creators had moved beyond simple technology such as rockets, yet they wanted to relive their first steps into the cosmos. And they needed a hobby. Something to keep them preoccupied and distracted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We were that hobby. A recreation of another old space program, reduced to a level even the simplest of their kind could understand. To round it out, to keep it light hearted, and to entertain all ages, this park was populated by cute, lovable, obedient, cartoon-like characters. Us. Kerbals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lovable? Strange word to describe creatures that spend most of their time hurling their own kin into the sky atop hastily-built exploding death traps, but whatever. Where are they now, these so-called creators of ours?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, they died. Many, many years ago. Died long before either of us were born. Our park and its toy space program have trundled on in their absence, forgotten and nearly alone ever since.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock shook his head and wondered if he was still asleep. No, there\u0027s no way his dreams could conjure a reality as insane as this. \u0022Why do I get the feeling you\u0027re about to give some long, boring, expository speech?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Look, I brought you here because I need your help, and because you need mine. If you\u0027re not interested in what I have to say, by all means go back the same way you arrived. I won\u0027t hold it against you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, you brought me here? Why?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Perhaps I needed someone to talk to? I\u0027m starting to regret it.\u0022 He waved his arms wide, pointing around at the mostly dark displays. \u0022This room is the Park Control Center. From here I can see everything that\u0027s going on in the Kerbol System, and have near total control. And you\u0027re right, I can spy on every kerbal everywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This facility served as both the Park Entrance and the General Administration Office. The visitors would gather here, kit out, and then slip onto Kerbin by way of the portal system. They concealed themselves amongst us, even traveled with us, helped us, hurt us. At least until they\u0027d got their fill and wandered back home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And no one made me \u0027Space Emperor\u0027, as you put it. The chair was empty and needed someone to sit in it. Why not me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I can think of a few reasons already. So how did you get here in the first place?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The same as you, through the Vall Portal. Perhaps I should start at the beginning.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Please.\u0022 Thomlock sat down on the ramp and got as comfortable as one can get when wearing an EVA suit in full gravity. \u0022It\u0027s not like I have plans to be anywhere, or a crew waiting on my crazy hide to get back to them. Please, by all means continue with your exposition dump.\u0022 He crossed his arms and leaned back on his jetpack. \u0022I\u0027ll just get comfortable here on the floor.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re welcome to leave at any time. I just thought you\u0027d like some answers. And perhaps avoid a painful death and help prevent the total destruction of everything we\u0027ve built....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s wrong with writing a book? Something I could carry with me, take home, read in my free time? No, no, don\u0027t let me stop you. Please.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Very well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022In the beginning there was Jeb. And Bill and Bob. They died.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fast forward past this part. Tell me something I don\u0027t know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlbro ignored him. \u0022The fourth launch didn\u0027t go so well either, as you no doubt remember. There were two launches after you were ejected into Solar Orbit: Nelsey and myself. Nelsey\u0027s Hawk 4 disintegrated during launch, unsurprising considering the haphazard design. He managed to disengage the capsule and land safely on the beach, only to be crushed by falling debris moments later. The program administrators decided the Hawk was cursed and moved forward with Falcon. My launch was the first successful mission, lobbed into a very clean suborbital trajectory that reentered over the space center.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Except the space center wasn\u0027t there when I landed. Nothing was, except myself and my capsule. Just empty prairie and some scrub brush. It was a bit of a hike but I eventually found a nearby town, a town filled with staring kerbals. None of them had any idea who I was or what I was talking about when I asked what happened to the space center. Blank looks and disbelief when I said I\u0027d been to space. I got the same from the next town, and yet more from Kerbin City. It was useless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So I went back to my life, best as I could. Back to the freeclimbing and basejumping and all the other insane pursuits of my youth. I still had these memories though, the program, the kerbals who I worked and trained with. Ghosts, every one of you, following me around every day. Ghosts who were completely forgotten by everyone else.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Some years later I learned of a new space agency. It was on the news, fully funded by the new government, launching as regularly as we had. It took them a few attempts, but eventually they placed a very happy kerbal by the name of Jebediah Kerman into orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The same Jeb? The dead Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, absolutely the same Jeb. I tracked them down and convinced one of the administrators to make some introductions. Jeb was unmistakable, with that same magnetic personality and endless bravado. The very same Jeb we watched die in the Hawk 1.\u0022 He closed his eyes for a moment before continuing. \u0022And we both know he was dead. No doubts are possible there. Bill and Bob were there too, though none of the three recognized me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I tried to stick around, tried to get hired on as another spacekerb, but this agency disappeared before I could even get skin deep into this new mystery. Everything disappeared, just like before. Everything except Bill, Jeb, and myself, the three kerbals who had been to space. And they were both as confused as I was. Three kerbals now living as outcasts and aliens on their own home planet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The cycles didn\u0027t stop there, and soon enough we\u0027d picked up a few more Jebs. Bill noticed some patterns in these resets, some opportunities, and he persuaded me to start a space program of my own. So began Continuum, a project intended to get us to space and to bring an end to the cyclical amnesia plaguing Kerbin. I figured if we gathered enough of us forgotten kerbals we could eventually crack the nut we were stuck on. As it turns out, sometimes strength is not in numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022At first we were only mildly successful, placing a scant six kerbals into space: Another Jeb, an extra Bill, a new Bob, Milbas, Chading, and Rayming. Sadly Milbas and Chading died to parachute failures. Milbas\u0027 death was especially difficult, he was such a well-liked kerbal and quite the media darling. Plus he\u0027d already been to space three times before the accident. We didn\u0027t talk about the Milbas Incident for quite some time; we danced around his name like he was just another ghost. It really haunted us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fast forward a few cycles and we\u0027d landed on The M\u00FCn, Duna, and I had a small mission on the way to Jool. Continuum had grown into a large organization, with several long-term, multi-cycle missions in progress. We had passed off direct control of the space program to the \u0027natives\u0027 of the new cycles, thinking it would be best if they grew organically while we did our thing with what equipment we had in the field. It was fun to watch them as they discovered the strange lie they were living. Some of them even fought against us, at least at first.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock grunted. \u0022Can\u0027t say I blame them, controlling kerbals such as that.\u0022 This wasn\u0027t the Albro he remembered, but then again that memory was of a kerbal from more than a century ago. Something had obviously changed him, drawn him down a darker path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Funny you should mention control. Several of our researchers, and one of the Bobs in particular, discovered peculiarities in how Gene and Wernher chose their missions and craft designs. Sometimes they would be in the middle of a thought, mid-sentence even, and completely abandon it to go off in some other direction. It was as though the first design was now cursed. This was odd, both of them being rather rational creatures, so we started digging deeper.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And that\u0027s when we found them. The puppet strings. They manifested as a band of radio frequencies, messages in a simple and obvious encoding. There were several channels over which commands could be whispered to a target, commands they would execute without question.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock jumped to his feet. \u0022You son of a....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It was you. Your voice. The one I heard on the ice. You didn\u0027t bring me here, you \u0027commanded\u0027 me to come here. Pulled my strings.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Would you have willingly jumped into a pillar of pure energy had I not?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No! Would you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m here, aren\u0027t I?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You really are crazy, you know that? Who else\u0027s strings did you pull? What else have you changed?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thomlock, if it wasn\u0027t for me, you\u0027d still be drifting through empty space.\u0022 One of the screens blinked to life, showing his capsule hanging in the nothingness. \u0022One of the first things I did when I arrived was to nudge your capsule, move a bit of space dust, micrometeorites, to put you into an orbit that would hit Kerbin. Otherwise you would still be out there drifting through the void, frozen for all of eternity. And yes, I\u0027ve changed things, spoken many whispers. Too many, perhaps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022At first we went easy, only pulling on strings to see what they would do. Have Wernher stand on one leg, cause Gene to spill his koffee, have Linus eat a goo, things like that. Then we moved on to heavy research, testing the limits, seeing how far a whisper could bend a kerbal before they broke. In one test a kerbal spent ten days atop the flagpole. In another they gleefully rode through reentry while holding onto a ladder. Or rather they tried to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There seemed to be no limits, even for ourselves and how far we would go to achieve our ends. Continuum had near total control over every aspect of kerbal life. Control we were abusing, and regularly so. Others started to catch on, kerbals in powerful places, so we had to make them forget. Usually we would just wait and let the cycles do the work for us. Sometimes we had to take action. Sometimes forgetting wasn\u0027t enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A large part of Continuum took issue with my methods, especially with us erasing ourselves from the minds and memories of innocent kerbals. This splinter group had been working for quite some time to find ways to block the control. They were good kerbals, spacekerbs each, so I let them continue their side project. Eventually they left Continuum and formed a series of monasteries, establishing a mental discipline they thought would protect them from the whispers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022These monks still serve a purpose, even outside of Continuum. They keep the records, they store the designs, they track everything kerbals do. They help rebuild society from the null state that forms at the start of every new cycle. But again we\u0027re getting ahead of ourselves.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As Continuum pressed on with our research into the mind of the kerbal we became somewhat paranoid about our reasons for wanting to do so. Were we doing it because we wanted to? Or because we were being told to? I commissioned a special research project to listen for and track whispers we didn\u0027t start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We found several sources of them, scattered all across the Kerbol System. I sent out a new series of probes, the ABISS project. On the surface they were simple science probes, destined one-each to all of the regions and biomes our early explorers had found. Secretly they were listening stations. A system-wide antenna, built to allow us to stare into the very abyss from which we had sprung.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Did it stare back at you? Did it feel a chill when it looked into the abyss that is your heart? Did the two of you start an abyss club? Are there now little abysslings running around?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Your continued sarcasm is noted. And no, it did not stare back, but it did reach out and pull me in. At first we didn\u0027t find anything interesting. Blips here, bloops there. And then a high-energy burst from Vall just as Gene and Wernher decided to abandon kerbal exploration of the outer planets and dedicate their every effort to building a large base on the M\u00FCn: Pioneer Base. You\u0027ve been there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Still have the shovel, somewhere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course you do. That signal was obviously what we were looking for, so I set about building a small Jool craft while the others preoccupied themselves with a colony on the M\u00FCn.\u0022 A monitor to Thomlock\u0027s left flashed to life, displaying an image of Macfred\u0027s infamous Thing A, just with considerably more bits to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170713_x028_anchorpoint.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022570\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170713_x028_anchorpoint.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022AnchorPoint Station, which Continuum partially built using the scraps that launched Pioneer Base. Most of it was assembled and welded in orbit, though we launched the superstructure pre-assembled in two pieces. That was where we built the Vallkyrie, my Vall craft. It was a good ship yard with a good crew, a crew that could\u0027ve built anything we asked. They finished the Vallkyrie in record time. Once that was complete I flew to Kelgee Station in an old \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E and transferred to Anchorpoint by EVA.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We had planned to continue using the station, build a fleet of carrier-shuttles like the Vallkyrie, but that never happened. That\u0027s when it all fell apart.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Did your mindslaves finally wriggle free of your strings? Try to strangle you with them perhaps?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. Worse. That\u0027s when the Kraken awoke. They slipped out of the inky darkness, at least two of them, and wrapped their black tendrils around the station\u0027s framework. I had just launched in the Vallkyrie when they struck, and could only watch in horror as they thrashed pieces of the station about. They shook kerbals out of hitchhiker cans and then tossed them around in space, as though playing with their food. They went for the fuel stores after that, and proceeded to rip the station apart. The skeleton you see today is all that survived.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And those eyes. Those horrible, golden, fiery eyes. They haunt me to this day.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170713_x042_anchorpoint.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022569\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170713_x042_anchorpoint.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I wasted no time in leaving, and activated the Vallkyrie\u0027s nuclear drives to burn into a higher orbit. There was nothing I could do anyway. Maclie, Kening and a few others from Kelgee later rescued a handful of survivors. They followed me to Jool aboard the Jool Jester, and said the station was a total loss. Vallkyrie would be the only ship of her kind. Then another cycle hit, and we lost contact just as I left Kerbin\u0027s gravity well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fitting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I spent more than two years in the dark, alone. I can\u0027t imagine how you managed to stay sane.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I was frozen.

I would fly back in the cabin of the lander, then return to Kerbin alone in the Vallkyrie itself. I had no idea at the time Maclie and his crew were already in-system and trying to reach me.
