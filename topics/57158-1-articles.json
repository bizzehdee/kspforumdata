I heard about a method of creating a manoeuvre node at ground level and retrograding it all the way to zero, but that doesn\u0027t work very well as I never knew when to start the burn (right at and/or half way to the node doesn\u0027t work) so that was also quite inefficient. In the end I gave up on this method and decided to use the formula given in a thread I found to create an Excel document that gave me the altitude to start burning at. It\u0027s pretty close, not 100% accurate but not too bad! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the link \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.2shared.com/file/D05vVYaR/Suicide_Burn.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.2shared.com/file/D05vVYaR/Suicide_Burn.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Simon Ross","CreatedById":82582,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T14:08:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave tried variations of the suicide burn, but it really is hit and miss a lot of the time.

The problem with them is that when you\u0027re moving at 500 m/s at the beginning, you simply cannot start burning at exactly the right time so that it ends 1 m above the ground, you\u0027d need to start burning at the right 1/500th of a second even if you knew when.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing maneuver nodes helps, you need to start burning 100% - 70% of the burn time before the node. But the map view is often not very accurate and if you put your node below the real surface, you\u0027re screwed. I recommend using this method only when you need pinpoint landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor normal landing where you don\u0027t care too much where you land, use the \u0022horizontal approach\u0022 - at apoapsis, bring your periapsis down, just high enough to not hit surface (you might want to check kerbalmaps for heights). Then at periapsis start braking and when your altitude starts decreasing, gradually raise your pitch to keep your vertical speed small (~10 m/s) while still killing your horizontal speed. When you kill enough of your horizontal speed, let the ship descend at reasonable rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis method is usually much more effective than your average suicide burn and only slightly less effective than absolutely perfect suicide burn. And unlike suicide burn, you can make it this way every time unless you are really careless about your vertical speed or height of hills you might run into.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T15:50:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you can get your ship to hover with no horizontal velocity, you can then use RCS to really pinpoint your landing site.
