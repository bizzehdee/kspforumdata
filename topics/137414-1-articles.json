Tonight I upgraded to 1.1. I currently have several vessels on the Mun, one of which is a landed orbiter and another is a fuel truck. The fuel truck has a claw on the front. When I ram the fuel truck into the orbiter, the two vessels \u0022dock\u0022 and can be managed as one. However, when I click on a fuel tank, hold down right shift, and then click on another compatible fuel tank, the in/out buttons do not show up. Repeated attempts to do this do not result in success. However, if I use [ or\u00A0] to switch to a nearby vessel and then switch back immediately, I am able to see the fuel transfer buttons and perform a fuel transfer as expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOS: Ubuntu 14.04.
