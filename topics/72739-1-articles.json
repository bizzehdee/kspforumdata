Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Croatia.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThousands are evacuated, towns and villages are literally gone under the spilled rivers. This is the worst large flood in the region in like more than 120 years. Even since the climate change has started showing its teeth, we have more and more of extremely bad weather. Record highs and lows in temperature and water level, never before encountered in the history of record keeping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.dw.de/image/0,,17639322_403,00.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220,,17639322_403,00.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(village near Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are landslides, collapsing buildings, roads are torn apart and it still isn\u0027t over.

Granted, the morons of antivax movement haven\u0027t made the \u0022success\u0022 as they did in USA, but nevertheless, rate of vaccination is dangerously low, and this will cause trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the terrible dangers are the landmines, left from the wars 20 years ago.
