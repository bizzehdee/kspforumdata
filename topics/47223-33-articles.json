Your example with the boiloff causing vapor plumes is pretty good - not realistic, but quite suitable for a game (especially a lighthearted one).

In stock I can\u0027t get my hands on the stability derivatives, that, while is it arguable that presenting them as hard numbers (actually the green/red is wonderful) and with mathematic description only could be a bit unfriendly, they are a must to build a plane, and once you got in a mindset that certain ones affect certain maneuvers they are pretty straightforward and fun to optimize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that comes to mind about having something modeled against RL physics but with concession to it are radiators and engines that glow with their temperatures. It looks badass, and the first lifter engines overheat put the attention of the player on the fact that heat exists in the game, without hard consequences since the stage is jettisoned early. What is missing now is the temp readouts on parts right-click menu, to further cement this idea while in space too and to give a feedback before everything is in the red zone. Presenting the first radiators and insulators with the nuke engine or shortly before while giving hints in their description on how heat flows could be a great way to ease the player into thinking about heat management.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T10:48:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow is heat removed for new NFT reactors?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the KSPI VISTA Fusion Propulsion system, I create a combination of exisitng KSPI heat management and KSP Heating.

In order for the heat engine to work, there must be a lower temperature \u0022sink\u0022 that heat can flow towards. Those are the radiators. The larger and better quality the radiators are, and the higher the reactor\u0027s core temperature, the larger the temperature differential between the core and the radiators will be; and the larger the differential, the better the heat engine will run.

IRL, that would be a big no-no. You already have issues with spacecraft overheating due to solar thermal flux; the Apollo capsule and service module for example were polished to a mirror finish to minimize that effect, but they still needed a bit of dedicated radiator surface. The ISS has entire banks of radiators just to cool itself (especially the solar panels, which would melt otherwise). Compared to RL spacecraft, KSP spacecraft are really really good at radiating. Also, the differences between facing the sun and being in the shadow are extreme. You can have the sun-facing part of your spacecraft heat up to over a hundred degrees while the shadowed side goes down to -250 or more. This causes major stresses in the material. The aforementioned Apollo module was put into a slow rotation with respect to the sun in order to evenly distribute solar heating and prevent any area from getting too hot or too cold.

Tiers 3 and 4 got nerfed across the board, and some numbers changed around on pretty much all engines. You will no longer be able obtain TWRs greater than 2.0 Kerbin-relative with any electric engine. This was done in order to keep the nerfed LV-N relevant in at least a select few scenarios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines also have a heat output now, and it\u0027s set on the high end for what I consider reasonable. Whenever Nertea gets around to pushing a new test build, \u003Cem\u003Eplease test especially with an eye towards vessel heating during long burns\u003C/em\u003E. The good news is - though I call it high, it should still be a far cry from the LV-N \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
