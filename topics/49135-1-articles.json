I imagine this may change in the future but it was just a thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I would like to see a spare parts box radial attachment. basically a box that allows you to store a set number of item in it like struts, fuel lines, solar panels, batteries, antennas, real small items that then require an EVA to have them attached to a craft. This would allow for some awesome orbital construction and get people out doing EVAs for reasons other than just mess around and get EVA reports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Do the modules have to be based off of current space technology? Can we be allowed to research more efficient types of propulsion, I mean if people are going to implement their own warp drive mods then why not a have a native rocket engine that is the pinnacle of rocketry research. An engine that, for one reason or another, can only be used in a vacuum. Again, just a thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Additional radial engines and maybe a another fuel tank twice the size of the orange tank? Maybe? Not sure about those, just a thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Make the Stowaway-10 module double as a research module allowing for its own chain of research hierarchy that can generate science points over time and requires the module to be in orbit and have at the least two Kerbals in it. Utilize the ground samples from other planets, other than Kerbin, to fuel the research requiring more ground samples and from different planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Implement the Smart A.S.S. from MechJeb to make general maneuvering a bit easier, some of the burns are really long burns and it would be really convenient to have at the least prograde and retrograde hold buttons for orbital maneuvering purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Unlabeled objects, like asteroids, that require a probe to detect them and then landed on them so they can be tracked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are just a few ideas, I know the development direction for KSP is not up to me, thats why I am developing my own game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E, but they are some observations I wanted to share and see what everyone else thinks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crush","CreatedById":59094,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T08:28:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you have multiple unrelated suggestions, you should break them up into multiple threads.
