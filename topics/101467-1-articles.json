The latter seems unlikely so I\u0027ll assume the former.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClockwise orbit isn\u0027t a problem. Just burn on the day side to get to outer planets (including Kerbin in this case), instead of the usual night side. As for the 45 degree inclination you have two options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Burn on the day side a couple of weeks before your planned departure day. Get your apoapsis quite high, but don\u0027t escape yet. Then, at apoapsis, plot a maneuver to correct your inclination. You\u0027ll need to use the pink markers for that. Get it as close to 0 as you can. It\u0027s unlikely you can get it completely flat, but it will not matter. When you reach periapsis again, just burn back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Just ignore it. Just plot a course for Kerbin, inclination be damned.
