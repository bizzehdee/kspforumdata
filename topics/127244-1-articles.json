I play to earn science, unlock nodes and reap the rewards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel that the game should begin with 1940\u0027s tech, and that it should start with giant leaps and bounds, with diminishing returns later on.

Maybe alternate, but after each level the science cost doubles and/or the buff is halved. Maybe a \u0027Materials\u0027 branch would make everything lighter and stronger. Maybe something to improve resource extraction, or funds / rep earnings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when the tech tree is complete, you can still progress and still have a reason to do science...

The KSP paradigm is that you do planetary science which somehow buys you technological improvements. Then, on top of this strange idea, the large majority of the \u0022tech tree\u0022 is in fact concurrent technology. First nuke in space, first solar panels, first manned capsule? All late 50s, very early 60s. The entire thing is screwy. The trouble from a game standpoint is that buying new tech is THE reward system in the game. People will chime in and tell us they play for different reasons, and that\u0027s fine, but studies of games have shown that players unconsciously play to the reward system, designers use this to create addictive games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are the options, assuming that the tech as reward is a desirable game element?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne would be a much wider (vertically wider assuming the same layout in R\u0026amp;D as we have now), flatter (less left to right) \u0022tree.\u0022 This presents the problem of \u0022cost,\u0022 as left to right in a science point increase.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo would be a change in the entire science/career/tech relationship. Perhaps breaking science into different kinds of science (spaceflight, planetary, and kerbal factors (health, etc). Have different tech require different balances of science points. A hitchhiker requires crewed time on orbit sorts of missions, landing legs might require some sort of planetary science (will the craft sink in the dust of the Mun?), new rocket engines might require parts testing on orbit, etc, and a capsule might require some of each. In addition, some tech might actually require specific missions, or might be made available as a test part, and only unlocked after it is tested someplace (drogue chute on Duna or something).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree, upgrades. At the very least, there could be a dichotomy between \u0022eXperimental\u0022 and \u0022production\u0022 parts. X parts are what is first unlocked, then they switch to production after some amount of use. Use can be defined a few ways, for engines it might be total seconds fired, weighted somewhat by where (ground/atmosphere/space), as well as unique crafts that have used the X engine, and perhaps some dedicated contacts/missions to test them. The production version would contain performance improvements over the X version. Such a framework could be used by mods as well, and those might add in reliability issues, ideally. Honestly, a chance of failure on X parts would be good, period.
