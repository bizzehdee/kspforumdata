Of course, it also adds a bit of a weight penalty.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Pt60z/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nI flew some simulations against my latest El Quicko variant (2 vulcans, no missiles), I found that the general course of events was that my fighter got to altitude a little before yours, allowing it to turn in and fire a (generally ineffective) vulcan burst, before the Naga began firing AIM-120\u0027s. So far it looks like the El Quicko can usually dodge the missiles (most often 6 of them) for long enough that the Naga gets too close and switches to guns, at which point the advantage seems to be solidly with the more maneuverable El Quicko, which was able to stay on the Naga\u0027s tail and eventually shoot it down. The Naga did display some impressive damage resistance though, often still fighting despite missing an engine and half a wing.\n\nSo if the initial missile attack failed, which, if the El Quicko was in the air first, it often did, as soon as the planes got too close for missiles, the result almost always went to the El Quicko, as it\u0027s superior maneuverability and acceleration meant it could prevent the Naga from escaping.\n\nThat is, if the initial missile attack failed. If it didn\u0027t, and the fight remained beyond about a kilometre, the Naga got the win very quickly. I\u0027m going to try giving the El Quicko some missiles of it\u0027s own and see if that changes anything.\n\nEDIT: I gave the El Quicko 2 AIM-120s and 4 Sidewinders, which actually made it\u0027s performance worse as while it tried to find a Sidewinder lock it was less able to evade missiles. I reduced it to just the 2 AIM-120s, which turned out to be very useful. If it gets to altitude to first - which it does most of the time, especially if it is the one activated first - and is able to turn onto the Naga and fire them off before the Naga can return fire, and the Naga is generally unable to avoid the missiles. I strongly suggest you work on it\u0027s missile avoidance ability, as in an AIM-120 fight, unless it fires the first shot, it seems to have no chance of successfully evading. \n\nIf the Naga got to shoot first, the El Quicko was forced to evade, preventing it from returning fire whilst the Naga shot off all of it\u0027s AIM-120s. About half of the time the El Quicko was able to avoid every single missile, leaving the Naga with just it\u0027s gun while the El Quicko retained both it\u0027s missiles. When the AIM-120s did hit, it was usually with the last pair, when the El Quicko had already expended most of it\u0027s energy avoiding previous shots, suggesting that if the Naga was fighting a fighter with better missile avoidance ability it would have little chance of achieving a hit.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/aIPAO/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-03T14:31:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2016 02:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by BlueCanary**"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T14:42:50Z","Content":"[@BlueCanary](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/131301-bluecanary/) Have you tried angling the rear wings down on your craft?

But it has a rather slow turning speed (time it takes to do a full 360); even slower than my huge Taurus fighter-bomber. It does have a very small turning radius, but unfortunately, due to the way the AI programmed, this turns out to be more of an disadvantage, as the **very moment** the AI detects a missile, it begins turning, bleeding a LOT valuable speed (as mentioned above), and potentially orienting itself in an awkward position to dodge missiles because it turned too early.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Pretty good, otherwise! My suggestions are to turn down the steer factor a bit (I believe this determines the amount of power the AI applies to the elevons when turning), and re-add the second vulcan. Your plane would become a very competent gun fighting airplane if you were able to add another gun!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E And if you\u0027re going to add the second vulcan, place both vulcans on the sides of the fuselage. It will spread the shot and give your plane a firing cone, rather than a firing line. I\u0027ve also noticed this increases the range at which an aircraft fires on another aircraft with its guns.\n\u003E \n\nIn regards to Zahida\u0027s CF-59 Naga;  \n\nI concur with drtricky\u0027s statement. I did find it a difficult plane to combat against due to it\u0027s small turning radius and the copious amount of missiles it fires early on in the 1 vs 1 battle. I did have a plane that did have some success against it (My Warthog replica) but it was equipped with RADAR Jamming. After the missiles were fired, the Warthog could get a foothold and eventually win against it with guns only.  \n\nIt\u0027s a tough plane to tackle.
