Built the lander with the rover attached to the bottom and practiced flying the thing and landing it safely at home. Tried to get it into orbit, not enough DV so added some more solid boosters. Now it almost makes it to Low kerbin Orbit. I landed in the Desert without using the Parachutes and went on a drive in the rover, took some samples and Jeb and Bob took a dip in an Oasis. Got a fair bit of science for the Desert Biome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext built a launch vehicle which I thought would get me to Duna but I don\u0027t think I have enough fuel, so I left it in Orbit. Meanwhile I built a larger planetary tug which definitely has enough juice to get to Duna and back. After launching that docked in orbit, made the calculation for the burn to Duna and waited for the correct planetary alignment. Started my burn and the docked ship started wobbling alarmingly and the DV actually went up rather than down. Tried ramping up the thrust slowly but the oscillation just got worse and worse and then I ran out of fuel and my engine shut down where I noticed the fatal flaw in my design. My fuel pipes from the 4 big radial tanks were not connected, this must have happened while I was tweaking the design. So all stop and I started looking through the mods for a solution. Docking struts or Quantum struts would solve the wobble and KAS could be used to solve the fuel issue. So last night I started trying to get a repair mission started but decided to do something else so spent a few hours building planes and a flying bedstead and trying to land on the nearby island. I will hopefully get Jeb and Bob off to Duna today. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HavelockVetinari","CreatedById":90729,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T00:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is a monster.

My current cargo SSTO is twice as big as yours and it can only carry 2.5 tonnes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn efficient spaceplane is a small spaceplane. The most effective way to improve performance and capability is to get rid of unnecessary mass. Only when you\u0027ve removed everything you don\u0027t absolutely need should you consider adding things to further improve the design (even fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake engines, for instance... They are heavy. Having more than you really need is just adding more weight to lift. Not to mention, you need extra fuel to lift them, which just adds tankage and decreases your performance more. Fuel is also heavy... if you\u0027re carrying extra fuel to lift equipment you don\u0027t really need to have, you\u0027re reducing your efficiency as well as payload capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some of my other SSTO designs: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/SfO2Z#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBumblebee\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/z2gqN#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavelin\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/CjnOT#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStingray\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/9Lx7N#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESkate\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing they have in common is they use very few engines, and they use very small, lightweight rocket engines when an airbreathing-only jet engine is used for atmospheric flight. If you treat reducing engine-weight as the first place to seek improvement, it will lead to reduced fuel requirements as well as reduced structural requirements, which also reduces fuel requirements, all of which reduces wing-lift requirements, where less weight and drag further reduces fuel requirements... keep working through those iterations and before long you\u0027ve got a tiny plane that can do the same job as the big plane... or a big plane that can lift a lot more payload than before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-21T14:14:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2014 02:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aghanim","CreatedById":76587,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T14:23:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IE6GgLg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IE6GgLg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA newbie kerbal astronaut crashed his fuel tanker while Bob is standing there, guiding him to get closer to the SSTO for refuelling.

Checked on the map do discover my Lander, rover and planetary Tug had disappeared from LKO. Seems the Kraken has come visiting while I was away. Luckily I had a quicksave and F9 brought Jeb and Bob back with ship intact. Had another look at it and decided that I needed to rethink my strategy so I deorbited the tug followed by the lander and went through a practice landing back at Kerbal space center. Good thing too because for some reason the staging of my parachutes was messed up so I had to separate the capsule and manually deploy my chutes seconds from impact. Bob and Jeb got back in one piece but if I had tried to land on Duna the boys would now be stuck. Tried to build an even larger launcher to get the lander and enough fuel up in one go. This is proving to be a challenge to get into orbit because my middle stage just doesn\u0027t have enough power. I am trying to put up a large lander, rover and a lot of fuel. I think it\u0027s about 238 tons Now thinking that I maybe I should send a few science probes ahead first, get enough science and then send the boys when I have heavy rocketry on the Tech tree. or maybe I should just burn the fuel in the transfer stage launching it and refuel in orbit before pushing on to Duna.
