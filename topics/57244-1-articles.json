They are annoyingly close, and they have slow relativistic weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile our own civ has both a good grasp of antimatter, and drive systems that can reach up to 80%c.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an excercise of the readers phantasy, how would YOU destroy their main-planet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA possibility ofc would be a directional gamma-burst weapon, that can scorch a hemisphere free of life, use two, and the planet is well-cooked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would such a weapon work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically you would build two giant panels each about 1 LY away from the starsystem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe panels would consist of charged near 0 K cold graphene sheets both from matter and antimatter, maybe with additional containment and cooling equipment around. To fire the weapon the layers are charged in opposites, so it will ollapse layer by layer. In the annihilation, as we all know, per atom used, a high energy gamma particle is generated, using the geometry of the process, a relatively coherent beam could be generated. Now unfortunately it would have only 50% efficiency, but considering the energy, that would be more then enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option would be relativistic bombardment from far away. This too should best be done from a polar position relatively to the target system, just so that no other stellar bodies can come in the way, especially not those annyoing asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be done either with inert or AM-warhead projectiles. Why no fusion warheads you ask? Because at 80%c the energy density of about anything is higher then that provided by a fusionwarhed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you can be wiseass, and argue you could just use a composite, an APHE basically, but if you go for mass-bombardement, simple inert projectiles are just so much easier to make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal idea in that sense would be a relativistic SABOT-AMHE, basically it would be giant needle of tungsten, hundreds or maybe even thousends of meters in diameter, with a massive AM warhead in the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAim for the core, account for lead, and accelerate it to maximum speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the good old gravel-trick against it would require massive preparations for obvious reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen reaching it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s destination, the rod (hopefully) penetrates the crust and deep into the mantle, now i don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t think anyone safe for NASA can make halfway accurate calculations for penetration of a planet by a relativistic object, but i would assume it can actually reach the core, if we assume an earthlike planet with a thin crust and a lot of liquid mantle. Latter does have a pretty high density, but it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s still liquid, and thus relatively well penetratable, compared to a solid. Like the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point the AM warhead would be detonated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA core-internal detonation will first and formost, do all sorts of thing to the magnetic field, if it is broken with sufficeint power you have massive pieces of metal destabilizing the planet as they get pushed out by both centrifugal forces and the shockwave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, much less risky would be a core-near detonation. The hydrostatic effects of the mantle would conduct the shockwave straight to the crust, bursting it off, or at least destroying anything on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing estimates from this site \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacegunconvent.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacegunconvent.php\u003C/a\u003E 8,333Gt of antimatter would be required to fully blow the crust away from the planet, assuming similar-to-earth.
