Enter VAB or SPH\n\n(Create a new ship)\n\n2. select any root part\n\n3. attach some other part to it (like an SAS module or fuel tank)\n\n4. select \u0022Offset (2)\u0022\n\n5. Switch to \u0022Action Groups\u0022\n\n6. select any part\n\nresult:\n\n1. the part\u0027s action group features show in menu\n\n2. offset arrows are shown and part can be moved (I don\u0027t think this is intended nor necessary, but confusing for inexperienced players)\n\nThis isn\u0027t necessarily a bug nor is it game breaking, but I don\u0027t think this should happen. It could confuse people because things are happening where currently nothing should happen and it distracts from the actual action group UI. It can also lead to unwanted part movement while trying to select parts and problems of selecting parts because they are covered by the offset arrows.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T22:36:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rob3110**\n  \nadded version number"}]}
