I/O from RAM could be less frequent (and in larger chunks), though such operation is required for each thread being processed in parallel, meaning the improvement will be great when a single thread is active, not so much when all cores are working in parallel with different threads. Needless to say, the width and frequency of the main data bus (linking RAM and CPU) and sum of latency cycles with RAM chipset is what gives I/O performance: modern DDR4 SDRAM modules can transfer data at up to 4266MB/s (not-overclocked), which is vastly inferior to L3 speed. L1 and L2 cache speeds are clearly even faster then L3\u0027s, but their limited size means more frequent access to the slower external RAM. In the end, all the opcode/data is fetched from RAM, through the cache levels, to the ALU and registers in each CPU core: if there were no jumps in code, doing less often larger transfers (L3) or more frequent smaller ones (L2) wouldn\u0027t change CPU performance. But jumps make for non-linear access, and if the new position required wasn\u0027t yet loaded in cache, would require to wait until it is (more slowly) transferred from RAM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn practice, seems Ryzen\u0027s L3 common cache is underperforming when compared with Intel\u0027s PC (see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.techpowerup.com/231268/amds-ryzen-cache-analyzed-improvements-improveable-ccx-compromises\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Earticle here\u003C/a\u003E, i7 6900K L3 cache is faster in both read, write and definitely has less latency than that of a Ryzen7 1800X).

Of course, my experience is only one of thousand, if not millions, in the world, so it\u0027s not indicative of anything. I wouldn\u0027t be surprise if others had issues (but I haven\u0027t met many who went Intel with the MB as well. Most I know went with other OEMs like MSI, Gigabyte, etc.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow well a part can do its job is partially dependent on a user expectations and use case, so I can\u0027t really argue\u00A0anything there.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAthlon vs Celeron: Well, yeah, the Athlon would win. Anyone interested in tech knows that Celerons are barely a step above Atoms. (In fact, some Celerons ARE Atoms. Heck, might be all of them at this point. Haven\u0027t kept up with the extreme low-end lately.) This comparison isn\u0027t really useful since it\u0027s comparing two products targeting different markets. The equivalent AMD line would\u0027ve been the old Duron line. Athlons\u00A0were closer to the current Pentium brand\u00A0and the original Core2 series. (Remember, Athlons were the impetus for Intel to produce the Core-series.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI can\u0027t argue that because, technically, everything you said is or could be very much so true. (I don\u0027t play intensive games on PC nor do I have a Phenom, so I\u0027ll have to take you word there.)\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBut if I recall, the Phenoms weren\u0027t really competitive with Intel\u0027s top chips and the Phenoms were positioned to compete in the high-end. They were a good alternative, but not competitive. (Anyone with better memory or search skills, do correct me if I\u0027m wrong.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOpinion on AMD products, so no comment from me.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSame as above (Though I\u0027ve been an ATI/AMD GPU user for a long time...)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen did Intel ever say they had 8-cores?\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou have to be in their LGA2011vX platform to even consider that prospect.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the Core i7-series, it always stated as 4-core, 8-threads. (If anything, AMD was closer to lying with the whole \u0022module\u0022 design in Bulldozer. Those were not true cores the way they advertised them.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYour comment on i5\u0027s is half correct. The higher-end i5\u0027s DO have 4-cores (4-thread, no hyperthreading). Their low-end i5\u0027s mimicked the i3\u0027s at one point with 2-cores, 4-threads.\u00A0(Others: Is\u00A0that still the case now?) However, every tech spec from Intel makes it clear to me. If I had to blame anyone for lies, it would probably be bad retailers not know what they were talking about.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me make this clear: I\u0027m not really FOR OR AGAINST INTEL OR AMD in this discussion. Intel is my personal preference from over 15 years or experience with them. But I won\u0027t disagree with a comment about them if it\u0027s\u00A0a well-informed and formed argument with facts, data, and/or examples to back it up. (Just typing up the words doesn\u0027t make them fact.) I WANT AMD to success to drive down prices. That hasn\u0027t happened since the Core2 vs Athlon64 days. Ryzen is a glimmer of hope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI KNOW AMD has their good points and Intel its bad points, but please portray them in a manner that isn\u0027t overly argumentative or fairly clear in personal bias. Opinion may be louder than fact (because people tend to scream opinions), but fact holds far more weight (or so I like to believe...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, if I\u0027m factually wrong about something, do correct me.

I wouldn\u0027t be surprise if others had issues (but I haven\u0027t met many who went Intel with the MB as well. Most I know went with other OEMs like MSI, Gigabyte, etc.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow well a part can do its job is partially dependent on a user expectations and use case, so I can\u0027t really argue\u00A0anything there.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAthlon vs Celeron: Well, yeah, the Athlon would win. Anyone interested in tech knows that Celerons are barely a step above Atoms. (In fact, some Celerons ARE Atoms. Heck, might be all of them at this point. Haven\u0027t kept up with the extreme low-end lately.) This comparison isn\u0027t really useful since it\u0027s comparing two products targeting different markets. The equivalent AMD line would\u0027ve been the old Duron line. Athlons\u00A0were closer to the current Pentium brand\u00A0and the original Core2 series. (Remember, Athlons were the impetus for Intel to produce the Core-series.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI can\u0027t argue that because, technically, everything you said is or could be very much so true. (I don\u0027t play intensive games on PC nor do I have a Phenom, so I\u0027ll have to take you word there.)\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBut if I recall, the Phenoms weren\u0027t really competitive with Intel\u0027s top chips and the Phenoms were positioned to compete in the high-end. They were a good alternative, but not competitive. (Anyone with better memory or search skills, do correct me if I\u0027m wrong.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOpinion on AMD products, so no comment from me.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSame as above (Though I\u0027ve been an ATI/AMD GPU user for a long time...)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen did Intel ever say they had 8-cores?\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou have to be in their LGA2011vX platform to even consider that prospect.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the Core i7-series, it always stated as 4-core, 8-threads. (If anything, AMD was closer to lying with the whole \u0022module\u0022 design in Bulldozer. Those were not true cores the way they advertised them.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYour comment on i5\u0027s is half correct. The higher-end i5\u0027s DO have 4-cores (4-thread, no hyperthreading). Their low-end i5\u0027s mimicked the i3\u0027s at one point with 2-cores, 4-threads.\u00A0(Others: Is\u00A0that still the case now?) However, every tech spec from Intel makes it clear to me. If I had to blame anyone for lies, it would probably be bad retailers not know what they were talking about.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me make this clear: I\u0027m not really FOR OR AGAINST INTEL OR AMD in this discussion. Intel is my personal preference from over 15 years or experience with them. But I won\u0027t disagree with a comment about them if it\u0027s\u00A0a well-informed and formed argument with facts, data, and/or examples to back it up. (Just typing up the words doesn\u0027t make them fact.) I WANT AMD to success to drive down prices. That hasn\u0027t happened since the Core2 vs Athlon64 days. Ryzen is a glimmer of hope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI KNOW AMD has their good points and Intel its bad points, but please portray them in a manner that isn\u0027t overly argumentative or fairly clear in personal bias. Opinion may be louder than fact (because people tend to scream opinions), but fact holds far more weight (or so I like to believe...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, if I\u0027m factually wrong about something, do correct me.

AMD is marketing Ryzen in a style similar to Intel\u0027s branding. It should have been a i7-7700K vesus Ryzen 7-1800x. The Ryzen 5-series seem to targeting the i5 market.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem for Ryzen in terms of KSP is\u00A0that KSP is mostly single-thread limited (the physics). Clock-for-clock, Ryzen seems to have a 10% or so deficit in IPC versus Intel. They attempt to make up for it with more cores. So it\u0027s a problem of Single- vs Multi-threaded performance and KSP can\u0027t take advantage of that many cores to boost performance better than just raw single-threaded performance. The larger L3 cache helps (less hits to main Memory), but KSP is a memory hog as well, so you\u0027ll be hitting main system RAM often anyway. (I can\u0027t imagine ALL the physics calculation being able to fit into 16MB.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want good performance for a limited budget, Ryzen is great. If you\u0027re trying to justify Ryzen on just performance, then that depends on your typical use-case and workload. For KSP, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s beneficial. You\u0027d need a bigger cache. And that cache won\u0027t help much when you need to brute-force physics calculations on a large vessel or multiple complex vessels within physics range. (You might\u00A0get a slight boost from the lower latency, but you\u0027ll still be limited by raw CPU throughput.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh... Wait... I think Ryzen could help with multi-vessel scenarios, now that I think about it. Don\u0027t separate vessels get their own thread? (Though it\u0027d only help if you had lots of vessel within physics range of one another if that\u0027s the case.) The limiting factor there is the largest, most complex vessel in the scene. Though 90% of the time I think users would just be dealing with one or\u00A0two vessels. I think you\u0027d be better off trying to find and use the highest performing/clocked CPU instead of worrying about it\u0027s cache.
