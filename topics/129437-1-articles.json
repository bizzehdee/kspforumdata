A real-world space battle would see some tactics that have not been in any sci-fi stories that I know of. Por ejemplo, when on the attack, your fleet could spend half an hour accelerating towards the target at four G\u0027s, so that by the time you reach firing range you\u0027re travelling at (here it comes!) ridiculous speed (lol). Human-crewed starships can travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light--it\u0027s the acceleration that has to be controlled so the crew doesn\u0027t find themselves a little shorter at the end of the trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of the sci-fi books I\u0027ve read (which is a lot) have this kind of tactics in them. And cartoons, TV shows, and movies will certainly never show these tactics because then the audience can\u0027t see what the hell is going on. Any show that uses autonomous drones or remote-controlled ships comes close to being realistic, except that drones and remotes are never flown at their full capabilities (again, because that would be too fast for the viewer to keep up with).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I\u0027ve written a couple of sci-fi stories of my own where the human race used artificial gravity to propel their ships--which allowed them to accelerate at thousands of G\u0027s without the crews even spilling their coffee.
