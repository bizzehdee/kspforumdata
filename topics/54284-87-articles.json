Before I start, I have no experience with Unity, and only a little with C#, though I do have about 20 years of other programming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter reading, it looks like it takes the position of the stake (stake.vessel.GetWorldPos3D) sums them up and get an average in the \u0022Points\u0022 function. Later, it calls \u0022GetOrientation\u0022 which calls \u0022GetDirection\u0022. Since the average in \u0022Points\u0022 is based on there physical position and angle, and your stakes are likely all placed at the same angle in the ground, \u0022GetDirection\u0022 will always be 0. The only way it wouldn\u0027t be is if you place the X/Y/Y stakes on a piece of ground that has a different angle to it.

Then you don\u0027t need \u002B/- stakes, could just enter -90 or whatever into the name. If for some reason a person puts down more then 1 stake for the same axis, just sum them up.

If there is 1 Origin stake, it\u0027s easy, just use the Pitch\u002BRoll orientation of the stake as the default orientation. If there is more then 1, it gets a bit more complex, but still doable. With 3 or more, you can work out the average slope to the centre, and define a plane base on that. This \u0022could\u0022 still result in our craft being placed in the ground with poorly placed stakes. eg, stakes placed around the base of a hill. Of course, if you do that, you deserve to have your craft rapidly de-construct.
