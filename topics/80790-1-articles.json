The problem is that it can barely move. I just changed rescale factor and mass, now it weights 0.95t, and it can\u0060t drive up the launch pad using 6 Rovemax M1 ...

I\u0027ve done some experiments with a 48-7S facing upward and throttle limited to some very low value to provide increased traction, but decided it wasn\u0027t really worth it on the types of rovers I was building. Maybe it will be more beneficial to your ultralight design. Could angle it backward as well to provide a little forward thrust if you still can\u0027t top the hills. Also, maybe the different wheels will give you better results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T10:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo real solution, but a general idea: in my experience, the \u0022TR2L Ruggedized Vehicular Wheels\u0022 have vastly superior grip. They still suffer badly when in low-g, but there is a notable difference in performance. My Minmus rover could accelerate twice as fast with TR2Ls compared to M1s; given the abysmal performance of M1s, twice as much still ain\u0027t good, of course. And when trying to make a turn, there was a visible effect; again not much, but far superior to M1s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking in the part files, I see this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E//M1\u003Cbr\u003E\ttorqueCurve\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t  key = 0 250 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t  key = 20  100 0\u003Cbr\u003E          key = 30 14 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t  key = 34 0 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E//TR2L\u003Cbr\u003E\ttorqueCurve\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t  key = 0 100 0 0 \u003Cbr\u003E\t  key = 2.5 70 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t  key = 30 0 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and can\u0027t make much sense of it.
