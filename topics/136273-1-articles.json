know, I\u0027ve been thinking around, its so cool the main fact that you can visit any planet, land on it and take of all the way to home... yea thats the issue, what if I want to stay on a planet? there\u0027s nothing to do with it, I could make a base and that would be pointless, and I was thinking this while I was playing an other game when the light hit me, I don\u0027t have the time to create such a big mod, but it would fit into KSP thematic and it would be just thrilling and exciting to\u00A0design a vessel the best you can and create a base, it would have sense, so here\u0027s the idea....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of, the actual \u0022resources mining\u0022 mechanic would have to be diversified, lets add iron, rare metals, water, etc... the point of this its to force the player to have multiple facilities distribuyed around the planet or even multiple moons, on this point you could sell resources for\u00A0money if you somehow land the containers on kerbin, making the contract useful\u00A0just at the begining with increasing prices on development and high tech things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext step, factories, biodomes and living modules, this one its easy, in order to build anything you need some sort of factory, to make the factory work you need workers and to have workers you have to feed them, so this would has to have some sort of balance, but this would be your main colony where, here, kerbals has to come from somewhere, in other words you have to bring them each one of them until you have come to the next mechanic because so far its just standar KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFactories need also resources, specially metals,\u00A0propellant and energy, so here its where the real mechanic comes in place, in order to run a factory first of you have to dock a vehicle into the factory module, then press a \u0022record mission\u0022 button where it will automatically undock then you have to fly to a resource mining station, dock, get the resources and back to the factory, once docked the game will record the resources used to make the travel and you can then assign the vessel to \u0022patrol\u0022 mission making a virtual version of the vessel (not in game but simulated as a route, similar to rts traders to save memory) and each time it makes some travel it will add and reduce the resources from the stock on the factory module, this would automate\u00A0the resources gattering avoiding getting the player bored with repetitive missions, then if you want more vessels on the same route you just have to create and assign more of the same vessel to that particular route, this way you could stablish a global market network, where you can also automate the travel to sell this things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, the space port module, once you have factories, you can send the parts to the space port where you can build your rockets anywhere you like, even in orbit if you somehow managed to get the parts in there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this you could exponentially do anything you would like, like simulate space tourism, create a growing colony, simulate\u00A0cities on kerbin (since it would make sence that this routing system would have been already stablished on kerbin from the first day), and many other things....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust thinking this would fill all the void and make some really interesting game mechanics,... hope you like some of
