It will be very helpful when official multiplayer will be in the game, so players don\u0027t need to search for mods that are installed on server, that we want to join, they just need to simply click on sever and mods will updated/downloaded automatically like they did it in Space Engineers, where you can browse mods from Steam Workshop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeatures that we need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - In-game Curse/Kerbal Stuff mod browser downloader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Game checks for updates at startup and asks ypu if you want to download them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Mods list that will allow you to enable, disable or uninstall mods, that you want to use on your singleplayer.

It will slow down the modding process a great deal, not only that but any problems that arise from this way of installing mods are just another forum that will generate bug reports from users unrelated to the function of the mod. There is a reason modders don\u0027t like steam workshop-like mod repositories. It just installs mods without any checking for any incompatibilities, not only that but all mods would need to conform to the same folder structure and placement. And if something goes wrong with the auto-installer people will flock to the mod maker and complain about problems when it isn\u0027t their problem or fault and can\u0027t do anything about it. It simplifies the process too much, if someone can\u0027t copy and paste a simple folder they shouldn\u0027t be installing mods in the first place, there are enough clueless people around already causing problems for the mod makers and this will exacerbate the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you mentioned steam workshop, it is a perfect example of this. Nothing but problems for the people creating the mods, screaming/whining people who download those mods and tons of incompatibility/gamebreaking problems.
