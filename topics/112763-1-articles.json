If your part is hollow, you will need to manually adjust its cube. That\u0027s why hollow parts have custom cubes defined in their part cfgs.\n\u003E In particular, for a stackmounted hollow part, change the Y\u002B and Y- area values (the first numbers in the third and fourth groupings) to be the area for a non-hollow version of that part.\n\nand\n\n\u003E \n\u003E the first six triplets are X\u002B, X-, Y\u002B, Y-, Z\u002B, Z- faces of the cube. The numbers are area, drag coefficient, and depth of widest point from the frontmost point at that angle. The nextr triplet is the bounds center, the final is the bounds extents.\n\nbut\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ah crap, so I do need to include them then. It\u0027s my hollow cargo bays that I\u0027m concerned about. I\u0027m assuming that the \u0022A\u0022 and \u0022B\u0022 versions are for with the doors open and closed.\n\u003E Is there a way to view the calculated version so I can just tweak that to insert in the configs?\n\nThen, I took a look at the part configs for all the Squad cargo bays and air intakes, and came up with the following:\n\nSQUAD INTAKES AND CARGO BAYS WITH CUSTOM DRAG CUBES:\n\ncircularIntake\n\nmk2CargoBayS\n\nmk2CargoBayL\n\nSQUAD INTAKES AND CARGO BAYS WITHOUT CUSTOM DRAG CUBES:\n\nmk3CargoBayS\n\nmk3CargoBayM\n\nmk3CargoBayL\n\nServiceBay\\_125\n\nServiceBay\\_250\n\nairScoop\n\nradialEngineBody\n\nnacelleBody\n\nIntakeRadialLong\n\nramAirIntake\n\nFrom that thread I quoted, and a quick perusal of the part configs, I was left with some questions that weren\u0027t answered:\n\nWhat determines which parts have custom drag cubes, and which don\u0027t? Most don\u0027t. How do I determine if I need to add a custom drag cube?\n\nThen, if I *do* need to create custom drag cubes:\n\nI am updating parts for 1.0 that I didn\u0027t originally create. These include air intakes and cargo bays. What is the best way to get at the values KSP uses to automatically generate drag cubes?\n\nIs it useful to see the KSP-generated drag cube values?\n\nIf so, is there an easy way to see the generated values?\n\nAlso, what is the first value of the custom drag cube? On the circular intake, with only one custom drag cube, it\u0027s \u0022Default,\u0022 and on the mk2cargobays, with two custom drag cubes, they are \u0022A\u0022 and \u0022B.\u0022 What do they mean?"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T21:27:31Z","Content":"What determines if a part has a custom dragcube entry is \u0022if it needs it, and someone remembers to give it one.\u0022 ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nFor example, the Mk3 cargo bays should have them, but that didn\u0027t make it in 1.0.2.

If the part is hollow like a Mkx cargo bay or decoupler, it definitely needs a custom dragcube.\n\n2. If a part is not hollow, but \u0022should be\u0022 -- like an intake--then it probably needs a custom cube.\n\nHere\u0027s how you do it:\n\n1. Make the part, export it, make the cfg (without any cube overrides)\n\n2. Start up KSP. That will generate an entry in PartDatabase.cfg\n\n3. Copy the entry into the part.cfg file\n\n4. (if part is hollow): Edit the facings that are hollow based on similar facings from parts that are not hollow. I.e. for cargo bays and decouplers, copy the \u002BY and -Y triplets from a similar-stack-size tank. If the part is not hollow in terms of mesh, but should be (in terms of it being an intake with a flat black section that\u0027s supposed to represent a hole), you play with the drag coefficient (second number in the triplet) in the intake\u0027s incoming axis."},{"CreatedByName":"Gryphon","CreatedById":58513,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T13:18:05Z","Content":"Excellent! that seems quite clear to me.
