for bump-stop/over-compression prevention they work well for stopping the compression, however I have not yet found a way to derive what suspension force should be used in such situations (have some ideas to investigate though).\u00A0 For sticky friction they also work well; the problem then becomes how to allow the suspension to still function; they could potentially be \u0027lowered into place\u0027 when sticky friction needs to be enabled (thus effectively disabling the suspension)... the problem then is detecting when they should be removed and the suspension (and dynamic friction) restored.\u00A0 However, using real colliders does appear to be the best solution for \u0027locked suspension\u0027 for landing gear and the like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other problem that I\u0027m encountering, as far as implementation in KSP is concerned, is regarding damping ratios.\u00A0 Anytime I set up the damper coefficient to be anything close to \u0027critically damped\u0027 the entire system begins jittering and oscillating; this problem does not manifest in my test cases in the Unity-Editor, so I\u0027m thinking that it is being caused by the fixed-joints between the wheel parts and the fuselage part(s).\u00A0 Will be putting together some jointed-rigidbody vehicle test cases in the Unity editor to see if I can duplicate the problem there, and how/where best to solve it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least the friction model seems to work well for dynamic friction, and the suspension works well for the most part \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 (still some quirks regarding instant-compression resulting in very large forces... but apparently this is also a problem with the U5/physx wheel-collider setup....).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-20T18:56:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay... so more investigation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan confirm that the oscillation problems as seen in KSP are caused by the physics joints between the wheel part and the body, specifically when the wheel-parts\u0027 rigidbody mass is a small fraction of the mass of the main body part (as is typical for wheels...).\u00A0 Anytime damping approaches critical (c \u0026gt;
