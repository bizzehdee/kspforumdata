I read through tons of forums saying that you should put aerodynamic fins but none of that worked. I tried with tons of different rockets and it didn\u0027t work. I even downloaded a Mun Rocket and the gravity turn still isn\u0027t working. I even tried using MechJeb and still not working.

Craft with a higher TWR have to turn more aggressively and also have greater aerodynamic forces applied, so a high TWR craft that isn\u0027t aerodynamic is actually rather hard to get into orbit efficiently because the only time you can safely turn more than a few degrees away from prograde is before you pick up too much speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor most of my craft that keep the TWR between 1.4 and 1.8, I find that tipping one degree when the craft reaches 35 m/s, a second degree at about 65 m/s, and a third at about 85 m/s. past 110m/s, I just follow the prograde marker. If I got the early part right, I tend to hit 10 degrees pitch from vertical at about 3500-4000m altitude, and 35 degrees pitch at about 9500-12000m. This is the ascent profile that tends to work best with my craft that like to flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your craft can safely turn farther off of prograde, you can wait longer and pitch over farther, but I still wouldn\u0027t expect to be able to pitch over more than 10 degrees off of prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LukeTheZuke","CreatedById":143703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T02:29:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys,it was actually the \u0022old rule-of-thumb\u0022 that was screwing me over.

I was so caught up into the \u0022How to get into Orbit in Kerbal Space Program\u0022 videos that I didn\u0027t think about experimenting with the other stuff. I know Turn a good bit at 6,000 altitude and it gets me into orbit, longer than usual but I now know I can experiment to understand more about getting into Orbit and stuff. I thought I was quite good but then I saw the replies in my thread.

Occasionally it will also work to just keel over right above the launch pad like 5 -10 degrees so the excessive thrust at least goes somewhat in the right direction. It\u0060ll then be easier to turn the rest of the way higher up. Early on I managed to get a few rockets up that way. The best ascent vector is entirely dependent on the craft. Ideally you want some initial altitude to get as much thrust out of the launch phase as possible. But the degrees don\u0060t really matter so much, as long as you make a straight line somewhere. What matters is the curve of your beginning orbit, which is a function of your velocity and angle. If you have a slow second stage you need to keep your nose higher to gain altitude and if you have a fast engine you can just flop down to the equator and stay there as soon as the boosters drop. With the medium engines you can actually circularize your orbit directly from launch because you are able to keep up with the apogee of your orbit. Ideally you should be about 40-50 seconds behind it. Any less and you\u0060re losing altitude. Any more and you\u0060re too steep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if you\u0060re too steep it\u0060s either because you\u0060re using the \u0022Reliant\u0022 which doesn\u0060t come with steering, because you\u0060re not using fins at the bottom of the craft or because you\u0060ve overdone it on boosters. But like I said, you can sometimes overcome it by leaning off the launchpad so you get started on the general angle you want as early as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T23:56:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 11:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fishslap\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
