I read through tons of forums saying that you should put aerodynamic fins but none of that worked. I tried with tons of different rockets and it didn\u0027t work. I even downloaded a Mun Rocket and the gravity turn still isn\u0027t working. I even tried using MechJeb and still not working. Can anyone help me?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T02:30:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 02:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LukeTheZuke**"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T01:09:13Z","Content":"You need to add some pics of your craft, and describe how you\u0027re trying to fly it now.

You want to make an immediate turn off the launch pad of, oh, about 5 degrees, and then continue turning as your rocket flies. Never really getting out of the prograde circle, but continually getting further from the vertical as it moves, and thus approaching horizontal as you approach your desired orbital height.\n\nBeyond that, we\u0027ll need to see the rocket you\u0027re having trouble with."},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T01:20:27Z","Content":"What ascent profile are you trying to do? If it\u0027s the old \u002210km up then pitch 45 degrees\u0022 then that\u0027s not likely to work.\n\nWhat ascent profile works is really a per-craft thing depending on the aerodynamic efficiency and TWR of the craft. Craft with a higher TWR have to turn more aggressively and also have greater aerodynamic forces applied, so a high TWR craft that isn\u0027t aerodynamic is actually rather hard to get into orbit efficiently because the only time you can safely turn more than a few degrees away from prograde is before you pick up too much speed.\n\nFor most of my craft that keep the TWR between 1.4 and 1.8, I find that tipping one degree when the craft reaches 35 m/s, a second degree at about 65 m/s, and a third at about 85 m/s. past 110m/s, I just follow the prograde marker. If I got the early part right, I tend to hit 10 degrees pitch from vertical at about 3500-4000m altitude, and 35 degrees pitch at about 9500-12000m. This is the ascent profile that tends to work best with my craft that like to flip.\n\nIf your craft can safely turn farther off of prograde, you can wait longer and pitch over farther, but I still wouldn\u0027t expect to be able to pitch over more than 10 degrees off of prograde."},{"CreatedByName":"LukeTheZuke","CreatedById":143703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T02:29:39Z","Content":"Thanks guys,it was actually the \u0022old rule-of-thumb\u0022 that was screwing me over. I understand alot more about how to get in orbit now that I understood how you guys did it. I was so caught up into the \u0022How to get into Orbit in Kerbal Space Program\u0022 videos that I didn\u0027t think about experimenting with the other stuff. I know Turn a good bit at 6,000 altitude and it gets me into orbit, longer than usual but I now know I can experiment to understand more about getting into Orbit and stuff. I thought I was quite good but then I saw the replies in my thread. Anyways thank you guys, I fixed the problem ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Jim","CreatedById":142312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:51:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You want to make an immediate turn off the launch pad of, oh, about 5 degrees, and then continue turning as your rocket flies.

Also, I often turn off SAS after the turn, and let the natural aerodynamics take over (winglets really help here)."},{"CreatedByName":"Fishslap","CreatedById":143204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T22:34:18Z","Content":"You can reduce the amount of boosters, scale them down by right clicking them or add fins to the bottom of the core launch engine for maneuverability. Occasionally it will also work to just keel over right above the launch pad like 5 -10 degrees so the excessive thrust at least goes somewhat in the right direction. It\u0060ll then be easier to turn the rest of the way higher up. Early on I managed to get a few rockets up that way. The best ascent vector is entirely dependent on the craft. Ideally you want some initial altitude to get as much thrust out of the launch phase as possible. But the degrees don\u0060t really matter so much, as long as you make a straight line somewhere. What matters is the curve of your beginning orbit, which is a function of your velocity and angle. If you have a slow second stage you need to keep your nose higher to gain altitude and if you have a fast engine you can just flop down to the equator and stay there as soon as the boosters drop. With the medium engines you can actually circularize your orbit directly from launch because you are able to keep up with the apogee of your orbit. Ideally you should be about 40-50 seconds behind it. Any less and you\u0060re losing altitude. Any more and you\u0060re too steep.\n\nAnyway, if you\u0060re too steep it\u0060s either because you\u0060re using the \u0022Reliant\u0022 which doesn\u0060t come with steering, because you\u0060re not using fins at the bottom of the craft or because you\u0060ve overdone it on boosters. But like I said, you can sometimes overcome it by leaning off the launchpad so you get started on the general angle you want as early as possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T23:56:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 11:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fishslap**"}]}
