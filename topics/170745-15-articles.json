Just recently, I tried to send a scansat to minmus and somehow decided it would be smart to use the universal storage 2.5m to 1.875m service bay as an interstage fairing. Because the upper stage engine had a rather large bell, and because the service module has some little frame thingies to help hold the wedges,\u00A0the service bay latched on tight after being decoupled, and because it\u2019s rather heat resistant and the engine was a vacuum engine\u00A0the engine could not blow it up even at full throttle. Fortunately, there was still enough time to revert to vehicle assembly and use an actual fairing, after which time the mission went smoothly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-26T16:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReviving this one with a recent addition...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDecided to use the Delta parts from Bluedog Design Bureau to make a Delta III lower section to toss a crew capsule into orbit.
