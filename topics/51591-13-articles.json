It adds flexibility, and properly balanced it should add a meaningful choice to a player\u0027s arsenal of choices when it comes to phoning home. If you land on the edge of the right crater on Mun you can get three or four biomes in a single pack of fuel; transmitting reports back could be a fun way to avoid having to go back to refill your magical fuel pack between steps (at the cost of not getting much / any science for the surface samples). It has other uses for smaller moons; now that Gilly has biomes, an EVA Kerbal could theoretically explore the whole thing! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, balancing it right now is a real problem. Since I\u0027m not currently modeling ElectricCharge use all the way down the relay chain, there has to be a reason that you wouldn\u0027t want to get out of your ship, grab all of your science, and transmit it for next-to-nothing from your EVA Kerbal. So, I could make the EVA transmitter really inefficient: I could give it a ludicrously high power input, or a really slow data rate, or some combination of the two. But, that\u0027s not fun at all. No one wants to sit there for 5 minutes while your Kerbal phones home six saved Gravioli experiments. It\u0027s also not very realistic; a short range radio on an EVA suit would have a comparatively low power draw versus a shipboard transmitter (perhaps not \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E much lower; after all even Voyager is basically whispering back to us, but that\u0027s not my problem right now).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterplay with life support mods that require ElectricCharge for EVA Kerbals to survive is also not trivial. TACLS fills Kerbals up with 91.8 ElectricCharge, which as I read it should be enough to last six hours. IFILS gives them about 1 ElectricCharge, if I\u0027m reading the code right, and that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E enough to last six hours. These very different ideas on what one \u0022ElectricCharge\u0022 really stands for makes it pretty impossible for me to present a general case. Let\u0027s say I want to balance the EVA radios to get about 6 transmissions on a full EVA battery, and I also want it to be a little less efficient than the on-ship monopole. The monopole costs 5 EC/MiT, so we\u0027ll have the EVA radio cost 6 EC/MiT. An EVA report is about 8 MiTs; 6 reports \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 8 MiTs \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 6 EC/MiT = 288 EC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this is already a problem. If I add that much battery, TAC\u0027s EVA batteries will support the Kerbal for over three days. IFI will have enough charge to support the Kerbal for a very long time, indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, how much is this actually a problem? It\u0027s tough to say. EVA Kerbals don\u0027t have any way of replenishing their stores that can\u0027t also restore their electric charge. Most ships can freely generate infinite charge given time, so ElectricCharge is almost certainly not the limiting factor in how long an EVA Kerbal can survive. But, TaranisElsu and Stavell both think it\u0027s relevant enough to model, so I\u0027d like to avoid stepping on their toes where I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in general, I feel like the right way to balance this is to model charge use down the relay chain. Then I can make transmitting from the suit basically free; I can rate it way down for IFI and make it a little bigger with TAC and pick some arbitrary number of my own when neither of them are present. It\u0027ll still work out OK because you\u0027re still paying to send it from your nearby craft, so transmission will ultimately be valued by the quality of your connections all the way home and the amount of charge your various relays can generate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with that is KSP doesn\u0027t make that easy. The good news is that jamespicone has written a BackgroundProcessing mod that could be a good solution. The bad news there is that would mean a complete rewrite of the transmission code to make it more robust, more tolerant of outages, and applicable to the BackgroundProcessing model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Balancing EVA radios is important to gameplay. I only see one good option, and it\u0027s not an easy one, which means it will take time to get done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-16T16:42:41Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2014 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by toadicus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded exploit explanation.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John Nowak","CreatedById":67890,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T00:42:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rules for broadcasting science already beg for some rework. \u0022Jeb, we want you to EVA over to the thermometer.

Hmm. At this point, the lines wouldn\u0027t actually do that. Relays don\u0027t connect to each other in AR the way they do in RT; everything paths back to Kerbin as directly as it can. All three of your satellites would show a line going straight to the center of Kerbin, which would pretty certainly be a better path for any of them than relaying through each other.

Back in the days of the first manned spaceflights, NASA was not dependent upon space-based infrastructure to talk to their pilots, but also had more than a 10 minute window to do so while they whizzed over Texas every hour or two. They used \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Space_Flight_Network\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esurface-based infrastructure\u003C/a\u003E to effect these early communications. The Apollo missions going all the way to the Moon also used surface-based infrastructure. IMO it\u0027s unreasonable to assume that the Kerbals do not have similar capacities even at the very start of a career save.\u003Cp\u003EWere I to add such a limitation, I probably would actually not allow any artificial point on Kerbin to act as a relay. Instead, I\u0027d require that an antenna be installed suitably close to KSC as \u0022the KSC relay\u0022, and thus require the player to develop every single point of communications infrastructure -- even the \u0022home base\u0022 antenna. But, IMO, that is not a fun or interesting requirement. Sending suborbital missions comprising an antenna on a parachute isn\u0027t challenging enough to be a fun task, and doesn\u0027t really contribute to the development of a meaningful skillset in terms of gameplay. If it\u0027s not well-founded in the \u0022reality\u0022 of the game world, isn\u0027t fun, and isn\u0027t educational, it\u0027s just busywork for its own sake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI welcome discussion on this topic.
