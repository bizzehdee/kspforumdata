Make sure your retro-rockets are pointing the correct way and fly all the way down pointing towards retrograde. When you start to see ground scatter (if you have that turned on) start throttling up until you\u0027re going between 25 - 75 m/s, when you start to see your shadow throttle even further up until your going around 10 - 15 m/s, when you\u0027re almost there decrease your speed to around 2.5 - 5 m/s.
