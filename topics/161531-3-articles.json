Most of the stock chemical engines that are good for launch stages have a TWR of 20-30, and a much higher TOTAL Thrust, so it\u0027s actually still an inferior option for a launch engine in most cases, despite the higher ISP (just as the Timberwind was inferior to most chemical engines).

The ability to build a rocket fuel tank as large as you need it (in Career Mode, only once you unlock Metamaterials for unlimited size) instead of having to stack 5 tanks on top of each other will help your part-count IMMENSELY. Instead of building rockets with tons of radial boosters, get in the habit of building a single monolothic stack, like in real life (FAR will also *LOVE* your for it- you suffer drag not just due to cross-sectional area but also due to total surface-area, and larger tanks have proportionally less surface area due to the Square-Cube Law...) Procedural Parts will also allow you to delete most fuel tanks from stock and mods from your GameData folder, as you can re-create the same shape\u002Bcapacity (or any other one you like) at-will...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree, get Procedural Fairings. I know you may like having 20 different fairing options and *only* those options with KW Rocketry, but the reduction in the number of parts your game has to load (in the catalog and memory, even if not currently in-use) and in the part-count on your craft will help IMMENSELY. This is why I would have been VERY angry if Squad hadn\u0027t gone procedural with the fairings- fairings are especially CPU-intensive (the calculations for aerodynamic shielding aren\u0027t free), and the performance of KSP is already bad enough as-is...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jinks\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jinks\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou\u0027re right, I mostly stick to the low-tech KSPI parts anyway because they are powerful enough for 80% of use-cases.\u003Cp\u003EKSPI has had quite a rocky history so far.

One major change will be to replace the current LiquidFuel and Oxidiser by their real counterparts Liquid Hydrogen and Liquid Oxygen. These require much larger tanks, and active cooling. So although your rocket engines are more powerfull, your also require much larger (and heavier tanks) and active cooling to prevent them from boiling off.

Additionally, fully-realistic balance is even better than in RealFuels\u002BStockalike, as the real engine has a Thrust rating *nearly an order of magnitude* greater than the version used in RealFuels\u002BStockalike (which is itself up-rated vs. the original in KSP-I to more or less match real-world TWR and ISP) although with the same TWR (in short, the engine is much more powerful but heavier than in RealFuels\u002BStockalike...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.P.S. Note that there are now *TWO* different versions of the Raptor engine under development in real life. One, which is optimized for vacuum-performance (mainly, it has a much larger nozzle ExitArea for higher Vacuum ISP) and would have a Vacuum ISP of 380 seconds, and another which is optimized for use as a launch-stage (meaning it is optimized for performance about 10-12 km off the ground) and has a sea-level ISP of 321 seconds, and a Vacuum ISP of 363 seconds. The RealFuels\u002BStockalike version was balanced against the Vacuum Version, as the data for this one was more widely-available at the time of the creation of the KSP-I engine config for RealFuels\u002BStockalike...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe data on Wikipedia is a little messed-up as it lists the Thrust data for the vacuum-optimized version, but the ISP data for the sea-level version. You can confirm this if you divide Vacuum Thrust/ Sea-Level Thrust, which yields a value of 0.8415, and an expected sea-level ISP of only 305 seconds instead of the 321 seconds listed... (either the listed Vacuum Thrust is too high, or the Sea-Level Thrust too low, for the Vacuum Version. Likely a combination of both, as having a smaller nozzle reduces your Vacuum Thrust but raises you Sea-Level Thrust...)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T21:26:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceHungryMan","CreatedById":131414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T17:29:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see.
