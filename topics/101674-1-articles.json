Now, this was the evening after I had finished my school, including dreaded 1980s A Beka Algebra II book with lessons such as... \u0022Precision in Measurement\u0022, which at first glance looks like the unspoken rules of social normalities in Math, equivalent to, for example, the unspoken social rule of when to use \u0022lol\u0022 in any common conversation, digital or not. The kind of thing that has a ridiculous amount of importance in common Math, but you just have to learn by reading the crappiest explanation ever and stumbling through how to use it like any other social rule. So, just a quick perspective on Math from me. So, we go to the giant whiteboard in our hallway for this kind of thing, and start factoring polynomials... \u0022just for fun\u0022. Another quick note, both my brother and dad are math majors and think it\u0027s just the coolest thing ever. Don\u0027t get me wrong, it\u0027s cool to me too... in KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then, he gets an idea. He looks up physics and math curriculum and came up with just playing with different values of position, speed, acceleration, time, etc. and we graph different speeds and acceleration, on a graph of X Time, and Y Position. Then, we played around with 3 cars: Car A is going slow and speeds up. Car B is going a constant speed the whole time. Car C starts fast and slows down. We graph those, and they all meet at a certain position, and a certain time, and just kinda play around with different aspects of the graph, blah blah blah. Fun stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, I thought, since my dad is my \u0022Math tutor\u0022(he does a better job than my brother, so most of the time I need him) and works on and off doing contract IT work, sometime\u0027s he\u0027s here to help, sometimes not. So I figured, when he\u0027s not here, I could do some more \u0022fun math\u0022. So, I had an idea to play around with graphing values of Thrust to Weight, or TWR to time, as your TWR gets better as time passes from dropping stages or whatever. So, I\u0027m not an expert at graphing these things, so without telling me everything about how it works, how could I do that? again, I assume I could mess around with Y TWR X Time, but how could I do Thrust and Weight? I assume I should get something like Kerbal Engineer to view that as my rocket is in flight. Anyways, what would be some fun ways to mess around with graphing that kind of thing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slab\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T15:08:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24594-0-23-Telemachus-%E2%80%93-Telemetry-and-Flight-Control-in-the-Web-Browser-%282014-1-11%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETelemachus\u003C/a\u003E to export data directly from KSP.

However, in our world, some engineers insist on using other units of measurement for distance, meaning that engineers in different countries would get different values for v_exh. To avoid confusion, it is traditional (on Earth and, apparently, on Kerbin) to divide v_exh by Earth\u0027s gravity (about 9.8 m/s^2 or 32 ft/s^2) to get units of seconds; that way it doesn\u0027t matter what measuring system you use as long as everyone is measuring time in seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s I_sp: the exhaust velocity (or ratio of thrust to fuel consumption rate) divided by gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means if you want the actual ratio of thrust to fuel consumption rate, look up the engine\u0027s I_sp and multiply by about 9.8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome other fun math stuff to try out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck the current mass of your craft.

Suppose you have a rocket that starts at rest (relative to the planet surface) some very large height above the surface of a planet. The most efficient (and most terrifying) way to land is to freefall (AAAAAAAA! says mission control) until the (very precisely calculated) last possible moment, then set engines to full throttle and slow down just in time so you come to a complete stop at ground level. Try to construct a formula that can determine (given mass and radius of the planet, initial height, mass of the lander, and engine thrust) \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E when you should \u0022hit the brakes\u0022 and transition from freefall to full throttle, then test your formula experimentally! (Suggest trying this with an uncrewed probe; your first attempt will almost certainly crash catastrophically--and then you get to try to figure out why!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T14:18:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol, to be honest, I have no idea what most of that meant, I\u0027m very early in Algebra II also, but calculating a suicide burn looks like fun.
