However you can only select between \u0022Default\u0022 and \u0022Default Mobile\u0022.\n\nI\u0027m wondering if it is possible for Squad to install different skins for us to choose from?\n\nI\u0027m having two monitors. And I like to have the KSP forum open on my 2nd monitor while playing KSP on my first. But I find the default white skin too bright and would like to switch to a more \u0022spacy\u0022 theme. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nWhat do you think, Squad? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T00:38:18Z","Content":"I\u0027d love to see this too, but I think I saw that a moderator said it would mess with the forums software.
