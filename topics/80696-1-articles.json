Obviously, there are arguments that a permanent combination instead of a docking joint won\u0027t solve things like wobbly lengths of construction, but there may just be another use to reenforce the point. As the OP pointed out, he was asking about a way of taking two separate constructions and binding them together. Like docking, the items will combine, but in this case the binding joint becomes a permanent single part, as if it were built that way out of the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA downside at first glance, is that once combined these parts will forever be bound once activated.
