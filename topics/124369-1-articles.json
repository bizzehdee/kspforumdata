Since I\u0027m all for tiny and cheap satellites, I\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s enough to have one Communotron 16 and one Comms DTS-M1 per satellite? Will an omni antenna automatically pick up (assuming the satellite is within range) for example, an unmanned rover on the surface of the Mun which itself has an omni? And will the dish from the satellite automatically pick up the relay satellites around Kerbin if it is pointed at Kerbin and the satellites are within the cone? Or do I need more antennas on the Mun satellite(s) that are connected directly to specific satellites around Kerbin? Basically I\u0027m avoiding having two DTS-M1\u0027s on one satellite because the satellite is really small and there is no way to aesthetically attach more than one of these on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second question is whether I should put three satellites in Mun orbit or two satellites in Kerbin orbit leading and trailing the Mun, with the second option I imagine there would be an impassable no-signal line on the far side of the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-03T18:46:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2015 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ROXunreal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T17:50:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDTS-M1 has a large cone angle so pointing to planet is good enough. 1 omni \u002B 1 dish per satellite is exactly my setup.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T17:52:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on your needs. The most basic network isn\u0027t around the Mun itself. Place a relay satellite just in front of the Mun in it\u0027s own orbital period, and another just behind it orbiting Kerbin. This does have some very small blind spots along the equator if landed, but should cover everything in orbit and most things landed except at 4 positions, 2 at the poles and 2 small longitudinal areas at the horizon. The blind spot on the back side of the Mun will be slightly larger due to the natural curve of your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it is in the same orbital period of the Mun itself, the Mun can never catch it and it\u0027s about as close as you can get to a Lagrange point in KSP.
