I always try to recover my manned spacecrafts, so its high price tag isn\u0027t that big of an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, once I unlock the remote guidance probes (probably be a while), does that supersede both Kerbal pilots and the Avionics Hub? It looks like the probe does everything the others can do and do it cheaper... Probes use electricity, but not that much, and batteries aren\u0027t that heavy nor expensive, so it\u0027s not much of a drawback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when would I ever want to use a Kerbal pilot except at the beginning of the game when my techs suck? Do lvl 5 pilots have some awesome abilities that I\u0027m not aware of? Both the engineers and scientists perform functions that cannot be replaced by any other Kerbals or techs (I land jets with parachutes since I\u0027m a terrible pilot and bring Bill along to repack them so I can take off again; I bring Bob on all science expeditions for the science bonus and resetting experiments), so it seems odd that the pilots appear so replaceable. Whereas Jeb and Val just hangs out in the astronaut complex all day since I unlocked the OKTO probe...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf pilots really provide nothing but SAS and direction locking, Squad should definitely consider adding some perks to Kerbal pilots. Jeb and Val\u0027s badS-ness should not be replaceable by some machines!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T14:26:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Avionics hub only works if you have a Kerbal onboard, otherwise it\u0027s useless even with a probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T14:47:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECrew Reports!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA Reports!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurface Samples (after unlocking those)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etaking the experiment out of goo canisters and junior labs, so you do not have to return those heavy things from Mun...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPushing... getting out and pushing the return pod sometimes really is the only way to get home... rarely, but it does work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplanting flags!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T14:49:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by heng\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eforgot flags\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"simsatellite","CreatedById":144076,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T14:49:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes it have to be a pilot Kerbal though?
