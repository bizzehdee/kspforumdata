I always try to recover my manned spacecrafts, so its high price tag isn\u0027t that big of an issue.\n\nAlso, once I unlock the remote guidance probes (probably be a while), does that supersede both Kerbal pilots and the Avionics Hub? It looks like the probe does everything the others can do and do it cheaper... Probes use electricity, but not that much, and batteries aren\u0027t that heavy nor expensive, so it\u0027s not much of a drawback.\n\nSo, when would I ever want to use a Kerbal pilot except at the beginning of the game when my techs suck? Do lvl 5 pilots have some awesome abilities that I\u0027m not aware of? Both the engineers and scientists perform functions that cannot be replaced by any other Kerbals or techs (I land jets with parachutes since I\u0027m a terrible pilot and bring Bill along to repack them so I can take off again; I bring Bob on all science expeditions for the science bonus and resetting experiments), so it seems odd that the pilots appear so replaceable. Whereas Jeb and Val just hangs out in the astronaut complex all day since I unlocked the OKTO probe...\n\nIf pilots really provide nothing but SAS and direction locking, Squad should definitely consider adding some perks to Kerbal pilots. Jeb and Val\u0027s badS-ness should not be replaceable by some machines!"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T14:26:37Z","Content":"The Avionics hub only works if you have a Kerbal onboard, otherwise it\u0027s useless even with a probe core."},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T14:47:09Z","Content":"Crew Reports!\n\nEVA Reports!\n\nSurface Samples (after unlocking those)\n\ntaking the experiment out of goo canisters and junior labs, so you do not have to return those heavy things from Mun...\n\nPushing... getting out and pushing the return pod sometimes really is the only way to get home... rarely, but it does work.\n\nplanting flags!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T14:49:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by heng**\n  \nforgot flags"},{"CreatedByName":"simsatellite","CreatedById":144076,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T14:49:23Z","Content":"Does it have to be a pilot Kerbal though?

I\u0027m not just asking manned vs unmanned, which I\u0027ve found threads that discuss that. My question is also pilot vs non-pilot Kerbals. Non-pilots can do all the reports and EVA and pushing (I suck at that) and planting flags, too. So, if I had a manned mission, why would I send a pilot?"},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T15:26:02Z","Content":"ah, sorry. misunderstood you question.\n\nthen yes, pilots are the most easily replaced specialization of the three. if you can live without having to automacigally find the right spot on your navball - which only takes a few seconds tops.\n\nbut think about your poor passengers, would Bob and Bill really accept leaving for a two years Duna mission without Jebediah? I mean, pilots are not strictly necessary, but the human... err kerbal touch of it just feels right (unless you are flying with Andreas L.) ;-)"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T16:01:20Z","Content":"OK yeah, guess I misunderstood too.

I usually put quite a few of those around my ships (they work wonders for poor pilots like me!) Can a Kerbal pilot still use reaction wheels with no electricity? Or will the Kerbal pilot only have access to torque from (the less magical) manned command pods (I think those don\u0027t need electricity), RCS (seems like a waste of monopropellant) and control surfaces (useless in space)? I guess some SAS is better than no SAS..."},{"CreatedByName":"stenole","CreatedById":144084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T18:20:28Z","Content":"pilots don\u0027t magically make reaction wheels work without electricity. But in the case of an antenna using up more power than the solar panels produce, because the antenna uses electricity in bursts, the power will recharge a little between the bursts so that reaction wheels will work a little bit. But in complete absence of electricity, reaction wheels shut down as well. That doesn\u0027t mean that SAS is completely useless. Engine gimbals need to be controlled too."}]}
