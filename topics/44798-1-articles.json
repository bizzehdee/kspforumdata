I started with fuel spent per second, however, I did all my tests stationary (on the lift-off clamps) and now that I\u0027m doing flight tests none of my numbers match up. The fuel flow rate as my rocket ascends, decreases. What is causing this? How can I plug this into my math? I\u0027m trying to make different fuel tank/engine combinations share the same burn time. For example, a 2160u fuel tank with a Skipper and a 180u fuel tank with a LV-N. Math is NOT my strong point (the reason why I\u0027m doing this is to learn and practice), so please explain it simple.
