Tested them all at KSC, proved that the concept was sound and I could build a functional surface base of whatever size I needed to. Wonderful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem for me though is how best to get all of these components from Kerbin to an extra-Kerbin body. Sending them up on individual rockets to their destination felt too inefficient, especially if they had individual landers. Sending them up in one big rocket felt too heavy, too over-built, and too expensive. I have thought about using a simple \u0022carrier\u0022 craft to park in LKO, rendezvous with modules sent up in SSTO cargo rockets, then take them to their destination along with a reusable lander, but I have only partially implemented this plan. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your preferred ways of actually getting surface bases to an extra-Kerbin surface?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T21:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne method that can work is to have a reusable lander that docks to the top of the base and acts as a sky crane. Put the base on the ground, undock the lander and return it to orbit. On Minmus, the same lander can be used as the tug to bring them from LKO to Minmus orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T22:07:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBig SSTO rocket or spaceplane....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I need to do more than 2 dockings...

It\u0027s the same in KSP as in real life. SSTO\u0027s aren\u0027t, usually, practicable to take large components upwards, although 3m can\u0027t be considered \u0022large\u0022 anyway. SSTO\u0027s tend to consume much fuel for all that extra drymass they have to take up so do your (economical) maths if the fuel you are wasting with multiple SSTO launches is more expensive than dumping one or two engines and fuel tanks...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T16:16:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use the minimum rocket needed to send them to LKO, then dock them to a large reusable mothership.

However, this can only be done if the construction of the base is sturdy enough to survive deceleration stress and re-entry heat (it was Duna, so quite easy). Remorker was also equipped with drogue chutes, aeorobrakes, and set of standart chutes and small retro engines for semi-powered final landing. The base was of big \u0022H\u0022 shape, tied with struts by KAS/KIS mod to prevent wobble which might otherwise destroy the base during most crucial moments of landing. After the landing, Remorker took off the base and landed nearby to be used as return vehicle (once refuelled by base\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s drills). Pretty risky but very efficient way. MIGHT be usable even for low-gravity airless bodies, but I never did that yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
