So I have been progressing through my career mode and I have hit some of the mid\u00A0To end parts? I have been to and back from Duna and Ike, Eve and Gilly (obviously didn\u2019t land on Eve\u00A0and return), to Dres and to Jool but haven\u2019t returned yet. I am thinking about setting up some\u00A0orbital fuel stations not only to help with interstellar travel, but to take on a big project which might be fun.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo obviously a Kerbin orbital fuel station would be a good idea. For then, would you mine\u00A0the Mun or Minmus to restock or? Or would you just tanker more fuel up from Kerbin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Also, is an orbital Duna station helpful? Or Eve? Or Jool? I was thinking it might be fun to set up stations throughout the system. Duna mining probably takes a lot? Might be better just to mine Ike to restock? Or else you might have to leave a team there to keep resupply going including an engineer to repack chutes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA station in the Eve system might be goofy. Obviously you can\u2019t mine Eve well. Mining Gilly would be doable but the lol gravity\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what about in the Jool system? Which moon would be the best to moons there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Overall I am looking for something that is seriously\u00A0helpful for\u00A0travel, but also something really big that would be fun to undertake.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRylant\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-12T01:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the Kerbin system, if I\u0027m trying to do things the easy way, I prefer to mine on the Mun. The reason I prefer that is because of the round-trip time. You can mine, refine, repeatedly send a mini-lifter up to LMO, gradually fill up a tanker, send it to Kerbin, offload it to a station, and return to the Mun to repeat the process every\u00A03 days if you try. Trying to do anything of that sort via Minmus ends up with a lot of timing problems and delays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing about mining any other CB\u00A0is that you generally only go there once. It\u0027s not all that hard to bring along some drills and a converter, but if you do then you have to visit a moon first, drop off the mining equipment (and probably an engineer), then visit your real target, then go back \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eagain\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0and recover the kerbal later. Unless you are using a rocket to land multiple times (in multiple biomes), the extra fuel does very little\u00A0for you. The only real exception is the Jool system. It takes a lot of fuel to fly around Jool and visit all the moons. So having a refueling station on Pol or Bop makes a lot of sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-12T06:31:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ridiculously small size of the solar system and celestial bodies in KSP doesn\u0027t provide a good use case for orbital fuel stations. In the majority of cases it\u0027s cheap enough to travel to and land at mining station nearby.

Pol is slightly cheaper to run fuel from, Val is more convenient. Temporary tugs can hang out over Tylo.
