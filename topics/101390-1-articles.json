There is a bit of a usability issue though - Xenon in particular is used in very small quantities - 700 units is 0.07t (70kg). Of course if the indicators were better, they could automatically switch between scales (that\u0027s 70,000 grams, 70 kilograms, 0.070 tons, 0.000 070 kilotons, etc*) as required...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother minor issue is that electric charge and EVA propellant is massless (the EVA propellant being massless is it\u0027s own separate epic fail)... that could be handled simply by displaying them in their legacy units of course (of course if you consider it carefully, you realize that the legacy units are probably a volume measure so.. 100 kerbal liters of electric charge?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt creates an additional needless barrier to understanding and using the rocket equation oneself\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrongly agree.
