I know the problem has to do with congruence (or lack thereof) between the window edges and the surrounding faces, but I have yet to develop an effective means of dealing with it. Most of my projects have allowed me to worm my way around one way or another, but this time my desperate attempts at retriangulation haven\u0027t brought me any luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226gROYhs.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022269\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6gROYhs.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe terrible in Unity:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VUtAGQb.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022433\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VUtAGQb.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UPHYUxy.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022428\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UPHYUxy.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe worst offender is the aft window (though the middle window is surprisingly bad too) . The root of the problem seems to be that the window in question is cut into an otherwise flat, geometrically simple face, so when the mesh triangulates the resulting geometry involves many elongated, incongruent triangles. I\u0027ve tried cutting the mesh around the window and retriangulating it in several patterns, but I have yet to produce a serviceable result. Is there a trick to this kind of work? If not, how might I approach the problem better than I have been?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-06T13:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse more geometry for the base mesh. Ideally, you should only use quads (use at-j in blender to automatically convert tris in quads).\u00A0 You seem to understand the problem, but you also seem to \u0022fear\u0022 to use some more vertices. Don\u0027t be afraid. Use them where they are needed. You can only do so much with ultra low polycount. Also you use different vertice count for the inner and outer curves of a window frame. This leads to triangles, and usually to elongated ones. Always seek a mesh that avoids triangles by having egqual amounts of \u0022corners\u0022.
