In high g-enviroments you can save on the stone. The complaint about ladders being so late in the tree is less about gameplay and more about intuitivity or inherent logic. Okay, keep the mobility enhancers where they are, but give us said rope with a stone (retractable ladder auto-pointing towards g) earlier. The problem is about having something to climb on beyond the main structure of the ship (past the engine below, for example) and solving that problem in a most basic way is trivial IRL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T10:48:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kelderek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kelderek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKeep in mind also that you do not have immediate access to EVA either - you need to upgrade the Astronaut Complex first.

I suspect that if the Apollo space suits had similar RCS built in that they might have saved some mass on the lander by taking off the ladder rungs - they were smart enough to realize that they didn\u0027t need any seats in the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now the first mobility enhancer sits in the 90 science tier and I think that is fine. Maybe move it up one tier to the 45 science level.
