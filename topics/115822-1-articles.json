It cannot handle turning planes in atmosphere well - wobble a lot, doesnt control throttle, doesnt brake, only controls steering \u002B gear. I think writing such plane landing computer will be extremly hard because of aero forces. If we could edit mechjeb plane landing autopilot behaviour to somehow turn mostly by rolling it might work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Mechjeb allows landing only on KSP and grass field. Definetly likes long planes, less wobble.
