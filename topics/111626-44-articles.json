The mission actually seems fairly efficient, given the constraints of the heavy pod and lack of nuclear propulsion.  The swappable pod was an effective strategy for this mission profile, and I don\u0027t think anyone has done 5 kerbals and 3 per landing before. Your 1510 Science points puts you in second place!  ...Jeb\u0027s level is not very popular these days.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I look forward to your proposed Eve mission.  Given that you\u0027re using the same Mk1-2 pod for every landing, I might recommend you try [The Ultimate Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/145204-the-ultimate-challenge-originally-by-just-jim/\u0026) - with Jool and Eve done, you\u0027ll have all the hard landings out of the way!\n\u003E \n\nSweet, thanks. The mission was a blast. I love the look of the Mk1-2, and the challenge of using it is always enjoyable. Finished my Eve ascent vehicle today, and I\u0027m proud to say it works well. Now I just have to design the descent stage to get it on the surface in one piece. And then design a launch vehicle that can lift the entire monstrosity off of Kerbin and get it to Eve in the first place.

What it *does* have to be is a single total spacecraft (regardless of whether it\u0027s assembled in orbit of Kerbin) that leaves Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and travels to Jool. \u0022There\u0027s funding for one main ship only so all the crew, lander(s) and other stuff has to go to Jool as one big ship.  The ship can separate once in Jool\u0027s \u003Cabbr style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;border-bottom:none;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022 title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u0022 Meaning no splitting off a few asteroid collection units from the mothership at any point between Kerbin and Jool either.\n\nThough you are allowed one refueling mission ***or*** \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, you may not have both. Hence even if you are allowed to send an entirely separate vehicle to go and collect some asteroids and bring them to the Jool system, that would have to be only one vehicle for every single asteroid you want, and even then you still wouldn\u0027t be allowed to *mine* those asteroids hence the separate vehicle to collect them would be useless.\n\nEssentially, unless you collect a few asteroids with *the same single vehicle* that you sent from Kerbin to go to the Jool system, your idea of \u0022asteroid bases are placed around jool and each moon\u0022 for purposes of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E would be against the rules. And you definitely couldn\u0027t do it \u0022prior to the mission\u0022 because that would mean that you\u0027re using pre-placed craft to help the mission and thus it\u0027s not a single vehicle any more.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-25T22:22:00Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2017 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by eloquentJane**"},{"CreatedByName":"PhoenixRise86","CreatedById":173094,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-25T23:24:11Z","Content":"My shakedown cruises went... moderately?

I\u0027m impressed by the splitting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E design, I\u0027ve seen them done before but not for a Jool 5.  And your landers are small and efficient too.  I liked the simultaneous approach with all of the landers splitting and gravity-assisting to their respective moons, it was quite the unique maneuver.  And a very well-edited video.  All of this coming from someone with only 3 posts!\n\nBe careful with the clipping though (on the mothership \u0022bridge\u0022 section).  This was really close to being disqualified but I don\u0027t think any drag tricks were abused, and your landers fit into the cargo bay without clipping.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 11/25/2017 at 2:52 PM, Destructogaming said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **asteroid bases are placed around jool and each moon prior to the mission**\n\u003E \n\nAs the other commenters said, this is not allowed.  You can visit an asteroid base once, if the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E is only on the asteroid base and not on the ship.  That will count as your refueling mission.\n\nAnother clarification: you may only meet with the refueling mission once.  For example, you can\u0027t leave a full fuel tank in orbit of each moon either, even if they were all dropped by the same ship.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 11/25/2017 at 6:24 PM, PhoenixRise86 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E My shakedown cruises went... moderately?

While we\u0027re talking about rule 6, this would actually be the perfect opportunity to use your refueling mission.  It\u0027s exactly what the rule was intended for in the first place - rescuing a ship that doesn\u0027t quite have enough."}]}
