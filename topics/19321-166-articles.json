When most vehicles stall, they do so at low dynamic pressures (most real life planes never even get above about Q = 15 kPa), and anything higher generally results in overstressing the airframe before stalling ever occurs.

Its at a point where I need to be aware of it and at least plan for it, but it doesn\u0027t really limit what is ultimately possible. It took me a while, but I make a relatively heavy plane that can pull a continuous 20g loop with Q hovering around 25 kPa and if I\u0027m really careful, pull out of dives up to 28g at 35 kPa. Haven\u0027t got it up to 30g yet, but I will. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can still get into fast spins, too, at high altitude. Its just if you don\u0027t recover fast, the denser air tears you to pieces before the ground does. And its nice that I can\u0027t do loop-de-loops with rockets anymore. I have launched many rockets with too many boosters that used my patented doughnut maneuver to prevent in-atmosphere overspeed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yea, scale gets really lost. Try switching the readout to mph or km/h sometimes, if you are more familiar with those. M/s is generally reserved for projectiles, in my experience, so its tough to get a scale from it. Consider that the strongest recorded windspeed in a hurricane is like 95 m/s, and that can level buildings and toss cars around. My airplanes generally don\u0027t even take off until they are going faster than that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe worst tornadoes, which literally will rip roads off the ground and pulverize them never reach windspeeds over 150 m/s.

There are lots of people who think that 300 m/s is slow (for some reason), and that the aerodynamic forces on a vehicle at those speeds shouldn\u0027t cause it to break up. When most vehicles stall, they do so at low dynamic pressures (most real life planes never even get above about Q = 15 kPa), and anything higher generally results in overstressing the airframe before stalling ever occurs. Stalling and spins don\u0027t occur at high Q, breakups occur at high Q. Stalls and spins are (for the most part) low Q phenomena.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFWIW, most lanes should fly apart much sooner than they currently do, since FAR doesn\u0027t even bother trying to handle flutter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and there has been an option to remove it and adjust it.
