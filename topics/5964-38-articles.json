The core itself has a drain value which represents batteries (right now, it will last about two days left alone, so don\\\u0027t power up all your stuff right away without a power source!), and attached parts modify it - solar panels decrease the value (and can negate it, where it will slowly fill up to 100%), and instruments will increase it, draining the power faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still need to get a vector from the sun to solar panels to change the production rate, but that will work fine with the system I have set up.
