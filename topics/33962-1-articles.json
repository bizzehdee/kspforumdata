The simple design as seen here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1LmXajx.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/1LmXajx.jpg\u003C/a\u003E is just a testbed i\u0027ve been using to see what happens. Even when i treat her gently (slow acceleration, a minimum of maneuvering) the link between the nuclear engine and the fuel tank \u003Cstrong\u003Eabove\u003C/strong\u003E will inevitably fail at a time when nothing is really is happening. Steady acceleration through the last 10% atmosphere at 75% thrust? Nope! camera shifts, linkage fail. This happens regardless of the interstage adapter (rocketry) and seems to plague the nuclear engine especially. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe relevant mods i am using are Rocketry and Ferram Aerospace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick edit: The structural failure takes place between the engine and the fuel tank above it, even if it is a stock rockomax tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-20T15:57:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2013 03:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SilentWindOfDoom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Damazo","CreatedById":54952,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T16:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if this is the same problem but this happened with me also.

This only happened when I was thrusting fast and on any kind of time warp, and when I stopped warping it stopped exploding.
