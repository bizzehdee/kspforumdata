Pod is a jet and rocket powered SSTO VTOL capsule that can get Kerbals to orbit and dock with whatever station or mothership you have up there, get refuelled and return. Should be Laythe capable as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/tfIyv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

This means you only need small amounts of Rocket thrust to finish the orbit and rendezvous with an orbital station. To access the internal fuel tank for refuelling it is recommended to zoom in under the Jet engine and right click there. The probe control ring is between the docking port and RCS tank and can be a bit hard to right click on but it is there. I have locked the landing gear suspension as the compression was causing the Jet engine to hit the ground and explode. The landing with the parachutes seems slow enough to handle it though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/pbetjbnr5jt75b2/Pod.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft file\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built Pod in the Space Plane Hanger, (easier to clip stuff in there), so you may need to save it in your SPH folder for it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T11:54:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a little off-topic, but what are the clod textures you are using?
