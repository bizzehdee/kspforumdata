Or simply redoing your craft from scratch. Most of the time, the amount of work that has to be done to clean the file is greater than the amount you\u0027ll waste redoing the craft so that\u0027s what I recommend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil the .craft files are more user and editor friendly, this will be the only way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
