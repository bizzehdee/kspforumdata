I found that planes were unflyable for me until i used Precision controls (the Yaw, Pitch, and Roll icons should turn blue), and even still the sensitivity makes it touchy. Even my joystick takes only a quick accidental flick to make a spectacular failure. And, of course, for those of you who hate seeing Caps Lock turn on and off every time you play KSP, just change the button in the options menu from startup. \n\nAlso, most of the takeoff fails seem to result from adding \\*gasp\\* too many boosters. You really only need one or two, it\\\u0027s just that the plane CANNOT (and i\\\u0027ve tried, but someone will prove me wrong, i know it...) take off without taking the gear up in my experience, lest you use more than enough boosters."},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T10:47:57Z","Content":"Well, yeah, many of my planes fail to takeoff until they leave the runway.

Needless to say, it\\\u0027s pretty damn tough to fly. SAS or not :/"}]}
