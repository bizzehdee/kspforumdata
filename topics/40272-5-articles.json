It\u0027s just that we get right back to the issue of strutting things into oblivion, an act which is significantly easier to do on a simply shaped fairing. And from there, we are left with a nearly invincible payload because of its shield and another strutted mess like before. Also, while we are assuming that once in space the part count will be low enough that the payload doesn\u0027t matter, remember: The largest conglomerations of parts are not only at the bottom, but at the top, because of how intricate payloads can become. For those who desperately need this, it\u0027s likely that the high part count of a payload is still going to cause framerate issues unless it\u0027s a very simple piece such as a small satellite or small Mun rover. For interplanetary journeys and larger payloads, the problem will still remain for many. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt just seems like a band-aid fix to a problem, frankly. What needs to be done to address this problem is doublesided: first, KSP needs to have multicore support, which does not seem forthcoming in the near future, but may be somewhere down the line. When that rolls along, this entire fix would become obsolete as KSP wouldn\u0027t be unnecessarily bottlenecking itself. Second, the connections in general need to be less wobbly. This is a tough one because many updates ago, Squad removed part collisions on the same vessel which allowed much more wobble because things could wiggle through each other rather than being stopped by each other. When a solution is found to this and Unity implements multicore support, this fairing solution will be obsolete, andeven now it can be used for exploitation which is not something any developer would want in a fix. Furthermore, I personally think it\u0027s bad practice to add something in when it\u0027s known it will be removed later on, unless it\u0027s pretty much mandatory to make the game playable - and that\u0027s not the case. Breaking up payloads into separate flights DOES work for small to medium payloads, and for large payloads, if you use multiple docking ports (which isn\u0027t that hard, really) you greatly reduce any wobble. In fact, just three jr. docking ports can prevent almost all wobble if they are placed in a wide enough triangle along a payload. And the new ASAS also greatly reduces wobble by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zaeo","CreatedById":52597,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T06:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Psycix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Psycix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat do inaccuracies in sped up physics have to do with this?

For my bigger creations, I have \u003Cem\u003Eat least\u003C/em\u003E 5 struts per fuel tank cross bracing them together, and a nice network around any stage separators. I\u0027d hazard a guess that they probably at least double, perhaps triple my part count. I think my problems could be better solved by Kerbal Joint Reinforcement. That would cut down on my strutting big-time, but also have far less potential for abuse (unless I start going into the .cfg files and changing properties at will, but you can do that in vanilla as well)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T16:29:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eonly way to kill lag is to have the game at startup calculate how many parts it can support on the specific hardware/software mix it\u0027s currently running on and refuse to let the user create or launch anything bigger, refuse to allow any 2 vehicles to get without visual range that together would exceed that number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo say it\u0027s going to come up with a number of 200 for your specific configuration, and you want to dock 2 150 part ships together?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETough luck, the moment you get within a few kilometers of each other, the game would refuse to let you go on and just send you back to the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycix","CreatedById":76916,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T16:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is not any more OP than welding the parts together using the welding tool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, launching is a grind, and the exciting stuff happens in space.
