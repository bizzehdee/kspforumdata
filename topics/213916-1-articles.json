After getting to orbit I spun the stage and it worked like a charm so KSP 2 community I challenge you to make a ring station in Dres orbit at it\u0027s ring inclination and preferably in visible range of the ring (i.e. inside the ring itself or just outside or below in orbit of the Dres ring system)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeres the link to a shor video of it rotating \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KSP2/comments/11ec0hv/and_said_space_station_rotates/?utm_source=share\u0026amp;utm_medium=web2x\u0026amp;context=3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EReddit\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T19:12:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are fun. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Congratulations on your build.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
