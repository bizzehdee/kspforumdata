If mainly what you want is a watch first that can also provide notifications and run simple apps, it seems like the Pebble is a better bet (more durable/water resistant, e-ink is always on, much better battery life, cheaper).

You\u0027ll always have your smartphone with you anyways so the main use case I can see is to let you know if the most recent email/text that buzzed your phone is actually worth digging your phone out for, which the Pebble does just fine. It still runs simple apps so you can still use it for things like a music player remote.

It\u0027s nice for checking stuff out without taking your phone out. It keeps connection across my house. The only problem I have is that sometimes the plastic where the watch pins meet the body doesn\u0027t do it\u0027s job well enough and the watch comes apart. It\u0027s only happened twice and both times it was easily fixed with a knife to put the pins back. I assume this problem is fixed on the second gen because the watch meets metal and not plastic. I\u0027d recommend it for sure. I\u0027ve heard the G watch R is a bit of a chore to change brightness on. I personally dislike square watches like the Pebble and the screen really doesn\u0027t do it for me. Out of all of them I\u0027d say Moto 360 second gen.

Remember that large datasets are often secured with small ones. There are other ways, but this is a new vector.
