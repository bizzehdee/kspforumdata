Minecraft is more of a game for the normal gamer, its pretty simple. I played Minecraft before KSP, but I quickly got bored with it. KSP teaches you rocket science and might change you completely, so you might find yourself plotting gravity assists with Joolian moons while listening to the history of rockets. Some say that Minecraft teaches you architecture, but architecture is not realistic when you have no gravity to fight against ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif). With the sellout to Microsoft I got even less interested in Minecraft since I like Indie games and Microsoft has a bad habit of ruining buyed things\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 (Nothing against Windows users, its just my opinion) In Minecraft, going mining is very important, but I\u0027m afraid of caves that are dark, full of green things that explode you and are containing lakes of lava ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif).

Less me!\u0022.\n\nNo one bothered it, especially not me, because I think videogames are not a religion or should be the main focus of anyones life, same with KSP here.

In fact, every person can add to it whatever they need/want.\n\nYou could think of Minecraft as a \u0022Block based Sandbox Survival\u0022 engine, not as a game by itself.\n\nAnd overall, I think that Minecraft will never die. Granted, the devs will one day get bored and stop developing, or maybe even stop the servers. But the community will go on developing the game through mods. That\u0027ll probably be even better than now, cause there would be no new versions of vanilla that break stuff and require for mods to be tediously updated. And about the login/skin/whatever servers, there are already things that allow you to change what Minecraft connects to. For example, my friend somehow managed to make it so that Minecraft gets skin images straight from my own computer, not from the servers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T18:10:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 06:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DestinyPlayer**"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T18:08:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And that\u0027s what I\u0027m talking about when I\u0027m saying \u0022Really stupid thing\u0022.
