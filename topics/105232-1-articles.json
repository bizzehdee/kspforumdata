I started a new career for 1.0. First two flights went well, being short hops to do the basic science. I unlocked enough parts for what I thought would be a sub-orbital hop out of the atmosphere. On the way up, my second stage went unstable and I had a nice little fight to get it back on course. Ended up when the engine cut out suborbital with an Ap of 184 km. I had a Mk1 capsule with Jeb in it, a materials bay underneath, a heat shield and a parachute up top. Re-entry was hitting its high point with flames everywhere, when suddenly I lost control, flipped over and within a couple of seconds Jeb was toast. I need to go back and learn how to fly again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"colonel0sanders","CreatedById":26580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T19:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did exactly the same thing.
