I have created some comic strips in the past and have also wanted to start a Kerbal story at some point. So I have a plot thought out which is great! However I am the kind of person which gets bored quite easily and quits. So don\u0027t expect anything big! I also think that when I start, there won\u0027t really be a schedule for when I post new strips. At most, it would be weekly. And just so you know, before I start, I have to finish Oberth station in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and build a Munar space station and a Munar surface base. So this probably won\u0027t start for a few weeks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever I decided to figure out how to make these. MS paint isn\u0027t great for comics of this type. Publisher kind of is but I want to be able to combine it into one picture as well as upload it to imgur and share it. So what software did I use? Powerpoint. Yeah. It was the only one that could combine all the pictures into one and make the file small enough to save as a picture and upload to Imgur.
