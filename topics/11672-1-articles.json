Piece of advice - for that kind of experiment, \u0027Orbiter\u0027 simulator is much more better. It at least deals with the Earth (Kerbin 1st space speed is just one quarter of Earth and therefore, SSTO is not a big deal here, actually), have good, and detailed enough orbit mechanic simulation including complex earth atmosphere. Well its have some flaws, when it comes to making your own craft, but now it have mods, that allow to do this by person even without knowing programming languages (search for spacecraft3.dll on Orbiter forum). Also it have more scientific oriented users, with long story of creating ships and using them. Actually KSP auditory can be very science driven too, but they are investigating that new world Kerbin, therefore, it will not help much with you field of interest. But there is no better place to check some crazy ideas \u0027on the fly\u0027 than KSP, and its actually - very fun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck on your journeys, Bob Clarck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exoscientist","CreatedById":27117,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-07T11:25:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi Exoscientist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks to me you are after a program where you can display your SSTO concepts to an audience, and things like projected lift capacity and mission duration are important to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is so then Kerbal Space Program may not be the software you are looking for, it is primarily a game and has no provision for simulating cargo, life support consumables or anything else beyond launching construction kit rockets into space with little green men at the helm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps a more suitable program would be \u003Ca href=\u0022http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOrbiter\u003C/a\u003E?
