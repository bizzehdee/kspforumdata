Original plan for KSP2 was basically a remake of KSP with a graphics update and a few new features, like having interstellar built in and adding colonies. That was a very reasonable project for the original schedule that was given to us during the 2019 E3. Based on everything we\u0027ve heard from the creative director since, I\u0027m guessing he and some other people within Star Theory were already pushing for a larger vision for the game. Success of KSP2 presentation at E3 gave them leverage to start negotiations about expanding the scope. This is where things get hazy. I don\u0027t know whether Private Division just got greedy, or Star Theory leadership was unreasonable, but negotiations broke down, PD pulled KSP license from Star Theory and started Intercept. I don\u0027t know enough to even guess at whether that was the right decision, but it was certainly handled very poorly, both in terms of how it was communicated to Star Theory and to the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, transition of development from Star Theory to Intercept was going to result in guaranteed delays, but it looks like Intercept was still trying to salvage the original schedule with expanded scope. That was a bad idea and clearly didn\u0027t work. They needed to step back, completely rescope the game to the new vision and available resources, and build a new schedule with a more realistic timeline. Looking at the current schedule, I think that was finally done. Things Intercept are saying they\u0027re planning to do and the timeline finally match up. The progress they are showing is consistent with where they should be on this new schedule, which is early production.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes it mean that we\u0027re done with delays? Unlikely. But they\u0027ve just said 2022 for now, and they\u0027re probably aiming for late summer early fall, and it\u0027s probably going to slip to late fall or holiday season. That\u0027s quite normal for the scope and the fact that they\u0027re effectively in early production now. Intercept is owned by Take Two, so I don\u0027t expect more politics to get in the way, and the project they\u0027re working on isn\u0027t exactly revolutionary, so I don\u0027t anticipate great technical difficulties to sabotage the production. Short of disaster, I think the game\u0027s more or less on track now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, more transparency on all of this would be great, but talking about this delay in more detail and explaining why they\u0027re rescoping would require talking about what happened between Star Theory and Private Division, and I strongly suspect that Private Division doesn\u0027t want this talked about. But again, it sounds like all of that is out of the way now, so I see no reason why this would be a problem going forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaManiac","CreatedById":176003,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-18T22:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223883187\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197935\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221605708576\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022195079\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dprostock\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, dprostock said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s solved with a project leader, a significant number of developers, and the integration of a team of targeted beta testers with clear test goals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is often said that there is no such thing as a bug free program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile that does eliminate most bugs, getting rid of ALL bugs is impossible, especially in something like a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"starcaptain","CreatedById":166799,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-18T22:52:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223883368\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197935\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221605738795\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022176003\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DunaManiac\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, DunaManiac said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is often said that there is no such thing as a bug free program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile that does eliminate most bugs, getting rid of ALL bugs is impossible, especially in something like a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn an interesting and possibly ironic comparison, software made to run in space is one of the most rigorously bug-prevented realms of all development whatsoever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Operating System for the Space Shuttle is emblematic of this: designed to run extremely fast, extremely efficient, and run without errors as close to \u0027never\u0027 as possible, and be able to check itself for cosmic ray corruption in real time, three layers deep.

You don\u0027t have gameplay\u00A0engineers write your MP. There\u0027s an overlap, of course, and there are some common resources in production and QA regardless, but by the time it gets to the studio scale and over duration of the project, it really comes down to cost of the project. And it\u0027s not an either-or proposition. Developers budget out what the core is going to require and what any add-on features would require in terms of costs. The core game has to be built either way, and it will be budgeted for either way. Then the decision is made on any additional feature.

And once the game is underway, because working on multiplayer is such a distinct task, you won\u0027t have resources transferred over one way or another outside of any all-hands-on-deck bug fixing sprints. And in terms of QA and bug fixes, I\u0027m pretty sure if it comes to it, Intercept will prioritize core. In fact, I somewhat expect multiplayer to be buggy, limited, or completely disabled on release and fixed with patches. I\u0027ll be pleasantly surprised if it\u0027s not, but you\u0027re right that it\u0027s technically an optional feature, and the first to take the fall for the team if there will be significant time pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dprostock","CreatedById":195079,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-19T14:48:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you to \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbol\u003C/strong\u003E for not owning \u003Cstrong\u003EAI\u003C/strong\u003E!!!!\u003Cbr\u003E\nImagine a development like AoE or simulators like SH!!!!

You quickly learn to recognize projects that are a dumpster fire from these that can do alright. Earlier in the year, there have been a lot of red flags with team transition.
