but never again.\u00A0 Methane to the best of my knowledge has never been used as a lifting gas for humans or animals.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s been a while since I

toward methane and hydrogen, below about 3 atm pressure and 1000 C and certain catylists.\u00A0 The ignition point for methane and air under ideal ratios is about 540 degrees C.\u00A0\u00A0The temperature to maintain steam falls with altitude\u00A0 (from 100 toward about 70 degrees C).\u00A0 Therefore it is possible to maintain methane above boiling temperature without any risk of accidental ignition.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow a fuel cell can process hydrocarbons on one side and release hydrogen on one side of a membrane.\u00A0 On the other side of a membrane oxygen from the air is converted to steam, and much heat is released.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA balloon inside a balloon is called a

steam.\u00A0 Surround that with an open balloon of air only the appendix of the balloon\u00A0is part of the fuel cell so the air in the appendix will be close to 10% oxygen, 10% steam.\u00A0 I would predict it would be virtually impossible to explode the gasses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMethane and Steam despite being 6 times denser than helium, have half the bouyancy, because what counts

It is always in equilibrium with water. Very hot steam is more \u0022dry\u0022 than cool steam, but it always has some liquid water percentage. You have a giant bag, which has tremendous surface area to radiate away heat. The higher you go, the colder it gets outside. How do you keep your steam dry near the bag? You would need a very high bulk temperature and a *lot* of convection to make sure that the steam at the edges doesn\u0027t get too \u0022wet\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat questions!\u00A0 This is the very heart of the problem.\u00A0 We need to know the rate at which heat radiates away.\u00A0 I do not know it.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you go higher the condensation temperature drops and solar radiation increases.\u00A0 So the colder atmosphere is not a big problem.\u00A0 If the balloons utilize the reflective properties of solar hot water heaters, they will get better with altitude.\u00A0 My experience with 6 mil\u00A0plastic greenhouses says they can maintain a 15-20 F temperature difference overall\u00A0 While the vaporization temperature is going to drop almost 50 F going up.\u00A0 Convection will fall going up. Solar radiation increases.\u00A0 Ascending requires lowering pressure, thus venting steam or water while going up.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe outer edge of the steam bag would benefit enormously from insulation.\u00A0 My idea is to surround the steam with hot air.\u00A0 The exhaust from a fuel cell is a steamy oxygen depleted air with no heavy CO2, so it would be perfect.\u00A0 Condensation of the outermost balloon only would drip back down to the fuel cell, and if it does not revaporize, then it will fall out.\u00A0 The inner balloons containing steam would be kept super hot and dry if possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing methane to insulate steam would work better much better from the heat perspective, the reverse of an ignition mitigation strategy.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m estimating that fuel cells are about 10 kW per ton, plus about 2 kW of \u0022waste heat\u0022.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a 100m diameter sphere of steam would get over 1000 kW of solar power (potentially twice as much with reflectors) , and say 100 kW of total fuel cell heat (that is a very modest gross weight\u00A0fraction).\u00A0 The surface of the steam bag is 32,000 m2.\u00A0 So at equilibrium the steam bag\u00A0will dissipate 35 W/m2.\u00A0 From this we can calculate the insulation value for the outer balloon we need.\u00A0 The outer balloon will have a temperature gradient less than 100 degrees, so it\u0027s insulation value could need\u00A0R as high as 3.\u00A0 I\u0027m not sure exactly how much air that is, but the air gaps in 3.5 inch studs count as R=1.\u00A0 So I think that a 3 layer onion of air 1 foot thick has enough insulation such that the inner balloonet would\u00A0have almost zero condensation.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-03T21:28:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2019 09:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by farmerben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
