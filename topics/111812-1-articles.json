It\u0027s not the most significant effect though. For jet engines it gives a little bit more thrust higher up. \n\nAbout cooling the air I think it cools the air since you get more thrust but I don\u0027t think it affects engine overheating. \n\nHowever they conduct heat pretty well with a high heat tolerance so in a way if you place them close to engines it could\n\nprevent overheating."},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T06:37:48Z","Content":"The precooling is just a name for more efficient air intake ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nBut it\u0027s also possible it is more heat resistant"},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T06:52:53Z","Content":"They don\u0027t cool directly, but they radiate heat faster than almost all parts (only solar panels and wings match them)."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T11:23:47Z","Content":"As far as I can tell they\u0027re just an inline intake \u002B LF tank.

If they are identical, then the pre-cooler has a very slight advantage. Making generous assumptions, at a temp of 1000, that difference could be a rad flux that is higher by 100-200. Considering that incoming heat flux can be in the multiple thousands, the difference is arguably irrelevant, and it\u0027s fair to point out I\u0027ve never done any air-breathing engine testing so the numbers might be less dastardly."}]}
