If they are identical, then the pre-cooler has a very slight advantage. Making generous assumptions, at a temp of 1000, that difference could be a rad flux that is higher by 100-200. Considering that incoming heat flux can be in the multiple thousands, the difference is arguably irrelevant, and it\u0027s fair to point out I\u0027ve never done any air-breathing engine testing so the numbers might be less dastardly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
