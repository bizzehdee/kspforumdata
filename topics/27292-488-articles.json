Intended for military purposes in FAR, it endures high accelerations (G\u0026gt;15), high dynamic pressures (Q\u0026gt;130000), has high maneuverability (around 22\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA/second in FAR at mach 0.5), achieves high speeds (Mach\u0026gt;3, probably more without DRE), is VTOL too. Its only problem is that it has very few BahamutoD armory missiles (3 Hellfire and 2 Sidewinders), but has some punch with guns (a hidden Vulcan and two .50cal turrets).

It\u0027s a 600-ton mobile Kethane refinery/moon base, for those planets/moons where my usual up-and-down depots (land, drill, refine, then return to orbit to act as a station) don\u0027t function well due to gravity or atmosphere. Instead of refueling in orbit, a lander can simply get refueled on the ground and get back to orbit under its own power more easily. Actually, both of my rover designs fill that niche, with the smaller (30-ton) Iguana rovers being much more mobile, but I wanted something that could plausibly be a livable base. In the long term I\u0027ll have ones on Laythe, Duna, and Eve, but the first one\u0027s going to Mun for two reasons: as a test case, and because \u003Cem\u003EMun is in the name\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that shot, the Zappa\u0027s booster is my 9-stack SSTO recoverable rocket design (capacity ~500 tons), and the landing skyhook is still on top. The hook is connected by a docking port, not a separator, so it\u0027ll draw on the rover\u0027s massive fuel tanks for the trip (for a total of ~8000m/s of dV). The Duna/Eve/Laythe version has more parachutes, but otherwise the design is now pretty much locked down. The best part is that it only has ~250 parts, so lag isn\u0027t an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo better illustrate the sizes involved, here are the two rovers during a docking test just off the KSC runway:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ebRx6Aj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ebRx6Aj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe heights are just right that an Iguana driving under the Zappa\u0027s front will automatically dock with the clampotrons placed on the cockpit\u0027s underside.

It should be there tonight, giving a new home to its 3-man crew: Doodbur Kerman (driver), Luzor Kerman (scientist) and Billy-Bobdrin Kerman (engineer). Yes, I picked this crew almost entirely for their funny names.
