That is all about to change, and I am gonna be livestreaming this whole affair from the getgo so the world can see that this is no hoax; I am the real deal and to be honest I have the crap scared out of me a few times enough to stop my projects altogether for years; but each time I press on a little further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI aint gettin any younger and this work needs to be done and published.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a backdrop just study von Daniken etc...then you have what are called the astral realms and other dimensions of \u0027possible\u0027 existance; it is in these areas that I have a keen interest in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes while outer space is there, so is inner space. I study the borderline between dimensions; lookup chaos and complexity theory. I believe it is in this borderline area where the interdimensional communications device is supposed to work; or something to that affect; there are ways of getting there, but alot of preliminary research needs to be done; this is where I come in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay I introduce you to my website:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.freewebs.com/mrzeta/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.freewebs.com/mrzeta/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand if you are really interested go ahead and look up mrzeta haha !!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan on building laser setups, a homebrew microwave dish, and have a 10 inch SCT for you viewing pleasure soon !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I need to work on computers etc first so head on over to my livestream...you wont wanna miss it !!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/26435-Live-Stream-The-Kerbin-Mission-Kerbin-Academy-and-other-stuff-\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/26435-Live-Stream-The-Kerbin-Mission-Kerbin-Academy-and-other-stuff-\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECdr Zeta\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-28T23:13:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2014 11:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cdr_Zeta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
