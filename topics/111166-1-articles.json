(Exceptions include: Kerbal Engineer, Mechjeb, and Infernal Robotics)\n\nMust float.\n\nCannot fly, no matter what, sorry.\n\nOnly exception to flying is if you need to refuel your rover.\n\nChallenge Requirements:\n\nStay as close to the equator as possible.\n\nStart from stock KSC, nowhere else.\n\nMap the route you went on.\n\nYou must do it after 5/27/15, nothing before this counts. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nYou can use a craft that was made before 5/27/15 but it is not recommended because of 1.02\n\nIf you complete this holy crap you have way too much time on your hands\n\nYou also get to put this in your sig:\n\n(Still working on pic)\n\nGood luck!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T20:54:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 08:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kozak**"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T18:38:41Z","Content":"Can I, perhaps, re-do a previous circumnavigation? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Same route, different vehicle?\n\nEdit: Just saw the stock-only rule.
