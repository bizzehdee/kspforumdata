There are a lot more issues than the corrupted save. The game feels really buggy, unfinished, and runs pretty bad overall. Some of the scenarios don\u0027t work as intended. Switching between vessels requires you to go back to the space station.

I thought that Squad was going to take a lot of the more popular mods and insert them into the base game for console, but that didn\u0027t happen.
