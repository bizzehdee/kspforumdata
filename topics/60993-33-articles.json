There\u0027s so many parts that need improvement and texture work to be done that I just don\u0027t have the time. Here\u0027s a glimpse of what I\u0027m currently doing though. The service module still has a bit more texture work, but I think it\u0027s already looking much better. I basically completely remade the capsule\u0027s texture in order to upres it to 1024x1024. Looks even better in game with all the specularity and bumpmapping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1276.photobucket.com/user/morrowindorion/media/Untitled_zpsc30e778d.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1276.photobucket.com/albums/y477/morrowindorion/Untitled_zpsc30e778d.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Untitled_zpsc30e778d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-22T14:56:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2014 02:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Orionkermin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HawkW","CreatedById":111699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T14:59:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Orionkermin, I just wanted to let you know that I love your work - this is one of my favorite KSP parts mods.
