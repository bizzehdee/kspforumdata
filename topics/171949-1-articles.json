After some more than normal docking difficulty it was decided to abort the docking, back far off and try again. Disaster struck when the lander suddenly phased into the nose of the mothership (weird time warp problem). This obliterated the docking port as soon as matter remembered that it was violating the laws of physics and space-time prison is a bad place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the only lander was useless, the secret agenda of investigating the Bop signal can not be completed, and a 9 million funds expedition can only do half its planned work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat.
