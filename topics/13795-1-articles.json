Booster and bottom core stage are almost enough to achieve orbit @ 120km. The orbital stage get\\\u0027s me to the mun, into low munar orbit. Lander stage usually has fuel to spare to land, ascend, get into kerbin orbit, and even deorbit. You have to be precise with your burns though. If you mess up you have to restart the flight or doom your kerbals to a cold death.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
