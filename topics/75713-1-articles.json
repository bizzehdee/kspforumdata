I\u0027m glad the asteroids have been added, but I think there are some UI tools that are necessary to make this part of the game worthwhile:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EClasss specific naming conventions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe names of the asteroids should contain some information about the asteroids, e.g. all B-class asteroids should start with the letter B. Alternatively, the class should appear in a mouse-over or be otherwise accessible outside of the tracking center. I was intercepting \u003Cem\u003Ewhat I thought\u003C/em\u003E was supposed to be an A class asteroid, only to find a D class with a similar name on a similar trajectory. I discovered this after the A class was already half way through the system and it was too late to launch an intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlarm rules\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECatching the asteroids takes a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of time. KAC is basically a requirement to make this part of the game playable. Beyond the functionality of the KAC being included in stock, though, I think it should be possible set alarm rules that don\u0027t have be made explicit \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E time. The rules would have the form of something similar to \u0022Always alert player [X time] at/before [Y event]\u0022, for example \u0022always alert player 60 seconds before any vessel reaches any atmosphere\u0022 or \u0022Always alert player when asteroids enter Kerbin\u0027s SoI\u0022. This has a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of applications beyond just the asteroids, but it\u0027s useful here too. I totally lost another class D I spent hours redirecting because it flipped through it\u0027s aerocapture on timewarp, and KAC lost it\u0027s alarm because of all the reloading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEvent tables\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe should be able to rapidly get information about the next events that are going to occur, e.g. The time of the next 10 SoI changes. It can presented in a simple tabular form that has one column for each of the following: Object name, object type, SoI change, time of change. We shouldn\u0027t have to manually select each of a half dozen asteroids to see when their Kerbin encounters are going to occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImproved \u0022nearest approach\u0022 indicators\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how these things are supposed to work, but they just... don\u0027t. At least for the asteroids. This system needs to be revised to give accurate information. Multiple times I was sailing on an intercept course with an asteroids with a high relative velocity (usually ~180 degree inclination orbit) and got encounter indicator, despite the fact that I passed within a few 100 kilometers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImproved alignment indicators\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was probably the worst part of the experience: moving the freaking rocks. Even if the alignment indicator appears to be perfectly on the CoM, extremely small imperfections in alignment will cause rotation over the extremely long burns required to move these monsters. The game needs either an improved interface to adjust alignment after linking, or a claw that can align the direction of control with the targets CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are \u0022quality of life\u0022 improvements that, IMO, this part of the game desperately needs to be fun. This is not asking the game to play itself for me, I\u0027m just asking for tools to make it pleasant to do what the game is asking the players to do. Most of these would also vastly improve game play in other sections of the game as well. I cannot see myself trying to redirect anything larger than a B or maybe C before these are implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, once again, these are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Esuggestions for stock\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, not mods. Mods shouldn\u0027t be required to make a game playable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
