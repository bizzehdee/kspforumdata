For an early access game, these types of bugs are expected, since the game is pre-release and the developers would rather create content than fix non game-breaking bugs. However, for a fully-finished release, these bugs are unacceptable, and should be fixed ASAP:\n\nVAB/SPH:\n\n(1) Struts/fuel lines going missing after disconnecting and reconnecting parent node (persistence of fuel lines/struts)\n\n(2) Action groups getting messed up upon disconnecting and reconnecting parts placed with symmetry (persistence of action groups)\n\n(3) Clicking through menus to detach parts\n\nManeuver Node:\n\n(1) Warp to button betraying user by not slowing down to 1x\n\n(2) Under certain conditions, being unable to click on trajectory to add a maneuver node\n\n(3) Encounter changing rapidly between impact trajectory to a complete miss/lack of encounter\n\n(4) Sliding maneuver node too much causes it to be deleted\n\n(5) Buttons on maneuver node being unresponsive/refuse to highlight upon mouse hover\n\nEVA:\n\n(1) Grabbing hold of the ship sometimes ejects you off the ship\n\n(2) Gently hitting something causes Kerbal to put away RCS, causing you to fall...\n\nMap Screen:\n\n(1) Inability to click on filters on top of screen\n\nFeel free to explain to me how i\u0027m using something wrong so the item isnt actually a bug.

The length of time before freeze-up has been getting shorter and shorter with every recent version of KSP. Usually these freeze-ups occur between scene changes. Sometimes they are presaged by graphical weirdness (images can be found in the threads where we have been reporting this problem). Adding mods makes the playtime before freeze-up even shorter. Why does Squad keep letting this problem persist? It\u0027s the closest thing that comes to sucking the fun out of KSP for me.\n\n2) Fix the embarrassingly sloppy SAS system that points the ship at prograde, retrograde, normal, etc. My ships often wildly overshoot the point, then wander back to overshoot again. The ships have plenty of control authority, since I can move the ship into position without overshooting, so this just looks like bad control logic.\n\n3) The way that certain control \u0027buttons\u0027 wobble around when you have a near circular orbit makes it difficult to click on the correct command.
