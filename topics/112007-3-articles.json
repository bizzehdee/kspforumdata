It is unknown which rocket they are using this year.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Good lord, IRFNA/UDMH with Scud engines... It\u0027s basically a big Scud.

No one actually knows the fuels, those you pointed out are speculation, the LOX/RP1 is very unlikely.\n\n2. The engines are Nodong engines, effectively a large Scud engine but with 30t of thrust compared to the Scuds 10t.\n\n3. Surprisingly the rocket actually uses vernier engines on all 3 stages, these were found at the stage impact zones.\n\nEDIT: In regards to LOX/RP1, they are building a new propellent complex that possibly could hold cryogenics so that could come in the future."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T11:55:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1.
