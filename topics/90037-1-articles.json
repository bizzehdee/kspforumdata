So they tell him that they are the new saloon girls on their way to the Dry Gulp Lake, a town just over the next few hills. They had camped for the night and when they woke up in the morning their horses were gone! Maybe run off by wolves or coyotes. They didn\u0027t know. Then they begin to beg him to help them get to Dry Gulp Lake so they could start their new jobs.
