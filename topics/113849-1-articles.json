They are simply not meant to fly fast and at high altitudes.\n\nWhat you probably witnessed is this:\n\n- more intakes generate more drag\n\n- the wheesley engines flame out relatively early, you probably flew with a steep ascent profile so you most likely crossed the boundary of \u0022engine works with very low air\u0022 and \u0022engine has no air at all\u0022 very fast -\u003E the number of intakes does not play a big role in this case\n\n- due to the previous points, your design with the least intakes was the most successful as it had the least drag\n\nIt is surely possible to build a low-tech SSTO based on the Wheesley engine, but its relatively hard.\n\nI would suggest to at least get to Whiplashs before considering an SSTO - or build one that works only on rocket engines.\n\nMore info on intakes:\n\n- [intake air resource flow](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64362-Fuel-Flow-Rules-%280-24-2%29?p=1176695\u0026viewfull=1#post1176695) - this is old but works still the very same way\n\n- check the link in my sig ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) might help preventing asymmetric flame-outs\n\nLet us know if you need more help, a pic of your design will get you a lot of usually constructive feedback.\n\nFly safe,\n\nFjord\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T14:44:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 02:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordFjord**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T15:12:08Z","Content":"Thanks that explains why I was veering during take off.\n\nAlthough I am still confused in the wheesleys description it says they can use up to 2.25 or something resources of air however even with 5 running off 1 unit of air they still ran at 110 kN (most I have been able to achieve as I have yet to see anywhere close to the 167 listed in the description."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T15:20:53Z","Content":"Wheesley\u0027s are designed as low-altitude engines; you won\u0027t go much above 15k on them before they flame out and even then you\u0027ll be lucky to top Mach 1 (if you do, it\u0027ll probably be in a dive).
