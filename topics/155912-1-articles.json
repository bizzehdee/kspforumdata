Today I want to talk about delta-v. For some reason I cant get it about delta-v. I\u0027ve done all the calculations, but then I try to calculate the final equation, It just doesn\u0027t work. Like I watched this video, and he went so fast, and I thought \u0022Okay I have to multiply it all together.\u0022 So I multiplied 345*9.807*0.141 (the example in the video) and I calculated it, they got 1,400 m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E, But I got 477.

Thus, an equivalent form is V_e * ln(m_0 / m_1). I will base this monologue on this form.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, why is exhaust velocity important? Well, a change in velocity (/\\ V) requires a change in momentum. However, momentum is conserved in a closed system. Thus, we must open the system. This is done by expelling mass. The velocity of the expelled mass determines how much mass carries how much momentum. How about the mass ratio and logarithm? Well, it\u0027s obviously important to know the mass if you want to know the acceleration, but that doesn\u0027t matter right now. What matters is how much total change in momentum (and thus velocity) you can do. And that\u0027s about ratios*. Now, why the logarithm? Well, as you chuck mass, you\u0027ll find yourself less massive. The change of velocity for the same change in momentum is greater because you\u0027re lighter. The logarithm models this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Take a moment to prove to yourself that it\u0027s all about mass ratios by letting two rockets burn themselves out. One shall be as two of the other, attached nose-to-nose but with one engine off. Burn both to completion and compare their /\\ V.

And for that purpose, it looks pretty small. In order to get this number, you\u0027d have to have a rocket stage that is only 13% fuel. That\u0027s really, really miniscule. Like, that\u0027s the equivalent of mounting eight FL-T100 tanks and then using only one of them. I would say it\u0027s even somewhat difficult to accidentally get such a low mass fraction in KSP - just adding one single tank generally gives you more. You\u0027d have to intentionally go out of your way to find a tank that\u0027s small enough to end up with so little.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, are you sure you understood that youtuber correctly? Are you sure the number you should be multiplying here is in fact 0.141? If the youtuber got a result of 1400, then what he actually multiplied was 0.414, not 0.141.
