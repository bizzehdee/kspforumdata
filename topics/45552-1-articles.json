I decided to fly but I cant figure out the coordinates. An example is, one of the anomalies is listed on the map website at 35.5705:-74.9773 but when I look at the coordinates on the surface information tab of mechjeb, it shows me 6 two-digit numbers. I tried using the \u0022land at\u0022 tab in mechjeb and putting in 35.57.05 -74.97.73 but it started heading out to the ocean and not in the direction of the place I wanted to go.
