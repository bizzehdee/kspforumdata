Both voltage and heat cause atoms to move around more easily. That is, of course, simplifying things quite a bit, but it is basically what it boils down to. Moving atoms are factual damage - you have a chip that internally is shaped differently than before and intended. Any powered chip will have some level of atom displacement, but when used within the design limits it will take longer than the economical lifespan of a chip to run into any kind of trouble. However, if you increase voltage, effects become stronger. As we know from electroplating, they can occur at low temperatures. Add voltage and speed up the process. The temperature increase is negligible in a large body of fluid. However, as we all know, reactions tend to happen faster and more readily when temperatures are higher.

I don\u0027t think there is anything I can really do about it at this point. I don\u0027t really have enough money to buy another video card outright,\u00A0I would have to sell my current 980 first. This would suck and would leave me without my rig for a little while. At the end of September, I will have a lot more money and can buy a new card then. Looking at the 1070 specs, it absolutely seems worth it, especially if I can get a decent price for my 980 (although with the 1070/1080s out now, I may have a harder time getting a good price). Likely, I will go with the 1080, it isn\u0027t that much more expensive. At the end of September, will there be a new badass card about to hit the market, though?
