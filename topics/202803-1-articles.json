unit\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 The reason for it is because the other things that are measured on a rocket, such as Fuel or Ore or even IntakeAir, have mass and volume, so (although this was not always the case) the developers decided to standardise the massive things to metric or metric-derived masses, volumes, and densities.\u00A0 EC doesn\u0027t have any of these properties, and more to the point, the way it is used in the game is definitely a departure from real-world physics, so even if it were to be standardised, it wouldn\u0027t be realistic.\u00A0 For example, batteries in KSP function a lot more like capacitors.\u00A0 A number of rocket engines have \u0027alternators\u0027, which would be a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0short-lived experiment if one tried it

it was the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eleast\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0metric.\u00A0 It\u0027s still very metric, but a lot of the units used in astronomy stand apart from the metric system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of that is due to the use of the arbitrary--but situationally appropriate--units of measure you described.\u00A0 The simple fact is that astronomical measurement is so far off the scale that SI\u00A0doesn\u0027t have the range\u00A0to properly accommodate it.\u00A0 In addition to the AU and parsec (and this is hardly an exhaustive list), there is the gee, which is technically a unit of acceleration, and also a selection of masses and distances\u00A0that derive from astronomical objects and not SI base units.\u00A0 Black holes, for example, are described in terms of solar masses--which, on the one hand, I understand, but on the other, I\u0027d really, really like to hear someone use the word\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eyottagram\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in a sentence. \u00A0In fairness, though, one solar mass is beyond the limits of even the newly-proposed SI prefix definitions at 1,989 \u003Cem\u003Equeccagrams\u003C/em\u003E, and compounding the prefix, i.e., \u0027kilo-queccagram\u0027, is not allowed.\u00A0 I could go with 1.989\u00A0ronnatonnes, but I consider that to\u00A0blur\u00A0the line between systematic measurement and just making stuff up to sound cool.\u00A0 There\u0027s a reason that astronomers tend to use scientific notation for everything:\u00A0 1.989\u00A0x 10\u003Csup\u003E30\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0kg is sterile, but it won\u0027t make anyone burst into fits of giggles.\u00A0 At the other end of the scale, I once saw a paper describe the gas pressure in a nebula in terms of particles and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ekelvin per cubic light year\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 It\u0027s a perfectly valid unit (it\u0027s even pseudo-SI if you consider that,\u00A0since the speed of light defines the metre, a light year is a valid derived unit), albeit it is an odd construction.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0It makes sense because the density and temperature of a nebula are relatively easy to measure at a distance, and it\u0027s all related through the Ideal Gas Law, so it should be apparent that astronomers\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0how to use SI ... it\u0027s just that often, they\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecan\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother\u00A0part of it is that many, many of the quantities used in astronomy are technically outside of the metric system\u0027s purview because they lack dimension.\u00A0 Of the six\u00A0Keplerian elements, only semi-major axis is an SI unit.\u00A0 Eccentricity is a dimensionless ratio;\u00A0longitude of ascending node, argument of periapsis, inclination, and true anomaly at epoch are all angles (and therefore also dimensionless ratios, albeit with extra conversion factors).\u00A0 I\u0027ll grant that orbital state vectors are typically metric, but they are not used in KSP.\u00A0 Angles do deserve a special mention:\u00A0 obviously, the radian can be derived by dividing the length of arc in metres by the radius, also in metres, and I\u0027m certain you\u0027re aware that\u0027s how it\u0027s defined for use in SI.\u00A0 I\u0027d be willing to accept that for the same reason that I\u0027m willing to accept the temporal second\u0027s adoption by SI (the unit saw utility in\u00A0a number of prior systems before SI gave it a specific\u00A0definition), but the problem is that astronomers tend to measure angles in degrees (and its subdivisions:\u00A0 a parsec is one\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Earcsecond\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of parallax, after all).\u00A0 \u00A0Degrees and angular seconds are accepted for use\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewith\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0SI, but they\u0027re\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0SI.\u00A0 They aren\u0027t even coherent units; they require conversion factors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to leave rocketry out of it, either, but in rocketry, we get a lot of ratios:\u00A0 thrust-to-weight for determining a rocket\u0027s lifting ability against the local gravity, mass ratio for calculating its available delta-V, and payload fraction\u00A0for determining its capacity (and therefore efficiency).\u00A0 There is lift-to-drag ratio, too, although that is arguably more appropriate to aeroplanes (and spaceplanes) than to rockets in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of this, of course, is to argue either for or against the use of the metric system.\u00A0 I\u0027m not arguing at all:\u00A0 I am merely pointing out that any system designed for broad applicability is going to run into edge case trouble when confronted with highly technical, highly complex\u00A0fields such as rocketry and astronomy, and especially so when it operates at the extremes of scale.\u00A0 As such, you\u0027ll find that there are a lot of situations that require either non-standard units or a lot of powers of ten.\u00A0 However, just as with measuring gas pressure in a nebula, the metric system is often perfectly valid for deriving those units or counting those powers of ten.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

there.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESpecific X\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is simply a measurement of some quantity divided by the mass to give the amount of that quantity per unit mass.\u00A0 It\u0027s particularly useful when comparing things such as different-mass objects in orbit (or the same object that changes mass, such as a rocket).\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EImpulse\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is a quantity of force multiplied by its duration (time), and it takes units equivalent to momentum (newton-seconds in SI, which simplifies to units of mass times displacement\u00A0divided by time). \u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESpecific impulse,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0therefore, technically\u00A0takes units equivalent to\u00A0velocity (displacement divided by time).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow, then, do we get \u0027specific impulse\u0027 measured in seconds?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe newton\u00A0(the current SI unit of force)\u00A0was not standardised until 1946--it wasn\u0027t even officially\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enamed\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0until 1948.\u00A0 What, then, did a German rocket scientist in the early to mid-1940s use as a unit of force?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EKilograms\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Oh, yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EKilogram-force\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is a\u00A0unit\u00A0equivalent to one\u00A0kilogram in a one-gee acceleration, so in other words, it equates to 9.80665 newtons.\u00A0 This technically means that washroom scales ought to be calibrated in newtons and not kilograms (maybe dekanewtons for the sake of close-to-familiar numbers), because unless that scale is a mass balance, it is measuring weight--i.e., force--and not mass, and will, for example, show a reduced value if used on the moon where the force is less because the gravity is less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder the German system then in place, mass was a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ederived\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0unit, not a base unit, so kilograms-force were more fundamental than the kilograms we know today.\u00A0 It is true that this unit had a proper name,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ekilopond\u003C/em\u003E, though the word \u003Cem\u003Ekilogram\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was often used interchangeably with it.\u00A0 In any case, the point is that aside from the ambiguities that arise when people use the same name interchangeably for units of mass and units of force, when you take units of force multiplied by\u00A0time and divide, not by units of \u003Cem\u003Emass\u003C/em\u003E, but by units of \u003Cem\u003Eforce\u003C/em\u003E, it leaves only time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is true that the U.S. customary system has the same problem with \u003Cem\u003Epounds-force\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Epounds-mass\u003C/em\u003E, and the correct unit of mass, the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eslug\u003C/em\u003E, has not seen widespread use.\u00A0 However, those expatriated German rocket scientists would have seen that as a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efeature\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the U.S. system because it made things easier and more familiar.\u00A0 Yes, measuring specific impulse in seconds made for easy unit conversion (by obviating the need for it), but that was an emergent property of the systems in use at the time, not a deliberate effort to ease conversion between metric and U.S. units.\u00A0 Keep in mind that we\u0027re discussing \u003Cem\u003Eactual\u00A0rocket scientists\u003C/em\u003E; being good with numbers and with unit conversion is pretty much a requirement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough sometimes, they do get it wrong.\u00A0 I\u0027m looking at you,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMars Climate

were trying to make.\u00A0 On the one hand, it doesn\u0027t take a lot of effort to find out that 2,000 metres per second is 1.203\u00A0x 10\u003Csup\u003E7\u003C/sup\u003E furlongs per fortnight.\u00A0 On the other, I can do the same thing with metric and say that it\u0027s 41.30 megacalories per newton-day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MetricKerbalist","CreatedById":211699,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-03T17:47:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022
