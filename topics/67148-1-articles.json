Into Darkness and Wrath of Khan are glaring examples of this, as they contrast in how the good guys approach the villian; in Wrath of Khan they outsmarted Khan, in Into Darkness they beat him off of pure luck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd obviously, there was his surrender to Kirk and co. upon hearing that 72 torpedoes were loaded in the suddenly many tubes on board Enterprise (I\u0027ll never know where all those torpedo tubes came from...).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was another problem that I had with the movie, was the tampering with the ship design. The original Enterprise was not equipped with torpedoes; it was a gun ship that relied on its phasers. It was not until much after the five year mission that the original Enterprise was outfitted with two forward torpedo tubes just above the reflector dish (during the events of the first ever Star Trek movie). The Enteprise-A and B were the same way, only two forward tubes. The C, who knows, and the D had one rapid fire tube on the front, and then a rear torpedo tube. The Enterprise-E (the first true torpedo boat) was the only one that had enough tubes to fire that many torpedoes at once, and even those gave way to the much newer and much more powerful quantum torpedoes that Captain Picard spammed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does sadden me a bit that the Star Trek series is stepping away from its roots.

The amount of backstabbing that constantly went on throughout my entire school life and on the street. It was insanity. BUT, there was this Star Trek thing, where camaraderie held importance, and instead of fighting for position, everyone worked together to achieve something greater. Star Trek was my only window into how a civilized society SHOULD behave, and it played its part in keeping me sane. Were that the Abrams Star Trek, what would I see? Spock, Trek\u0027s classic \u0027voice of reason\u0027 flipping out and beating the crap out of people at every turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pathetically easy to see why Star Trek got reinvented like this. Hollywood doesn\u0027t want to teach lessons anymore. They want us to feel like our CURRENT society is the perfect one, so more and more often, other worlds we see on screen are carbon copies of this one. Even the Smurfs film ended up happening in \u0027reality\u0027 instead of in its fantasy world, because the audience can\u0027t relate to it. With the Star Trek reboot... the plan was quite deliberate. In the original timeline, post-WWIII, Cochrin\u0027s Warp Ship attracts the Vulcans, and initiates First Contact. The Vulcans, a people who survived their primal era and developed a society that was mostly free of it. Taking humanity by the hand, they help us achieve a (mostly) peaceful space-faring civilization. Take away the Vulcans, and humans are left to evolve (or not, for that matter) with the same wasteful behaviors they\u0027ve always had, but also in space. The end result is a society just like ours, but with cooler toys. Much more tasteful to the modern audience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T20:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do not like Star Trek 2009, because they destroyed Vulcan, hope in next movie Q pop-up from nowhere and fix all that mess, what JJ Abrams, did in first movie \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T20:21:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pawelk198604\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pawelk198604\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI do not like Star Trek 2009, because they destroyed Vulcan, hope in next movie Q pop-up from nowhere and fix all that mess, what JJ Abrams, did in first movie \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least I knew that one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T20:47:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESurprised you haven\u0027t seen Nemesis yet.

No real spoilers follow, but if you think you\u0027ve spotted one, just skip to the next post. The Star Trek-hurry-it-up-with-that-franchise-continuation-into-the-21st-century movies approach has been rather lackluster to me. Sure, glitzy special effects (and an Enterprise with what looks like a hydroelectric dam\u0027s 20th century components in the engineering section) is OK (yeah, that lighting in your face on the bridge regardless of direction you look is \u003Cem\u003Especial\u003C/em\u003E). As others have pointed out, physics got tossed out of the air lock. For me, even the casting of the antagonists was strained, at best. And hey, the difference between aliens and humans is the surface area of their tattoos.\u003Cp\u003EOK, they were fun to watch once, in the theater. But since I also like to buy DVDs, that\u0027s just more cash for movies I want to actually keep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make Star Trek realistic. They tried it with ST: The Motion Picture. A LOT of the sluggish nature of that film can be attributed to an attempt to make it feel more like what we knew space travel was really like (which we didn\u0027t have much footage of when TOS originally aired). But, the Enterprise in that film looks more impressive than any other. Under impulse it moves like a ship of such size should move. It just feels big. As time went on throughout the film series, it became more and more like jet-fighter combat, with maneuvers that would tear such a massive ship apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbrams more or less tried to turn it into Star Was (which is probably why Disney hired him to make Star Wars).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut couldn\u0027t we find a happy medium between the two extremes?

Combine Star Trek with, say... Gravity?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for a long time against making sci-fi too realistic has been budget limitations. Everything, the environments, the movement of the ships, the aliens, the more realistic you make them the more complex they are (and thus more expensive they become). This is becoming less and less true with time, as CGI becomes so much more powerful. Unfortunately a lot of the first attempts at using this CGI-heavy approach at sci-fi story-telling have been... not great. Elysium, After Earth, Stargate Universe as well. They all seem to try and take a hard SF approach but really just fall under bad \u0022gritty realism\u0022. Avatar, Moon and District 9 I would say were better and more successful at selling the notion, but again those didn\u0027t please everyone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also classify Inception as a good hard SF space film, just because the way those sets were moving would have worked SO WELL in a micro-gravity environment.

The most important age demographic has dwindled down to being nothing but teenagers - the age group that is easiest to swindle. If you\u0027re not a teenager, you\u0027re not the target audience for practically anything.

Depends on your definition of goofy. He was goofy in TOS, but definitely not in the same way. Shatner\u0027s melodramatic portrayal of Kirk is quite infamous.
