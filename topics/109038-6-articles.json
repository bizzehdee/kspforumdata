There was a couple of changes in 1.1 that may effect the release.\n\n1. Bad news, KM\\_gimbal will not be updated. Fortunately axial gimbal control is now stock, I just need to see about implementing it.  \n\n2. The Hot Rockets Style exhaust FX used to require SmokeScreen. I\u0027m not sure if it is required anymore but there is a possibility that the FX won\u0027t display without it. Module Manager and Firespitter have been updated. Edit: SmokeScreen got an update.\n\n3. I have to change the hierarchy of the engine heating FX and the animation. Fortunately legacy animation is still supported at least seen for emissives but not sure for transform. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, Shinji-The-Kerbonaut said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Nice of you to keep the *only* possibly good turboprops away from the public.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Oh, and making people who want this for 1.0.5 being forced to wait for 1.1, which, let\u0027s be honest, won\u0027t be coming out until early May at best.\n\u003E \n\nSee above, and don\u0027t be a \\*\\*\\*\\*.
