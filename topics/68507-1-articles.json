If you are throwing out energy, you can still generate thrust (just very little, since mass is an awful lot of energy). A Giant laser would work, however it would (very slowly) use up the filament or whatever you are using, and unless you give several exawatts of power to it, you won\u0027t be going anywhere soon.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s get mathy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a specific equation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically under Physical Property.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMomentum of a photon: p = h/lambda\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eh is the plank constant\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elambda is the wavelength of the photon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe energy of a photon: E = hc/lambda\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec is the speed of light: 3e8 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the amount of momentum that you can impart on our spaceship (p) is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep = E/c\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere c = 3e8 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE = joule\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep = kg * m/s (1 p can accelerate 1 kg to 1 m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what does this mean? It means that if you have, say, a 1 kg spaceship (wow, you\u0027re really, REALLY efficient), to accelerate it to just 1 m/s (give it a deltaV of 1 m/s), you need 3e8 joules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, in another word. if you have a 1kg spaceship, and you want to keep accelerating it at 1 m/s^2, you need 3e8 watt (3e8 joules per second), or 300 megawatts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Apollo command and service module has the mass of 30 tons.

Let\u0027s use a nice round number of 1,000 megawatts per reactor, this means that to accelerate the Apollo 11\u0027s command and service module enough for it to slowly lift off from earth with just pure photon emission, and assuming 100% efficiency (typical diode laser hovers around 50%), you\u0027ll need 90,000 reactor somehow pumping ALL their power into the Apollo 11 CSM.
