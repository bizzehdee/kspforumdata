Lowering the density means that editing a part.cfg file for a fuel tank or engine is just a matter of changing the resource name, instead of tweaking the actual numbers).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve modified my KW Rocketry install so that the high-ISP lifters use LH2\u002BOxidizer instead of LiquidFuel\u002BOxidizer. I\u0027ve also modified BobCat\u0027s MPSS NERVA engine, and the base nuclear thermal engine to use LH2\u002BNuclearFuel instead of LiquidFuel\u002BOxidizer, merged BobCat\u0027s NuclearFuel with Selentic\u0027s U235 fuel, and added an always-on electric generator to each of the Nuclear Thermal Engines. I\u0027ve also changed the \u0027big orange\u0027 tanks to store LH2\u002BOxidizer instead of LiquidFuel\u002BOxidizer, and changed a few of KW\u0027s fuel tanks to store pure LH2 with no Oxidizer (for the nuclear engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, KW Rocketry has a \u0027please do not redistribute\u0027 notice in its readme.txt.
