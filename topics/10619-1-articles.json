Im new here and Ive had a look through the forums and used the search function but I couldnt find any help on this subject, so I figured Id ask here: Is there a way (beyond what I find in the options menu of 1.4.4) to disable the particle effects (such as smoke etc) to help me get a few extra frames on take off? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few rediculous sized ships but I literally get 0.33 fps on their first stage of takeoff making it very hard to even detach the first stage of my rocket which is pretty frustrating to say the least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there was also a way to perhaps lower the model detail beyond the options just so I can at least get the ship into orbit, please let me know as well\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-15T03:19:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do not believe so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, they do tend to cause a lot of lag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-15T03:55:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only way (that I know of) at this time is to go into the part CFGs.
