So if the detector reads 5, then it\u0027s about half the surface gravity on kerbin (1/2 g). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a funny thing, that gravioli detector, in real life it would be something like a detector of gravitons. But gravitons are not proven to exist, although they are part of the Standard Model. In reality there is no way to measure gravitation, because gravity is indistinguishable from acceleration, as described in theory of relativity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
