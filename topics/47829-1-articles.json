You will always get center of mass changes, using fuel change it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP we can not set trust level for each engine however I believe some mods allows this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo compensate KSP reaction wheels can handle off center trust. this does not work in real world as the wheel whould be forced to spin faster and faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-09T15:43:58Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2013 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by magnemoe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycix","CreatedById":76916,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T16:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is just a wild guess, but I\u0027d say they rotate the engine nozzles to line up with the CoM, aka thrust vectoring.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-09T16:09:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2013 04:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Psycix\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T17:08:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not just probe release that affects center of mass, but propellant slosh, antenna cantilever pendulum motion, etc. The working engine (one of the two engines is a redundant spare) is constantly gimballing to account for that stuff during a burn.
