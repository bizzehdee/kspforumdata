In practice, it leaves much to be desired. Here are some of the things I\u0027ve run into, feel free to add on if I jog anyone\u0027s memory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfirst off. The horizontal pan on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E camera is non-existent. Fine mostly, for rockets. But building planes with it is an exercise in frustration. You used to be able to hold shift to switch between rotate and pan. Having it on the middle mouse button (wheel) means it messes with the zoom function.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext\u00A0 The move tool is to cluttered. I found it difficult to grab the arrow I wanted and I hated having rotate and translate on the same tool. I miss the rotate globe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnchors, well the buttons again are to small. When the pan didn\u0027t work as expected I thought maybe changing the anchor would recenter the camera on the new anchor. It did not. These problems, and the buttons just not responding sometimes had me pulling out hair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart manager, again to clutted, and far to large. It was good that it opened on the part I clicked on, but with the dropdowns and long list of parts I still found it difficult to figure out/find what part I was affecting. A highlight would go a long way, maybe break it up by stages? I like the idea of it, but if I just want to mess with the part I clicked on I found myself wishing for the old P.A.W menus.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWings, I\u0027m on the fence. I found the sliders not fine grained enough to use efficiently. The lack of text adjustments didn\u0027t make sense. Like the box is there with a number, why can\u0027t I click on it and just type what I want? All and all I preferred the way the procedural wings mod did it, via a combination of draggable handles and the box with sliders and text input. And all of this is only when they worked. I often had to exit the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and re-enter because I could just not activate the shape tool, could not grab them again after placing them, and could not attach parts to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAction groups, I haven\u0027t really messed with them. But I will say this. I thought it was silly to have that in the same window as the part manager. I don\u0027t need the parts list when doing action groups. Just leave where it was, replacing the list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe list, It\u0027s much improved, I give them that. There isn\u0027t enough categories though. Some of the condensed choices just baffled me. It took a hot min to figure out how to get rid of a part on the mouse. And It frustrated me that when I was trying to drop a part I had to find an empty space to do it without picking up another part at the same time. Could we not do that? The only other issue I have is the part size isn\u0027t clear by name only. So it makes it harder to deal with in the part manager.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlacing parts, while mostly straightforward. What was missing, and is just default muscle memory for me is holding shift to force it to only connect to nodes. I honestly didn\u0027t realize how much I rely on that to be efficient.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s all I can think of for the moment. This is more not working as expected/user friendly and less this is broken, aside from the wings. I think muscle memory is biasing me. But I don\u0027t think that\u0027s exactly a me problem.

It\u0027s the UI elements themselves and how you interact with them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, the Parts Action Window in KSP1 was a much more efficient method of presenting and interacting with part-specific data than the monolithic Parts Manager they have now. When I right-click on a part, I want to interact with that part only. Presenting information about all parts on the entire craft is inefficient in that it forces me to concentrate more on interacting with the Parts Manager itself to process all of the data that I don\u0027t want at that moment, instead of focusing on just the data I am requesting at that moment in time. This will be especially important when designing large interstellar ships in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother example is how there is now a gap between the parts palette and the edge of the screen. In KSP1, if I didn\u0027t like a part or wanted to get rid of several parts quickly, I could simply click on them and jerk my mouse to the left side of the screen. I didn\u0027t even have to look at where the mouse was when I left-clicked to throw the part away because I knew my mouse was up against the far left side of my screen, and anywhere along the left side would allow me to left-click again to drop the part to delete it. Now, I have to pause what I am doing and place the unwanted parts in a very narrow target area in the bottom left part of the screen to delete them. This may sound like an inconsequential issue, with a difference of fractions of a second, but its the cumulative time spent needed to hit a smaller target each time I remove a part and the attention constantly being pulled away from my craft to focus specifically on the action of deleting the part. This is quite cumbersome over several hours of gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-17T16:01:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224261098\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212501\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221679068357\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002267915\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Raptor9\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, Raptor9 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I have to pause what I am doing and place the unwanted parts in a very narrow target area in the bottom left part of the screen to delete them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot really.
