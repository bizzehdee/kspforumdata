When I freely admit to being a KSP Win64 user (having used the Unfixer tool) and being forever tainted as \u0027annoying\u0027 or \u0027irrelevant\u0027. Since switching to Win64 (because, with the amount of mods I want to use, OpenGL is sorely needed but breaks TextureReplacer reflections - Win64 doesn\u0027t have that problem. I have like 8GB RAM and a meh CPU on this laptop anyway, reflections are literally the only benefit I gain from Win64), I have not once reported a bug to ferram4 at all or any other modder without first verifying on x86. I know Win64 is unstable, the fact I had to hack it means I\u0027m dabbling in things that ought not be dabbled into. But it makes me sad that the actions of other idiots tars me with the same brush. I recently had a bug with InterstellarFlightSwitch - first thing I did? Switch to x86 (even though none of the mods involved are specifically against Win64) and minimal mods for testing.\n\n5thHorseman, you say I have that choice of number 1, of not reporting bugs when using Win64, but the reality is that I don\u0027t. Because if I report a bug and have admitted in the past that I use Win64 KSP, I\u0027m assumed to also be a moron that doesn\u0027t actually check things. So I have to say \u0027yes I use Win64 KSP normally, but this was on x86 because I\u0027m not stupid\u0027 and even then, I can sense the judgement.\n\nJust makes me sad, is all. Half the time, I don\u0027t bother posting something because I\u0027m worried it\u0027ll just be ignored as another \u0027stupid Win64 nonsense \u0027bug\u0027 report\u0027. Ah well. What does it really matter, in the grand scheme of things.. I stay quiet, bugs will still get reported by other users and fixed, I get locked out of one of my favourite mods, I lose interest in a video game and end up sad that the chuffing asset loader was stupid enough to kick off this whole thing :/"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T02:51:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 5thHorseman, you say I have that choice of number 1, of not reporting bugs when using Win64, but the reality is that I don\u0027t.

It\u0027s not against any of our community rules in and of itself, and we\u0027re not in the business of banning topics just because some don\u0027t like them. \n\nSome players want to run the Win64 workaround. Some modders want to block their mods from working there. A thread where they talk to each other (civilly, one hopes) about their perspectives is far from useless and may help them reach common ground of understanding.\n\nAs always, if you don\u0027t like a thread you are free to not read it."},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T17:32:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Renegade, your personal theory is in fact totally correct. Unity 4.x has a known bug where D3D9 on PC (and, sadly, the OSX/OpenGL version too) keep a shadow copy of all textures in system RAM even after they\u0027ve been uploaded to VRAM, even if you explicitly tell Unity not to (as KSP does).\n\u003E The Windows OpenGL client does not have that bug. That\u0027s why you get ram savings, and why adding more parts barely increases ram footprint.\n\nWow...\n\nWould there be any way possible to work around this (without using OpenGL) or is this an unfixable bug with Unity? aka Unity not us :^)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T23:39:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mythbusters844**"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T19:32:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wow...\n\u003E Would there be any way possible to work around this (without using OpenGL) or is this an unfixable bug with Unity?

I would hope this would be the case anyway.\n\nAs far as mods and W64KSP, each mod maker is completely within their rights to not allow their mod to run on a hacked version of KSP. It causes headaches for them that they could well do without which are not their fault.\n\nMyself I have made the choice to run 64 bit and just not use those mods. Stock has come a long way towards having better chutes and atmosphere and I don\u0060t miss them as much as I would have before although the game would be better with them of course.\n\nI find, at least on my install, that I suffer far less crashes with 64 bit than 32 bit although the reason for crashes has changed. It used to always be an out of memory crash reliably after 20 minutes of play and now it is due to running a hacked version but the frequency of crashing is around 10% of what it was. Sometimes I run for many hours faultlessly."}]}
