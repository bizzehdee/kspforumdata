I understand your feeling overwhelmed but you are taking on a lot of tasks at once. It may be worth focusing on one task at a time. I wish i knew more about modding and configs or i would gladly help you with the shuttle. I have little experience or knowledge in really anything else. Along with personal reasons i took a step back as there where so many other projects being tasked that i had very little knowledge about. It may be worth taking a seat on so many projects and focus on one at a time. If you wish i would be glad to PR for you so you are not overwhelmed on the forums. You have me on skype feel free to contact me at any time. I do beg of you not to abandoned the shuttle. Other modders have been working on orions, CST and of course many progress/soyuz what has always been needed is the shuttle. It is getting better and better the shuttle is fully at a point to where it is usable in nearly every way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou dont need to make every adapter ever designed by NASA lets be fair here this is kerbal half the fun is creating your own payload launch and setting it up in the cargo hold. I have done this since the rocket2gunz edition. A large docking port at the back of the payload bay and build from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is an idea to maybe balance your work. Make a stawpoll on what people want to see most. Let everyone vote on what they want to see then focus on each project based on the straw poll. Your an extremely talented modder mike but you take on projects that usually have teams. KSO has a team and thats a collection of 2 shuttle types and space station parts, you have exceeded that greatly. I will be glad to help you manage community outreach i do it for a living.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the community some basic things i think we might need is some documentation like KSO has to help people using this mod understand it since it is so complex. Before you throw in the towel take a breather. Let the community relax with their demands.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thaetre","CreatedById":150192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T21:08:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Mike, sad to see you let go of this project and your ISS one, you did such a great job on them!
