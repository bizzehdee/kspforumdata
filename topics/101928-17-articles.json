But seeing KospY\u0027s view about KSP being about building ships and inventions to solve problems instead of relying on quick fixes made me pause. Now I use those little KAS winch socket thingies on the containers and just winch them wherever I need them. Being able to attach winches wherever I want is a godsend. Just attach a winch next to the receiver cradle and attach to the new container and pull it across. I normally have a follower winch on the donor craft that\u0027s unclutched to arrest the container when it gets near where it needs to be.
