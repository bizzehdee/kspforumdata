I have several mods installed and wanted to remove quiet a bit of them (including TAC life support and deadly re-entry because they are becoming a hassle to deal with anymore). I destroyed all my active flights/vessels using these parts in my save, then deleted the mods. When I load up my save, I am unable to click on any buildings or anything. I can only go to the research builiding and then it won\u0027t let me back to the main screen. Additionally I cannot load the main menu either. Why is this happening? I thought after deleting all the active flights and everything using the modded parts that it would be okay to delete them, but it\u0027s screwing up my save still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried everything I can think of. I backed up my save files but I\u0027m having a ton of problems trying to get my save to load even without any mods. Can someone please help or know why this is happening? You think removing all the mods would make the save file work correctly but that\u0027s not the case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T23:20:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou did not remove all of your mods then.

Mods cannot cause problems if they are not loaded into the game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a matter of fact, I did and I think the mods somehow may have caused a corruption in the game save. Let me try to explain this whole situation. I wanted to remove several mods from my KSP to the game would load faster and I also got tired of the deadly re-entry and life support. When I deleted the mods, it somehow corrupts my game save but now allowing to click on any buildings or anything, it\u0027s like the interface completely bugs out or something. I completely deleted my entire KSP folder (after backing up my saves), re-installed KSP with nothing but the squad folder and NASA Mission folders in the game data, and when I try to load my game save in an un-modded copy, it acts up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO here\u0027s the deal, or what happens anyway... when I load my game save the way into the vanilla KSP, it pops up with several messages saying there are missing parts/components (which is to be expected when mods are moved). The game acts up after I close all those windows. Like, I can\u0027t click on any of the buildings. When I try to press escape and go back to the menu, it just gets stuck on the screen with all the buildings. The only one I can visit is the research building and after I try to back out of there, the menu bugs out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I reload KSP after all of this, my game crashes and creates a crash report. I attempted several things already:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I happen to be a programmer and I attempted to modify the game save and remove parts/vessels of mods. This did not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I attempted to reload all of my old KSP with the mods and delete all active ships in orbit and everything that was using modded parts. My game save is STILL corrupted. I also tried to do this with the vanilla version after deleting everything with mods reloading it into a vanilla version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I\u0027ve tried both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of the game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, what is going on here is the game save is messed up. When I load in, I can\u0027t click on any buildings on the main screen anymore. I\u0027ve looked this issue up a bit and I seen something about not being able to click on buildings if kerbals are missing from science nodes are something. All in all, I just want to be able to use my game save with all my current currency, science, and landing sites (where I planted flags at). I\u0027ve already sacrified a giant space station that took me over a month to build so I can get a clean game going with less mods.
