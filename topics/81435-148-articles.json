That said, ive completely given up on anything above 100t as it is pointless to have ships that large, as even my new FlaKShip will at a minimum disable it by shooting off all its ordinance with KDrone-Ms (pocket ibeam\u002Bprobe\u002BRTG\u002B2 RCS blocks\u002Bdecoupler). These thinsg are so accurate that they can reliably target a very specific section, even fly up the nose to take out a stack of weapons, something very few weapons ive seen capable of doing reliably. And although it carries missiles in multiple spots, i have what, 40 of the missiles on my anti-fighter corvette (if i can bear loading 280 parts in weapons atop a 160 part base hull), i could probably chop it in two firing all of that at the same area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Three1415\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Three1415\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThus is the weakness of large vessels.\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here are my two most recent vessels, the 45-ton Lachrymeum Class Gunship and the 91-ton Photon Class Ion Frigate, both updated in terms of firepower and durability:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/7kypik3nfzrtqm3/Photon_Class_Ion_Frigate_Mk_II.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPhoton Class Ion Frigate Mk II\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/j67cfm5cc8rq4s2/Lachrymeum_Class_Gunship_Mk_II.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELachrymeum Class Gunship Mk II\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny results from combat testing would be welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are pretty good, but they seem to have issues with high enough mass phased rounds (like every single ship ever made). That said, they are well armored, but sadly not part efficient, and like many other ships, aint gonna see many battles until U5. very very resilient to weaker weapons, and even stufflike my lighter Tripedo-S which seems to shatter when hitting very dense armor like this style (S/H still works wonders against anything including these though). Finally, the ships get instantly obliterated when a corvette class vessel is rammed into them at 2km/s (as does everything else including the corvette that collides at 2km/s), although i needed to reload alot of saves as at that speed its tough to actually HIT something, and you phase thru entire ships alot of the time at such velocities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat reminds me, gotta finish my FK-141 ramming fighter. It has no weapons, but its frontal protection is so insane it can cut anything but the heaviest ships in two at ~200m/s impact with usually minor if any damage to itself. Its heavily inspired by something i saw in a movie at friend\u0027s house, forget the name, this assymetric craft that basically attacked stuff by ramming it, buildings, fighters, whatnot and if i remember correctly flew through a building without suffering any real damage. Still dont remember what that movie was though, just remember this one ship that rammed stuff and could cloak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kStrout\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kStrout\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor reaction cannons, I\u0027ve found that instead of using one huge engine to provide to kick, a bunch of smaller radial engines will do even better, are lighter and consume very little fuel. I\u0027m still testing but I have been able to consistently get 500m/s velocity and only use 5-10 fuel per shot. More updates as development continues.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve found these things to be all but useless from a practicality perspective. Ive tried them myself (railguns, mass accelerators, whatever you want to call them), and sofar they are neither lower in part count or better in lethality then a very generic long ibeam\u002B2 sepatrons unless you are using excessive engines liek clipping 10 KR-2Ls inside themselves, which will make it lethal at the cost of loosing any practicality. A nice gimmick to play around with, but ive yet to get anything out of them in a competitive environment. That said, i do have a frigate in duna orbit (current AKS flagship) that is equipped with a skipper cannon that can do something with luck, although its just not very practical and uses alot of fuel (well the ship its on is a LFO engine powered anyways so i just added the 2 extra skippers to each side as it isnt that much weight for a ~100t ship already, and its a nice utility that ive used many times to launch fighters far away). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, for competitive games, all it takes is a single well placed shot to ruin teh weapon, fire at the area the ammo is stored and either ammo gets shot apart, engines get shot apart, or most likely the whole ship gets cut in 30 pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jon144\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jon144\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s no moon.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, its not a sphere, s trait shared by almost every ship lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-18T02:52:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2015 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T02:54:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022noname117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022noname117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m questioning what that ship even is.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just going to not tell you guys what it is, enjoy trying to figure it out \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dSOMM1D.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dSOMM1D.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
