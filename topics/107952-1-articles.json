In the case of USI\u0027s life support, if you run out of \u0022supplies\u0022 for more than 15 days, most kerbals will refuse to do anything remotely useful other than complain. In the case of Snacks!, you take a hit to your rep... after all... who sends kerbals to delicious-looking planets without any snacks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth provide an excellent way (IMO) to add the consideration for supplies to be consumed over longer time periods without adding complexity that doesn\u0027t add to the game in any significant way. I used TACLS for the longest time, but I use USI-LS now. From a gameplay perspective they are virtually identical. TACLS offers water, oxygen, and food... but they come in containers that automatically portion them out in such a way that all three run out simultaneously... so all you end up really caring about it \u0022how many days to I have right now\u0022. The two mods I mentioned above add that same functionality with less complexity. The only thing unique to TACLS is that you can recycle water, recycle air, produce water/oxygen from LFO, etc... such that you could in theory carry less of one or another by extending those that you can re-use with more devices and more power... but even that in the end simply ends up being a method to \u0022give you more days\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a fictional species in a fictional universe...
