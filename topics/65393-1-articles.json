Last time I looked at this, mainstream physicists consider this nonsense. This does not necessarily mean that it can\u0027t be done, but we should be clear that it is not supported by mainstream physics. Also, it is important to note that even in the best case this is only useful to detect if spacetime can be warped in such a way. It is very clear that this particular method, even if it works, cannot be used for actual propulsion, so you still need to find actual negative mass/energy if you want to build an Alcubierre drive capable of propelling a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother point, that is not usually brought up is that if you can actually build an Alcubierre drive (and assuming General Relativity is correct) then it immediately follows that you can \u003Ca href=\u0022http://exvacuo.free.fr/div/Sciences/Dossiers/Time/A%20E%20Everett%20-%20Warp%20drive%20and%20causality%20-%20prd950914.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ealso build a time machine\u003C/a\u003E.
