What happens if, using your previous launch trajectory, your launch path would cause you to impact another spacecraft in lower orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. What happens if the spacecraft you designed is so near the edge of instability that if you would\u0027ve launched it normally, it would disintegrate sometimes (I\u0027ve some spacecraft prototype that\u0027s near that edge, they\u0027ll occasionally launch successfully, in other time they will spontaneously deconstruct mid-flight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. For interplanetary missions, how would you handle that your \u0022current\u0022 missions may involve a complex set of maneuvers that could only happen at a specific time windows (for example, your mission involves multiple gravity assists to reach Eeloo, which naturally means that all the planets involved must be in the right alignment).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T16:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) \u0022Kessler syndrome\u0022 is still too rare in this game to warrent the worry.

More manual flights, better survivability (though I agree, KSP is avoiding random events, so might be for Mod additions instead). Or, it can only perform to the percentage of the Kerbal pilot, which is always less than 100%. Thus you never get back the full fuel use/orbital height you had in the manual flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I\u0027d actually be happy if it only covered launches. Things like supply launches to a station (fuel/food/kerbals). Or possibly to other planets, but again, as above would have a distance limit and also need to have been done manually before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bit like setting up a trade route. When I have 10 fuel tanks to add to a station/tug, sometimes I long for a way to skip to the next part, flying the tug!
