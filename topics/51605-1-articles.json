I flew a plane to the north pole and it probably took about 40 minutes... I was tired. I landed, stopped, and extended my panels on the plane so I wouldn\u0027t come back to having no power... Well, when I went back to the flight both of the panels were \u0022broken\u0022. So, I\u0027m not trying to cheat... I just want the plane the way it was when I left. I want to do a lot of science up there, now I\u0027m not going to be able to recharge my batteries and the mission is scrapped without that capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, how do I edit the files so that flights vehicle has the panels intact again?
