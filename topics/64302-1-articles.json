What you\u0027re describing is strange, but I can remember there is sometimes a problem with some control parts, e.g. control surfaces normally act differently ahead and behind CoM, but as the CoM passes the part (e.g. as fuel is used up), the surface often keep acting the same way it was, in the end doing the opposite than what it should. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo maybe try to switch to Space Center or some other ship after you dock, then switch back and it might fix itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MoonMan22","CreatedById":78400,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T15:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem your having may be caused by the game getting confused as to where control is coming from.
