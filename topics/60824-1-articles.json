Several lines need to be changed, exactly how depends on the way that the part was oriented in construction. I suggest if you want to go down that route, you make a pair of test assemblies of just an RC-L01 probe core and the docking port, one with the port correct and one with it inverted, and compare the save files. Once you\u0027ve identified the lines that need editing, you\u0027ll need to do some math on the figures in the \u0027position = x,y,z\u0027 lines to get the rotated port correctly located. As it\u0027s obviously not yet connected on one side, if you get the figures wrong it will just look out of place, unless you position it within the space of other parts, which could result in rapid unplanned disassembly. So long as you take a backup of the save file before playing, there\u0027s nothing to lose, and it\u0027s a learning experience.

You need to change the attach node lines, and alter the docking port state. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe attach node lines are \u0022attN = bottom, 0\u0022 and \u0022attN = top, 2\u0022, or something like that. For your first docking port example the lines will probably say \u0022attN = top, 0\u0022 which means the \u0022top\u0022 of your docking port is attached to the parent part (\u0022parent = 0\u0022), while the bottom is either free (it should say \u0022attN = None, -1\u0022 if it\u0027s free) or attached to something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need to switch these, make the bottom attached to the parent part # and the top attach node free. Then you have to go down a bit to the docking port state line and set that to ready (I think the line will say \u0022state = preattached\u0022 for you, change it to \u0022state = ready\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you screw anything up your ship will probably be totally ruined, parts sticking out at odd angles, big gaps in the construction, and maybe parts spawning inside of other parts.
