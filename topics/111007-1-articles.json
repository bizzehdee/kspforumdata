Ugliest thing ever, it looked like one of those nerf footballs with fins on the back. My payload was huge for my tech level, but I finally did it after about 30 reverts and rebuilds. After that the mission was glorious as I fulfilled several big contracts for building an orbital station and transmitting science around the Mun. The grand finale was to land my very well tested and versatile big science bus with 2 labs to do some major exploration, science and surface contracts. I was so happy to have it touch down! Then I went to grab a scientist out of one of the labs to begin the Mun odyssey, and.... there weren\u0027t any. Only Jeb came along for this particular ride... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was pretty mad. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not the first time I forgot some critical detail. I have parked science labs without antennas, I have made landers with no ladder and no way to get back in, probes with no electricity generation, etc. The little stuff can be very costly in this game. VAB has little warnings to help you, but I frequently have to go against those warnings to accomplish my goals, like having a command module pointing the wrong way for use as a rover, blocking one of two hatches, unused engines for separate attached craft, etc. I tend to ignore those warnings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a mod that provides a configurable checklist? I need to be forced to check every item before each launch with a dialog box. Having the right crew is something that comes up a lot with reverts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T13:47:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 01:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cephalo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jansn","CreatedById":131392,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T13:50:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWernherChecker\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63591-0-90-WernherChecker-v0-3-4-Customizable-In-Editor-Pre-Flight-Checklist-%28Jan-5%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63591-0-90-WernherChecker-v0-3-4-Customizable-In-Editor-Pre-Flight-Checklist-%28Jan-5%29\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T14:17:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOoh, thanks so much.
