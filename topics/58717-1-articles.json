Out of the blue, a suspicion entered my mind that it might have to do with part clipping. I\u0027ve clipped parts within other parts thousands of times with no issues before but after some research on the forums I suppose it is a valid cause for ships exploding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, what set of variables causes random explosions related to part clipping? I only began encountering problems with clipped vessel explosions once I started playing on my pretty old laptop. When I played on my tower with an i7 I had no issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill not positive its part clipping causing the issue but I\u0027m wondering... could it be that on slower computers maybe the physics calculations cant catch up before the scene loads causing parts to instantly smash into each-other?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T09:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell I have an old laptop too,it is 5 years old and it\u0027s monitor holding onto superglue \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually my ship explodes on launchpad when I don\u0027t have launch clams or when my ship is too big. :|\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T16:04:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre they saves that you have from before using the laptop?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf yes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be, as you suggest, an issue with performance on slower computers affecting the physics. Try adjusting the physics slider thing (Lagsbane, I can\u0027t remember the official KSP name) to see if that makes any difference, or identify a rocket which reliably explodes and provide the craft file so someone with a higher spec machine can see if they get the same results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf no:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you\u0027re just doing things slightly differently from before and ending up with more chance of clipping errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is more likely in both cases though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jayvaughan08","CreatedById":68055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T08:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replies.
