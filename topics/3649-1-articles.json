It was taxing my poor little laptop to the max and I\\\u0027d left it open for quite a while. However, achieving that velocity is pretty simple with a little rocketry, and perhaps a modified part or two. I used the Intrepid II rocket from the Spacecraft Exchange forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt all happened when a friend, unfamiliar with the game, asked if I could \u0027set the controls for the heart of the sun\u0027 (being a Pink Floyd fan). Naturally I tried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou just have to launch yourself through the sun on an *extremely* eccentric orbit. As the sun has no real modeling of surface or temperature or anything at the moment you can delve deep into the core and launch yourself around what is basically a point-source of gravity at the very center. The first time I tried it I came out at half the speed of light. On this attempt I didn\\\u0027t get quite it quite as fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can post some pictures to detail it if you\\\u0027d like but essentially all you have to do is get into a solar orbit and then do a retrograde burn to turn the orbit into the center of the sun. In my experience the game tends to crash if you aim directly at the center but it doesn\\\u0027t take much to get where you want to go. On this attempt I got into an orbit with an apoapsis of about 17Mm from the Sun and burned from an orbital velocity of ~7000 m/s down to about 0.1m/s and then simply let the ship fall in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t know the math all that well. It may be that simply by slingshotting I was able to achieve the velocity. It may be a glitch of the game engine.
