Of course, you could open another desmos graph and you could put E = mc^2, with c set equal to the speed of light, and m as your variable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the Fourier series is a pretty interesting thing. Just type a function: try\u00A0 f(x) = x^2, or even better, get creative with the functions (of course, with the k-value, just start at k=1, then go on to a higher value). Just make sure the function is in y= form for this to work, because it relies on the function being set equal to y ( aka f(x) ).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
