On practical and ethical grounds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore seriously, I disagree that longevity research is the most necessary kind. There\u0027s a difference between \u003Cem\u003Eextending\u003C/em\u003E lives and \u003Cem\u003Esaving\u003C/em\u003E lives. I can save a life with all manner of trivial interventions - a mosquito net, a supply of rehydration salts, basic first aid, a latrine. Far less trivially, I can save many many lives by providing: adequate clean water, nutrition, shelter and basic medical care to everyone. None of that is likely to extend the duration of those lives beyond that of a normal human lifespan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for the sake of argument, lets assume that the above is a given. Let\u0027s also assume that we can implement your goals of tackling smoking, cardiovascular disease and cancer, without resorting to such drastic measures. Frankly, if we\u0027re ever in a place where those kinds of measures are a) regarded as acceptable by the population and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E enforced by an organisation that is willing, able and mandated to do so, then we\u0027re most of the way down the slippery slope to the dystopian fiction novel of your choice. If I was being snarky, I would suggest that alcohol also be phased out or severely rationed (and good luck with that). Less snarkily, re-working society to be less dependent on automobile travel would be a good start too. Lots of people killed in road accidents every year dontcha know. Not to mention the adverse health effects of all that CO2 and sundry other pollutants from vehicle exhausts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat then? Biologically we would want to focus on neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease and osteoporosis to name but a few. I don\u0027t see a lot of point being immortal if I can\u0027t remember my own name, am crippled by arthritis, or can\u0027t move from my mobility aid without my bones breaking under the strain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESocially and economically, we would need to completely overhaul our current systems to make them fit for purpose with a long-lived or immortal population. Retiring at 65 and living to 165 isn\u0027t going to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPolitically, we would need to ensure that \u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E gets access to this, regardless of social, economic or religious status. If you think we\u0027ve got problems with inequality now, then you aint seen nothing yet, if only the favoured few get access to immortality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysically, we\u0027ll need either a lot more living space or a way of packing a lot more minds into the same space. I would be putting a lot of research into space travel, computers and/or neural uploading. If you can run 99% of the world population in \u0027the cloud\u0027, then a lot of the above problems are solved anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL: DR. Longevity research (defined as lifespan extension beyond the current human maximum) isn\u0027t remotely necessary. Longevity by itself is pointless without an appropriate quality of life to go with it. Longevity coupled to any positive population growth rate is fundamentally flawed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T09:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am rather surprised that Duxwing left one important step out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of eating normal meals (with their variable amount of nutrients) each person would get a chemical mixture (either administered orally or intravenously) with exact the amount of nutrients, that according to calculations a person of the age, gender and body measurements would need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely a necessary step if you want to maximize age and, after all, Duxwing wants to take \u0022whatever means necessary\u0022 to accomplish this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut nope, I wouldn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t be pro such measures.

I agree with this technical definition, but my point of view has always been somewhat akin to parents defending their young. It matters more that the children continue on than that the parent does. It matters more to me that some \u0022me\u0022 continues on than \u0022me\u0022 continuing on. I would of course ideally love for the \u0022me\u0022 that is operating to be the most up to date and complete version of me, but there WILL be situations where this cannot be. Fork a copy of me to pilot the ship against the alien mothership in a kamikaze attack? Sure, why not. Multiple \u0022me\u0027s\u0022 at the same time is fine, if our tech is good enough to do this in the first place, it shouldn\u0027t be that hard to \u0027merge\u0027 the forks. Sure depending on how long the two have been separate this will result in some unique \u0022identity death\u0022 going on, but if all parts are from me anyway then they will accept this. Yeah, if I could I\u0027d pull a Doctor McNinja, fork myself hundreds of times, go to college in all the things, merge again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECessation of conciousness I have always hated as a description of death. Throw in all the technicalities you want about brain activity, dreams, etc. When you sleep you have a cessation of conciousness. The unbroken stream of you doing things has been broken. The universe could fundamentally work in a Langoliers fashion upon you falling asleep. It is all destroyed, your brain vaporized/eaten-by-interdimensional-pacmen, etc. And then the universe is meticulously reconstructed at morning with your brain atomically no different than it should be. All evidence of this erased, then the universe \u0027unpauses\u0027. You would never know. All you know is that when you wake up in the morning, you \u0027know\u0027 you are you. When Mazon Del # 23461235145C wakes up, he will \u0022know\u0022 he is Mazon Del. That will be good enough for him, and thus it is good enough for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: Oh I am quite sure if I had this system that I will experience a nigh-infinite amount of horrors and death experiences, etc. But I accept that as a consequence of my choice. Considering that it is me making that decision on myself and not others, that is pretty fair. Plus, if a given copy of myself doesn\u0027t want to continue this immortality system, they ARE free to make that choice. However they will do so with the knowledge that a new Mazon Del WILL spawn somewhere else without their ability to stop it, a rolled back copy if necessary. As time goes to infinity, the likelihood that a copy of me will be convinced that this system is horrible/immoral/etc and needs to not be done approaches certainty. So if I actually had this system in place, my first goal is to take the system out of my own hands. Whatever pain/argument/etc convinced me then won\u0027t necessarily work on all of me. Time heals all wounds, except for entropy. That\u0027s the only thing that I\u0027ll allow to stop me. But of course the 2nd goal is to fix entropy or find a way to universe jump...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get that my views on this subject are not exactly standard and are not necessarily what others might find ethical.
