I took some time off of my last days of summer vacation to create a guide on interplanetary rendezvous. Due to the limitation of photos we can upload here and my lack of video recording software, I have opted to format it in PowerPoint. Let me know what you think about it. Tell me if you have any problems viewing it or if you have trouble understanding it and I will best see how to remedy the situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it is possible to test out the rendezvous methods yourself out in kerbol orbit. Just grab the lightest command module, put the stock ASAS module on it (it protects you from the space kraken) the smallest fuel tank and the lightest extrasolar engine on. Config the fuel in the tank and give yourself ridiculous amounts of fuel to give you enough leeway for practice. Strap it on a rocket to help get it out of Kerbin\u0027s surface and atmosphere and head off for solar orbit. With planets about to come out we need to prepare ourselves.

When we r captured by a soi via an H-transfer, ourpejected path is always an escape trajectory. There fore we must use delta v to prevent it. The question on how much do we use. It depends how fast we were when we entered the soi. Now if we imagine that we burn a transfer from kerbin to another planet. U would need alot of delta v to prevent the escape trajectory cause u r slow at the top. Now if we did some effort to first establish a intermediary orbit then transfer, the amount of delta v needed to prevent escape trajectory is less then the straight transfer. So much so, that it makes up the effort we put in to our intermediary orbit.

Ive been humbled. Upon my own testing in game, i have found out that i am wrong. Sending a craft that weighs 13.6kmu from kerbin altitude to a hypothetical planet located 60gm with an intermediary orbit located 30gm wastes about 380 fuel units more than just sending your craft straight up to the planet.\u003Cp\u003EAs a guide meant for ease of understanding, practicality, and versatility (like a one size fits all type of thing) it accomplishes its goal quite respectively. However, its not a custom tailored suit. So its not the best option in most cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is less efficient fuel wise but it is easy to throw a couple more tanks on. It is a lot harder to figure out and perform the launch angle out of kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
