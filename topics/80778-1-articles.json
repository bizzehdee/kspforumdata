Thanks to asking in the KSP forums on how to make a good ship, I got a lot of responses and learnt how to make a ship that could escape Kerbins orbit! But as I did this, I managed to miss landing on the Mun AND Minimus (yep I missed a target the size of the moon.....literally!), so that leads me to this question, how do you properly predict where to fly and how? I tried using the apoapsis thing, but as you could expect, I am no genius with it either, help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll answers appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T06:59:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy written/illustrated walkthrough for moon missions can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81320-An-illustrated-moon-mission-walkthrough-for-new-pilots-%28with-link-to-example-ship%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork_werewolf","CreatedById":90749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T07:45:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGetting a Mun landing is far too long for people to rewrite every time.

Do this by clicking somewhere on your route and clicking \u0022Add Maneuver\u0022. Play around with this a little bit. For example, you can burn to Prograde, Retrograde, Normal, antinormal, and I\u0027ve forgot the other to. Maybe you should try out Pecan\u0027s tutorial (in his signature).
