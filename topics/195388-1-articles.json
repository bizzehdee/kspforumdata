Many, many games use it as such, especially strategy/management games. The timewarp saves RL time, but events in-game still progress so the player still needs to weigh how much time they have before a launch window vs how much construction capability they have and what mission vehicles and payloads they have the ability to build in that timeframe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree it has the potential to be annoying if not done correctly and could make the game significantly more challenging (especially with regards to life support), which is why I would advocate for this to be a difficulty option like the current comm network system which isn\u0027t enabled on a normal difficulty game, but might be default on hard and could be toggled on/off to fine-tune the difficulty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see how this would alienate people, many of the same arguments have been used against any kind of stock life support system where the assumption is that it\u0027s forced on everyone and is a worst-case implementation. Given that we have the ability to fine-tune the difficulty in KSP1 and turn off features like reentry heating and comm network requirements, I seriously doubt the devs would force everyone to use the system (especially for sandbox and custom games) and I expect that if they did put the feature in, they would also put some thought on how to make it not overly annoying given that\u0027s how reentry heating and comm networks came in (they were done by mods for years before they became stock).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-07T13:23:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2020 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-07T13:02:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the very least time should continue while in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-07T13:10:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223816434\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195388\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221594123946\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278020\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n47 minutes ago, AlamoVampire said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nim sorry but youre wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo I\u0027m not, I played 2 careers with KTC using time-warp and it was not pointless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt encouraged me to use standardized rockets and reusable tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of building the perfect purpose specific rocket for every mission I had to take into account what I had ready in the hangar and use that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also loved to have my fleet of planes and SSTOs with some planes designed to be flying test platform for new technologies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso loosing a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E while landing means a longer wait for the next mission and/or risking to miss a launch window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConstruction / production times even with time warp are not something new in management games, they\u0027re an integral part of logistics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConstruction time rewards people planning ahead, regardless of time-warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
