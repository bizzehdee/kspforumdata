The Saturn V had major issues before it was the reliable launcher it became. The Space Shuttle was meant to fly in 1977. Although SLS shares a large amount of commonality with the Shuttle stack, a large amount of stuff is new, like the new core stage, 4-engine configuration, 5-segment SRBs, the ICPS and EUS, not to mention an entirely new crew capsule. 5 years of delays?
