Didn\u0027t want any non-stock parts to possibly cause any problems.

With \u0022Show Landing Prediction\u0022 checked and my lander approaching the aim point roughly northwest-to-southeast, during the high deorbit burn, I watched Map view as the blue prediction marker moved westward down the orbital track and approach the red target marker, but then keep right on sailing several hundred km past and well short of the target. MJ would then try a \u0026gt;200 m/s correction burn to lengthen the landing approach, but instead push right back into an oddball highly elliptical orbit. I reverted to a quick save and tried again twice with the same results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was finally able to land by first clicking \u0022Land at Target\u0022 and then at the point in time when the blue and red markers roughly overlapped during the high deorbit burn, aborting the auto landing. I then monitored the reentry and tweaked it a bit with RCS to get the miss distance down to around 700 m. Once I was well through the atmosphere and coasting toward the target at about 20 km altitude, I clicked \u0022Land at Target\u0022 - this time MJ did a few m/s correction burn to get the miss-distance down to about 140 meters, finished the coasting trajectory, popped the chutes and landed at a nice, easy 1 m/s (which is what I have it set for).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I will say that the initial orbit I was landing from was inclined at 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA on purpose so I would overfly more of those archipelagos on Laythe, and the orbit was quite elliptical. However, I was landing on the descending node and very close to perigee; the reentry burn started at around 100 km altitude. Furthermore, the aim point was almost dead-on the ground track, requiring little to no cross-range correction. So the first part of the landing autopilot worked great, as did the actual landing once I was well into the coast phase.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T13:31:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022codepoet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022codepoet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBARCLONE,\u003Cp\u003EThank you for providing logs and other helpful information in your reports.

Interestingly they all seem to relate to the terrain system, which I have discussed a lot with Sarbian. In my own game I sometimes see distortions in the terrain (see picture below) after moving to 0.23 and the log that you quoted contains exceptions all related to terrain vertices and \u0022PQS\u0022 which I do not understand, but believe is related to the celestial body / terrain system. In my own game I sometimes see a log saying \u0022PQS Duna: Restarted\u0022, at which point the terrain visual distortion disappears. Finally on your report that a part of your craft magically exploded - I once had a similar thing happen in testing - one of my engines exploded when I was 1000m AGL. When I checked the flight report (f3) it said that the engine had impacted the ground, which sounds a bit like the terrain had momentarily rush up to mee the craft.\u003Cp\u003ESo I have my suspicions that there is something wacky going on with the terrain system.
