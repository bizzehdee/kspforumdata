I cant understand why Squad decided to change the bar from horizontal to vertical, down the right side of the screen... When using open MechJeb, KER, VOID, or other data info windows, I always line them up along the right edge of the screen... Being on a laptop, the right edge is the best place... Now, I have to leave a large gap along that edge, and now it pushes the windows further into the center of screen, making overall gameplay space even smaller... Add to that the larger stock navball and altitude UIs, I have to always try to keep longer craft completely horizontal in the camera, to see the whole ship, or zoom out so far that its ridiculous... (Yes I know you can resize the UI, but in current form, if I make the UI smaller using stock means, all the text is ridiculously unreadable... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E )\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWould be better for Squad to move the altitude UI all the way to the left, next to the timer/warp indicator, and the navball to the left right next to the staging UI, and put the app launcher back to horizontal in top right corner...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-25T15:20:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2016 03:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Astra_","CreatedById":155195,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T15:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuh, it\u0027s even tied to primary monitor (not to the primary DirectX device).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my case\u00A0it means the launcher always appears far away from mouse pointer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, i cannot press the PLAY button \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0nor settings gear\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
