The shields would be like shields from Star Wars or Star Trek in that they, A) protect the ship for a while until a part of the shield is ablated away (lose power) and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) the ship will lose power the longer the shields remain on.
