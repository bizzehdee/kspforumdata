Would it be possible to replace the polybutadiene with stronger and more stable (but still combustible) medium?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy theory is, if you could do this, you could create a solid fuel stage that would require much less housing and structural support, perhaps even none at all. you could even remove the nozzle, instead opting to design the fuel block with a bell-shaped cavity at the bottom, and the fuel would have to be ignited and burned from the bottom up. And as\u00A0has been proven with rockets like the SS-520, a controllable engine nozzle is not necessarily needed for a functioning rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course the fuel block would have to be very well designed and catalysed so that it would burn completely and maintain its shape. However, with no structural support\u00A0needed, a rocket like this could achieve incredible mass ratios, to the point where even with the low ISPs of solid fuels, significant payload fractions could be achieved. In addition, the cost of launch could be significantly reduced, as complicated casings and staging mechanisms wouldn\u0027t be needed. I see it as a great way to partially negate the tyranny of the rocket equation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, i\u0027m not an aerospace engineer.
