What I have seen as a result is plenty of people who use rules of thumb about how to do things based on some mod mission profile said so, or something they read on the forum, or saw on a video once. But they don\u0027t necessarily understand \u0022Why\u0022 something is more efficient, and having coached a few twitch players through some of these follies caused by blindly following these rules of thumb, I believe that understanding the \u0022why\u0022, and the underlying equations is very powerful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt allows for much greater flexibility and success, especially when mods aren\u0027t available after updates, or haven\u0027t been programmed to solve the actual situation you\u0027ve discovered yourself in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what does actually doing the math assist with? I actually understand the numbers that I see. I know where they came from. And the more I play with the equations, the more I can figure out when to apply them, and when to start breaking the rules....because there are times when radial burns are more efficient than pro-grades, and what autopilots do for inclination changes aren\u0027t necessarily optimal either.

Or in a time crunch I use also use pre-generated dV maps, and an Isp/Mass ratio to dV graph and some head cheese math to build up quick ships from the ground up. Neither of these even require a calculator...the two graphs required are available in the community, and the ratio\u0027s are simple enough that if you can divide and multiply in 2\u0027s and 10\u0027s in your head, you\u0027re golden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t fear the math, or a little work... because the pay-offs can be awesome.

Up to this point, I agree with PurpleTarget\u0027s post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere I disagree with Purp\u0027s post/opinion is that, due to the current state of the game, calculating dV by hand is largely a waste of time. This is because performing the math needed to calculate dV in KSP suffers from two major and related problems: It is impractical, and it is tedious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP gives bovine manure for info during vessel construction. To calculate dV for a staged rocket, you need the following parameters for \u003Cem\u003Eevery stage\u003C/em\u003E: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Estage dry mass\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Estage fuel mass\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ecumulative vessel mass\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eengine(s) ISP\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, we can quickly get \u003Cstrong\u003Eone \u003C/strong\u003Eof those values. The others require a butt-load of work to get out of the program, making hand calculations of dV impractical. Further, because of the cascading nature of changes to dV due changes to payload and upper stages, the work may need to be repeated several times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe calculations are also made tedious since the work has to be repeated for every stage. When students are presented with this kind of tedious, repetitive work, they can \u003Cem\u003Equickly\u003C/em\u003E lose the forest for the trees. (I\u0027m going to swing credentials here for a second, sorry, but it\u0027s needed for perspective) I\u0027m a doctoral candidate in epidemiology and biostats, and I\u0027m defending my dissertation next month.

IMO, trying to calculate dV from what\u0027s presented in game without mods leads to the same problem: so much work has to be put into getting the numbers and running the calculations over and over and over that it\u0027s value as a learning exercise is all but ruined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the devs \u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E manage to get over themselves and just give the players the information the \u003Cstrong\u003Eneed\u003C/strong\u003E to play the game intelligently (what I\u0027ve listed above), I\u0027ll be able to agree with what Purp is saying up there. If you can get the numbers easily (making it \u003Cem\u003Epractical\u003C/em\u003E), then you can plug them into a spreadsheet (removing the \u003Cem\u003Etedium\u003C/em\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut until that time, I\u0027m not going to change my mind that KER/VOID are necessities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MGCJerry","CreatedById":95202,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T18:14:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t read past the first page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play games to have fun.

And I use KER to estimate entire complex missions all the time, by building each piece of the mission backwards in time from landing on Kerbin to launching from Kerbin, and making sure the dV is sufficient at each stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do agree that it all comes down to what you prefer. I have a friend who refused to use any info mods on his Eve lander and return. He also refused to use HyperEdit or any other way to test the ship other than launching each test from Kerbin. It took him months of fairly dedicated play. I have no clue how many hours but I\u0027d not be surprised if it was triple digits. That is as distasteful to me as having so much information pre-flight that I may as well not even bother doing the mission. I like the middle ground where I can be pretty sure the ship CAN do it with the fuel it has, but all kinds of things along the way can cause all sorts of mayhem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with that I\u0027ll bow out, as this thread from the get-go has been off topic as Xavven mentioned a few pages back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xavven\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xavven\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo what you \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E meant to do by posting this thread was to counter those folks discouraging people from learning how to calculate dV by hand.

For those of you were were wondering how those mods like KER and MechJeb calculate delta-v, it\u0027s actually a pretty easy equation. If you want to do it by hand, by calculator, or by spreadsheet, and learn how this simple but powerful equation works, I encourage you to read my/this-other-guy\u0027s tutorial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-10T23:06:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2014 11:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
