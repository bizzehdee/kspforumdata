I\u0027m really not too bothered about most mods, but tbh I think mechjeb/kerbal engineer ( the one with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E readouts\u00A0etc)should really be a core part of the stock game by this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther than that then I can understand why other mods \u00A0wont be added to console version. And would personally prefer to see more funding/development going toward a KSP 2. Also\u00A0before anyone else tries to say there would be no market for a KSP 2. I believe there is a massive amount of people who would pay for a new game with better atmospheric visuals, base modules, kerbal attachments, more difficulty options like kerbal food and water requirements. Etc I could go on all day so I\u0027m sure the devs would come up with plenty more things that could be improved/ added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway that got off topic a bit\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yeah come on scorpio \u002Bpspro support please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll concede that ksp2 might be a pipe dream , but that won\u0027t stop me dreaming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-22T15:25:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2018 03:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by mikey117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mako","CreatedById":69375,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-22T16:43:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I had to guess which one is most likely to happen between One X/PS4 Pro version, mods on consoles, and KSP 2, I would guess KSP 2.
