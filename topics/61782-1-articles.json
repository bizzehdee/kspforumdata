I am looking for some ideas on what to do now. I play with some mods, KW, Interstellar, KAS and kethane. Today was my first day back and I am really liking the new additions to the interstellar mod but now i need some ways to utilize it in a useful way. I have been thinking of building an Alcubierre Tug to run some kethane to and from the jool system but that seems a little bland to me today. So KSP tell me what to do and I will either try to vid cap it if my comp will allow, or do some imgur albums of my adventures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObligatory pretty pic.
