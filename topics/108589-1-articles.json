I thought it was a bug ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif) because I thought it was in Celsius, but then I noticed in the information for Kerbin\u0027s climat on *The Map* that it\u0027s actually in Kelvin ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) So I started to think how to change it back (in earlier versions the display was in Celsius) and since it is much more easier to check the actual temperature rather than subtracting it by 273.0 degree each time, I wanted to ask you guys: ***Is it even possible?*** **And if it is,** ***th******e*** ***n***  ***how?***\n\n**Give me please some advice** \n![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n***MondayZi***"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:40:58Z","Content":"I find Kelvin more useful than Celsius because it\u0027s easier to estimate the radiative flux that way."},{"CreatedByName":"Cardano","CreatedById":143056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T04:35:30Z","Content":"Also not answering your question - but Kelvin are not \u0027degrees\u0027 like Fahrenheit and Celsius are. they are just Kelvin, the way Pounds are just Pounds.

I unfortunately do not know how to accomplish such a task, as I am no modder. Perhaps you could ask someone in the modding subforum?"}]}
