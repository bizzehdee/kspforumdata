Note that this happens during Chapter Two while Jedwig is en-route to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELiftoff\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022... and... what if the door jams? What... uh... if you can\u0027t get to the controls?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill sighed and put an arm awkwardly around Seanbur\u0027s shoulder as they walked. The guy was just a total bag of nerves right now. OK, his first launch. Still...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Look, Seanbur. Nothing is going to go wrong. You\u0027ll do your geology and I\u0027ll fly the capsule. We\u0027ll be fine. Come on, you know your job and I know mine. No trouble, right? Right?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally Seanbur gave a nervous nod as they neared the end of the accessway and the capsules open doors called to them. With a gulp Seanbur climbed the ladder on the side (not yet rated for space) that led up to the upper capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new vessel, a duplicate of Munar Two that Jeb and Bob recently took to the Mun, used the newer, more streamlined capsules, stacked one atop the other. It was said it reduced drag to enable both to fit on a vessel that was almost identical to Munar One with it\u0027s single capsule. As long it launched safely, and Seanbur worried about that too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESliding into the seat he heard Bill get in behind him, both of them assisted by flight technicians in white coats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You OK up there Seanbur?\u0022 Bill called on the suit mic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Er, yes. I\u0027ll be fine.\u0022 \u0027I hope\u0027 he added silently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Flight to Minmus One,\u0022 Gene\u0027s familiar voice filtered in through Seanbur\u0027s suit, \u0022We check good on our end, you\u0027re go for preflight.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next few minutes were tense as Bill went through his checks and Seanbur through the few he had on the scientific instruments. He\u0027d hoped to have a seizmic instrument to add to the equipment but the techies were having difficulty getting one to work in vacuum without exploding. Rather embarrassing actually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a whir and a click he saw the umbilicles retract and the walkway pull away, the last tech waving happily from the open end. If that guy was so overjoyed about all this why couldn\u0027t HE be sitting in here instead of Seanbur?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Come on, get a grip.\u0022 he muttered to himself and settled in to wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn\u0027t a very long wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Flight, we\u0027re good to go here.\u0022 Bill said after preflights were finished. \u0022I read a good plot on initial burn to orbit. Thanks for the plot Caldin.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re welcome Bill.\u0022 Caldin\u0027s voice came through, rare on a flight, though Bill and Caldin were pretty good friends. That always helped someone to open up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022B... Bill? I\u0027m reading some oddities in the fifth stage fuel lines. Sh... should we abort?\u0022 Seanbur said hopefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, don\u0027t worry pal. We\u0027re well within specs.\u0022 Bill replied chearfully. \u0022Hey Gene, what do you read on Fifth stage tanks?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a slight pause while Mission Control checked the figures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Reads pressure variance from the launch clamp feeds. Well within tolerance. Should stabalize after launch.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeanbur sighed, his hope for a reprieve gone. Why had he let Bill talk him into this? He had been quite happy analysing science station readings OTHER PEOPLE had brought home from space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027re at T minus two minues Minmus One. Standby.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, Gene had confirmed it. He wasn\u0027t getting out of this. Straightening the uncomfortable space suit helmet Seanbur re-checked his restrain straps again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlancing up he watched nervously as the countdown clock proceeded. Soon down to thirty seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We read elevated heart rate and blood pressure on your suit teltales Minmus Science. Are you OK?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took a moment to register Gene\u0027s comment. He wasn\u0027t used to being called \u0027Minmus Science\u0027. Guess he\u0027d have to get used to it on this flight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m good.\u0022 He didn\u0027t want to be the reason the flight was cancelled, not matter what he felt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022T minus five... four... three... two... ignition!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Tylen%20Sea/01-Night%20Launch.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002201-Night Launch.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a roar Seanbur felt his seat slam into his back and his eyes opened in panic. Gritting his teeth as the g-forces built rapidly he struggled to remain calm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027ve cleared the launch clamps Minmus One. You\u0027ve got a good burn, and good flight.\u0022 Caldin said, adding that last for luck Seanbur guessed, or for Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill barely acknowledged Telemetry. He was rather busy flying the ship. This was only his third orbital flight after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGouts of flame lashed down from the solid boosters as Minmus One clawed at the sky. It was a huge stack of the larger SRBs KSC had at their disposal, often used for initial stages due to their low cost and high thrust, despite low ISP. However there was talk about changing the launch configurations. After Jedwig\u0027s near miss with one of his own stages and after Deep Scan Nine had mapped the large numbers of debris from past launches in LKO, the Program was considering attempting more re-usable vessels, despite the initial csots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Booster separation.\u0022 Bill muttered as he focused on flying \u0022LV T30s burning good. See, told you the fifth stage would be good Seanbur.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Tylen%20Sea/02-Booster%20Separation.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002202-Booster Separation.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeanbur didn\u0027t answer but just watched the altimeter climb to over six kilometers. This was higher than he\u0027d ever flown before, and never straight upwards! The g\u0027s were building to the point where he felt like there was most of another Kerbal laying on top of him... That did remind of that time a while ago when...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Starting gravity turn.\u0022 Bill said, interrupting Seanbur\u0027s train of thought. \u0022How are you doing up there Seanbur?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I, er... I\u0027m OK.\u0022 He managed, automatically checking his suit again, as much as he could strapped in like this. \u0022How much longer?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A little while yet Seanbur. OK, fifth stage is...

After a little wobble though things stabilized. Seanbur was terrified, too terrified to even ask what had happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Minmus One, what\u0027s your situation?\u0022 Gene came in, calm as ever, but sounding insistent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Checking Flight. I read no problems here. I think the fifth stage burned unevenly. Maybe some fuel left in when it was jettisoned and it exploded behind us.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I TOLD YOU!\u0022 Seanbur shouted... then blushed in his suit. He hadn\u0027t meant to say that as loud as that. \u0022I mean, I knew those readings on the tanks were a real problem.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well,\u0022 Gene said, before Bill could respond, \u0022all reads good here too.

He still had half an eye watching Seanbur\u0027s vitals. The guy worried him, though he tried not to let it show. When Bill pushed Seanbur into applying for the mission specialist position for this trip he\u0027d thought it would finally push him through his nervousness. Get him more confident... especially as this was his field after all. Exogeology, or Extrakerbestrial Geology as Seanbur prefered to call it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger Flight, looks a little long on the orbit. Trying to save time on intercept Caldin?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022He, hey I know how you loath, long boring flights Bill.\u0022 Came Telemetry\u0027s response. \u0022Plus you have the delta V to spare on this one. Plenty of reserve.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Huh, kind of ingrained now though, to get the maximal return for it, minimum orbit to get close. Still, you\u0027re right, this does it quicker, and it\u0027s a long way to Minmus. Heck, Jedwig\u0027s course was slightly non-hohmann, not hugely inefficient, but still wasting fuel. If they can do that on an interplanetary ship who am I to stop KSC from doing it with a ship to one of Kerbal\u0027s moons?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How much of our reserve?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill looked up automatically, even though there was a bulkhead between him and Seanbur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Seanbur, don\u0027t worry, we\u0027ve still got tons of fuel left. It\u0027s not a problem on this trip. This ship was designed to land on the Mun, with Minmus\u0027 much lighter gravity we have plenty of dV to spare.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe could still hear Seanbur grumbling up ahead, but he didn\u0027t respond otherwise. Hmm. There had to be something he could do to get the guy more with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Seanbur, we do need some checks on the science gear in flight. Could you get things set up? I know, we\u0027ll do the actual tests after the burn, but just get things ready, OK?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh, sure Bill. I... I mean Minmus One.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a chuckle Bill got back onto the transfer plot and started to get the ship ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ready Seanbur?\u0022 Bill said\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um... no, but lets go. I just want it to be over.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill stopped what he was doing and sighed. This was getting silly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Seanbur, this isn\u0027t going to be like launch. It\u0027s just a transfer burn, and a low acceleration one at that. We can\u0027t crash, the engine is incredibly reliable, and you won\u0027t feel much in the way of g-forces. What\u0027s to worry about?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Micrometeorites?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill just closed his eyes and got ready for the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Minmus One, you\u0027re lined up and set. We read good on primary systems. Slight vibration reading in the hatch on your capsule.

Even if it swung open in flight as long as we\u0027re strapped in we\u0027ll be fine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But if the ship\u0027s pressurised, even low pressure, it\u0027ll act like a rocket!

This was not the way to handle this. \u0022Look, it\u0027s OK. If you\u0027re worried about the burn we can depressurise for that, then I\u0027ll check it out after. Check your suit and let me know when you\u0027re done so I can get started. We\u0027ve three minutes to the burn.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um... OK Bill.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe really had to find a way to get Seanbur to calm down!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, capsules are depressurized Flight.\u0022 Bill said a little later. \u0022We\u0027re lined up on the mark and ready for burn.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger Minmus One. Minmus Science, are you good for the burn?\u0022 Gene said softly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I... I\u0027m good. Er, Minmus Science reports ready for acceleration.\u0022 he managed, holding the terror back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a slight cough from behind him. Was Bill laughing at him? No, he wouldn\u0027t! Seanbur re-checked his straps as Minmus One went over the final checks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027re hot to trot Flight.\u0022 Bill said with a real chuckle this time. \u0022Give me a countdown. You know how I love countdowns!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, totally enthused.\u0022 Gene said blandly \u0022OK Minmus One, just for you... Twelve... Ten... Nine...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t let us explode. Don\u0027t let us Explode.\u0022 Seanbur repeated to himself quietly while the countdown carried on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Two... One... Ignition.\u0022 and Seanbur braced, but as Bill had said it was very minor push into his seat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowly Seanbur started to relax a little. Perhaps, just perhaps, he could get to like space travel... just he doubted it would be on this flight.

Trust me, there is no coronal mass ejection event at present. We have the telescopes at Hoober Island focusing on the sun right now. No coronal ejecta. No flares. No increase in Kerbolar wind. You are fine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill carefully stayed out of it as Flight and Minmus Science argued. Seanbur had heard some odd static an hour ago, just after mid course correction, and then he\u0027d insisted his instruments were picking up some faint readings indicative of a Kerbolar flare soon. KSC disagreed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Look, Flight, please check the Argo-five readouts again. If it\u0027s a cyclic pulse we could be building to a major event. Can you get any readout on the Karrington index on the sunspot layer?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECuriously it seemed like Seanbur was actually less nervous than usual. He was obviously scared, but Bill guessed it was different when it was something he knew about. True, his main degree was in geology... but it seems he had other interests. Unfortunately Bill realized he would have to interrupt this after all. He hated butting into these kind of things, but this time it was important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sorry guys, but we\u0027re nearing Minmus.\u0022 Bill said carefully. \u0022I need to get a corroboration on orbital data to plot the entry burn and you need to start getting the orbital science going Seanbur. Part of the reason we\u0027re here after all.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a sigh Seanbur relucantly agreed and the Kerbolar radiation subject was dropped, but Bill could see Seanbur\u0027s elevated vitals. The guy was still worried. You don\u0027t suppose he could be right and the whole of KSC could be wrong could you? Nawww.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile Seanbur started studying the local medium and occasionally commented on the reaction to certain high energy particles, Bill got his course ironed out and watched Minmus grow on the forward monitors, then through the window. It was pretty, whatever it was made of, and soon they\u0027d be landing on it. But first to get a stable orbit so they could could confirm a good landing spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Tylen%20Sea/07-Circularize%20at%20Minmus.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002207-Circularize at Minmus.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill remembered the various satellites that had been sent around the far side of the Mun to map Farside Crater for Jeb\u0027s first mission there. This time they were going on blurring photos from Kerbin. He really needed better data!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowly they slid closer, pulling in to roughly thirty kilometers above the rocky surface. The green color was rather restfull on the eyes at least. Bill far preferred this to The Mun, whatever Jeb said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout ten minutes later he was setting up for his burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Seanbur. You about done up there?\u0022 He said when he was ready. \u0022We\u0027re going to be under acceleration again soon and I want you ready.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How long till the burn?\u0022 He said, almost absentmindedly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill grinned. Yesterday he\u0027d been terrified of a burn just like this, and now he seemed more annoyed at being interrupted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022About twenty minutes. Anything you need stowed?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a slight pause before he answered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Actually, I did want to check out the readings on my hand held equipment... and I haven\u0027t actually done a spacewalk.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill almost choked. This was the guy who was panicing over the launch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um, well sure. We\u0027re depressurized already so feel free to step outside. But I need you back inside in ten minutes maximum.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure. *sigh* Wish we had the EVA packs already.\u0022 Seanbur said wistfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill shook his head. The guy still surprised him!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeanbur gazed in wonder at finally seeing the stars with nothing inbetween them except one thin sheet of glass... OK, best not think on that! Gulping he tried to refocus on the grandeur instead. It wasn\u0027t hard to do!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin was a tiny white green and blue ball behind them, with the even smaller dot of the Mun off to the right... if \u0027right\u0027 meant anything out here. In the other direction the face of Minmus loomed greenly before them, swollen already to fifty times the size of The Mun seen from Kerbin, and getting larger. He read off the magnetic readings and started to worry. That reading he\u0027d been sure was indicative of a Kerbolar event was still there. It looked remarkably similar to the predictions of Esinger Kerman, in his book \u0027Seeking the Unpredictable\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, no-one believed Esinger either. No-one could predict a flare event. So the common theory went anyway. That was why he hadn\u0027t mentioned Esinger\u0027s name during the \u0027debate\u0027 with KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it was Kerbolar magnetic fields somehow interacting with the local fields it showed that sunspot storms must focus magnetics enormously! To have any field strength at all for a near-field effect at this range? He could see why so many people didn\u0027t believe Esinger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking another reading of the incident Kerbolar wind Seanbur was beginning to have doubts himself. This looked amazingly like...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bill! I\u0027m coming back in, and we need to let Kerbin know. It isn\u0027t a Kerbolar event.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill\u0027s voice came over the line, confused, while Seanbur struggled into the cockpit and close the hatch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What? What d\u0027you mean Seanbur?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um, what\u0027s our current speed? Oh, scratch that. Can you transfer the orbital plot to my monitor up here? The more data the better.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout comment Bill complied and Seanbur dug into it. After several minutes he sighed in relief.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, good news. We\u0027re not going to die.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Say what?\u0022 Bill gasped. \u0022Seanbur... what\u0027s going on?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The readings I was getting, it was from a pinch field, like the Melvey fields around Kerbin. I think Minmus has a much stronger field than we realized, and it\u0027s interacting with Kerbin\u0027s, even at this range. We\u0027re getting irregular pinches in the magnetic field and it\u0027s syphoning the Kerbolar wind in in stages. That\u0027s why the readings I was getting were inconsistent.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe took a breath and closed his screen down after saving the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022As far as I can predict, there\u0027s a lobed field of trapped ions, and other faster particles in a ring, at roughly sixty five kilometers from Minmus. Best guess, it\u0027s not too healthy at that altitude. Luckily our entry vector is too fast. We won\u0027t be exposed long enough to hurt us, going in or out. Thank Kod!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well,\u0022 Gene said, surprising Seanbur. He\u0027d forgotten about Mission Control for a moment, \u0022I apologize for doubting you Minmus Science. But that does explain why our readings weren\u0027t picking up anything. From the ship\u0027s sensors we\u0027re reading the ion level as rising. Are you sure there is no danger from the radiation?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeanbur went over his data one last time and compared it to the quick simulation he\u0027d mocked up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027d give it over ninety percent chance my model matches what I\u0027m seeing here Flight, and that gives us no real danger with our given course.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, send your data and the theory and we\u0027ll check it out, but for now, I\u0027m glad you lucked out, and glad you figured it out. At least now we know not to stay in certain orbits there.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We need to check also if it\u0027s periodic. Right now it seems stable, but it could be a seasonal phenomena, or even a function of the phase angle of Minmus relative to Kerbol.

Yeah, almost as high as the launch burn, but it was smoother with the little 909s, even with six of them. This ship was designed and build before the recent research on Fuel Systems had alowed the fuel transfer pumps to automatically pump fuel around the ship. It was also before the new RCS system had been finished. As far as Bill knew that still hadn\u0027t been tested in the field, and he hadn\u0027t heard how the suit RCS packs were progressing.
