So over time you lose that \u0022wow\u0022 factor when doing things... I guess we all have that going on, yeah Duna\u0027s pretty, been there done that, got the screenshot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I haven\u0027t played KSP for several months and yesterday I decided to fire it up again and do a return mission from OPM\u0027s Tekto.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlan, build, take off, maneuvers, tweaks, checks the SCANSat map to find a place to touch down... Landed, excellent, take that!, EVA, hmm these ladders... I don\u0027t know... Don\u0027t you fall you green stand-up guy. Flag... Picture time for posterity and... it hit me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/PxPCJrD.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022PxPCJrD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere I was, alone, looking at that rocket with the sun blasting away some photons on the distance... Sarnus floating above the clouds witnessing it all, perhaps laughing at me, perhaps sad for me. I don\u0027t know. And the rocket. My ticket out of this moon\u00A0that\u0027s supposed to take me back to my ship. I shall rendezvous and head back. Wait for the a transfer opportunity and \u0022Hohmann it\u0022 to oblivion. No fuel to waste.\u00A0\u00A0Maybe I\u0027ll use the Mun to assist on braking, and perhaps those puny nukes as a sacrificial heat shield on Kerbin atmosphere too. Will I have enough thrust to slow down? I came here with 0.25 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E so... should be good on the way back too.\u00A0\u00A0Will\u00A0my parachutes be enough? I better aim for an ocean just in case. That if I have enough mono-propellant to actually rendezvous in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut all that is in the future, something that will happen later... Or will it? I don\u0027t know, my fate rests on that green tainted rocket. MechJeb said it was okay. I just hope it was right and the real Jeb can come home some day... But for now, just enjoy the view my little friend, might be the last time we see something at all. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-05T17:01:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving this very cool mission report to Mission Reports.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
