If 200 liter tank at 250 atm (50000 liters) weighs 71.45kg, then it seems like 1 liter of air weighs 1.429 grams. I read somewhere that a liter of air is closer to 1.286 grams. But the values you have all seem to be based on a weight of 1.524g/liter of air. My numbers below will be based on the higher 1.524g weight but if you\u0027re using something else, just let me know what.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering those numbers are for modules that just add O2, I don\u0027t see any problem with the values you are coming up with. For instance, a large stack tank is a pretty big item so the fact that it adds 2238.1 days worth of O2 for a single Kerbal is fine with me. I would ask, is that earth days or Kerbal days? If a human uses 0.8kg/24 hours, and a kerbal uses 80% of that, does that mean a kerbal only uses 0.16kb/kerbal day? Even if that\u0027s the case and the large stack tank adds 8953.5 kerbal days of air, I\u0027m still fine with the numbers. The four items you\u0027re exampling are just extra O2 tanks so I have no problems with them adding alot of air. And although you haven\u0027t exampled them, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll have any issues with the amount of O2 you have the two stack recyclers add since those modules would have some extra air tanks along with the recycling apparatus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy issue has always been with the amount of O2 that comes in the various command modules. By default, the MK1 command pod comes with something like 20 units of O2. At the default rate of 0.0000028935 units per second, that means the Mk1 command pod comes standard with just over 1920 hours worth of O2. That\u0027s 80 human days or 320 kerbal days all on it\u0027s own. With that default amount, you don\u0027t need to include the extra O2 modules unless you\u0027re going to be flying missions for extremely long missions. I have a mission to Duna setup that took only about 250 kerbal days round trip, so with the default numbers I don\u0027t need extra O2 because there is plenty in the default capsule. For that matter, I probably don\u0027t need to include any extra LSS modules unless I\u0027m planning a trip out to Dres or beyond. It seems ridiculous to me that a standard 1 kerbal command pod comes with just about as much O2 as the small radial tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew modules should (IMO) only contain enough air for a full crew compliment to last a short duration. Something along the following guidlines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The Hitchhiker module is intended as a crew living area so it makes sense to me that it would have a large life support capacity. I\u0027d say something along the lines of 60 days (human if your above examples are showing human days) worth of O2 for a 4 kerbal crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Command pods should have just basic life support so enough for a full crew compliment to last only a couple human days (about a kerbal week).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Mk1 and Mk2 Cockpit should have the same LSS capacity as a command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Mk3 Cockpit looks like it\u0027s supposed to represent the shuttle\u0027s crew area so I\u0027d give it a slightly larger LSS capacity then the other cockpits. Perhaps enough O2 to last three Kerbals for a Kerbal month (about a human week).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Lander cans and the Cupola aren\u0027t meant to be long term living areas so limit their LSS system to a bit less then a command pod (1 human day at most).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above criteria should work for mods that have their own crew modules. For instance, the MK3-9 Orbital Command Pod from Near Future Spacecraft would only have about a kerbal weeks worth of O2 for it\u0027s 2 kerbal crew. And the PPD-24 Itinerant Service Container (also from Near Future Spacecraft, I think) would be like the hitchhiker module with 60 human days worth of life support for it\u0027s 2 kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there are some exceptions that would likely have to be addressed case by case. For instance, the huge PPD-1 Heavy Command Module (again, from Near Future Spacecraft) should probably be treated like the Mk3 Cockpit and have around a kerbal month\u0027s worth of life support for each of it\u0027s 6 kerbal crew. But for the most part, I think it should be fairly easy to classify various crew modules into one of the above categories. Either way, though, most shouldn\u0027t have a huge LSS by default. Otherwise you defeat the purpose of the other Ioncross modules.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T19:57:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1liter of air != 1 liter of pure O2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etheres a lot of nitrogen which has a lower molecular weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery little nitrogen has to be brought along because it is all recycled except for a very small amount lost to EVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Assuming an airlock instead of just venting to space)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chrisl","CreatedById":114320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T22:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I know.
