I was trying to keep it simple, and I definitely borrowed some elements from work. I imagine when I am more practiced I will try to build a Hondajet in game sometime. However, here is my first flyable plane. it handles ok, but has some overmaneuverability. You also have to trim the nose up about 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\n\n[![Efj63nJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/Efj63nJ.png)](http://imgur.com/Efj63nJ)\n\nSo, this morning, my 10 year old daughter comes to me and asks if she can make a plane. I give her the basic rundown about CoL being just behind CoM, and show her how the hangar works. I reminded her when she thought she was done that she needs control surfaces to steer, suggested she add winglets to correct her yaw issue, and mounted her landing gear on the big radial decouple to give her tail enough height to not bang the ground on rotation. The rest was all her.\n\n[![EHTqx4x.png](http://i.imgur.com/EHTqx4x.png)](http://imgur.com/EHTqx4x)\n\nIt flies like a dream. You have to rotate slowly, or it tail-bumps, and you only need to trim the nose up a hair. You need to fly it with caps-lock, but it\u0027s much smoother than my attempt.\n\nTry it out, if you want.\n\n[http://www./download/a22t2v4049vin4c/lenderman%27s\u002Btest\u002Bflight.craft](http://www./download/a22t2v4049vin4c/lenderman%27s\u002Btest\u002Bflight.craft)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Dwarf","CreatedById":67709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T05:23:00Z","Content":"Look at you go, raising up the next generation of nerds.
