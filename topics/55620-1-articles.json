With a different font, or a slight increase in horizontal size, it would be possible to read two digits as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe any advanced joystick would benefit of the above requested changes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, my joystick is a Saitek X-52 Pro. KSP is the only program to have issues with it: it is able to bind axes fine, but not the main hat (POV0) and not any button with a ID number beyond 19 (X-52 has the ability to use up to 40 buttons, as each of its 8-way hat switches can also be reprogrammed as 4 single buttons). X-52 ships with a programming software that allows to assign buttons to keys, and with many other programs I just need to create a proper profile to match keys (as defined in the program settings) and buttons. However, KSP shows the very peculiar capability, when running, to intercept those buttons: no other program can get any input from the stick, including the joystick programming software itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even tried to directly write in the settings.cfg file an assignment for a button beyond #19, but KSP does not like that and resets most joystick bindings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T09:22:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enot against better input code at all. but these problems usually can be solved just by mapping buttons directly to keystrokes rather than binding the buttons in game. this should be possible in the x-52 software (at least it was before i started using ch joysticks and threw away that piece of junk x52).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T09:59:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...these problems usually can be solved just by mapping buttons directly to keystrokes rather than binding the buttons in game. this should be possible in the x-52 software...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about reading the post you\u0027re commenting about? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022diomedea\u0022 data-cite=\u0022diomedea\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...KSP shows the very peculiar capability, when running, to intercept those buttons: no other program can get any input from the stick, including the joystick programming software itself.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheBard","CreatedById":89636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T13:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUp for this, I was just going to create a thread for it but I found this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile buttons are also a concern, I would add to this that it would be nice to be able to bind more axis than those now available and, while I won\u0027t ask that those can be used to control different sets of engine, but I\u0027d like at least that mods can bind/use them, so mods like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38069-0-22-Davon-TC-systems-mod\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDavon TC Systems\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-21-0-22-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Parts-Infernal-Robotics-0-9-(11-21-2013)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInfernal Robotics\u003C/a\u003E could take advantage of those for a better control.
