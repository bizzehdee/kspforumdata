He was determined to be the first Kerbal to set foot on another planet. Naturally he chose the closet one, Duna. Mostly because it was the easiest to get to, but also because it had an atmosphere for aero-braking. This meant he could save some delta-V on slowing down once he got to the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMilzon, however, didn\u0027t like travelling alone, so he conscripted the entire rest of the Kerbonauts to come with him. There would be seven of them, and all of them had experience with space flight. Milzon got togeather with the design team to design a rocket for just such a task, one that could support an interplanetary trip. It took nearly two weeks to build, but once it was ready it was placed onto the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3hMuIIm.png\u0022 alt=\u00223hMuIIm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMilzon was the first across the gangway, trying desperately to hold in his excitement.
