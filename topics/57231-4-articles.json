It becomes very complex to try and design a system that has this level of fine control within the constraints and mechanics of the game, for the moment all I can recommend is that you enable fine control (caps-lock) and make sure you set the telescope to \u0022Control from Here\u0022 (the picture on the original post was reasonably stable and was taken using this technique). For more help you can try Mech-Jeb, and using Smart-ASS which will control your ship and look at the planet automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally the sky texture \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E If the sky texture doesn\u0027t scale with zooming, or scales differently things look very weird, and it just looks wrong. That said I\u0027m looking into creating a procedural star field, so that even at high zoom you will have distant stars , rather than smeared blobs. It would also bring the possibility of new science, as distant constellations and galaxies could be added to the list of things to see.
