I dont want it to have over 10k parts (i.already made the drones for it but by my calculations it will have over 3500 parts just in the 80 drones, and\u00A0i dont have a NASA supercomputer in my basement to run a craft like that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could change the tweakscale modifier to include 5000% scale but i still want to publish the craft on KerbalX for all of you to enjoy it still and play with it. So im placing a request here for any moder to make stock-alike wing parts just in 2000% or 5000% scale. I will make sure to add the moder in the credits of the huge craft on KerbalX.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would do it myself if i knew how, but sadly i have 0 knowledge in modding.
