In many such cases, certain human actions are determined to have had a detrimental effect.

Can we not discuss evolution?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of the above are examples of \u0022settled\u0022 science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecently, another thread was closed where the scientific question was still open, but the political implications are huge. Where should the line be drawn when discussing science with political implications? Should we refer to the scale of the implications? who is implicated? or should the discussion be limited based on whether the science is settled or not, since unsettled science could result in \u0022blame\u0022 that ultimately is not borne out by conclusive evidence?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should not be hard to guess which topic I am referring to, but I would like to limit the discussion on this thread to the subject of how to navigate the fine line between politics and science if possible, and how to determine when it is not possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-07T09:25:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is not possible adequately answer this question without going neck-deep into politics of science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, the science is \u0022settled\u0022 insofar as there is more or less a broad consensus. However, a common refrain is that global warming is a \u0022politically charged\u0022 topic where dissent is stigmatized. A cynical analysis of the science as an institution would show that what achieves the status of settled science isn\u0027t necessarily what is true, but what is popular (peer review, as shown by several studies) and what promises desirable outcomes (chiefly grant allocation); the hypothesis that comes out on top isn\u0027t necessarily true (nor necessarily false), but one that fits in with current views,and guarantees more funding, preferably through becoming embedded with regulatory or political agencies - that\u0027s precisely why paradigm shifts are so painful... and that\u0027s before we get to the media and clickbait.

In other terms, \u003Cstrong\u003Epower\u003C/strong\u003E.

There is a lot of power to be had in fields like human biology, anthropology, sociology, psychology and economics, compounded by limited room for verification and testing; note how in many of these fields paradigm shifts have been substituted for with balkanization into countless rival schools. These disciplines are almost explicitly intended to be prescriptive, to exercise power over human society, and when power is the object, it\u0027s not the best ideas that prevail, it\u0027s the ideas that accrue the most power that are selected for. Sometimes they reflect reality, and sometimes they\u0027re Lysenkoism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe moral of the rant: science readily devolves into a political excrementsshow of dubious scientific quality \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhenever\u003C/strong\u003E you try to apply it to the real world. The way to observe the forum\u0027s rules for me, in spite of my strong and often radical opinions, has been a method of dispassionate, often bitter and acerbic observation as a more or less neutral third party.

bother even publishing any formal written rules at all?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe answer is that it\u0027s primarily for the benefit of the users.\u00A0 The \u0022prime directive,\u0022 above, basically boils down to \u0022don\u0027t be a jerk.\u0022\u00A0 That\u0027s an awfully vague statement, though-- especially since different people have very different concepts of acceptable topics of conversation, where personal boundaries are, etc.\u00A0 One person\u0027s \u0022admirable frankness\u0022 is another\u0027s \u0022being a total jerk\u0022.\u00A0 And if there weren\u0027t some written rules, then it would be uncomfortable to users, knowing that there are these \u0022moderator\u0022 people who wield forum authority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you know you can get smitten with thunderbolts if you step over the line, then there\u0027s a natural and wholly reasonable desire to have some idea of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhere the line is\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (as judged by the Powers That Be).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, as a result, we\u0027ve tried to codify \u0022don\u0027t be a jerk\u0022 into a set of forum rules that are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereasonably\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E explicit and detailed, about the do\u0027s and don\u0027ts.\u00A0 This accomplishes several things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIt gives users a reasonable idea of what types of behavior to steer clear of.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt helps the moderators be more consistent in our actions, and avoid \u0022mission creep\u0022 over time-- we can refer back to the rules in each case, as a helpful framework.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt helps the community have more confidence in the moderators as being reasonable arbiters of reasonable rules, rather than just a bunch of totally arbitrary martinets.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe important thing to understand, though, is that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethis is not \u003Cstrong\u003Elegislation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 The forum guidelines are not intended to be a rigid, completely unambiguous, fully detailed specification of exactly what is or isn\u0027t allowed in every case.\u00A0 Because to do that, they\u0027d have to be about a hundred pages long, and they\u0027d be written in such dense legalese that not even the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emoderators\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E could keep up with them-- and they\u0027d be totally impenetrable and useless to the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eusers\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Which would be silly, since it\u0027s primarily for the users\u0027 benefit that the written forum guidelines exist in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, okay, if they\u0027re not intended to be as detailed and specific as a legal framework would be... what

judgment\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 They help users understand the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eapproximate\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E shape of our judgment space, and they help the moderators keep our judgments \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereasonably\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E consistent and understandable.\u00A0 Like any human creation, they\u0027re imperfect.\u00A0 They are our attempt to strike a balance between \u0022detailed enough to be useful to people\u0022 without being \u0022too detailed so that they\u0027re hard to understand and toxically rigid to to

again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs much as possible, we\u0027d prefer not to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehave\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E rules.\u00A0 After all, if our goal is for the forum to be a pleasant place where people are happy to spend their time... then people tend to be happiest when they\u0027re \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efree\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Nobody likes being told what not to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, we have a strong \u0022bias for inaction\u0022-- less moderation is better moderation, and fewer rules are better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... basically the only reason for a rule to exist is \u003Cstrong\u003Eif it is deemed necessary to protect that \u0022prime directive\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 There are certain types of user behavior that have significant negative consequences for \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eother\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E users.\u00A0 So for such cases, we have a rule.\u00A0 These are the cases where we judge that the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epositive\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E effects of the rule (protecting the community from problematic behavior) outweighs the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enegative\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E effects of the rule (constraining people\u0027s freedom).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, okay then, how do you judge that balance?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, anything that involves human decisions is not going to be an exact science.\u00A0 However, in the case of the forum rules, we do have one thing going for us:\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003ELots and lots of data points\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 The forums have been around for a decade now.\u00A0 There have been nearly 200 thousand topics and nearly 4 million posts made.\u00A0 Collectively, the moderator team has \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etons\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of experience of dealing with user behavior, and other users\u0027 reaction to it.\u00A0 This is a very rich set of experimental evidence that we can leverage to drive the rules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, basically, it boils down to:\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003EEach rule is there because bitter experience has demonstrated--
