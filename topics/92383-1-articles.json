My game playing is cyclical, I\u0027ll play exclusively for a few weeks, than go onto the next game which I play for a few weeks...until I work my way back around to the beginning. So...with the new ability to kerplode the Space Center, I was wondering what would happen if a stray asteroid managed to impact dead center?
