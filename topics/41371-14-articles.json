When \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E think tech tree, I think Victoria II. (Hearts of Iron 3\u0027s tech tree being so absurdly in-depth it\u0027s not worth even making a pass at implementing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w7tXx6j.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w7tXx6j.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A quick overview, you\u0027ve got tech families. Military, Industrial, Cultural, all that fun stuff. You can choose the focus of your administration: this gives bonuses to some tech family research speeds (or point cost, if we go that route) and nerfs others. For example in this image, Bavaria has a Corporatist-Industrialist complex that gives very significant boosts to commerce and industry research while hampering your military and naval research. Each level of technology you research in a tree in a family gives you a specific bonus. Here I have Clean Coal selected as an example. Clean coal is a massive boon to coal and iron production, but also comes with two \u003Cem\u003Einventions\u003C/em\u003E. Inventions are a percentage chance over time of triggering. I\u0027ve highlighted the invention of Proto-Existentialism to bring up that UI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow how does this translate to KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could have five families: crew modules, probe parts, engines, science and utility. Obviously there would be fewer inventions and trees than Vicky at first (Victoria II espousing a whopping 150 techs and over 500 inventions) but the idea would be the same. In Crew Modules, you could have the trees of Aircraft, Life Support, 1-Man, 3-Man, Lander. Etc etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hamilton T Ksos","CreatedById":78425,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T17:37:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of experiments to get data, and deliver the data to Kerbin to get science done. Then there is the type of science and how it applies. I am also all for being limited to sub-orbital until a few experiments are done on the upper atmosphere, the you can progress to orbit, them the mun, Duna, etc... I just don\u0027t want to have to go to the Mun before I can build an orbital platform. or the other way around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI await the actual science equipment and experiments that go with it. Harv described the experiments as one-shot deals where data is collected than delivered back. I hope that the experiments are not only time based, i.e. deploy experiment, wait a day, collect results, but also include actions. such as collect data while driving a rover through the mountains successfully to make better materials. or have a \u0022black box\u0022 part to get data from failed missions to improve computing. I am also assuming the Kerbals\u0027 Stupidity levels will factor in to the experiments as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the tree, I hope it is more free-form than the rigid examples from strategy games. I want to pick my own successful or unsuccessful path. I want to invent the aerosol spray can before the wheel! Nevermind lighter materials, get a better ISP and thrust! Never invent the RTG and rely completely on kolar power, triple-K batteries, and an Exercycle connected to a generator. (hamster powered probe anyone?) KSP has a silly and ridiculous side to it. please keep it. The only pre-requisite to an achievement should be the ability to construct the equipment to achieve it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"triffid_hunter","CreatedById":61814,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T03:03:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hamilton T Ksos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hamilton T Ksos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI want to invent the aerosol spray can before the wheel!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 for Douglas Adams reference \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the rest of your idea too, ie a highly expanded tech tree with some random variations thrown in, like a 1 in 1e7 chance of discovering quantum physics shortly after the telescope, balanced to roughly follow our historical pace of development\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alacrity","CreatedById":70443,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T03:24:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am a huge fan of eve online.

Some of the tech upgrades would require sending satellites and telescopes into orbit to detect radio waves, gamma waves and K-rays (heh.. X-rays) etc., kinda like spectroscopy irl.

Instead of a click and spending some money and gaining some new part, it would be nice to have a more elaborate system with multiple ways of improving parts and inventing new parts (slight difference to \u0027unlocking\u0027 parts). HarvesteR mentioned in the last progress update that there will be benefits to flying rockets successfully in the way of research, but I\u0027m wondering what else he has planned. The ability to fly dangerous prototypes as well for the same kind of result, just more rewarding? There are many ways to go about making the \u0027tech tree\u0027 something more seamless. I\u0027d rather not even have the tech tree displayed anywhere, but whatever method of research the player chooses, a different invisible (to the player) branch they go down, resulting in a more fun and personalized experience. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoach agreed, and I think HarvesteR also replied, I\u0027d like to see what becomes of this old discussion we had. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazro","CreatedById":55825,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T03:52:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like to think of science points as \u0022public interest points.\u0022 Satellite in space?
