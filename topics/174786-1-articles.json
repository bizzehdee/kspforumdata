Every game in existence has trained us that shift and control are modifier keys that we can use to modify what we\u0027re doing. So it\u0027s instinct to try doing things like \u0027shift right-click\u0027 to open up the window for a second/third/etc part. What happens when you do so? You suddenly find yourself accelerating towards god knows what and wasting precious Delta-V. You can fix this by rebinding those keys... but KSP\u0027s keybindings are already a bit tight. A part of this problem is caused because KSP\u0027s default keybinding choice is IMHO poor and made worse by the fact that you can\u0027t use key modifiers in your keybindings. Ideally, I\u0027d like to see Shift-Z and Shift-X used to set your throttle to max/zero and z/x to increase/decrease it and then reserve the shift/ctrl to be used properly as modifier keys. At that point, KSP\u0027s keybindings are pretty wide open to be properly setup however an individual wants them. Even just getting the keybinding interface setup to atleast give you the option of assign ctrl/shift \u002B another key as your binding would go a huge distance towards fixing keybinding issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
