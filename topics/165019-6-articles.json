He\u0027s now touting claims that me and others were pointing at 10 to 15 years ago and saying hey, guys why are you ignoring these. There is nothing in these links that I disagree with, it is unfortunate that the conclusions are so late in coming. These view I have held for more than a decade. If these teeth were found 500 miles to the SW, it would hardly raise an eyebrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point is that apomorphies can move into adjacent populations. And also I feel very uncomfortable about calling something a human apomorphy in the sense that we assume that the gene flow was from human and dates in the 170ky range, simply because it could be a trait that flowed from the N.African population into SSA population and not vice versa. But when we talk about homo sapiens in the North African context we are talking about Archaics, that means they have a spectrum of plesiomorphic and apomorphic traits. As such we can talk about apomorphies in SW Eurasia, at times as being trans Saharan gene flow, not necessarily human or Netherlander in their origin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is something else that needs to be stated, since I studied 6p21.3 (about 3 mnts) that along with scant evidence for admixture in the gene population, when the human population is polled for extreme examples of evolution (the most variant or deepest branches) the pocketed variation (see manifold definition) did not appear in Eurasia, but was pocketed in W/Central Africa . . . .very close to the deepest branch of the Y chromosome and proximal to one of the latest appearance of multiple plesiomorphic traits in Africa. Taken together it does hold for some sort of complex model of Hss evolution. The idea of AMH (anatomically modern human) is a simply a purest idea its a fantasy to believe that all humans became AMH at once. In if thats true, then its more true for adjacent populations.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut also, based on genetics, neither is it evident that these Archaics evolved into to something else, in fact the genetic evidence shows the opposite, that if they contributed they would have needed in totality to have moved south admixed into SSA and then reexpanded as something else. I find this highly unlikely. In my mind the original suggestion that these were African Neandertals is partially true and that they were also homo sapiens is also true, both are true, but the problem is we don\u0027t know how stable the population was AND that any stability it might have had might be attributed to evolving Hss and Hn. Likewise as humans expanded (L1 tangenika, L2 central and west Africa) really 100 to 140 kya time range, that the stability of this \u0027trans\u0027species might have been in jeopardy. Once Humans appear in Europe then its stability is in great jeopardy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223278349\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165019\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516988737\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Green Baron\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Green Baron said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthey are only one tiny too\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen genetic approaches are properly applied, when they are fully statistically condition it is one of the most most powerful tools that paleoanthropology has, when it is misapplied, when it represents a huge selection bias, or when statistics are not used to condition the arguments, then like any other technique it can be bunk.

I used to follow MREH, but then I looked at the genetic studies and i realized that Paleontology was very good at dressing up lies, packaging them into expensive books and selling them. As a scientist nothing ever taught me to be so much of skeptic as the historical study of paleoanthropology. And more importantly to basically defend MREH one has to take the devil\u0027s advocacy. . . . prove what you are saying true. And eventually it was proven, but not by the physical paleoanthropologist, almost all (not stringer he has 97% correct) of their conclusions were wrong, it was the molecular evolution that eventually (after much beating and critique) proved the point , 10 fold less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I see something like humans were in Israel 170kya and knowing about all the consistencies in the molecular genetics and the plotting of human fossils and MDTs around the Earth, it raises the eyebrow very high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I pointed out that inside of a bubble 235 to 170 kya (which can really be extended as a slowly opening funnel to about 120 kya) you have a container, and then outside the container things are going on. The container does not contain all human apomorphies it only excludes certain molecular traits (that is to say plesiomorphies of certain types were excluded, observed with X-chromosome, mtDNA and Y chromosome). Nor does it restrict the engagement of external apomorphies with the human population, it simply argues that if those traits enter the Hss population they should be highly selective to fix in humans by the time that they expand. There is nothing that limits admixture of traits before the expansion other than violations of the 2N rule. That is to say that if a male contributes an apomorphy, and his offspring or offsprings offspring are all female, we can not trace Y flow with the apomorphy even if the apomorphy is selective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat it means is that novel claims create uncertainties in several directions and we should not be fast to throw these under the rug simply because a popular author offers a conclusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-26T19:45:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223278388\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165019\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516992924\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n53 minutes ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0If these teeth were found 500 miles to the SW, it would hardly raise an eyebrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that is point !

S. and E. Africa was the core, on the peripheral of the core other interesting things were going on. Some of these things were captured by the human population, some of them were not. The things that were not captured we have no further evidence of or where they roamed. The genetic anomalies in the West/Central African population we spotted 20 years ago, and supported by physical anthropology 7 years ago. Likewise the genetics spotted admixture, probably between Homo neandertalensis narmada/desinova that occurred in Indonesia with no, I repeat, no evidence of Neanderthals being in Indonesia. If you can\u0027t see what I am getting at you are not thinking abstractly enough. The physical typology of paleoanthropology is pretty much a fail without the genetics (aDNA and molecular evolution), even with genetics its pretty incomplete.\u00A0 The plums in the pudding (like florensiensis) were more frequent than anyone can imagine, and tracking the plums over time is not a trivial issue. There is one other abstract issue, we can detect admixture if an only if we have a sensor, otherwise its just evolution. Yes, there have been studies in humans to detect ancient outgroups without aDNA, but the result is more like classical physics trying to replicate QM on the small scale. What you need are sensors . . . .but I have to say there are elements in the human population that neither fit Hss or Neandertal and they are spatially localized which means there are phantom plums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of archaeology I can point you to the fact that one site (unknowingly mesolithic) was characterized as having Neandertal stone tools (and in all fairness they really looked homologous to Neanderthal stone tools at a different site) until it was precisely dated and later found to be mesolithic tools. Tools reflect what people are doing, not their genes per say, but how they live, if you have a clever tool that makes what I am doing easier, I will strive to make it.

Specific trait evolution (apomorphies) attributed top AMH were variants until rather recently. I should point out that its not by my definition, hominims with certain level of plesiomorphies are called Archaic homo sapiens, but an earlier name Homo rhodesiensis (c.1921), by a recent name homo heidelbergensis. Again, I am not going to mince the terminology, but I should point out that there was also apomorphic gene flow from Europe into Africa\u00A0 (ergo the name African Neandertals) and from SSA and there is no reason to believe that genes flowed one direction and not the other. So N. African hominids are a mixed bag and the best name for a mixed bag is archaic homo sapiens. IN species we call this a gradient. You start with Classic (stage 4) Neanderthals, you have Levantine Neandertals, you Have North Africa archaics, then . . .\u00A0 homo sapiens. But that by definition is a recent thing, before that plesiomorphies and apomorphies in Africa appears stocastically intermixed with exceptions. And the exceptions lack statistical weight to mean anything. But the genetics shows waves of motions, first before 500 kya then around 200-250 kya and finally recent introgression, this informs us why there is stochasm.

Here, we use statistical inference based on high coverage whole-genome data (greater than 60\u00D7) from contemporary \u003Cspan\u003EAfrican\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EPygmy\u003C/span\u003E hunter-gatherers as an alternative means to study the evolutionary history of the genus Homo. Using whole-genome simulations that consider demographic histories that include both isolation and gene flow with neighboring farming populations, our inference method rejects the hypothesis that the ancestors of AMH were genetically isolated in Africa, thus providing the first whole genome-level evidence of \u003Cspan\u003EAfrican\u003C/span\u003E archaic admixture. Our inferences also suggest a complex human evolutionary history in Africa, which involves at least a single admixture event from an unknown archaic population into the ancestors of AMH, likely within the last 30,000 yr.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should note that my studies revealed a similar fiindings and were completely independent of these. It also revealed that the alternative centers of diversity outside were likely within Africa or close to Africa.\u00A0 If you look at the physical anthropology of Africa over the last 400,000 years you can surmise the same thing (see post above). As I said, Africa was a bit of a plum pudding, most groups intermixed during the constriction period, a few intermixed during the expansion. Plesiomorphies and apomorphies appeared to coexist side-by-side sometimes these were variants at other times these were self-isolating populations. Some pops might have been lost. Some of these plesiomorphies still exist, \u003Cem\u003Eunder then skin\u003C/em\u003E, in certain African populations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n75% of the human population genetics can be explained by two events (summarized, fully explained you have to look at Tishkoff\u0027s genome studies). The first is that mtDNA expanded along a line from East Africa to South Africa, with a strong favoritism along the Southern Rift valley, this is given by Tajima\u0027s D value for L5 and slightly higher L1 (these are the most equilibrated and slowly evolving mtDNAs in human, its a measure of stationary populations). The majority of Y chromosomal evolution comes from the A-B branch which is A is localized in Southern Africa and B splits to explain all others. The A00 deep branch dates to 265,000 kya\u00A0 is likely of N, W African or Arabian origin of the same period as the AB branch.\u00A0 Those events take a snap shot of where people were once at, but its a low resolution picture. We have to do refined genomic studies to see high resolution. But we have to note that there is not much in here to support a N. African origin of Hss, the N. African population appears to be an intermediate in geneflow more important geneflow of an earlier period, the anecdotes are that maybe a persistent N.African population contributed more recently, but where is the core of this population?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd when we look for centers of diversity in the N or NW African population, not apparent deep centers of diversity although there is gene evidence from Iberia and NW Africa of a prolonged occupation.\u00A0 In fact the coast population has fractional diversity relative to the SSA population, by many techniques. So that if Jebel Irhoud substantially contributes to the modernization of Africa its contribution has to move southward at least by 215,000 years ago. I suspect that the N.African population contributed to the diversification of Central African populations. What N Africa archaics contributed to H. sapiens would be much, much more apparent if we had\u00A0 a sensor, aDNA, but unfortunately the temperatures of N. Africa are too high to hope that the DNA would survive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne might ask the question, why with almost 20 years of a complete human genome that it took so long to find these introgressions into the African population. The answer is that the diploid genome (is capable of) carrying alot of variation, and unless you know the selection coefficients you have to assume that the variants are pass through variants (The HLA loci have something like 10-16 passthrough gene variants for B and DRB1 genes, in comparison mtDNA had 1 invariant passthrough and Y appears now to have 2, but still rather recent TMRCA, HLA RDs TMRCA was \u003Cem\u003Eestimated\u003C/em\u003E at 60 million years). In that context its not easy to often see introgression. HLA is peculiar because it resists exclusion and so its essentially an introgression trap. Africa has 3 fold more variation than the exo-African population. If the signals are weak and the noise is strong, they are difficult to find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe original HapMap studies were done of the Yoruban, which became a surrogate for Africans. Refined genomic analysis we can get a picture of what longer segments of African genomes look like by looking for long stretches of homozygosity that are unique to certain populations and when you do that you find the \u0027odd\u0027 variants that are in linkage disequilibrium and with that you can identify introgression events.
