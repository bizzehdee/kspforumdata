Without funds or weight/part limits, you can just make an enormous booster to blast just about anything into orbit of anywhere. With those restrictions, you need to be more efficient- do you need four landing legs or will three do the same job? Can you get away with less fuel? Can I save costs by using SRBs instead of more liquid engines? etc, etc. Spaceplanes and/or fully reusable rockets are now more useful as well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sof","CreatedById":65663,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T17:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry playing career with mods such as Tac lifesupport, FAR, deadly reentry and Kerbal Construction time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESending Kerbals to other planets is really hard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T18:12:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Agricola\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Agricola\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt is fairly easy on moderate level, especially when you work out all the little tricks to earn science and complete half a dozen contracts in one go.
