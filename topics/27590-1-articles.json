And the extent of what is done depends too.

There are a few exceptions, as others have said: things inside struts/empty fuselage elements is the most common, but I also clip jet intakes all the time. The problem is that the stock intakes have an unrealistically horrible flow rate, so you need a half-dozen per engine if you want to fly at high altitude. Seriously, a 1.25m part (meaning it has an area of ~1.2m^2) has an effective intake area of 0.01? Ridiculous, unless the units aren\u0027t in m^2, in which case the number should be raised for gameplay reasons. And its intake storage value of 0.2 (presumably liters, given how the fuel system works) is also horrible. I\u0027ll likely just create/download a mod part that has a higher flow rate, to reduce the graphical headaches, but for now I clip them using girders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few other things I regularly place inside fuselage elements. The two most common are the avionics package for my spaceplanes (since I prefer using the Mk1 cockpit, which has its own nose cone) and the RTG. In both cases, what I\u0027d really like is a thin 1.25m stack version of each, but until that happens I\u0027ll continue to put them inside my other components to reduce the ugliness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in most cases, the thing I use the debug noclip for most is just when the game won\u0027t allow me to connect something even though there\u0027s no reason for it to refuse. This happens a lot when you\u0027re using symmetry; I was putting objects on the ends of the wing of my spaceplane, and I could put both sides on individually, but when I tried to use the symmetry to put them on together it refused. Other times it\u0027s even stupider; I\u0027d connect A (new part) to B (my core ship). I\u0027d then attach C to A. But if I then pulled A off, and tried to put it back on, the game would refuse because somehow it thought C was now conflicting with B, even though it hadn\u0027t had a problem with them before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line, I use clipping in cases where the game SHOULD have allowed you to do things that way in the first place. I don\u0027t use it for things like sticking an engine inside another engine, or putting a fuel tank inside another fuel tank, because those are giving you a clear advantage over the core game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T19:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is multiple uses for using the debug noclip (getting round the radial mounting bug that doesn\u0027t let you validly attach tanks is my main use) but BEWARE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is one thing that plagues KSP and only seems to happen at the worst possible time and is linked to clipped parts...
