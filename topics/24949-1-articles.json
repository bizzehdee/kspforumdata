Nibb31 brings up a very good point about the risks of investing, Especially in this sort of gamble situation. You can follow suit and keep ranting about how your not one of the 20% that recieved their product, or you can get some patience, sit back, and wait. Just doing a little look around the web, it looks like they might have sent them out to game reviewers first, as a PR standpoint this makes sence as they will put out reviews and unboxing videos which will make their investors happy, and excited about the product they threw money at. As can be seen in this situation, sending them to game reviewers first has made the investors angry. Put down the Torch and Pitchfork, sit back and be patient. I am sure they will deliver on their agreement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Person012345","CreatedById":33728,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T12:02:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Carthaginian\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Carthaginian\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat\u0027s being an ass?\u003Cp\u003EYou didn\u0027t read what I said right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI told you you didn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease, if you didn\u0027t order, don\u0027t post anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made this thread to try and locate more people and see if their experiences were similar to mine, and perhaps drum up support for a united front to take to the Facebook page to try and get some answers.

Yes, there is every chance that an investor will \u0022get screwed\u0022. When businesses perform poorly, investors are regularly put out of pocket, as other people have pointed out that\u0027s part of investing. If you described yourself as a customer, then maybe you\u0027d have more of a point. The business should not be out to please investors, but customers (the other way around and you get EA). As it happens, kickstarter is a bit of both, so you actually have some legitimacy to complain as a customer. Also, there is no risk from a kickstarter project failing to get funded, since if it fails to meet the goal you don\u0027t get charged. I don\u0027t know why you think coming in late would \u0022minimize the risk\u0022. The risk comes in the form of the project potentially being terrible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T17:42:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELG had supply problems that delayed the Google Nexus 4 for at least 2 months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENintendo delayed the NDS for 3 months, missing the holiday period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESamsung is late in providing the Galaxy S4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGTA V has been delayed from \u0022Spring 2013\u0022 until september.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ax4APrQmWzE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what you are looking like right now BTW...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry typing \u0022Apple delays\u0022 or \u0022Sony delays\u0022 in Google, and you will see that delays are common in the hi-tech industry. Although frustrating, they are usually a good sign, meaning that the manufacturer is confident with releasing a quality product rather than rushing it just to make deadlines.
