This is usually accomplished by placing control surfaces controlling pitch at the extremities of the plane... so at the tail (tailplane) or at the nose (canards) (forgive the (possibly) inaccurate terminology, I\u0027m just a guy who learnt this stuff through KSP, not an expert). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t have canards, so typically for a tailplane this happens: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you push the stick forward, and you have a tailplane with control surfaces, these will change the shape of your tailplane so your tail basically gets more lift, and gets pushed up. If your tail goes up, your nose goes down. Because your main wing isn\u0027t doing any deflecting, you will pitch down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you have ONLY control surfaces on your main wing, and those control surfaces are BEHIND the CoM, your SAS will figure, hey... these control surfaces MUST be a tailplane! So, you press forward (push stick forward, intending to push the nose down), your control surfaces will move down to increase lift, since this must be a tailplane according to the SAS. So now, your main wing is generating more lift, but your tailplane is neutral here... so you will pitch up instead. of the expected pitch down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also means that your SAS thinks you should be pitching up when you are actually pitching down. But because the nose goes down, your SAS goes into panic mode, and pulls up harder... which fails because the pitch controls are inverted and only makes it worse. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, for effectiveness, the pitch controls are on the extremities of the plane, but work opposite. Because your plane is a see-saw one end moves up, the other end moves down. This is what the SAS assumes. And I believe it uses the CoL as a pivot point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy the roll reverses when you put the CoL in front of the CoM, I don\u0027t know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn this design it stands out that there\u0027s no yaw authority in it\u0027s entirety. Both your tailplane and vertical stabilisers seem to be AV-T1 winglets, which have no control surfaces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to fix this, remove pitch from the control surfaces on your main wing, and add control surfaces on your tailplane (disable roll and yaw here). I\u0027d also recommend putting a control surface on your vertical stabiliser for yaw control (disable pitch and roll here).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Landwalker","CreatedById":92710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T18:46:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Merandix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Merandix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E[bunch of stuff that makes sense]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou observe correctly\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthe tail of the craft is entirely fixed (and is entirely AV-T1), since at the time of design I hadn\u0027t unlocked any controllable surfaces that were suitable for the tail. My attitude towards the tail was mostly \u0022It\u0027s here to move the CoL back a little bit and get some stabilizing drag going,\u0022 which was (clearly) not a very effective or useful attitude. I\u0027ve since unlocked the Delta-Deluxe Winglet part, which also happens to be what I used in my successful sandbox test. That part will make up the preponderance of my tail-based assemblies for the foreseeable future, I think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like I may have just gotten lucky in the past and had a plane that was so nose-heavy that there wasn\u0027t any doubt about where the SAS thought the wings were in relation to the CoM, but that this particular assignment resulted in me stumbling upon the more normal arrangement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the recommendations regarding where and how to limit control authority. In the past I\u0027ve just sort of slapped on control surfaces and hoped it all worked, so I\u0027ll give these a shot going forward and hopefully have better luck / less guess-and-check and more just-do-it-right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
