KSP1 ran this for ships under player control in Cartesian coordinates. Fast and dirty, and also results in an absurd amount of error. It looks like KSP2 team was doing something very similar.

Maximum warp of KSP is 10\u003Csup\u003E5\u003C/sup\u003E. Alpha Centauri is 4.3ly from Earth. The interstellar distances are reportedly \u0022realistic,\u0022 which in the most generous interpretation means 0.4 Kerbin light-years at realistic c of 3x10\u003Csup\u003E8\u003C/sup\u003Em/s. So most generously, we\u0027re looking at something like 10\u003Csup\u003E14\u003C/sup\u003Em. A 1g torch ship would traverse this in ~73 real world days. At 10\u003Csup\u003E5\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0warp that\u0027s about 1 minute. Which is fine, but only if you really can torch the whole way, your frame rate holds, and there\u0027s nothing at significantly higher distances. In other words, 10\u003Csup\u003E5\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0must be supported in KSP2 as an absolute minimum, and needs to be rock solid. Ideally, you want to be able to push it to 10\u003Csup\u003E6\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0while maintaining a 1:1 simulation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this was all going in the wrong direction.

But the game director is almost always a creative, and they always push for more. That\u0027s normal and what every game development process will go through. It\u0027s the game\u0027s engineering director\u0027s job to say no, and then you start having discussions about what the limitations are, whether they can be exceeded by hiring more people or circumvented with a different design, and you arrive at something functional.

All indication is that the engineering didn\u0027t apply the brakes where needed or supply a solution. And while orbit decay specifically is a deceptive sort of problem, where I can see someone underestimating it initially, there were way too many examples that land the same way for me to excuse it. Technical leadership dropped the ball, and maybe Nate et al. should have recognized that sooner. Engineering director was eventually replaced, but I have no idea what sort of impact that had. The replacement would have been stuck with an absolute mess to untangle, and that obviously would take time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Izny","CreatedById":137814,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-24T19:45:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnate is counting the moneys he secured for himself the past years, and is looking into nice places for retirement.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-24T19:54:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2024 07:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 24\u0022\u003EMay 24\u003C/time\u003E by Izny\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-24T20:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t get the focus on Nate.

The senior people might be used to their counterparts from other departments telling them when they\u0027re over-reaching, and the junior people might not know to speak up, creating a perfect storm for confidently heading in the wrong direction. Dev teams tend to be pretty flexible in terms of the hierarchy - there isn\u0027t usually a strict chain of command to follow (though, there is one outlined, and it\u0027s usually used to resolve conflicts). But the composition of the team is still very important. If you\u0027re lacking \u0022high ranking\u0022 developers in any given area, even if the juniors are capable of doing the work, it\u0027s going to bite you in the rear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut on the net, it\u0027s not something invisible. Everyone knew the project\u0027s off schedule. The internal view was clearly, \u0022We\u0027re not getting enough resources, and the goal posts are constantly shifted,\u0022 which is at least partially fair. But to a publisher that looks like a team that\u0027s giving a constant thumbs up and under-delivering. The correct reaction from a publisher is looking into the causes, down to the point of sending their due diligence team in. Because PD usually works with external studios, they have people\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Especifically\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0employed to look into other team\u0027s culture, work practices, etc, which evaluates developers prior to signing them up. And if your internal studio starts showing signs of distress, these are the people who will tell you precisely what\u0027s going wrong. Instead, PD\u0027s reaction was to just keep saying, \u0022Hurry it up,\u0022 and then putting a hard deadline for EA? That\u0027s not going to make the situation better. All it does is moves another goal post from the team\u0027s perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBottom line, we can argue at length on what the studio could have done to self-correct and to send clearer communication up the chain to the publisher to resolve the situation, and whether that was even possible. But there is no argument that identifying and responding to problems like this is part of the publisher\u0027s job. It\u0027s literally what they are there for - managing resources and targets for the team. And the publisher that only adjust the latter without even checking on the former does not know how to do their job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is why I\u0027m fully on Intercept\u0027s side, including individuals often blamed for it, like Nate. Mistakes were clearly made, but mistakes always happen in any development, and in a healthy developer-publisher relationship, these would have been corrected years ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd FWIW, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s malicious from T2/PD\u0027s perspective either. They shot themselves in the foot and lost a bunch of their own money. A lot of people here will say, \u0022And ours!\u0022 and that\u0027s true, but T2 wanted KSP2 to be successful as much as the rest of us. The only predatory move was how EA was marketed, and I don\u0027t think that was intentionally malicious. I don\u0027t know if anybody here ever worked with brand/marketing people in games, but they are their own universe. I know a bunch of people just picture an office building full of boring bean-counters, and they have a few of these, but marketing is about hype, about going viral, about making things popular. They are extremely excitable, and often terminally online bunch. (Also often older than the target demographic, leading to a touch of the \u0022How do you do, fellow kids,\u0022 but that\u0027s a separate topic.) So if you send them an email saying, \u0022Hey we are releasing an Early Access for this game, can you make a trailer?\u0022 you\u0027ll get exactly what we got. I don\u0027t think anybody wanted to hide how rough EA is to defraud somebody. Analytics wanted to see how many units EA can sell to make projections for the 1.0, marketing just wanted to do the best they can as always, and somebody in charged pushed the red \u0022launch\u0022 button without ever considering the consequences. It was still predatory and damaging, but I don\u0027t think anybody involved went in with that intention. People at T2 who should have thought about it just didn\u0027t care. And that last bit is probably the summary for the entire story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Izny","CreatedById":137814,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-26T10:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224392978\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224740\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716676136\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201293\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DeadJohn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, DeadJohn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo what, work 7 years at $50k and retire?
