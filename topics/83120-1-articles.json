It\u0027s about angular momentum of craft in central potential. If your aim point is low, with periapsis of hyperbolic trajectory almost kissing the surface of the target body, the angular momentum you need to kill to perform landing is also low.

Guys tried all sorts of things from bi-elliptic transfers to simple Hohmann transfers and everything in between. The two methods that resulted in the lowest delta-V expenditure in the competition were Stochasty\u0027s, who built a craft that could survive a roll-on landing at over 100 m/s and my own. Stochasty still beat me, but I got close to his score by using a double gravitational assist off the Mun, then intercepting the Mun for a landing on the third encounter. I used the first munar slingshot to raise my periapsis about Kerbin and the second Munar slingshot to lower my apoapsis about Kerbin. When I entered the Mun\u0027s SOI the third time, I was actually on an elliptical trajectory rather than a hyperbolic trajectory. Using Stochasty\u0027s landing technique at the end of the multi-gravitational assist trajectory would have shaved even more delta-V off the transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T06:04:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEnergy may be conserved, but delta-v is path dependent.

The main reason to orbit before landing is the same as to orbit Kerbin before departing: getting the time to set up your manoeuvre properly. On the landing end of things this includes being able to select your landing zone and make the appropriate deorbit burn for that.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes. But it\u0027s important to make sure people know that by doing this you\u0027re getting a benefit (picking your landing zone. Taking a breather. Hitting quicksave in a save area) with NO DETRIMENT. It\u0027s not like we do this, get all these benefits, but sacrifice fuel. By doing this we\u0027re actually SAVING fuel AND getting the benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T21:51:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWith patched conics, you can leave/enter a planet\u0027s SOI with an elliptical trajectory no problem.
