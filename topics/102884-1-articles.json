Modded and stock will also be divided.\n\nBest replica will be judged on how closely it follows the shape, dimensions, and weight of the original one.\n\nWingspan: 98 m\n\nLength: 67 m\n\nWeight: 136,100 kg\n\n![images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTfZEc9QbNkY1d7ZiVHRjCt8T7E469oTqU6PyE-CYXESNtPGH2HtQ](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTfZEc9QbNkY1d7ZiVHRjCt8T7E469oTqU6PyE-CYXESNtPGH2HtQ)\n\nThe biggest replica challenge will be judged on overall size (bigger is better) and how well it follows the originals shape.\n\nRules of both challenges:\n\nAll parts are allowed \n\nPart clipping is allowed\n\nNo infinite fuel\n\nNeeds to land mostly intact (ex. less than half a wing missing)\n\nThe original flight specs (must exceed all of these):\n\naltitude: 21 m\n\nairspeed: 217 km/h\n\ndistance: 1.6 km\n\nNote:\n\nThis plane is not made to land on land it is a water plane! \n\nSo only put enough wheels on it to get it to the water!\n\nIf you have questions please ask.\n\nAnd last of all I\u0027ll put my attempt up soon.\n\nNow get out there and make Hughes proud!\n\nHere is a badge for everyone who completes this:\n\n![10e6b33dfe.png](http://puu.sh/h8vkp/10e6b33dfe.png)\n\nEdit:\n\nI finally got mine flying check page 2 \n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T12:09:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 12:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheLongRun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T14:02:56Z","Content":"I\u0027ll give this a try when I\u0027m back home..
