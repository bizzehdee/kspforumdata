I am new in these forums and I had a idea in mind since time: \u0022omnidirectional wheels\u0022.\n\nMy idea is add these three types of wheel (and variants by company or size, of course):\n\n- Omni wheel.\n\n- Mecanum wheel.\n\n- Hemispheric omnidirectional gimbeled wheel (or simply hemispheric wheel).\n\n- Normal wheel capable to spin 360\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA (thanks to Armchair Rocket Scientist).\n\nMore detail:\n\n\u003E\u003E Omni wheel:\n\nThis type of wheel is a multi-wheel that contains small wheels aligned 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA over the extreme of multi-wheel.\n\n![omni_backside.png](http://i2.wp.com/matrixrobotics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/omni_backside.png)\n\nHow it works?\n\nSmall wheels allow that the multi-wheels are capable to crawl without generating friction, is simple and very useful, with this you can make functional omnidirectional vehicles with octagonal, triangular, etc shapes.\n\nRobot with this type of wheel in action:

clockwise.\n\nE: spin vehicle counterclockwise.\n\n\u003E\u003E Mecanum wheel:\n\nThis type of wheel is a multi-wheel that contains small wheels aligned 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA over the extreme of multi-wheel, and aligned 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA over de radius of multi-wheel.\n\n![mecanum-wheel.jpg](http://robomatter.com/images/ifi/mecanum-wheel.jpg)\n\nHow it works?\n\nSmall wheels deviate the multi-wheels when these multi-wheels spin each in different direction, this causes a lateral or spin movement of vehicle, much more useful.\n\nVehicle with this type of wheel in action: \u003Cfont

vertical axis, this half sphere is connected with a system of rotation.\n\n![hqdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O7MoVRNObN0/hqdefault.jpg)\n\nHow it works?\n\nThe half sphere spin in vertical, when is inclined by the mechanism, the direction movement of vehicle changes, the reason is a long geometry and physic explanation.\n\nRobot with this type of wheel in action: \u003Cfont

I know firsthand that they will maintain grip in every direction, (if you set them up in the proper X formation, that is. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Darn our robotics build team, putting them on completely the wrong way.) to the extent that they can.

They can strafe sideways at all speeds, but so can 360-degree wheels, which have the added benefit of being capable of using a wired connection to the car\u0027s \u0022avionics\u0022 (or whatever they call it in cars). At some point, these are way more technically challenging than a steerable castor, but not any more advantageous. I\u0027ve made Lego robots that use trackball-type wheels for control, and designing a control scheme for them is tough. Their only real advantage is that their desire to twist due to a forward center of pressure is not a serious issue. The other problem I see is weight. A ball probably can\u0027t be designed lighter than a wheel. Also, assuming the wheel underneath needs some sort of maintenance at least sometimes, you need to take the tire completely off (somehow) in order to even SEE the darned thing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-05T02:46:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2016 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314**"},{"CreatedByName":"Navy2k","CreatedById":95246,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-05T09:17:52Z","Content":"Those wouldn\u0027t work on most planet surfaces because they need a considerable amount of friction and a flat surface.
