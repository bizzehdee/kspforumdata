In this case, their age is equal to the mission time, and so it increases also during time warps and when inactive. Currently this only applies to tanks and control surfaces.

In fact, only a few lower-stage engines and some engines designed for landers are. (The RL-10 was originally designed for the USAF lunar base mission and was thus designed to be throttleable). Throttling an engine is *hard* since it usually decreases Isp (*especially* at sea level; throttling can be done by lowering chamber pressure, but that drastically reduces sea level Isp).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SSME has a range of about 67% to 109%. The \u0022109%\u0022 is just because later engines had a higher max thrust and rather than redo the avionics and gauges they just left 100% at where it originally was. It\u0027s run at 109% at liftoff, then throttled down when it no longer needs so high a chamber pressure, and to lower G load for the crew. Higher chamber pressure is generally bad, but running your turbopump etc. at lower than rated RPM is also, IIRC, bad. So a U-shaped curve is probably best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also worth considering whether you want 100% thrust in KSP to be \u0022maximum thrust\u0022 or, as it were, \u0022overthrust\u0022--something beyond what the engine is reliably rated for, but something achievable by boosting the turbopumps, say. Then again even in KSP where you can restart them the lifetime of engines is quite short...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ippo","CreatedById":107018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T23:12:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIppo: yikes!
