Falcon 3 has an impressive wing area neatly fitted around the essential engines. The fuel management is clearly efficient and allowed you to reach orbit with only 6x 400L tanks with plenty to spare. The return to Kerbin was very precise and the large wing allowed you to glide in to land unpowered on the KSC runway, quite a feat which fully deserves the honour of an advanced pilot precision award.

I do think the people who want a challenge involving mods and cargo drops etc would enjoy having a dedicated challenge thread but obviously that depends on someone being willing to admin the thread. Though on the other hand one can organise challenges as self administering, if the rules detail requirements for proof, each report becomes self evident and noone need arbitrate but that means no roll of honour which is something I think people quite enjoy.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like the way the K-prize is set up. If I were to assume control over it, I will keep the rules and the objectives the same (with the exception of adding the new planets and planetoids added for acomplishments of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECargo Drops, Mods, except for Mechjeb will of course not be included, and an achievement for achieving orbit and landing without Mechjeb will be added as well. etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-22T08:18:57Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2012 08:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Suzaku\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheHengeProphet","CreatedById":14895,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T09:13:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022boolybooly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022boolybooly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHenge, your entry in 16 is updated to include the remarkable oinker! (O1-NKR) Which has a very innovative wing with a space stationy look to it. Only viable as an SSTO in 16 though I am guessing... unless you know different! Well done on what looks to have been a very tricky landing!!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I just tested to see if it can still get into space in 0.17 and it is more than capable, though I need to test if it is still capable of performing the K-Prize challenge! I was quite surprised. It is actually much more flyable now, which I assume is attributable to a change in fuel-drain, but landing is still a challenge (I have not succeeded on an empty tank), so I think I can do it without much, if any, modifications.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
