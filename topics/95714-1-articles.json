I mean the flavour text is mostly there just for laughs anyway. The real info for missions comes from the bit underneath where all the numbers and requirements are. On top of that... Anything that has location requirements such as specific orbits or surface samples and the like can be seen in the tracking station even before you accept the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T23:03:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe contract descriptions should be completely cut because they\u0027re unreadable nonsense.

It was put in to get a laugh out of the reader, not really explain much. I find it quite absurd and funny, myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe true description is literally right under that. The contracts in the left-hand window offer an extremely basic overview of what they want you to do right off the bat, and if you look in the main contract window it literally explains exactly what you are supposed to do. For example, when a contract appears saying to place a probe in an exact orbit, they MEAN exact orbit. They offer incredibly precise apoapses and periapses, and inclination, and in the tracking station you can tell if the orbit needs to be prograde or retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s the steps to get there that trouble you, that\u0027s what the tutorials are for, not to mention good ol\u0027 trial and error in sandbox. Most players start off there and get a feel for launching missions and landing them safely again, and that\u0027s how to learn how to play the game. There are no exact steps for the contracts; that\u0027s left up to you.
