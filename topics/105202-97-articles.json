You\u0027re missing something - the config file I know has consequences for both in it.  Haven\u0027t had a chance to look at the new UI, but I suspect it\u0027s there as well.  But basically: Habitation time is the amount of time they can be comfortable in their current vessel.  Homesickness is the amount of time they are comfortable away from Kerbin.  They start the same, because they are based on the same things: Space in your current ship, rec facilities, etc.  However, Habitation resets every time they enter a new ship, while Homesickness never resets.  It can however be increased by going into a larger ship - and it will not decrease just because you\u0027ve gotten into a smaller ship afterwards.  So for a single ship, they are equal.  Over the course of a longer mission they\u0027ll be different.\n\nI\u0027ll leave the others because I\u0027m not 100% certain on them, but it\u0027s also worth checking out the wiki - a lot of it has been reworked in the last day or so, and I think it has much better info now."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-15T15:12:59Z","Content":"That\u0027s odd.

With 18 Ec left, draining at 0.05 Ec/s, it happily reported 33 days of supply time remaining.\n\nIt might be a good way to implement it, though.\n\nEDIT:\n\nHuh. I just deliberately ran myself out of Ec. Nothing happened, apart from supplies no longer draining. None of the Kerbals onboard - a mix of orange suits and regulars - went grouchy, as they are supposed to (all available options are set to grouchy right now). They all went EVA and did stuff just fine. I was able to cruise the entire nighttime portion of a 90 km Kerbin orbit without power, while still keeping control of my vessel and even conserved supplies while at it.\n\nIt appears that either, there is indeed a grace period for power outage, or power outage has no consequences at all.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-15T17:29:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2016 05:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"}]}
