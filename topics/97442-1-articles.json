It\u0027s so light that the number of RCS ports has a noticeable effect on the mass listed in the vehicle assembly building. If I put lots of RCS ports on it, will it really have no impact on my delta V or my TWR? Is the mass listed in the vehicle assembly building unreliable for tiny craft with massless parts? Just to be clear, I\u0027m using the stock \u0022Place-Anywhere 7 Linear RCS Port\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo spice this up a bit I\u0027m attaching pics of the unfinished probe.
