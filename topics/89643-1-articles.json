If you have a really large complex wing, make sure you are attaching them width wise and then you can move each row as one piece (be sure to strut length wise).

It\u0027s best not to attach the wing as one piece as it causes issues with lift as Red Iron Crown said and also even with struts doesn\u0027t like to hold to the plane in flight so the rear wings will sag. In the image below you can see 3 rows, each row can be moved individually but the whole wing can not be moved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do this in symmetry but be warned that if you move the wing, any action groups for those parts need to be reset as they don\u0027t work well with symmetry mode. This means any wing-attached engines (like this plane) that have shut down action groups will only work on half the plane until you delete the actions and recreate them. Any FAR/NEAR controls for Flaps and Spoilers will be the same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h0rSEgG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022h0rSEgG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-07T13:56:55Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2014 01:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phemark","CreatedById":108011,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T14:18:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI get it, multiple movable things it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
