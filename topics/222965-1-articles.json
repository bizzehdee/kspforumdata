For example you couldn\u0027t reset science experiments without a scientist. Engineers could do Eva construction etc.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-this is missing in ksp2 and you can do every single mission with a probe core essentially.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2)the kerbals improved with time adding to their value. A 5 star Jeb was actually better at flying than a 1 star Schlub.\u00A0 This rocked and really helped attach you to individuals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would suggest refocusing kerbal customization along those lines but also improving the system. There are many ways to do this but I would suggest the following\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) give kerbals xp points that can be put into abilities. There could be abilities similar to ksp 1 (I.e piloting abilities, science abilities, and engineering abilities).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could for example lock the jetpack behind an ability so perhaps you can walk or tether the kerbal prior to this unlock raising the hazard of evaing with non leveled kerbals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy not tying the abilities to a class but to xp your kerbals would all end up unique in their abilities and as such could be chosen based on the mission. Their deaths would be tragic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally the abilities would be tied to interaction with ship components as right now there is functionally zero reason to Eva other than rendezvous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) give medals to kerbals for accomplishments.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) unlock new gear at higher upgrade levels (for example a fighter pilot flight suit)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-13T08:45:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about Bob\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gluckez","CreatedById":226569,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-13T10:31:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224358690\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222965\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221705135550\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about Bob\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhe\u0027s on vacation in the mohole until someone goes and rescues him\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
