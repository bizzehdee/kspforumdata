Amplification and processing swiftly followed. Patterns were identified, compared with stored data, encoded on a burst of radio waves and transmitted back to the waiting antenna. The journey took seconds, the response much longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen it arrived. An answering burst of radio waves, subtly different to the first, encoding commands instead of data. Relays tripped, valves opened, fire burst forth. The starlight shifted minutely over the sensor grid, and this time the data matched the expected values. A second, far simpler message blasted out and the reply was far swifter. The main engine fired, altering the probe velocity by a tiny fraction. Searing gases froze almost instantly in the unforgiving vacuum, leaving nothing but an invisibly faint crystalline trail, drifting away along a divergent vector.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMidcourse correction confirmed!\u0022\u00A0Bobrie called out. \u201CEstimated time to Minmus encounter, 4 days, 18 hours.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPropulsion telemetry looking good,\u0022\u00A0added Ferlan. \u201CValves, line heaters and helium pressure are all Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf all the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s spaceflight firsts, Germore reflected, defining the \u003Cem\u003Elanguage\u003C/em\u003E of spaceflight had to be their most pervasive. Listen to coverage of any launch, watch any spaceflight documentary, and the argot of Mission Control was exactly the same. Understood, Standing By, Go for this, No-Go for the other. \u003Cem\u003EThen again,\u003C/em\u003E she thought, \u003Cem\u003Eit works. Fast, precise, no wasted words. Of course any newcomer to spaceflight also feels that they need to speak the jargon to be taken seriously.\u003C/em\u003E Ruefully, she glanced around the modestly sized Deep Space Operations Centre. \u003Cem\u003EThat would be us then.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Understood,\u0022 she replied, \u0022PV array status?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe watched Ferlan work his console. \u003Cem\u003EWe certainly picked a grandiose name for our little room. But then again - why on Kerbin not.\u003C/em\u003E Minmus Explorer \u003Cem\u003E is already far beyond the reach of the crewed programmes - and Minmus is just the start.\u003C/em\u003E She shivered. \u003Cem\u003EPlus we have the first genuine \u003C/em\u003Emission \u003Cem\u003E in spaceflight history. We\u0027re not just in this for curiosity and wanderlust - what we\u0027re doing may - literally - save the world.\u003C/em\u003E She sat up straight, thumping her chair off the wall behind her. \u003Cem\u003EBesides it\u0027s \u003C/em\u003Eimpossible\u003Cem\u003E to be grandiose in this broom cupboard!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOriginally set up as Communications Room Number 4, and hastily enlarged by knocking through a wall into the adjacent room, the Deep Space Operations Centre had a distinctly cobbled together feel. Raw steel girders held up what was left of the dividing wall and nobody had yet had the time to plaster over the brickwork, let alone paint it. The floor around the flight consoles was badly scuffed and the whiff of cleaning fluids in the air mingled harshly with the metallic tang of hot electronics and ionised dust. Bundles of cables trailed everywhere, neatly corralled under black rubber floor protectors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022PVs are Go,\u0022 reported Ferlan. \u201CMain bus looking good, reserve bus online. Not a twitch in the voltage, even under thrust.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe room was dominated by a large wall mounted screen, which flickered briefly before displaying a, by now familiar, view of a star field with one small, blue dot in the middle. Bobrie glanced at the screen worriedly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027re getting blurring again. I thought we were using the new camera setup this time?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe are,\u0022\u00A0said Ferlan. \u201CLook at the background, Bob - the stars are all fine, it\u0027s just Minmus that\u0027s a bit fuzzy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBobrie waved dismissively, \u201CPoint sources,\u0022\u00A0she said, \u201CThere\u0027s nothing there \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E blur.\u0022\u00A0She looked over at Germore. \u201CWe should re-orient to Kerbin, or the M\u00FCn and get a comparison shot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGermore shook her head. \u201CI want to keep manoeuvres to a minimum,\u0022\u00A0she said. \u201CBetter to keep everything pointed at Minmus and get \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E to show for this, than get a couple of long distance shots of the M\u00FCn - and nothing else.\u0022\u00A0She paused, \u201CBesides, there\u0027s no need.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh come on,\u0022\u00A0said Ferlan, \u201CYou\u0027re not still holding to the cometary theory?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I still think it fits the data better than the mineral theory,\u0022 Germore replied. \u201CInclined orbit, apoapsis barely inside the Lemney Sphere...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah but that doesn\u0027t explain the \u003Cem\u003Ecolour\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 said Ferlan impatiently. \u0022And Melvey\u0027s latest analysis of Kerbin-M\u00FCn perturbations found any number of solutions for the inclined orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGermore shrugged. \u201CWe\u0027ll find out in four days,\u0022 she said. \u0022Anyway, decision made - we\u0027re not re-orienting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerlan gave her a mutinous look and pointedly turned back to his console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aircraft nose dipped, slowing its meteoric rate of ascent. The pilot checked his instruments, one finger sliding over the throttle levers towards a small toggle switch, seemingly oblivious to the screaming kerbal sitting behind him. Lodan pounded on the pilot\u0027s seat, on his flight helmet, on the cockpit canopy next to him, desperately trying to get his attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t help. It never did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe toggle switch flicked over in slow motion. The pilot frowned as the aircraft wings twitched, and nudged the control stick to compensate. Lodan watched the puffs of gas lazily expand from the wing mounted rocket control nozzles, and drift away on the slipstream. The aircraft began to roll, its nose creeping upward centimetre by centimetre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime reasserted itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstantly the pilot snapped the toggle switch back, wrestling with the controls as he tried to return the aircraft to level flight. The nose pitched sharply up, far past its rated angle of attack at this altitude, disrupting the precariously stable airflow over the wings. The starboard wing abruptly stalled, slamming the aircraft into a spin. Lodan\u0027s head smashed against the cockpit canopy, warning lights lighting up around him. Calmly, the pilot pulled the throttles back to shutdown, snuffing out the twin rocket engines that had been hurling them skyward. Fighting against the mounting G forces, he pulled a lever, dumping the remaining propellant overboard, trying to shift the nose down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane plummeted towards the ground, still spinning furiously. The airframe shrieked and groaned, juddering violently in the thicker air. The pilot lowered the undercarriage in a last ditch effort to regain control, but by now, every warning light in the cockpit was glowing a solid red. He braced his head and neck against the back of his seat, tucked his legs in and pulled the ejection handle. Pyrotechnic bolts fired, and promptly jammed, wrenching the cockpit canopy free but failing to detach it. A fraction of a second later, tiny rocket engines exploded under their seats, slamming the pilot and Lodan through the flapping mass of aluminium and polycarbonate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cockpit alarms shrilled in Lodan\u0027s ears. The last thing he saw before everything turned black was Enley\u0027s screaming face, lacerated and streaming blood as he tumbled away towards the waiting clouds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan jerked awake, his alarm clock warbling in his ears. Automatically he reached out to switch it off, only to bark his knuckles against the wall. The sudden explosion of pain woke him all the way up, sweaty, dishevelled and twisted around in his bed covers. He squeezed his eyes closed for a minute, trying to block out the nightmare then, resignedly, set to work disentangling himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFour in the morning. Not that I was going to get much more sleep anyway. And at least it wasn\u0027t the one about the Kerm.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe small, sparsely furnished apartment did at least come with its own moss room. The freezing cold water was a welcome tonic, sluicing away the dried sweat on his skin and chilling the fading fire of the nightmare down to it\u0027s familiar dull ache. By the time, Lodan emerged, his black mood had lifted to the merely bleak. A scalding cup of KSA tar masquerading as coffee, and a warmed over bowl of crispy noodles later, he began to feel marginally kerbal again. \u003Cem\u003EAs Jebediah would say - the recommended breakfast of rocket scientists everywhere.\u003C/em\u003E He grabbed a redfruit from the bowl and set out into the dark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDark purple streamers of cloud huddled around the mountain tops, glowing faintly in the first light of dawn. Across the grounds, much brighter light spilled out from a row of ground floor windows in the main communications wing, and away to the right, the familiar bulk of Tracking Station Two was lit up against the sky. Lodan checked his watch. \u003Cem\u003ENearly time for a shift change. Hope the Eve 2 crew managed to get more sleep than me.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe soothing smells of wild sage and mountain parsley filled his nostrils, as he strode towards the main wing. He tossed his redfruit core into the bin by the door, wiping his fingers on his handkerchief as he went. Before he could grasp the handle, a bleary eyed kerbal stumbled through, holding it open for a second, equally tired looking kerbal pushing a large urn of coffee on a trolley.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMorning, Director,\u0022\u00A0he yawned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood morning,\u0022 said Lodan quietly. \u201CA busy night I take it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdney rubbed his eyes. \u201CJust a long one,\u0022he said, \u201CNothing to report really - barely a glitch or a gurgle from the spacecraft systems, and the crew were asleep for most of the night. Just gotta take this for the next shift, and then I\u0027ll be catching a couple of hours myself.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood to hear that it\u0027s been so uneventful,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan, \u201CI won\u0027t hold you up any longer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdney nodded gratefully. \u201CAppreciate that,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CThank you, Director.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan strode down the corridor, following the distant babble of voices. He turned the corner and then stopped dead at the Deep Space Operations Centre window. To his astonishment the room was crammed to bursting with kerbals: Probodyne staff, off-duty controllers from the \u003Cem\u003EEve 2\u003C/em\u003E flight, KSA workers, and a number of others that he didn\u0027t even recognise. Dunney\u0027s voice boomed cheerfully over the crowd as Lodan pushed open the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Impeccable timing as usual, Director! We\u0027re just setting up for what-do-you-call-it... ahh yes - Minmus orbit insertion!\u0022 He gestured expansively, narrowly missing Germore\u0027s head. \u0022Or so the experts here tell me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan glanced at the main screen which was showing an image of deep space. The familiar constellations glowed steadily in the distance but otherwise, there was nothing to distinguish it from any other patch of sky. \u003Cem\u003ECan\u0027t tell anything from that. Not pointing at the M\u00FCn though, which is a good sign.\u003C/em\u003E Behind Lunney, Bobrie and Ferlan tapped away at their consoles, consulting with each other in murmured undertones. Finally Bobrie looked up at the screen, finger poised over a button on her keyboard. Lodan glanced over at them and saw Ferlan\u0027s fingers firmly crossed behind his back. He could almost hear the soft click as the button depressed and rebounded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA light blinked on on Bobrie\u0027s console and data began to scroll past on a small screen. She studied the flickering lines of code intently, although they were far too fast for Lodan to follow. The significance of the second, green light though, was clear to everybody in the room. Bobrie smiled tightly as she swivelled to face Germore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022MOI program confirmed and loaded. Ignition at T minus nine minutes,\u0022 she checked her console, \u0022twenty-two seconds.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe probe glided silently through space. Two long photovoltaic panels and an unfurled dish antenna protruded from an ungainly collection of propellant tanks, thrusters and instrument boxes. The antenna pointed unerringly at the small blue-green disc of Kerbin, a jewelled ornament floating silently in the void, basking in the life-giving electromagnetic fields from distant Kerbol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWaiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, electromagnetic fields of a different timbre reached into space. Incomparably fainter than the torrent of energy blazing from the nearby star, the ripple of radio waves raced out past the moons of Kerbin, stuttering out their coded message to anything or anyone that could understand it. The antenna swivelled on its boom; tracking, seeking, locking on. Swiftly, the message was decoded and acknowledged, triggering new instructions for the probe systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrusters twitched into life, making final, tiny attitude corrections. Then a pause, a near eternity on the scale of the flickering digital pulses that controlled the probe, but longer still for its kerbal builders. Then, a flurry of activity. Once again, valves opened, grudgingly releasing a precisely metered trickle of liquid onto a catalytic mesh. Once again, fire exploded from the engine, no mere course correction this, but a long, steady braking burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stuttering radio pulses fell silent, hiddden in the shadows of the second moon. The moon\u0027s feeble gravity tugged on the speeding visitor, slowing it, pulling it round onto a new trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe probe raced onwards, skimming mere hundreds of kilometres above the surface before soaring back out into space.

A ripple of activity flowed through the room, as the waiting kerbals stretched stiff limbs, bent over to relieve tired backs and grimaced at the taste of coffee long since gone cold. Then the main screen flickered, instantly drawing everyone\u0027s attention. Static rippled over the blocky image, which steadied, and then sharpened rapidly as it decompressed. Dozens of puzzled faces stared at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are you guys using the colour filters?\u0022 asked Sidbo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGermore nodded, just as another voice spoke up from the far wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I thought Minmus was blue?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan stared. \u003Cem\u003EI thought it was too - apparently not.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeen from orbit, most of Minmus was a coal black shadow blocking out the stars. Only the nebulous haze surrounding it and the blotches and whorls of lighter material spattered over the surface, provided any sort of guidance to its true shape or size. Lodan made his way over to the Probodyne team gathering around Ferlan\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerlan looked at Germore apologetically. \u0022Sorry, boss.

A number of variations were proposed, but a consensus developed that it was probably a temporary Joolian satellite which got too close to either Laythe or Tylo - maybe both - and was kicked in-system. That explains Minmus\u0027s orbit rather well actually, but it \u003Cem\u003Edoesn\u0027t \u003C/em\u003E easily explain its colour.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe scratched his head. \u201CI\u0027m still at a loss there myself to be perfectly honest.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerlan grinned. \u201CI\u0027m not,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CDiffuse dipole scattering would do it - right Germore?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney frowned, \u201CBut you only get that with...\u0022\u00A0He looked closely at the probe image and his eyes widened. \u201CWell, I\u0027ll be...\u0022 His sudden guffaws startled everybody else in the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh that\u0027s priceless!
