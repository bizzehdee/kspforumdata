I\u0027m not mathematically challenged, however I just need some clarification. So, the big question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat is the domain of True Anomaly? Could someone explain a bit about this?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so I get the following: At periapsis, we have theta = 0. At apoapsis, we have theta = pi. But when we from apoapsis towards periapsis (the \u0027inbound\u0027 leg), does theta assume negative values or is it customary to assume positive values? In the first case the domain of theta would be -pi \u0026lt; theta \u0026lt; pi, in the second 0 \u0026lt; theta \u0026lt; 2*pi. For elliptical orbits, the choice of convention does not seem to matter, but for hyperbolic orbits it seems that it does matter since all of a sudden hyperbolic cosines and sines come in to play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry if this question is a bit fuzzy - I\u0027m still learning!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdeLuxe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T19:23:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure it just increases in multiples of Pi.
