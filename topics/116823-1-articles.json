I\u0027m not mathematically challenged, however I just need some clarification. So, the big question:\n\n*What is the domain of True Anomaly? Could someone explain a bit about this?*\n\nOkay, so I get the following: At periapsis, we have theta = 0. At apoapsis, we have theta = pi. But when we from apoapsis towards periapsis (the \u0027inbound\u0027 leg), does theta assume negative values or is it customary to assume positive values? In the first case the domain of theta would be -pi \u003C theta \u003C pi, in the second 0 \u003C theta \u003C 2\\*pi. For elliptical orbits, the choice of convention does not seem to matter, but for hyperbolic orbits it seems that it does matter since all of a sudden hyperbolic cosines and sines come in to play.\n\nI\u0027m sorry if this question is a bit fuzzy - I\u0027m still learning!\n\nCheers,\n\ndeLuxe."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T19:23:42Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty sure it just increases in multiples of Pi. Starting at periapse theta is 0, but it\u0027s also 2Pi.\n\nBasically, radians."},{"CreatedByName":"MinimumSky5","CreatedById":115138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T19:31:50Z","Content":"Radians measure how far along a circle or ellipse something is, so both 2pi and 0pi are correct (just as 1pi and 3pi are correct at the apoapsis). 0pi implies that it has just started moving or you have just started measuring, and 2pi implies that a full orbit has taken place. Radians are cumulative, like distance, there is no limit, like temperature."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T21:37:59Z","Content":"Hyperbolic trig functions have the same period as regular ones. So it doesn\u0027t matter. True anomaly \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8 can have a domain of the form a \u003C \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8 \u003C a \u002B 2\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC for any a. But some choices might be more convenient than others. I\u0027d probably go with \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC for hyperbolic orbits just because it makes book-keeping easier."},{"CreatedByName":"TrabantDeLuxe","CreatedById":132222,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T00:16:46Z","Content":"Thanks guys!"}]}
