Don\u0027t forget that the panel would avoid all transmission losses (about 7% in the UK) and conversion losses at the point of use (about another 3-5% for a SMPS) so the panel could even produce slightly less power than it\u0027s embodied energy over its life and you\u0027d still come out ahead.

That\u0027s capitalism. It turns out the demand for their product is there, so the only issue is the use of subsidies during the early phase of deployment to speed the process. That\u0027s already falling away, and the market is maturing. The subsidies were necessary because governments wanted to push a carbon reduction policy faster than they knew the market would drive the prices down naturally.
