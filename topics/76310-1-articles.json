I would love to see Gas Planet 2 and other interesting planets in the stock game. I would also really like it for Squad to allow planets to be more easily editable by modders and to reduce the resources (especially memory) needed to add more planets. I\u0027m sure with enough customization options in the hands of modders, we could see some incredibly interesting planets that wouldn\u0027t fit the scope of the base game. I would love to have multiple solar systems, with different types of stars. A Binary system would be really cool, as would a Red Giant star that is as large as Kerbin\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that, I would love to see Squad heavily optimize the game once they reach their current goal of making the game scope complete.

Better multi-thread support and off loading some of the physics calculations to my GPU would be really awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moss","CreatedById":106413,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T05:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA fuel tank half the height of the Rockomax X200-8.
