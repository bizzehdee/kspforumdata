After a thousand tries I finally got them together right so all the ports actually docked. It\u0027s a beautiful thing, except now I can\u0027t get them apart again. So, if some nublette wanted to break apart said space station if he forgot, say the power core, how would one go about doing that. In theory, cause I totally wouldn\u0027t do something so colossally mindless as that. it shows a complete lack of planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried to undock each port, but they just reconnect when I get to the other side\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConarr\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tobmaster","CreatedById":57953,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T20:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENext time create an action group to undock...

I worked all afternoon to get the docking down perfectly. All four ports locked. I know how to do the docking manuvers now and can replicate it quickly. I have about 4 practice stations stuck together in orbit right now. I\u0027ll just end flight and setup the action groups.
