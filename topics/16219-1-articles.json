It *is* possible to fly a plane like that (modern fighters are \u003Cem\u003Edesigned\u003C/em\u003E to fly like this to make them more manoeuvrable) but you need a very sophisticated fly-by-wire system and huge control surfaces to manage it!

The answer is no. In my ridiculously ugly test craft, it made a spin worse rather than countering it, and proceeded to flip the other way. I suspect that its controls are reversed. Thankfully, the insanely brave - and probably also quite stupid - test pilot, Jebediah Kerman, thought to cut the engines BEFORE seperating the capsule and deploying the parachute. I don\u0027t know why he did that either. I promised the onlookers fireworks and my lab team had to fire a few solid rocket boosters off the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can have your thread back now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
