I put some jet engines on my Rocko Monster SRB glider so MechJeb will fly it instead of dropping it nozzle first into the ocean.

Newer automatic flight systems are good enough to run the entire flight from start of takeoff roll to landing and full stop. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the newest ones can also taxi to and from the runway. Look up on Youtube the first Airbus A380 landing at SFO. There\u0027s a cockpit video showing the pilot hardly ever touching the sidestick. Some of the time he\u0027s using a keyboard - when it\u0027s not folded down under the instrument panel.
