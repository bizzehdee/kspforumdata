The first part is probably because KSP loads at least some information about every part into memory, and the second is because physics calculations have to occur on every part that\u0027s within a certain distance of the active ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have money to spend, consider upgrading your computer - the easiest way would probably be making sure you have the maximum amount of memory your motherboard and OS can handle, since KSP seems to leak memory a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tigga","CreatedById":31224,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T13:07:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently trying to build a SSTO spaceplane. My main limitation at the moment is getting the thing off the ground because it lags like crazy. I\u0027ve found rearranging parts even slightly can have a huge difference on frame rate. I\u0027ve a feeling some self-intersections are the cause, or maybe wheel-ground \u0022collisions\u0022. Graphics settings had absolutely no effect on performance for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MilkTheFrog","CreatedById":36146,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T14:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps not what the OP was getting at but i wonder - what limits KSP the most hardware wise? GPU, CPU or RAM? It does seem to use a bit of RAM, but if i\u0027m not running anything else it\u0027s rarely at 100% of 2GB. I\u0027d have thought the CPU would have helped with the physics calculations, and reducing that pause you get when you go to start a flight. But when i watch videos from people with much better hardware than me it doesn\u0027t look \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E much better (E2140 @ 2.6). And i wouldn\u0027t have thought the graphics would be that taxing...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
