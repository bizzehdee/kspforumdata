Given that Kerbals are half the size of humans, this probably \u003Ci\u003Efeels\u003C/i\u003E more like 32/km2.

If they tried to fly any lower, they\u2019d never make it... anywhere. Not that here was much better.

She set the autopilot, then rose, her own face pinched in a diplomatic smile. With the touch of a leather-covered panel, it slid away, revealing a large screen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLet\u2019s see,\u201D Burdous peered at the console as if struggling to focus, \u201Chere...\u201D He plugged in a tiny memory card, and the screen came to life. He then plopped into the nearest seat, rubbing at the wide, flat spot between his eyes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait, what?\u201D Edgas seemed to rouse himself from the back, \u201Cyou actually got that?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous mumbled vague assent as Edgas worked his way forward.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiving them both a concerned look, Dibella tapped at the screen. An image appeared, grainy and just a bit tilted, showing a wing of the polar base below and endless white stretching to the dark horizon. Then, as they watched, little storms seemed to billow up out on the snow. Tiny at first, they began to swell as they rushed \u003Cem\u003Etowards\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the base at astonishing speed. The air just above the mini-blizzards appeared to shimmer, almost like a heat haze despite the freezing cold.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe patches of swirling snow stopped just beyond the base, and before their eyes the air above them seemed to just split open, dozens of white-clad figures nearly invisible against the snow streaming out. Within seconds, one pressed something against a hatchway, and it blew inward, the figures rushing inside behind it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella poked at the screen again, changing the picture. Now the view came from inside the hangar on the other side of the base, opposite the airlock, just above head height. A section of the towering main door just beside it exploded inward, white forms flowing through before the smoke had even begun to clear, spraying rifle fire seemingly at random. Someone in the hangar ran for cover, arms trying vainly to shield his head.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThose maniacs!\u201D Valentina spat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D Dibella said softly, brow pinched in thought, \u201Cthey are not trying to hit anyone, their aim is to scare them. \u003Cem\u003EDrive\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0them.\u201D She looked at Valentina, \u201Cthey wanted prisoners.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore she could comment further, one of the invaders approached the camera, looking right into it and grinning below its mask, and Valentina spat another curse. She could never forget that scarred flesh, those teeth filed to sharp points, or that feral, eyeless leer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CValar\uFEFF\u00A0Arct\uFEFF\u00FBct\uFEFFis.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait, what?\u201D Burdous popped up, his eyes suddenly clear, \u201C\u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0did you say?!

The armpit part was \u003Cem\u003Emost\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0unpleasant. The bandage on his head still wasn\u2019t quite enough to staunch the flow, even after he\u2019d tied it so tight his teeth clenched.

Edgas had thought about looking down at it, but those tiles seemed polished to a mirror shine, and his own face was probably the last thing he needed to see right now. Those tiles spread out across a \u003Cem\u003EGran Foy-yay\u003C/em\u003E, far bigger than any apartment he\u2019d ever lived in. Or apartment \u003Cem\u003Ebuilding\u003C/em\u003E, for that matter. A massive double-winged staircase led up to rooms beyond, he supposed, and between and beneath them was an impressively large set of double doors.

Her face was serene, flawless, and try as he might Edgas couldn\u2019t quite put an age to her. Her pale hair was done up just so, yet with a single long, thick braid draped down over one shoulder. She wore a velvety, long-sleeved, high-necked dress of light and dark green with a stately purple cape fringed with many colors, and, Edgas noted, she wore no crown. Only a large blue gem on a loose golden chain around her neck.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd about this time, Edgas felt Valentina\u2019s eyes boring into the side of his head, and stopped gawking. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Empress stepped forward, a proper, just-slightly-disinterested smile on her face, hands folded demurely before her.

Sheer, nearly vertical cliffs stretched out along either side, towering over the pale blue of the ocean nearly a dozen kilometers below. From this height, he could just see the curve of the massive bowl they created. Sam was weak, his entire body felt like a liquid, his lungs burned, and \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0hurt... and this wasn\u2019t even the \u003Cem\u003Ehighest\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0peak in the mighty Rim Range.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet he felt like he could see forever. The air was so clear at this altitude, the snow along the distant ridgelines looked close enough to reach out and touch, he could see individual boulders on the naked mountain flanks too steep for snow, and from above even the clouds seemed crisp and solid. His brother Kyle was right... as he, well, usually was. \u003Cem\u003EThis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was worth the climb.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCheck it out, lil\u2019 bro,\u201D Kyle pointed out across the sea, \u201Cyou can see Mont Bonc rising out of the water shrouded in mist there, and just beyond the horizon\u2014 Rim Island.

From here it looked like a model, something seen in a diorama at a museum. As he watched, a four-engined \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E transport that was little more than a toy lifted off from a nearby pad and headed out toward the open sea.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd finally, lil\u2019 bro,\u201D Kyle gave him another turn, \u201Cthe \u003Cem\u003Epi\u00E8ce de r\u00E9sistance!\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWo\u2014\u201C the half-formed word froze in Sam\u2019s mouth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere she is, \u003Cem\u003Emon fr\u00E8re\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E Garish, the City of Light.

If you look \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0close, you can just about make out the Eye-full Tower.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam\u2019s lower lip trembled, perhaps seeking a word. Any coherent thought had ceased altogether. The shadow of the mountains reached out to the east as afternoon rapidly moved toward evening, and nestled there in the deepest part of that shadow was a web of light in every hue imaginable. It seemed to stretch out, like an explosion of beauty frozen in time, gossamer strands of red and yellow radiating from a core of rainbow shades that throbbed and pulsed like a heartbeat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd indeed, there in the center, he \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0see it. A dark tower silhouetted and bathed in the city\u2019s glow, the strands of the web radiating from it like beams of light. An impossible pillar of pure white shot skyward from its apex, as if in that moment it was the axis upon which the whole world turned. Sam was a simple kerb, not taken to such grandiose ideas, yet he thought his heart might break from the beauty of it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as he watched, the brilliant pillar flickered and winked out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen a sector of the web went dark. Another followed, and another, as if the shadow were swallowing the light. The darkness stretched out, raced along the gossamer strands leading out from the city, erasing them from existence, streaming in all directions, including\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam felt his already weak knees begin to quiver. It took him a moment to realize \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was quivering, just before the vibrations knocked him to the ground.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEarthquake!\u201D he screamed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBe chilled, lil\u2019 bro,\u201D Kyle dropped down to one knee and a hand, \u201Cjust ride it out. We\u2019re on top of a mountain, that\u2019s the safest place to be in an earthquake. Nothing to fall on us!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam crawled forward and embraced the little rock outcrop, clinging to it like a buoy in a stormy sea. He worked his eyes open and shut, trying to focus, trying to convince himself he \u003Cem\u003Ecouldn\u2019t\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0feel the mountain rising and falling in waves. He turned, saw the tracking station. It was thrashing about like a wounded animal, twisting metal squealing in death throws. It seemed to melt and slide down the mountain face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shaking went on and on. Minutes. Hours. Days. He couldn\u2019t tell anymore. Then a new sound came to him above the rumbling. \u00A0He looked along the ridgeline, to the farthest edge of the curving rim. Darkness itself was spewing up as if from the very bowels of all the Nine Hells, reaching skyward higher and higher. And coming closer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took his addled, panicked mind some time to realize what he was seeing. A jet of dust and rock bursting forth from the crest of the mountains, rending the very rock like cloth, and rapidly racing towards him. Sam tried to look away, back to the north, only to see the same dark eruption bearing down the other way.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe squeezed tighter to the outcrop as the two rising walls of chaos finally slammed together in the center of the towering peak just to the east, and then\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSound.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESOUND!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe world became sound, blasting over him like a solid thing, driving burning spikes into his ears\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then all sound ceased. Sam could \u003Cem\u003Esee\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the pandemonium rising all around, boulders tossed like pebbles, but the world had gone silent as a dream. He was distantly aware that he was screaming, but couldn\u2019t even hear that. Slowly he turned, and found his brother. Kyle was barely clinging to the edge of the glacier, and for the first time in his life, Sam saw fear in his bother\u2019s eyes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere came a jolt, and the scrap of ice that had clung to the mountain for eons finally surrendered, taking Kyle with it as it descended into the frothing black maelstrom far below. Sam felt another jolt as his harness snapped taught, felt a rib crack, but that seemed faint and unimportant. More out of dumb instinct than anything else, he tried to crawl back up the precipice that his harness was still clipped to, until the entire \u003Cem\u003Emountain\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0fell away beneath him, and the shadow swallowed him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thedrelle","CreatedById":145967,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-09T17:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223464888\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162280\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221539103366\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257438\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CatastrophicFailure\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 minutes ago, CatastrophicFailure said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere came a jolt, and the scrap of ice that had clung to the mountain for eons finally surrendered, taking Kyle with it as it descended into the frothing black maelstrom far below.
