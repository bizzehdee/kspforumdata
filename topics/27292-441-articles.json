Learned that the advice of \u0022rolling the command pod around KSC\u0022 to collect enough early science to get to Basic Rocketry is sound, but I must\u0027ve been doing it wrong; could barely deal with the command pod\u0027s natural camber. Worked though. Set up my contracts to favor additional science at the cost of funds, accepted the first four contracts, shot Jeb into orbit with a quad of goo containers and came back down in the sea east of KSC. Earned enough science on that initial hop to unlock all the Tier 2 and 3 nodes, and chose Electrics for my first Tier 4 node. One flight and I\u0027ve already got solar panels and the ability to construct science packs. Almost had enough to go ahead and pick up fuel ducts too, so I did some parts tests to get that out of the road. Did another hop to unlock RCS; I\u0027ve got my first rescue contract in the chute so I figured that\u0027d be important. I do have to concur with the observation that Jeb doesn\u0027t really like to hang on to the side of the ship in 0.25; I had a couple of times when I was out trying to get an EVA report where he just kinda slipped off - this with the pod getting ready to come back down...\u003Cp\u003ETonight I\u0027ll do my rescue mission, and then I think it\u0027ll be about time to go to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I like to do is take two of the MK1 pods and stack the tops together and just \u0022launch\u0022 that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T18:19:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022skeevy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022skeevy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat I like to do is take two of the MK1 pods and stack the tops together and just \u0022launch\u0022 that.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh - now that makes sense.

To be honest, though, I\u0027m not sure how I would have built it differently, though; its centers of drag and mass were lined up just fine for an engine-first descent, but trying to fly it horizontally across the surface with any maneuverability is nearly impossible. It did make a perfectly satisfactory SSTO ascent from Kerbin prior to docking with the Aranai\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9, though, so that much should definitely be possible from Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dj6670v.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dj6670v.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIssue number 2: Turns out Laythe doesn\u0027t have a flat surface on it. I took the recommended landing site of some guy on IRC, but it still wasn\u0027t great. In the end I had to turn on infinite fuel - I mean, grab some water off the surface and electrolyze it into fuel real fast - so that I could use RCS to keep the blasted thing from falling over like it so badly wanted to do. The Aerulia lander works well enough, but I think it\u0027s going to need a big redesign - maybe more along the lines of a VTOL plane than a rocket - before it\u0027s doing any real exploring of Laythe\u0027s landscape. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the other news, I also built a new super mighty power transit vehicle with KSPI stuff, this time powered by antimatter and fueled with a combination of ammonia and hydrogen (either-or, not at the same time).

Unfortunately, doing this would leave the ship hanging dead in space with nothing but RCS for propulsion (maybe I should put a few NFT plasma engines on the aft ends of those ammonia tanks for backup?), but 9 out of 9 kerbals agree that nearly anything is a better situation than finding oneself at the center of a multi-megaton antimatter explosion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntimatter is scary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment, the first prototype for this vehicle lives in a slightly-inclined Tylo orbit to survey the surface.
