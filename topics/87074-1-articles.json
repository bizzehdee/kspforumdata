I think I need a position Vector of every enngine, and also another Vector that points in the thrust direction of each engine. Or is there a way to calcualte these with the attachedAngles of the engine?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also quite unfamiliar with the Coordinate System of the ship. I looked into a config file of a very simple spacecraft and was confused, because the capsule was not at (0|0|0) coordinates, and engines that i placed on the x,y an z axis didn\u0027t show (0|0|x) rotation as I expected. Why are there four rotation axis???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you can help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eregards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimon\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T20:24:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought would be to simply use the thrust transform. That is where KSP applies the thrust from the engine and so would work for your location I would think. You\u0027d have to grab the thrust magnitude separately but that is just the ModuleEnigine.MaxThrust field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would only get you the location and magnitude of the thrust of each individual engine though, I\u0027m not sure how to go about evening things out to find the center of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the co-ordinate system, things get fun there. First, the root part of the vessel is the part that is at the 0,0,0 location, but only in Flight. If you are looking in the Editor (.craft file), the part\u0027s position is relative to the Editor building itself. Also, the root part does not have to be the capsule, it is usually the first part placed. Second, the reason there are 4 values is that Unity (which KSP runs on) uses Quaternions for its rotation values. Trying to manipulate those directly is pretty much impossible, look at the in-game functions offered to try and match what you are after. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWiki link on quaternions.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you describe what you are trying to do? That would give us an opportunity to suggest how to manipulation the quaternions to do what you are after.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Red Death","CreatedById":69338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T04:21:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, I\u0027m having a similar need as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to create a VTOL, that\u0027s rather large for a space plane, and I need to know where the center of thrust is with my vertical engines, excluding my horizontal engines thrust but including their mass. I try to use parts that approximate their mass and won\u0027t contribute to the center of thrust, but it leads to a lot of trial and error.
