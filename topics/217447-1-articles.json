Suddenly space infrastructure matters. Space stations, refuelling tugs and so on all come into play. Vehicles get designed for a specific purpose and then reused again and again, so they become old friends. Old problems need entirely new solutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest of all, you get an entire career run with NO LAG.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
