Channel selection is going to be something like 1/100. So you\u0027d have to travel about 1% of the speed of light to make a difference. This might be closer to 1/1000 in the microwave ranges, but it\u0027s still much, much faster than any spacecraft ever launched.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bunsen","CreatedById":10598,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T07:18:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s there, and whether or not it matters depends very much on how the radios are set up. Some systems are quite sensitive to frequency error, others not so much. Higher speed systems are usually less picky. For example, the cubesat I\u0027m working on right now has one downlink transmitter on approximately 435 MHz with a 10 kHz channel width, and for low Earth orbit the ground station has to tune plus or minus one full channel to compensate for Doppler shift. It also has a 2.4 GHz radio with a 280 kHz channel width, which doesn\u0027t give a damn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterplanetary missions see larger relative velocities, and often use rather low data rates to overcome the long distances and limited power availability. Doppler adjustment is designed into the system at about the same level as figuring out where to point the antennas, though, so it\u0027s not like it catches anybody by surprise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thaniel","CreatedById":11130,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T07:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESETI for instance compensate for the dopler created by the movement of earth in it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s orbit around the sun to confirm/rule out terrestial signals.
