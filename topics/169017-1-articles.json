I have been playing KSP quite some time now and I\u0027ve just been getting into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E. I really like the mod but the rockets I make don\u0027t lift off the launchpad anymore. They worked fine, but not anymore. I think that it has something to do with the second stage. If I build a rocket without a second stage\u00A0it works perfectly fine but the second I add a second stage it doesn\u0027t lift off and is stuck \u0022hovering \u0022 in the air. I can fire up my engines and even do flips but it just won\u0027t move further up into the air. It\u0027s like this for every rocket that I build.\u00A0Has anyone had this problem? Can someone help me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.: I wanted to attach a picture but I don\u0027t know how.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-30T01:27:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums and to the challenges of\u00A0modded KSP.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s hard to tell without a picture (there is a thread in the Community section with current\u00A0instructions for posting pics), but it sounds like a mod incompatibility issue.

I\u0027ll make sure to use that in the furture. It seems that I have solved the problem... I installed KSP again with\u00A0the same mods but now it works. Don\u0027t know what caused the problem but it seems to be gone now. I\u00A0just installed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and that seems to work\u00A0better than just installing all of the mods separately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
