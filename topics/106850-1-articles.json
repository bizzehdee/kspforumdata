Why is this happening ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T18:51:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 06:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bast63**\n  \nAnswered"},{"CreatedByName":"Moss","CreatedById":106413,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:33:26Z","Content":"The engine has likely become hot through use or has had heat introduced to it by conduction or another source. It\u0027s probably transferring it\u0027s heat through the craft to the heat shield, which is losing ablator as an effect of this."},{"CreatedByName":"bast63","CreatedById":38031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:36:15Z","Content":"Ok thank you. Probably because of the nuclears engines. What can I do for evacuate the overheat ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Moss","CreatedById":106413,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:39:00Z","Content":"That\u0027s an extremely good question. There\u0027s some demand within the KSP community for dedicated radiator parts that can remove heat from your spacecraft. I\u0027m not sure how realistic the KSP heat model is, but it\u0027s been shown that parts with high surface area, such as wings, are effective at getting rid of heat through a modelled radiator effect."},{"CreatedByName":"bast63","CreatedById":38031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:44:26Z","Content":"Ok, tkank you again.
