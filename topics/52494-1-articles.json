I was wondering if anyone was interested in starting a Kerbal Space War and possibly doing a Youtube series on it. Let me know if you may be interested or just want to talk about it a little bit. I can host but no guarantee the internet will be of the highest quality. There would be mild role-play as well. Also, the game would be Vanilla.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bradley101","CreatedById":39760,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T21:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes but I\u0027m rubbish with flying intercepts in space.

I could even set up a temporary server for it as well, and record a series. I have fraps, and about 8gb of memory I could use for the server (in total I have 16gb). However as of when I\u0027m posting this, KMP doesn\u0027t support modded parts, and plugins are a bit sketchy. Obviously, if I did run a server it wouldn\u0027t be up 24/7, but it would be fun to get together on a weekend and just duke it out and record. I\u0027d do all the editing and production for the recording bit. All you guys have to do is kill each other with kinetic kill missiles. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E PM me if you want more info.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wahgineer","CreatedById":59292,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T22:54:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry bradley101, but mods that use plugins are incompatible with KMP right now.

When Jebediah left his brothers and made off with what was left of the lander after a crash landing on the Mun, Bill and Bob realized he could no longer be trusted. Bill soon later abandoned the injured Bob and made for a space station 15 kilometers out. After almost 5 days of radio messages, a rescue vehicle finally found Bob. When each of the brothers returned to Kerbin, their sense of brotherhood was gone. Each left the Kerbal Space Program to make their own company.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah went on to create the ASF, Aredian Space Fleet; Aredian meaning \u0022of red\u0022 in Kerbal. The ASF was a warlike conglomerate of many nations\u0027 space fleets to the North of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill went on to create the FKS, Federation of Kerbal Space. The FKS had a goal of colonizing all bodies in the Kerbol system by whatever means necessary. The company grew into a Federation to the South of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob went on to create NK, New Kerbin. The company, like the others, gained the support of many nations and forged a new nation in the Great Kerbal Desert.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter 3 years of preparing, these nations, headed by each founder, are readying their armies and raising their fleets. The first Interstellar war is upon the Kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Anyways, that\u0027s my idea for the story. I\u0027d go under the ASF because that\u0027s more my play style.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bradley101","CreatedById":39760,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T23:13:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool like the plot line doing more work on the stuff tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"generalred256","CreatedById":26949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T20:29:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry guys, this idea has been cancelled, thank you for the support.
