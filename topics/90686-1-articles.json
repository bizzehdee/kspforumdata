They\u0027ll attach to just about anything, just about anywhere and create a new node to which you can attach just about anything extra. The struts themselves are massless so apart from extra part-count there is no drawback to having them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want 7 engines under a tank, for instance: place the one in the middle as normal. Now grab a Cubic Octagonal Strut and put it towards the edge of the bottom of the tank and put an engine on the new node that provides. Change to symmetry-6, click the strut you just placed and adjust its position so that the (symmetrical) set of struts\u002Bengines fit around the central one. The editor allows some \u0027clipping\u0027 (overlapping) of parts, which can make things look better but people regard as various degrees of \u0027cheating\u0027 (it\u0027s a single-player game, have fun the way you want to).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a bit more work you can use WASD to turn the struts inside the tank before you attach the engines, which makes them fit flush against it but then it\u0027s harder to adjust their position later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T17:53:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello from a fellow North Carolinian!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vsully","CreatedById":129549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T21:33:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk thanks for the tip on multi engines.
