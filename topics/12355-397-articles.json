Thanks!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will find that the oscillation you mentioned is due to your RCS thrusters not being in balance, i.e., at the center of mass when they are being used. I, too, thought, that MJ\u0027s Auto-Dock had improved between KSP 0.25 and 0.90. Then, I had a docking where tons of monoprop were spent. When I placed the RCS thrusters in the correct location, MJ spent less than 15 monoprop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen building your rocket, estimate how much fuel you\u0027ll have when you\u0027re going to dock; right-click the tank and adjust both LF and Oxy sliders. I use a rough guesstimate. Then use the CoM tool to determine where to place the thrusters. Then, use the sliders to set the tank to maximum for LF and Oxy again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for your current situation is that when the thrusters are not at CoM, and MJ fires a thruster to translate, that causes the vessel to rotate about the CoM axis. MJ then corrects by firing the opposite thruster, which again, causes rotation, which must be corrected. Thus, you see a lot of RCS firing continuously and spending monoprop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you have unbalanced RCS thrusters in flight and preparing to dock, you can kinda workaround it with MJ\u0027s SMART A.S.S. Turn-off Auto-Docking. Select TGT-\u0026gt;(-PAR) This will place your vessel\u0027s docking port in parallel alignment with the target docking port. Manually translate with RCS until you are roughly inline with the target port and about 15 meters out. Then, turn on Auto-Docking. You will burn far less monoprop this way instead of letting MJ\u0027s Auto-Dock spend it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T14:23:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Apollo13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T23:35:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, 6km isn\u0027t too horrible, yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou didn\u0027t answer the question I had about the bug report on deltaV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, my retest of Pol, this time I flew the ship there, so hyperedit wierdness is eliminated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file (same as the laythe one): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://sta.sh/0cwk610imhq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sta.sh/0cwk610imhq\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Equicksave and output log: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://sta.sh/0hp3jn778cc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sta.sh/0hp3jn778cc\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild 444\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttempt 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used the same coords that I used previously just for consistency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurned out to be a replay of the first testing, which is that it went normally until it started doing the tumbling, and I\u0027ll note here that I\u0027m using the reliant engine, which doesn\u0027t have a gimbal in the first place.

To make a long story short, in a career game I have an early-ish stock rocket with the basic \u0022Swivel\u0022 engine. Ascent profile is more or less default -- 15km start, 75km end, shape is 50%ish, 100 m/s speed.

With this smallish rocket, speed is the first mark hit by a longshot. (The craft is at 100 m/s by about 5000m, give or take.) The gravity turn starts. The result I expected is that the gravity turn progresses based on the shape from that point until the target end altitude. What actually happens is that the turn progresses, it appears, based on something else. I can\u0027t tell if its speed, or % of desired final orbital altitude (as determined by current apoapsis), or what. I wind up with a craft that\u0027s finishing its gravity turn at about 35,000 m, and is at the desired final orbital angle -- i.e. pretty close to horizontal -- and is accelerating to hit the desired apoapsis. 35km is a low atmospheric density region... but it ain\u0027t zero.
