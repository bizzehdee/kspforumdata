It\u0027s safe to add Outer Planet Mods which simply just adds planets to the stock system. Best thing to do is to read the mod description before you add it. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlpacaMall","CreatedById":209127,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-31T04:18:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-31T09:37:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome planet packs are built to add to the stock system- OPM is a good example, however it also moves Eeloo to be a moon of the new planet Sarnus so be careful if you have any missions on/at/going to Eeloo. Others like XPC, MPE, Corelian (makes Dres a moon), Valor are also available but might not work well when they\u2019re all combined; as far as I know XPC has a patch to work with OPM but you\u2019d have to check the others yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlanet packs which replace the stock system also exist- Galileo\u2019s planet pack, Beyond Home and JNSQ are some examples. Don\u2019t install those and open a save using the stock system, bad things will happen to your active crafts. GOP and BH are very different to the stock system and both have a second star (Grannus for GPP, white dwarf Kerbol for BH), but JNSQ is a redesigned and expanded stock system with a 2.7x rescale to make the game considerably harder due to the increased delta-V; if you want to try the real solar system, JNSQ is a good stepping stone to get used to the higher speeds and greater distances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are planet packs that add new solar systems as well- Grannus can be added as a standalone secondary system, for example. Some system replaced planet packs e.g. GPP also have patches to make them secondary systems instead of replacing the stock system and these can be combined, some\u00A0by design-\u00A0GPP and Grannus are designed to work together with either of them as the primary star or with Ciro\u00A0orbiting the stock system and Grannus orbiting Ciro, and there\u2019s a patch to upscale the Grannus system as a secondary star for JNSQ.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor any planet pack, you\u2019ll need to install Kopernicus for it to work. Kopernicus is version-locked to a specific version of KSP and won\u2019t work in other versions so make sure you get the right one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you just want to add some planets to the stock system, OPM is a good choice\u00A0and MPE can add more to the stock-scale Sol system feel with various analogs to real objects in the Solar system. If you\u2019re prepared to start a new save (copy the whole of KSP first!) a system replacement can be good fun and bring new challenges; a rescaled system is more difficult but also more rewarding when you succeed at the same tasks that are easier in the stock system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless you\u2019ve been playing KSP for a while and really know what you\u2019re doing, I advise against jumping into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and realism overhaul etc., there\u2019s a huge difference between stock KSP and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-1;\u00A0that being said, the greater challenges can also be much more rewarding- I\u2019m playing an RP-1 career game right now and it\u2019s good fun to land probes on the Moon a whole year before the real Sputnik 1 ever flew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-31T09:40:19Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2021 09:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by jimmymcgoochie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
