KSP on console is just a money grab. We get half the content at full price. Nice one. No extra work is going to go into making KSP a good and fun game to play on console like it is on PC. This game is about mods. The mods section of this forum is the most popular. There is a modding Monday. If you own a console though, too bad, you get a buggy, old, broken game, with little to no support. This game should have never released on console if they were going to treat it and us like this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-22T14:33:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167310-chimpbone/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022167310\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167310-chimpbone/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@chimpbone\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Sony and Microsoft aren\u0027t going to permit arbitrary DLLs on their platforms, full stop.
