Things like how many intakes/engine to get the best out of my jets befor eorbit, how much rocket fuel to jet fuel proportions, how many jets/total mass of ssto, ect. Any help is appreciated, and while i do not mind pictures and stuff, i do not want to just copy someone\u0027s ssto, i prefer to make it myself, i just would liek to know how to make it as optimized as possible (without making it look like utter crap with intakes all over it).

I can\u0027t really help you there since I wouldn\u0027t want to make an interplanetary single-stage. Space is space though, whatever sort of vehicle you do it with; the basic figure for Laythe is 4,360m/s each way, including orbital insertion but aerobraking can reduce that a lot and the good news is there are plenty of options for aerobraking in the Jool system as well as around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to design for worst-case and would probably go for a (space) requirement of at least 8km/s but wouldn\u0027t be surprised if those that go to Laythe more often suggested a figure half that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wyre311","CreatedById":125446,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T20:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96406-The-Arcadia-series-and-the-Zeus-Ships?highlight=Arcadia\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96406-The-Arcadia-series-and-the-Zeus-Ships?highlight=Arcadia\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMine can make it to duna after a refuel in orbit.
