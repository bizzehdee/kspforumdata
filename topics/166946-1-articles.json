So, I\u0027m watching Expedition Unknown and one segment had a balloon launched to near space (100,00 ft). an experiment package took a sample and was later analyzed for signs of life. Of course they might have found some. The claim was made that life cannot get that high in the atmosphere on its own. Therefore any life found must have come from out there. My mind immediately starts debunking this claim. The balloon that carried the package probably was crawling with microbes even if the experiment was shielded.\u00A0\u00A0It could also come from one of the many objects we mere mortals have lobbed into space. Maybe even volcanic eruptions or some other natural occurring though rare event. Point being there seems to be too many assumptions in what was being stated in the segment. I felt this way a few years ago when it was claimed there was algae on the exterior of the ISS windows.
