In reality you want to plan your approach to overshoot the target, i.e. keep your retrograde\u00A0 marker closer to the horizon than the target retrograde marker. Now push your retrograde marker around the navball: when far away you can just burn retrograde; when it looks like you overshoot too far then burn closer to the horizon; when it looks like you will fall short then burn closer to straight up. (Note: when firing your engines you will push the retrograde marker \u0022away\u0022 from the center of the navball == the direction your engines push you.)
