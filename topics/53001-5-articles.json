One temporary workaround I\u0027ve found that seems to work is to quit and restart KSP once I get to one of the stable points in the mission (landed, or in a stable orbit - basically any of the places this challenge allows you to type commands). After the restart I then continue the mission where I left off. But to use this fix, of course I have to be able to save and reload the persistence file, which in turn triggers the other bug in KOS about failing to load the craft from on-rails if there\u0027s any variables in its saved state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I have to do to make this work and to work around those bugs, is to manually edit the persistence file and remove the variables context (effectively clearing the memory of the KOS SCS unit) before reloading the game. If you do that you can avoid the bug and get it to reload the craft correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce a variable is set there\u0027s no way to unset it, so there\u0027s no way around this bug other than editing the persistence file, and there\u0027s no command in KOS that seems to clear the variables out - shutdown doesn\u0027t do it and reboot doesn\u0027t do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I can understand that editing the persistence file would normally be a cheat, but can an exception be made for this purpose and this purpose only - to be allowed to edit the persistence file to clear the variables so you can reload the saved game and continue your mission from where you left off? (Provided this is only done when your mission is at one of the states during which the challenge rules would allow you to type manual commands.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy desire to be able to come back and continue the mission isn\u0027t just for the sake of the stuttering bug, by the way. It\u0027s also because I want to make a video of it and when I start getting into interplanetary missions that makes it into too long of a video capture session for me to want to fit it all into one go. It would make quite a long raw footage of a few hours, which will eat up lots of disk space. I\u0027d rather make a few separate videos of half an hour each rather than one enormous hour and a half video. That allows me to compress the raw footage down and save disk space before going on to the next part. And then I\u0027d be able to go back and edit out the boring parts or speed them up, and re-combine those separate videos into one. But at least I wouldn\u0027t have to temporarily store an hour and a half of raw uncompressed footage as an intermediate step, which is what I\u0027d do if I captured the entire mission in one go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sacred Aardvark","CreatedById":85856,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T13:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy .02$: Sounds legit, I\u0027d allow it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobnova","CreatedById":75385,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T15:45:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI played with this a bit before leaving on a business trip, I can get to orbit and back easily, I have no clue how Y\u0027all are doing the maneuver node testing inside kOS, my eventual entry will likely be hard coded entirely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any event, expect an entry of sorts from me next week, and thanks for having this challenge! kOS has turned out to be a lot of fun, and I\u0027d never have checked it out workout the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T21:56:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this challenge, in addition to being fun, has also turned out to be quite USEFUL to the development of KOS itself.

I say that because I can see a potential problem with opening it up entirely to ANY possible future mod that might be made which happens to have a hook for KOS to call, because then if, say, Mechjeb adds a few KOS calls you could have Mechjeb installed. Such a rule could become a backdoor into allowing someone to pretty much ignore KOS and instead write a Mod that controls the mission from the C# code, and have that mod create a hook to allow a KOS script to trigger the Mod\u0027s code and have the Mod\u0027s code actually doing the work rather than KOSscript doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess on a similar note, maybe a rule should be added to require that the mission has to work using only an official release of KOS (but perhaps an older release is allowed), rather than something compiled from a personal private fork of the github code, for the same reason - someone could fork KOS and then write their own C# solutions to things that aren\u0027t in the main release for others to use. This is more for the repeatability of the test by others than anything else. Granted, at the moment because Kevin isn\u0027t around to merge pull requests back into the main releases this means having to avoid using any of the fixes people have made for things, but the alternative to allow anyone to use any fork of KOS they made would be too hard to control and keep the challenge fair.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adammada","CreatedById":29884,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T12:20:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s another rules question that\u0027s coming up in my case because I\u0027m trying to make an interplanetary Duna mission and there\u0027s a lot of steps and it\u0027s triggering a problem in KOS itself (I *think*) that I can\u0027t do anything about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing my scripts previously used for Minmus -\u0026gt; Mun fly i could fly to Duna and havent noticed issues.
