As you can see in the pictures below it has 3 sets of swept wings on top of the craft, the longest set having 3 engines on each side. The craft Can be flown with only one pair of engines going, although it won\\\u0027t be going too fast. The recommended is having all three pairs running (more speed!).\n\nThe craft, for it\\\u0027s size, is rather maneuverable.\n\nTo land just find a big open, flat piece of land and land as you normally would. Except try not coming down as hard, the plane\\\u0027s a rather fragile thing when landing.\n\n**Screenshots:** \n\nFront-view in SPH: \n\n\u003E ![EwPKn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EwPKn.jpg)\n\nBack-view in SPH: \n\n\u003E ![SFqWL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SFqWL.jpg)\n\nAfter takeoff: \n\n\u003E ![TX7it.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TX7it.jpg)\n\nFlying between the water tower and launch tower: \n\n\u003E ![TXBQM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TXBQM.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T00:34:15Z","Content":"Uhm,\n\nits,\n\nBig.\n\nWell,\n\nit flies! \n\n(mine usually dont work :-[)"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T00:40:26Z","Content":"From my perspective, having that amount of engines is just wasteful as these aircraft. The main reason (renember, this is my perspective, not everyones) for having a large craft is more fuel (therefore longer range), if you have that amount of engines, your actually losing range for not much more speed (then there is a whole other topic of engines and dead weight)."},{"CreatedByName":"DeadlyPear","CreatedById":9606,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T01:15:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E From my perspective, having that amount of engines is just wasteful as these aircraft.
