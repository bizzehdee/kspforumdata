As you can see in the pictures below it has 3 sets of swept wings on top of the craft, the longest set having 3 engines on each side. The craft Can be flown with only one pair of engines going, although it won\\\u0027t be going too fast. The recommended is having all three pairs running (more speed!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft, for it\\\u0027s size, is rather maneuverable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo land just find a big open, flat piece of land and land as you normally would.
