If G-forces applied on the craft is high enough it could dislocate the parts (sometimes causing it to slam on another part, explosively). An easy fix is autostrutting or put a strut (it\u0027s not 100% fixing it, but can minimize the effect)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Backslashjack","CreatedById":198656,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-06T17:00:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is not what is going on here... These parts are not under any extreme stress or anything. and btw pieces have NEVER just moved on me in ksp, ever!
