When I started running 1.1.x on Windows 10 I had an unbearable amount of crashes. I tired 32 and 64 bit versions of the game. 64 seemed worse ironically. All over the game too not just in the VAB or staging but all over. Then some helpful individual (sorry don\u0027t recall his name) recommended setting the properties of the .exe shortcut to run in windows 7 compatibility mode. That was the magic bullet for the most part for me. That game still crashes on occasion but the occurrence rate has decreased 99% as a result. The only time the game crashes for me now is during staging, especially asparagus style, on large rockets but only once out of every 10 launches maybe with huge builds only.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I am about to say is not meant to urinate on anyone but just my two cents. I believe that 99% of these issues are Unity related. When you try to be the jack of all trades, like Unity attempts to be, then you are a master of none.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-15T18:51:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2016 06:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Brian444444\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
