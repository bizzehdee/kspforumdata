So I made a nice long fuselage, then started sticking wings on. I may have gone a little overboard with the wings. It lands at less than 40 m/s, and it takes off before I think to watch what speed it takes off at. It cruises around 13km and flies at over 300 m/s; due to the positive AOA I have on the wings for it to fly completely level the nose actually has to be pointed downward at about 2\u00C2\u00BA. This thing also has insane glide capabilities. The only problem is that it maybe should have slightly more vertical stabilizer area to help prevent side slip, but it really isn\\\u0027t bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two versions attached, one with a MechJeb attached, and one that is completely stock in 0.15.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly morning take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ovMHz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ovMHz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing in for a landing on the other side of the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iOtUc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iOtUc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI kind of forgot to get pictures of the plane on the ground on the other side of the ocean and taking off again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere it is coming in for a landing back at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1JVIr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221JVIr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the insane gliding capabilities of this thing I just barely managed to touchdown and stay on the runway.
