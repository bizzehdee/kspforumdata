In general, the aims of the project were to see if it was possible to build such a thing at all and get some useful functionality out of it. After all, if they could derive important information from such a Stone Age thing, it might help bootstrap Kerbal scientific progress after another supernova inevitably wipes the slate clean again. Moho was chosen as the test site because 1) it\u0027s got a very good view of Kerbol, 2) it has no atmosphere to screw up observations, 3) it\u0027s eccentric and inclined orbit might make for interesting observations, and 4) it\u0027s day being a significant fraction of its year makes Kerbol move very slowly across its sky, aiding accurate observations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo EPIKFAIL funded a huge monstrosity of a ship, capable of carrying a large construction crew of 7 Kerbals and scads of building material, and sent it off to Moho. They decided an equaltorial location would be best to start with, to eliminate some of the variables associated with latitude, and originally wanted to go for the highest ground they could find. However, all the high ground was too rough--they needed a fairly large flat area. So in the end there was nothing for it but to land in an equatorial crater, essentially leaving the choice of longitude up to chance.

This provided valuable data on Moho\u0027s orbital parameters, such as its inclination and eccentricity. It also helped establish Moho\u0027s position in its orbit at any given time, relative to its ascending and descending nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther useful observations were that the relative amounts of daylight and darkness varied over time, instead of being the constant number listed in the almagest. This again helped calculate Moho\u0027s eccentricity and it\u0027s position relative to its LAN. Also, it was noted that most of the seasonal variation in Kerbol\u0027s position in the sky happened during its transit, so that it wobbled in an S-like pattern across the Sacred Strut of background stars along the ecliptic. And all the while, Kerbol\u0027s position relative to various background constellations changed noticeably during the course of a Moho day. Using this data, the boffins at EPIKFAIL were able to develop a solar calendar for Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the pic below, you can use the menhir code to see how the position of sunset has changed so far during the mission.

But there was 1 more thing to do. Now that no further sightings were necessary, it was decided to build the central menhir up to a height of 4 stones, so that it could serve as the gnomon of a sundial.

All except for Fredke, now known as the Keeper of Mo-Henge 1. What\u0027s the point of having an observatory if you don\u0027t have an astronomer on staff? Besides, EPIKFAIL needed somebody to verify the accuracy or not of the placement of Sunset Menhir 1:3 as noted above, however long that takes.

EPIKFAIL was happy with the results although the rest of Kerbalkind doesn\u0027t seem to care.

Being on the equator, it\u0027s necessarily going to be a bit linear. But having established this as a baseline, EPIKFAIL is even now contemplating building Mo-Hinge 2 at a higher latitude, perhaps even above the arctic circle.
