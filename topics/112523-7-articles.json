They will heat up very quickly (this is by design). The amount of energy being transferred is independent of how \u0027glowy\u0027 something is. The amount of heat moved will always net zero (i.e. if I pull 100 internal flux from part A, I dump 100 into the radiators). And your docking ports (or any other interceding part) are irrelevant since they are assumed to have internal heat pipes to move the heat around from hot spots to the radiators. \n\nSide note... they work fine. \n\nMy test craft (a simple ship with quad nervs) without radiators exploded spectacularly at about 12 minutes into it\u0027s burn. With radiators deployed, this was dramatically extended (I got tired of watching it at around 20 minutes). Now... everything was super glowy (the nukes won\u0027t start trying to dump heat till they are very hot, and the surrounding bits were warm) but the radiators were able to cope with the heat and dump it into space due to their high emmissive value and large surface area.\n\n(edit: make that 30 minutes of watching.. and it looks like the radiators are keeping up with the nervs even at full throttle)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T02:20:48Z","Content":"Mind tossing me the test craft you used?
