That way, at least we\u0027d be able to add extra vessels to scan faster, instead of using MOAR TIMEWARP, the difference being that the latter can much more easily get in the way of doing other things in KSP other than scanning, while the former much less so.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-19T08:19:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2014 08:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by phoenix_ca\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T13:25:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, I\u0060m failing to be able to bring up the debug menu.
