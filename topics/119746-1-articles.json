The 2 kerbal version can capture orbit around mun/minmus to likewise dock and refuel so it has met its design goals. It handles really well at speed and on empty landing and it looks really sleek when you see the cross section.

Also for best dV it is a matter of reducing cosine loss from high Angles of Attack. So typically an ascent would start with running off the end of the runway, pitch up to between 5 and 10 degrees, lower for lower TWR, reach 400ms and then keep ascending to 10000m by which time you should be doing 1000ms already and then it\u0027s just a matter of tweaking your ascent velocity to keep it from blowing up and stay on air as long as possible to achieve the highest speed. Any big pitch changes cost you dV. Also wing inclination to body helps, a LOT. I only found out how much recently, makes me want to go back and redesign everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegeas","CreatedById":109879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T00:06:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rune\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rune\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, this is a bit tricky on account of being quite draggy, but it has a relatively \u0022comfortable\u0022 TWR of about 0.7 with the maximum recommended payload (10mT).
