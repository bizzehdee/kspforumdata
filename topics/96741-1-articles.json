Their metrics have different signatures. Both are flat, yes, but you shouldn\u0027t confuse the term \u0022Eucledian\u0022 to simply mean \u0022flat\u0022. The space-time of General Relativity is a Pseudo-Riemannian Manifold. That means that while it isn\u0027t necessarily flat, you can always take a small enough region of space that locally it behaves just like Minkowski space. This is why any principle that applies in Special Relativity globally must apply to General Relativity locally. Speed of light is a global limit in SR, but a local one in GR. Causality is globally enforced in SR, but only locally in GR. And so on.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith partial regards to locality vs global-ness of causality in SR vs. GR, I\u0027ve been meaning to ask you something. As a hard-SF worldbuilder, I\u0027ve been searching around for information to make sense of an FTL system that doesn\u0027t cause time travel, as opposed to simply not violating causality, but I\u0027ve only been able to find scattered information and the best lead I\u0027ve had so far has been the Orion\u0027s Arm universe with its interpretation of wormholes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I understood through Orion\u0027s Arm, wormholes are the only realistic FTL method that can prevent time travel when traveling back and forth between two points in space, to an extent; because the wormhole creates sort of a single link/tunnel between two points in space and time that stays open - if that makes sense - while an FTL \u0022drive\u0022 system such as Alcubierre would need to \u0022tunnel\u0022 both ways, once by activating the drive to get to the destination, and once by activating the drive to return to the spacecraft\u0027s origin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wormhole\u0027s advantage here is limited by the possibility of moving one or more mouths so as to create a tunnel into the past, but this is prevented in the OA universe by the wormhole immediately destroying itself by self-detonation if it becomes a time machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I understand from \u003Ca href=\u0022forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76174-Alternative-to-chemical-engines-warp?p=1090314#post1090314\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea reply you wrote last year\u003C/a\u003E that using an Alcubierre drive to travel faster than light technically doesn\u0027t violate causality, you seemed to indicate that using it could still send its user into the past, albeit an alternate one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve read it suggested that a hyperadvanced system might be put into place so as to specifically target, \u0022grab\u0022, and prevent FTL vessels from traveling in a way that would cause time travel; the author Charles Stross uses it in his \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_Sky\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESingularity Sky\u003C/a\u003E universe, in the form of the \u0022Eschaton\u0022, a superintelligent computer and FTL traffic controller.

In this situation, the billiard ball emerges from the future at a different angle than the one used to generate the paradox, and delivers its younger self a glancing blow instead of knocking it completely away from the wormhole, a blow which changes its trajectory in just the right way so that it will travel back in time with the angle required to deliver its younger self this glancing blow. Echeverria and Klinkhammer actually found that there was more than one self-consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each case.
