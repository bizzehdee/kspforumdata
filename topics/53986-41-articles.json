This is an awesome addon package and, though it\u0027s a lot more difficult, I\u0027m having a LOT of fun. I don\u0027t have a lot of experience with most of these mods... played mostly stock until now. I\u0027ve had some issues with remote tech2, but I was able to find solutions in it\u0027s thread.

I haven\u0027t progressed very far). When I go to retrieve the vessel from the space center, I get the science points, but it I can\u0027t recover the vehicle or the kerbal. If I go back and control it, the kerbal and the pod are both spinning out of control. I have to exit the game, then re-enter the game to retrieve the kerbal and pod. It\u0027s like, things don\u0027t stop moving, or start moving again when they have already stopped (and they usually begin moving quite violently).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Also, is there a way to turn down the water effects a little? Whenever a pod lands in the water, it moves around so much, it\u0027s impossible to go back to the space center to recover it. It always says I have to revert back to the previous save... therefor, anytime a pod lands in the water, it\u0027s lost and I lose all the science I\u0027ve earned as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really enjoying the challenge of this package, but it\u0027s been a little frustrating.
