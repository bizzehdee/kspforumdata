They weight some 12 tons, so they shouldn\u0027t be too hard to deliver to their destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a small monopropellant tank between the lander can and the lower docking port. The structural panels help protect the FT-400 fuel tanks - they can be removed to get some additional delta-v, at the risk of blowing one of the tanks while moving around and getting stranded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe action groups are set as 1 to toggle the solar panels and 2 to toggle all the ladders. Regarding ladders, your kerbonaut will be stuck trying to move down the ladder from the landing can, but you can let go of the ladder without the risk of destroying the engine below. Climbing the ladder works without any issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first set of decouplers jettison the wheels, making the craft lighter for ascend. The second set jettisons the fuel tanks, goo and material labs, so make sure you collect all the science from them before staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload as a subassembly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://mega.co.nz/#!4VcnCTqY!npSZzXIQbU9GlVbVNnNl5v6UHZEFFitxHpIqYUEf27A\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://mega.co.nz/#!4VcnCTqY!npSZzXIQbU9GlVbVNnNl5v6UHZEFFitxHpIqYUEf27A\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as a ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://mega.co.nz/#!BBkgVaBQ!aDe1l-IvQwy5LeeciLkkC2yrmu4BIkl_7YQiVByQNV8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://mega.co.nz/#!BBkgVaBQ!aDe1l-IvQwy5LeeciLkkC2yrmu4BIkl_7YQiVByQNV8\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T22:01:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere I have four of them stacked on top of a booster\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i57.tinypic.com/vwwzus.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vwwzus.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do need lots of struts, though\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i60.tinypic.com/k3k6j4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k3k6j4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with moar struts, it can be done\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i57.tinypic.com/e19qpy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022e19qpy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T22:28:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like a lot of work went into this man, \u002Brep for you,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will have to try them out, i do not have a good system of transporting rovers atm (Not a massive fan of rockets lol)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T00:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks! It\u0027s really the result of a lot of gameplay and failed or not entirely successful attempts to pack several landers in a single ship. They are still somewhat hard to put in orbit due wobbling - they really have to be attached with lots of struts, and the booster I\u0027ve used should have used more powerful reaction wheels. But it\u0027s doable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for packing them in SSTOs, no idea. I didn\u0027t build them for that. Maybe they can be mounted in one of B9 large cargo bays or a custom made one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is the matter of a mission profile for this. The exploration of Jool smaller moons seems an obvious one. They can also be used to hit biomes in the Mun or Minmus in a single launch, but they require some later technology. The wheels can be replaced by the earlier model in that case I guess. They can also be useful for Fine Print rover contracts: put them in orbit and keep dropping them near the nav points, doing science on the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding in a rover also allows a bit more activity than \u0022landing, planting the flag, doing experiments and going back\u0022 as it\u0027s easier to add a \u0022drive around\u0022 to the mix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m wondering if they could take off from Duna. Maybe that would require replacing the 48-7s for aerospikes, adding more parachutes and maybe a few drop tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
