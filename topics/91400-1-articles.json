But I have an issue. I\u0027ll send that central truss section up to orbit and it\u0027ll be fine, I\u0027ll go and dock one of the engines to it and it\u0027ll be fine. Now here\u0027s where it gets interesting, I\u0027ll dock the second engine on there and it\u0027ll be fine for a bit. However after some time (be it saving and going to sleep and coming back the next morning, or launching the next component up to dock) only one of the engines will start to randomly vibrate then explode, with the other following after another save. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDebug console doesn\u0027t say anything but \u0022Structural failure on connection between Fusion Reactor and Generator\u0022. I\u0027ve got a fair amount of other mods, but the ones I have on that particular vessel are KSP Interstellar, RemoteTech (just the parts without remotetech.dll because I don\u0027t feel like setting up a comms network in a sandbox game), DMagic\u0027s Orbital Science, MechJeb, and a neat station parts pack I found on Curse that I\u0027m forgetting the name of at this time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, another interesting thing that happens is after I dock the second engine unit (both of which are the same mass), the camera focuses not on what should be the centre of mass, but a few meters to one side or another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, hope we can figure this out together. If you need more infos or clarification, please feel free to let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
