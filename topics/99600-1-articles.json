I\u0027ve played since .18 and not once have I ever felt like the game itself was pushing me to make explosions and catastrophe happen. It HAS been embraced by the community though as a byproduct of the learning and experimentation process, because it just is. If you don\u0027t want to focus on exploding things, that\u0027s good, and that\u0027s your thing. But if another player, or even lots of other players do want to focus on exploding things, then it\u0027s got nothing to do with you, nor your enjoyment of your own experience. It\u0027s not like SQUAD is adding weaponry, or contests for the biggest explosion or most Kerbals lost in space. It\u0027s not like they\u0027re adding just random explosions of craft as a gimmick, either. That WOULD be toxic, and wouldn\u0027t be a good game.
