The IP guarantees a solid Base of customers that will buy the Game instantly at any state because they are longing for the sequel. so why not cash in for some bucks if they lay abroad and the risk is nearly Zero ? Set the Price for EA to 50 Bucks because you need that first rush until the Fans notice whats going on (or not, in that case)....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts a simple calculation: evaluate the fanbase that will instantly buy the game if it comes out (i guess there are people in the offices that can do that) , evaluate the costs of hyping the game, evaluating the costs of buying the IP \u002B recycling the codebase and the coders. Summarice that up and you will have a fixed date when the game has to be published to generate a pre calculated return of investment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you go into an apple shop, they will sell you a charging cable for a few bucks, even if the shop can not run on that income, its a side business thats generates some minor income too. Why wasting the possibilities of a few safe bucks ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
