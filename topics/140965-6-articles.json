The evidence is based upon a red algae fossil that looks like a modern red algae. There is also the assumption that the the algae\u00A0mated sexually. \u00A0In any case if life first firmed 3.8 to 4.2 billion years ago and sexually reproducing life appears 1.0 to 1.2 million years ago and the cambrian\u00A0is closer 0.540 then the greatest growth of complexity is closer to the cambrian that to bioneogenesis.

It rather prefers the strong males and pretty female, things that today are highly influenced by cultural criteria. In times when population was thinner and people wandered in tribes it\u0027s more probabel that mixture between other groups was favored. The guys and gals of the other tribe must have been sexier than the ones they saw every day. It is assumed that in interglacials in the european ice age tribes met from to time to exchange their members and thus genome. In high glacial times they went through genetic bottlenecks. (Africa was different)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a misunderstanding: assuming that peace came with diversion and domestication came out of pressure. The contrary is the case: there are no (maybe one) hint of intraspecies violence in the lower stone age (until ~15.000 before now), but with the emergence of settlement there comes battle and killing. Pressure was not the reason of domestocation, it was the outcome. There was no reason for the start of plant growing and 1000yrs later domestication. It could as well have happened 110.000yrs earlier, in the OIS 5e, when climate was even better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: before someone else points out: i was very fuzzy with \u0022lower stone age\u0022 and 15.000yrs. Don\u0027t nail me to the cross, there is no lower stone age in europe (let\u0027s say Palaeolithic) and the 15.000yrs are arbitrary, in fact the first known remains of battle are much younger.
