The third picture shows where the center of mass normally is.\n\nAlso adding mass shifts the center of lift towards the mass. Is this a FAR thing?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T21:22:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OddFunction**"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T21:24:49Z","Content":"The COM moving is probably just because wings are fairly heavy, but the COL not moving back with the wing in the rear position doesn\u0027t look right.
