Now I want to expand this into some full-blown orbital infrastructure and launch all interplanetary missions from Minmus in the future (if possible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if I could use a gravity assist off Mun to aid in the escape from Kerbin\u0027s gravity well. At first glance, I see two options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:upper-alpha;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPass behind Mun (more than once if necessary) to increase orbital velocity directly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPass ahead of Mun to enter a highly eccentric orbit, then make good use of the Oberth Effect with a direct escape burn \u0026lt;100km above Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption B looks like it might use more delta-V, but it also looks a whole lot easier (indeed, I\u0027m not sure that A is even possible). The two would additionally have wildly different ejection vectors to consider (although that might be a good thing to keep my options open within individual launch windows).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve calculated (you might want to check my math) that Mun passes directly between Kerbin and Minmus every 159570.67 seconds (1 day 20 hours 19 minutes 30.7 seconds), so that\u0027s the period for launch windows. Minmus\u0027s rotation only takes it 0.8217243 rad (relative to Kerbol) in this time, though, so that may limit which interplanetary launch windows can be accessed through this method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther questions I have involve how best to embark from Minmus itself, including which direction to rotate around the planet, whether it would be better to start from low orbit or a high orbit resonant with the launch window, and (if I start from high orbit) whether it would be better to burn inwards first to use the Oberth Effect or to just escape Minmus directly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-02T23:30:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2013 11:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by COL_Tatticky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T23:27:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA possible problem of using Minmus as your starting point is that it\u0027s in an inclined orbit which may not work to your advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"COL_Tatticky","CreatedById":79626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T23:42:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA possible problem of using Minmus as your starting point is that it\u0027s in an inclined orbit which may not work to your advantage.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHm...
