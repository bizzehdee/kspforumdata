Given what little you described, I\u0027m willing to bet it\u0027s the former - the rocket design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket design is tricky stuff, with lots of counter-intuitive things going on that, in the end, affect your ability to complete the mission. So here are some tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Get rid of all non-essential empty mass. Why? Math, that\u0027s why! (Don\u0027t worry I won\u0027t bore you with rocket science equations, just the layman\u0027s end results...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe math tells us that for every bit of extra non-fuel mass we take with us, our Delta-V (a fancy word describing what, in the end, our rockets can actually do) goes down. Basically, the more \u0022junk\u0022 you bring, the less far you can go - and the more likely you are going to be stuck half-way there without any fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. In a multi-stage mission, each and every stage \u003Cem\u003Emust be able to complete its task\u003C/em\u003E without relying on fuel from later stages. If any stage can\u0027t do this - it\u0027s time to redesign that stage (and likely any stages before it to account for the change).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractically, this means that if your ascent stage is meant to get your Mun ship into Kerbin orbit all by itself, but you end up having to use some fuel from your Mun ship to finish getting into orbit around Kerbin - your ascent stage is incorrectly designed. Make sure that each stage can do its job without help from a later stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat might get you started for now, if you have more specific questions, ask here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T18:44:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere are you in the tree?

The three BACCs have plenty enough thrust on their own I reckon. You don\u0027t want to go too fast on the ascent or you waste fuel fighting drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, if you just want to orbit the Mun and Minmus, you don\u0027t need much at all. A spacecraft consisting of the parachute, Mk 1 pod, FL-T200 tank and LV-909 is more than enough to get from low Kerbin orbit to Munar, Minmus, and even Duna orbit and back. Key is to get it into LKO without using its own fuel. The rocket you\u0027ve shown would do the job I reckon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T02:45:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like to develop my lander, transfer craft, and booster separately and in that order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo what dust says but add 15-20% more because you\u0027re just learning how to fly these things and you\u0027ll be happy for the extra fuel and error room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lighter the lander the better off you are. You want to use engines that have an ISP of 370 or better and still give you a TWR of 2 or better on the Mun. Less and flying it is very difficult and not forgiving of error. You can land with enough deltaV and a TWR that is just north of 1... but hard. Keep in mind too though your TWR being too high makes controlling your landing velocity very difficult because you\u0027re sitting in a little sliver at the very bottom of your throttle just tapping the engine on. Which btw, if you bind \u0022toggle engine\u0022 to your brakes action group, you can shut down your engines by right clicking on them then when you hit your brakes button it will turn on your engines at the current throttle setting for as long as you hold the button down then shut them down again instantly when you release (just like hitting the x button, but you don\u0027t need to keep throttling up either you can tap the engines if you need). Sometimes its a handy way to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the squatter you can build your lander the better off you are. Tall and skinny likes to fall over. Squat ones tend to fall into position. If you\u0027re having trouble falling over put a SAS unit as low on the lander as you can then the torque will help keep you in position. (Also set toggle ladder to your action group with your landing gear toggle. It\u0027s handy.). It\u0027s also nice to put a MK1 light facing directly down so you can get an idea of your altitude visually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T03:28:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022helaeon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022helaeon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKeep in mind too though your TWR being too high makes controlling your landing velocity very difficult because you\u0027re sitting in a little sliver at the very bottom of your throttle just tapping the engine on.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get around this by right-clicking on the engine and setting the throttle limiter.
