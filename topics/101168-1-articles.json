As mentioned above, put the jets in a separate stage from launch clamps and give them a bit to spool up. If you use KER watch for TWR=1.0 to release the clamps.\n\nTry this:\n\n1. Start with an Engine Nacelle or Radial Engine Body.\n2. Add a tricoupler and 3 Basic Jets.\n3. Add 8 radial intakes, because the nacelle includes one. There\u0027s enough space to do this without part clipping.\n4. If you\u0027re not averse to mods, the Intake Build Aid really helps to balance the intake-to-engine mapping.\n\nTotal mass of this unit is 3.7 tons, lift capacity is an additional 41.3 tons. The 40 units of fuel in the nacelle should propel you to 450 m/s at 20km or so where you\u0027d run out of air anyway, so there\u0027s no wasted fuel mass when it\u0027s time to jettison. A bit pricey at 15k Kerbucks but it\u0027s a handy modular first stage.

Total cost is about 22k Kerbucks and each hybrid booster delivers 5 tons to LKO.
