Doing a typical gravity turn always failed due to lack of speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat seemed to work was moving sideways as soon as possible. Basically I would tilt my rocket over slightly and while I would move even slower vertically, my horizontal speed would increase greatly and would even accelerate at a decent speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that even though you\u0027re accelerating at a fraction of a meter per second per second vertically, you\u0027re accelerating much much faster horizontally, and because you spend more time in the lower atmosphere, your air breathers get more life out of them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does take a considerable amount of time, but in my experience I\u0027m starting to gain altitude at a decent rate and I\u0027m already moving vertically pretty fast so I point my rocket 5-20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 above the horizon and I have no problem getting into orbit even with a twr ~1.1\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T00:00:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know this is considered answered, but I did a no-upgrades career 18t Manned Mun landing using Jet Engines as an initial stage.
