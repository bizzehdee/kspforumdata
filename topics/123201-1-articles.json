I may have crashed once using 64 bit. Now that 64 bit is unsupported and I am forced to use 32 bit, the game crashes after up to 5 flights, but usually only 1 or 2. A decent amount of the all instances of KSP, I cannot enter the any of the buildings no matter what I do. Even with building shortcuts, I cannot enter buildings. KSP 64 never had any problems excluding the loading screen being the Astronaut Complex, sometimes being unable to right click parts in flight, and the weird desktop mouse glitch that you solve by right-clicking. I could run KSP 64 bit using far more mods than I can run KSP 32 bit. I am just wondering when KSP will support having more than 2 mods without crashing more than Crysis on a computer from 1742 again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not hate KSP. I just hate 32 bit KSP, and am wondering how many years it should take for 64 bit to be allowed again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T22:51:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.1 or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117224-Windows-64-bit-community-workaround\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enow\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T23:18:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually for me the bigger issue is performance.
