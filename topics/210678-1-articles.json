Setting up low-consumption flight paths is hard and time consuming and players should be rewarded for pulling it off. It\u0027s pro-problem-solving and anti-grind game design. Might not be absolutely realistic, but it\u0027s an acceptable abstraction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n____\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome hiccups with the Abstract Network though:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say you have a colony Alpha producing 100 widgets/launch window. You want to ship these widgets to colony Bravo, but Alpha doesn\u0027t have the best shipbuilding infrastructure yet and can only build and launch a small ship carrying 10 widgets. So you do that, and save it as a delivery route: 10 widgets, Alpha -\u0026gt; Bravo. Cool...\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut once you\u0027ve established that as a delivery route, in principle there\u0027s no reason why you couldn\u0027t multiply it. \u0022Hey, Alpha, just send ten of those same ships per launch window, okay?\u0022 10 widgets, Alpha -\u0026gt; Bravo, x10. Now you have all 100 widgets going from Alpha to Bravo per launch window, despite Alpha\u0027s low state of development.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is how things might work in real life, with Starships colonizing Mars for example. Hundreds or thousands of Starships could be loaded and staged in LEO, then depart all at once in flotillas every two years. But is that fair in the game? Should there be a button in the Delivery UI to duplicate export shipments up to the maximum a colony could support? Maybe, but it would obviate the need to launch bigger delivery ships, which would eliminate that as a design challenge for the player. I\u0027m sure bigger ships could be more efficient and replace the smaller ones later, but still...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, so let\u0027s say you don\u0027t include a multiplier button. Well now you\u0027ve just incentivized the player to manually launch 10 identical low-tech transport ships, stash them in orbit, then have them all burn for their destination in one launch window. That\u0027s the same as doing the first delivery route x10, just grindier. Might as well give the player their route multiplier button back and save them the trouble.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMining missions have this issue too. If a colony sends out a rover to dig up and return 100 ore from a nearby deposit, can the player just... do it again and make 200 ore? Then 300 and so on until their colony has an unreasonable income due to grind? What\u0027s the launch window for a mining mission? Nearby craters don\u0027t have synodic periods.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne option is to simply restrict the number of abstract delivery routes from any colony A to any colony B to 1 ship per window. This is quite unrealistic of course, but now all of the trade from Alpha to Bravo depends on \u003Cem\u003Eone \u003C/em\u003Eship design and \u003Cem\u003Eone \u003C/em\u003Eflight plan, which seems in the spirit of the game as a rocket design and astrogation challenge. The amount of resources transferrable from Alpha to Bravo depends on the player\u0027s design of one ship for that purpose, and larger more ambitious designs are incentivized to maximize payload.\u00A0It simplifies things a bit further too, in that there\u0027s now only one route to be replaced if the player launches a new mission to update it; there won\u0027t be a mess of different ship designs going from A to B to keep track of. Resource locations could also function as \u0022colonies\u0022 for this purpose, so players will need to make their mining missions count.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, this creates the problem of having to constantly design new ships to update your delivery routes as your colonies grow, which is its own brand of grind.

It also still incentivizes more efficient production, as better ships consume less resources per unit of cargo, enabling the same colony to transport more materials. It ends up with the best of both worlds; very little to no grind, with incentives for ship building and flying for those who enjoy that. Also, since we have no central resource conversion, colonies that shift their purposes in the late game (like going from a mining station to a resource deposit) will need to have the option to drastically shift their route production, and flying a hundred missions for dozens of colonies just to rebalance the network falls beyond my personal line.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vortygont","CreatedById":223549,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-20T21:30:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll say a thought that\u0027s already been said here.

The route you flew manually, of course, must be repeated under certain conditions, such as a certain relative position of the planets, the orbital parameters of the target and the availability of a certain amount of necessary resources.

But looking to realism does help for balance, as physical limitations already are \u0027balanced\u0027 in a sense? So having artifical limits (like supply route limits) inspired off of physical ones seems like a good place to start. I believe the original argument was along the lines of whats stopping you from just making a basic colony and clicking duplicate supply route indefinitely with a wheel attached to a mining drill and a chair.\u00A0 Since we know population is based off some kind of milestone, it can be a way to limit supply routes based off progression. Another way would be the facilities to support supply routes like ports and storage and fuel production, forcing you to improve your colony and thus making tiny supply ships redundant in the process.
