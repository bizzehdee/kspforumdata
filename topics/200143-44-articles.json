We did some minor optimizations to the biome sampler. We wanted to do more, but some mods that probably won\u0027t get updated (Parallax) are dependent on it\u0027s methods, so cutting out large chunks of it is not an option. Maybe after communicating with other authors.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) The config variable \u0022ScatterLatLongDecimalPrecision\u0022 was previous mislabeled \u0022ScatterlatLongDecimalPrecision.\u0022 Note the improper lowercase L. This has been fixed for consistency.

Not exactly a bug, but worth mentioning: The Kopernicus_Config.cfg file is rewritten when the game exits. This means any manual (not in the GUI) edits made while playing the game will not be preserved. Edit the file only with the game exited, please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) At interstellar ranges, heat can sometimes behave strangely, sometimes related to map zoom (be careful zooming out). It is best to turn off part heating when traveling far far away. (I am not sure if this is still releavent as of Release-159, feedback welcome).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) When zooming out all the way out in map view at interstellar ranges, the navball furthermore sometimes behaves oddly. We are working on this and monitoring all the interstellar bugs actively. (I am not sure if this is still releavent as of Release-159, feedback welcome).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) Very Old craft files may complain about a missing module.

When you uninstall a mod that had installed a Terrain Detail preset you were using, it may be listed still in the Graphics settings as \u0022New Text.\u0022 This is by design.

Multistar Solar panel support requires an additional config file, attached to release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) As of release-107, scatter density underwent a bugfix on all bodies globally that results in densities acting more dense than before on some select configs. Some mods may need to adjust.

As of release-151, polar generation behavior has changed slightly. Though it will be safer overall for new missions, be careful loading existing craft there.

The \u0022collider fix\u0022 as it\u0027s called, which fixes the event in which you sink into the terrain on distant bodies, is now on by default.

A new bool configuration parameter has been added, \u0022UseOnDemandLoader.\u0022 The default is false.

This uses a bit more ram but is generally much faster and allows for things like DistantObjectEnhancement to work easily.

even Saturn by a good margin (and that\u0027s already less dense than liquid water) and ends up with a pretty weak gravitational pull that in things like Principia, result in it losing control of the

I was doubtful that it would be the modpacks like you suggested, but I am curious what GU was doing to mess with OPM.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the data (it\u0027s the most I\u0027ve gotten so far!).\u00A0 I will prioritize this issue for investigation and hopefully, a fix in next release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue to track this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/issues/596\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/issues/596\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\u00A0 I think I may have identified an origin cause, working on a fix now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-22T03:46:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2023 03:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 22\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by R-T-B\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"R-T-B","CreatedById":200868,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-22T04:34:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis ones for you, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/222648-mrlafle/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022222648\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/222648-mrlafle/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@mrlafle\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew in this latest version \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/releases/tag/release-182\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erelease-182\u003C/a\u003E:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) The \u0022collider fix\u0022 as it\u0027s called, was causing star occlusion issues on distant bodies in the tracking station. Since this issue was limited to the tracking station only, it was fixed by simply disabling the option when the tracking station scene is loaded (it isn\u0027t needed there anyways).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) The above does not apply to the inflight \u0022mapview\u0022 mode, but that wasn\u0027t buggy anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnown Bugs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Not exactly a bug, but worth mentioning: The Kopernicus_Config.cfg file is rewritten when the game exits. This means any manual (not in the GUI) edits made while playing the game will not be preserved. Edit the file only with the game exited, please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) At interstellar ranges, heat can sometimes behave strangely, sometimes related to map zoom (be careful zooming out). It is best to turn off part heating when traveling far far away. (I am not sure if this is still releavent as of Release-159, feedback welcome).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) When zooming out all the way out in map view at interstellar ranges, the navball furthermore sometimes behaves oddly. We are working on this and monitoring all the interstellar bugs actively. (I am not sure if this is still releavent as of Release-159, feedback welcome).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) Very Old craft files may complain about a missing module. This is a cosmetic error and can be ignored. Reload and re-save the craft to remove the error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.) Sometimes when reloading a quicksave to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, you will get the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E sunken into the ground. This is cosmetic only, another reload of the same save will fix it. (This error has been around forever, just now listing it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.) When you uninstall a mod that had installed a Terrain Detail preset you were using, it may be listed still in the Graphics settings as \u0022New Text.\u0022 This is by design. If it bothers you, please reinstall the mod that setup that preset, or delete settings.cfg and let it regenerate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7.) Some mods that used custom Terrain Presets may require you to delete your settings.cfg file and reset your settings with this release. This is rare, but can happen. See \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/200143-112x-kopernicus-stable-branch-last-updated-march-7th-2023/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=4258139\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E post for details\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnown Caveats:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) The 1.12.x release series works on 1.12.x. The 1.11.x,1.10.x,1.9.x and 1.8.x releases are deprecated\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Multistar Solar panel support requires an additional config file, attached to release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) As of release-107, scatter density underwent a bugfix on all bodies globally that results in densities acting more dense than before on some select configs. Some mods may need to adjust. Normally we\u0027d not change things like this, but this is technically the correct stock behavior of the node so... if you need the old behavior, see config option UseIncorrectScatterDensityLogic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) As of release-151, polar generation behavior has changed slightly. Though it will be safer overall for new missions, be careful loading existing craft there. This is probably not lethal but I don\u0027t want you to be unaware. Maybe make a save just in case? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.) The \u0022collider fix\u0022 as it\u0027s called, which fixes the event in which you sink into the terrain on distant bodies, is now on by default. If you really need distant colliders, turn this off, but you\u0027d best have a good reason (I can\u0027t think of any).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.) The particle system was hopelessly broken and has been since sometime past 1.10.x. Few mods used it, so it has been removed completely as of Release-146.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7.) Because we now unpack multipart PQSCity\u0027s correctly, you may find some PQSCity structures are in the earth or floating. Report such bugs to your planet pack author as this is an intended change (only cosmetic).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
