Because AVP is a pain in the bahookie to install. If it does use AVP then do you think you could contact rbray and Astronomer and you could release the folders ready to go into Gamedata, EVE, AVP, and OPM already installed? (Hooray, acronyms) That would make my life a lot easier, and I would love you forever for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- If you can\u0027t do number 1, do you think you could explain how to get AVP working?
