If they go to Mars there will be a hab module that the astronauts spend most of their time in. Possibly inflatable. NASA talking about Orion taking astronauts to Mars rubs me the wrong way because it\u0027s misleading. As for deep sleep, the benefits don\u0027t really outweigh the drawbacks. It\u0027s better to have an awake and alert crew on the way to mars so you can do science and have them stay fit and healthy for when they arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-07T23:48:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2014 11:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dkmdlb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T23:41:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of room for the astronauts Orion is only a little improvement over Apollo\u0027s CM, but four are stacked in there, so you will get to know each other very well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
