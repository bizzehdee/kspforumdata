Those kerbals would be excited to go into space and would get a head start by having a buff to allow for the longer journeys to the edges of the system. Maybe even a buff to tell the kerbals at the KSC that they are going further out. Also expanding on this, kerbals with a higher courage score would also buff faster than ones with a lower courage score (fear factor). That buff would drop to 0 over time of course but it would allow them a head start for their mission and the higher courage kerbals would see a much slower reduction of that buff than a non courage kerbal. Maybe even the highest courage kerbals would barely be affected by cramped quarters for extended missions because they\u0027re just that badass.. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022) but the scare kerbals might not want to even be in the ship for a few days without something to take their mind off what they\u0027re doing (high hab buffing parts)\n\nWe\u0027ve been missing a reason for getting high courage kerbals this might give that skill a purpose like EL gave purpose to the stupidity skill. Those kerbals with a higher courage skill could do a few things for the crew and the hab level degradation as well, for instance with a high courage kerbal on board he could give pep talks to the lower courage crew members making the overall hab level drop slower than a ship full of scared kerbals. Or it could affect only his own level of degradation where he can last longer in the ship as a whole before he goes off and \u0022pouts\u0022 and turns into a tourist. This way kerbals who are scared could be thrown in the smaller capsules for shorter missions and not be a big deal but the higher courage rates kerbals could be sent off to the remote edges of the system in a less \u0022habitable condition\u0022 and still be ok with it to a point knowing they are doing something amazing for kerbal-kind.\n\none other aspect that might be interesting to introduce is an SOI buff for habitation. Whenever they change over to a new SOI they get a burst of habitation (antisipation of arrival) as well as a complete reset of habitation timers if they actually set foot on a planet (for the first time only on this mission though) this would allow for getting kerbals to the outer edges by setting up fly bys of other planets and moons as well as actual landings during the missions.\n\nmight be something to consider or build off of.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-04T19:29:26Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2016 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by GokouZWAR**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kadrush","CreatedById":158076,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T23:09:29Z","Content":"Roverdude, \n\nThanks for the amazing mods of the USI series, I really love them.

Yet, I agree for the multiplier for the OKS habs in an interplanetary ship. Before the hab mechanics I roleplayed it and sent a gigantic ship to Duna with aeroponics, kerbitat, pioneer, the inflatable hab and many other stuff (actually it was my first trip to Duna so I sent a fleet of 10 ships with landers, probes, 2 refineries, ressupplye ships, wasnt taking any chances).\n\n2-I agree with the guy above and it would be nice to be able to find the right line on the settings file to take down the hab mechanics if we are experiencing a hard time.\n\n3-Do you think it is possible to use this new mechanic with the deep freeze mod without bugging the ship (or the save)?\n\n4-Is it possible to add an experience factor to the hab multiplier per kerbal, i mean, a more stars kerbal, a more corageous one, a more experienced (spending a long time away) should increase the time he can stay in a given space without going into a strike.\n\n5- I am experiencing a hard time trying to understand the life support mechanics to reduce the supplies usage by my kerbals, so far it is just to high.\n\n5- BUG: I managed to rescue my \u0022tourist\u0022 kerbals by sending a ship there and I believe i found a bug. My \u0022tourists\u0022 were stuck on a base at minmus, so i had to land a ship nearby and conect both using a flextube (nice part by the way). Once my ship got close the \u0022tourists\u0022 resumed working but with a very low timer, so I decided to swap them with the ship crew and send them home. Once I disconected the flextube I discovered that my lander was not using any supplies, nor had a hab timer, even with a crew of 3 inside, the USI life support stuff was totally turned off from it. I found a similar issue with the derp rescue pod from the USI survivability mod, even with a kerbal inside, it just dont use supplies (altough it uses TAC supplies normaly).\n\n6- BUG: I believe there is a phanton energy usage with the Nommatic (the garden part that make supplies, the stronger one), i have fusebox mod installed and one of those radial power plant of yours that give 50 of energy per second. Once I turn on the Nommatic fusebox tells me that the energy usage went up by around 20 (to a max of around 25) per second and that my energy production is 50, yet my batteries are slowly being drained, unless I warp faster than 4x.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-05T02:04:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2016 02:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kadrush**\n  \nGrammar (kind of)"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T02:23:18Z","Content":"UKS - He\u0027s likely referring to the Kerbitat (the Duna class being the more traditional MKS-looking bits vs the inflatables)."},{"CreatedByName":"sardia","CreatedById":149922,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T03:27:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, RoverDude said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E UKS - He\u0027s likely referring to the Kerbitat (the Duna class being the more traditional MKS-looking bits vs the inflatables).\n\u003E \n\nAny confirmation about the big three orange dudes being converted to tourists due to running out of supplies?"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T03:30:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, sardia said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Any confirmation about the big three orange dudes being converted to tourists due to running out of supplies?\n\u003E \n\nCheck your LS settings.

But it seems that feature has been disabled by default until some of the hab time bugs have been resolved. The default penalties were much more severe in 0.32.0.0 and have been progressively neutered in the following versions because the life support timers have been kind of unpredicable. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised to see harsher defaults return to Kolonization once things are proven to be stable."},{"CreatedByName":"GokouZWAR","CreatedById":142307,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T04:30:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 minutes ago, sardia said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for the confirmation, I wasn\u0027t sure if this was intended or not.

And the end-game pieces will essentially turn your colony into a mini-Kerbin (i.e. it refreshes the master hab timer, and there are no penalties while there).\n\u003E \n\nCan you elaborate on this? I saw the colony stats screen and the three numbers and only one was going up...but what do you need to do to make the colony have no hab limits? Just get those numbers up? How do you affect the different numbers and what do they do? Or are you just referring to expanding and making it bigger over construction of new parts or does it just grow without doing anything?"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T04:48:06Z","Content":"I\u0027ll do a guide on it.  But basically, the longer you keep people on a planet, the higher those numbers go (and we\u0027re talking up to about 200,000 or so... they get big for a decades-old kolony).  It will result in a bonus to the habitation number of any habs on that planet.  So not good for your first colonists, but better as you establish yourself - and even better if you have more bases.\n\nThere is not (yet) anything that gets you the infinite hab - those are new parts that are not yet released."}]}
