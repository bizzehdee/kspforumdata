The idea is to give the swap file a nice clean, fairly high performance part of the disk all to itself, no more fragmented swapfile....ever. Create the main OS parition after that partition is made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can devote the space to it indefinitely, define an actual swapfile size instead of allowing it to be system managed. 4Gb should be plenty, depending on what it needs to do i wouldn\\\u0027t go under 1gb. If the work related tasks are very low memory usage, it might be possible to operate just fine without a swapfile, so your thought of trying out 500mb should be enough in that case. The system does have a decent amount of Ram. The point of defining its size is to prevent fragmentation caused by the changing size of the swapfile. Windows can get rather....fussy if its current desire for memory exceeds both your ram and swapfile combined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing a work computer, there are a fair number of processes that run in the background that might not be necessary for you.

Will also help the system last longer, current and temperature are both enemies of system life, the less of each, the longer it lives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts also fairly painless and low risk to apply new paste, that said, anytime you physically handle the parts, there is risk of them not functioning after.....so, yeah.
