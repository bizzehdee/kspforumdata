And you can use in-line intakes too, which is basically shielded by crap in front. That or a stack of ablatives, stacking like 5 in a row ive managed to pull off over 1500 at sea level without tweaking heat amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, one thing thats AMAZING at blocking stuff in the mk1 pod, and the shielded port, both having incredible heat tolerances, with a precooler behind those you can pull off some insane speed. Stilll love the new rapiers (despite no more pure jet mode to 400km AP), 1000kn thrust at sea level FTW!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
