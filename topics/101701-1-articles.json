{"TopicId":101701,"ForumId":66,"TopicTitle":"Devnote Tuesday: Rocket Technology","CreatedByName":"SQUAD","CreatedById":66485,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T22:32:00Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"SQUAD","CreatedById":66485,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T22:32:00Z","Content":"\u003Cfigure\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://31.media.tumblr.com/0ff9377afa68dc3ad3fe6844aaf1bd38/tumblr_inline_nl0odsciXO1rr2wit.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tumblr_inline_nl0odsciXO1rr2wit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E**Felipe (HarvesteR):** Fairings and Cargo Bays are pretty much done now, barring any bugs that might pop up during the upcoming testing phases. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m now switching gears again to work on other areas that need attention. This week then, my goal is to devote some attention to one area that really needs it: The Tech Tree.\n\nOne thing we learned from the Aero overhaul, was just how useful a properly designed set of debug and tweaking tools can be to help us find the proper tuning for a complicated system, and with the large amount of new parts coming in on this update, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s inevitable that we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have to have some techtree-time to at the very least assign them to tech nodes. But new parts always affect the tech tree more than just the matter of which tech they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be assigned to. They fill in niches that were previously unoccupied, change progression paths, and generally cause enough of a change that we end up having to review the tech tree in its entirety. I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t expect the new wings, fairings, landing gear and resource parts to be any different, but I do expect the revision that these will require of the tech tree to be a pretty massive one. \n\nSo, instead of just bracing ourselves for another round of tweaking cfg files by the hundreds, and awkwardly editing a prefab full of tech nodes, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m writing a set of tools to allow us to edit the tech tree directly from the running game. This should allow us (and the test team) to change part assignments to tech nodes, modify part and node parameters, and generally re-jig the tech tree around without having to go through the tedious process that doing these things requires right now. \n\nNow, this begs the question: Will these tools be available in the release version? The answer right now is, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m building the toolset for our own use here at the moment, as that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s required of it. Writing release-quality code, even for debugging tools, inevitably takes a lot more time. However, if by the end of the rebalancing and testing phase we think these utilities are presentable, then we might leave them in, along with the rest of the debug toolset. But we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll see about that when we get there. No promises yet.\n\nSo, armed with a proper set of techtree-editing tools, we should be able to tinker and revise the tree\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s layout much more easily, which in turn should allow us to do changes that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been wanting to do for some time now. Now that we have so many new spaceplane parts, the tech tree can be revised to let you start unlocking aero parts earlier, allowing you to get into spaceplane design at earlier stages of the game. \n\nJust what the new tree layout will look is quite a ways off from even being the matter at hand, however. I expect we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have other devblogs to talk about that yet, but as for this week, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m happy that Fairings and Cargo Bays have reached QA-worthy state, and that I finally get to move on to other areas again. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s always nice to get a change of pace.\n\n**Mike (Mu):** More work has gone into the thermodynamics and aerodynamics systems. We received a doc full of great ideas to further improve the aero, from QA team members TheClaw, diomedea, sal\\_vager and NathanKell, so i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been spending some time discussing and implementing some of those. They feature better stall mechanics and more realistic control surfaces.\n\n**Marco (Samssonart):** Nothing new to report this time, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on that Docking tutorial, which is now basically complete, awaiting script revision, so a few minor changes could come up, I started work on a Interplanetary Transfer Orbits tutorial, meant to walk you through an efficient way to get to Duna, using the Oberth effect and all, that one\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s barely starting, I am trying to get the Oberth effect explanation just right, accurate and easy to understand, from there on it should be pretty straightforward.\n\n**Jim (Romfarer):** This week my main focus has gone into writing a new algorithm to test stack fuel flow on a vessel. Basically it is about pairing (for every resource) the containers that are connected to consumers. Everything that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not connected is displayed in the report. It would be nice and simple if the vessel was a undirected graph, but it is not because the fuel lines makes it directional. Without going into too much detail, it is more time consuming to test for this in a directed graph. The solution i went for was to convert the vessel into two graphs, one for fuel delivery and another for fuel requests which is basically a graph going in the opposite direction as the delivery graph (fuel line direction flipped). Then it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just a matter of tracing those two graphs from the container/consumer entry points using a DFS search and flag every part it sees without visiting a part twice. So the result is the intersection of all parts not flagged as receiving a resource and parts flagged as destinations for that resource.\n\n**Max (Maxmaps):** Merch and marketing meetings seem to have finally concluded, which is great because over the past three weeks it has been nonstop negotiating. Other than that, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been looking over the timely development of the 1.0 features, as well as planning our internal marketing for it. Working with our collaborating modders has been crazy cool, as has been the development of the new tier 0 space center. Our internal release date has also fully crystallized, which means it has now taken its place, floating ominously above us holding a slightly threatening and deeply unnerving glare. \n\n**Ted (Ted):** It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been an incredibly busy week here, the fun just doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t stop! We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had a full and excellent week with Resources in QA. Things are looking great for it and RoverDude has really done some fantastic work on it, not to mention the superb work he put in liaising with the QA Team on feedback and issues. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re now QAing Arsonide\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s features and changes that he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s developed for 1.0, which are looking pretty damn good so far. Additionally, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got the fairings feature now integrated into our main QA branch, nice and stable, so the focused QA on that has concluded. The QA Team has also been testing out some performance improvements and overhauls that Mike has developed, in addition to a number of additions and refactoring he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s done on KSP\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s heat and thermal systems.\n\nI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also been working on a couple of other KSP-related projects, but nothing that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s all too interesting, just something else that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been spending time on.\n\n**Rogelio (Roger):** This week I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been doing some dynamics and fluids testing on Maya, we want to simulate real smoke on the upcoming animation so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m understanding how the particle and fluid systems work. It will take some time since the simulation time varies depending on the level of detail we want, but I think we will get really nice results.\n\n**Kasper (KasperVld):** I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been busy with several projects, most related to KSP but one that wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t and it provided a nice change of focus. Sadly we didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have a Squadcast last Friday, but we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be back with a lot of information this week, be sure you tune in to Squadcast on Friday.

Can you also consider allowing smaller resource consumption/requests on non-stack-flow resources? IIRC, currently anything that is not stack-flow ends up requesting nothing if it\u0027s less than, what, 0.00005 or something? That would be a great improvement for modders, especially those that concern themselves with more realistic or theoretical systems."},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T22:39:56Z","Content":"Thank you for the update ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I am pretty curious to take a look at the new fairings.\n\nWhich YouTuber i want to see playing KSP?

This isn\u0027t what mission control should be.

But then maybe we have to consider, the original design document called for a rocket-building game where you tried to go as high as you could.\n\u003E I wonder if some of the design issues in career mode in KSP are the simple result of KSP being Squad\u0027s first game.\n\u003E \n\u003E To sum up why Career isn\u0027t that great imo:\n\u003E \n\u003E -Contracts are grindy and one-shot, you can\u0027t establish grand programs.\n\u003E \n\u003E -Administation functions don\u0027t seem to be really useful.\n\u003E \n\u003E -Mission Control is really just another administration building, where you make deals. This isn\u0027t what mission control should be. Mission Control is the place where missions happen!\n\u003E \n\u003E -It\u0027s hard to do proper recovery of multistage vehicles, and recovery works by giving back funding for parts rather than keeping the actual ship.\n\u003E \n\u003E -And to an extent, I think the element of competition is lacking. No space race. This is probably more subject to opinion than anything else here.\n\u003E \n\u003E -Structural parts that would seem to be very simple are quite late in the tech tree.\n\nTotally disagree that KSP needs some kind of pre-defined end game objective, the freedom to create your own objectives is one of the best things about this game. \u0022The End\u0022 in minecraft feels like a tack-on job added to satisfy the unimaginative."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T00:23:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Good devotes, but could you please put a space in between each entry, the wall of text is kind of hard to read.\n\nHows it look now? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
