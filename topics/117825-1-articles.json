It is much more like RL now, a bit like old FAR in 0.90, also re-entry heat and parts heating each other is a thing. It\u0027s all good, takes some getting used to. Jets are no where near as powerful as they were, still way overpowered. But there are some bugs. Be careful clipping things in cargo bays and service modules. Physics timewarp in atmosphere can cause rapid disassembly, especially with MK2 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome tips, with rockets don\u0027t go too fast low down and start your gravity turn early and slowly, no more blast to 10km then 45 degrees. You need nosecones, the front of the craft must be less draggier than the back. The CoM must be high, think normal rocket vs pancake. You need a shallow re-entry, I hear people are doing 45km\u002B degrees periapsis, I have not had to worry too much, straight down is an obvious no no. The other planets have bugs with their atmospheres, no Jool aerobrake (instant death), you need to be extra careful aerobraking on any world especially the bigger ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: you NEED Claws \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-4-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-4b-2-1-Aug-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStock Bug Fix Mod\u003C/a\u003E and to install it use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager-v1-12-0-30-Jul-2015\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/a\u003E these are almost mandatory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T22:39:39Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 10:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by selfish_meme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lego8_bit","CreatedById":58076,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T01:49:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow thanks for the update on the game lol i am also broke over 2200 m/s in a mk2 plane \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arran","CreatedById":64656,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T14:53:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lego8_bit\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lego8_bit\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWow thanks for the update on the game lol i am also broke over 2200 m/s in a mk2 plane \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launch my MK2 spaceplanes in a shallow angle (5/10 degrees) way up to about 32km where they start to sufficate, reaching a speed of about 2600 m/s that pushes it to a near stable orbit (roughly 450km x 30km) on airbreathing engines alone while the plane itself, then just let it glide to AP, where i active my lvl-909 for a circlulasation manouvre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly this approach takes patience as the acent on turbofans take about 35mins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly 2 small MK2 tanks are needed one for Liquid fuel and one for the LoX, so even with the airbreathing engine nerf, they still are pretty OP if you ask me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T14:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, how the heck are you guys getting those speeds on air breathers...?
