Why do I have to perform an orbital rendezvous around Kerbin before I can get a mission to circularize around and/or land on the Mun? Does not compute.

Definite suggestion for 1.0.1: make all of the World-Firsts contracts into auto-contracts. It makes zero sense otherwise. \u0022Oh, you landed on the Mun already?
