In order to rescue the ship you must match their orbit as close as possible within 24 hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You must match the altitudes within 10,000m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) You must match the speeds within 100m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) You must have a mission time of no greater than 24 hours at the time the orbit is matched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonal Note: This is my first challenge (and first post) on these forums, and it\\\u0027s actually a follow up to my own Mun mission gone totally wrong. The reason the mission timer is at 351 days is that I was trying to return to Kerbin under my own power before finally giving up, so I\\\u0027m trying to see if anybody can rescue the crew of my little ship. Good luck everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just noticed how similar this is to Operation: No Kerbal Left Behind from Panichio \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=4468.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=4468.0\u003C/a\u003E. Sorry about that, probably should have looked around a bit more \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.
