I dont think that passive radiation will be a thing, but the devs have said that you will need to care about radiation when it comes to nuclear engines (the main counterplay here seems to be radiation shields and having lots of distance between your crew and your engine).

Air may be a thing for colonies, but its trivial to add a small fuel tank onto a spaceship, so having air be a concern for spaceship doesn\u0027t seem like itll add anything. This is more speculative but I think microgravity being an issue was something that was in production at some point, considering the amount of gravity rings we have seen, but considering that we haven\u0027t seen much of them recently I think it got axed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot of these concerns are fair but I think they were things that the devs already considered and they have a lot of ways to negate them. The issues with life support being too much to drop on a new player will be fixed by the fact that the increased distances between planets will lead to a natural progression of increasing life support demands. The concerns about micromanagement would be addressed by automatic transport/management, which are very likely already in game in some form. It would be nice to have some sort of warning tab that catches things when a spacecraft is missing something like parachutes and it also has a heat shield, just to help with those messups involving forgetting parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-03T02:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224194613\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210405\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221667438858\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe should fully expect a thoughtfully designed vanilla experience that functions properly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s easy to say and\u00A0 very hard to define.

It just sounds like you\u2019d rather play sandbox. You also don\u2019t mention colonies so maybe thats not your jam either? What me and a lot of folks are hoping for is that KSP2 caters to the sim folks with sandbox, but that the other elements of the game\u2014progression and science, mining resources and fuels and building self-sufficient colonies can make KSP into a really good \u003Ci\u003Egame\u003C/i\u003E. It could still follow the same logic\u2014just the way you\u2019ve managed power input and heat to extract and process ore in KSP1, in KSP2 you might have 3 or 4 raw resources that colonies would turn into refined methalox, reactor fuel, metallic hydrogen, new parts and modules, etc. You shouldn\u2019t have to worry about piping and logic gates like factorio does. The colony is just a big vessel with a different set of inputs and outputs. Ideally these would also be for the most part set-it-and-forget-it. So even with a dozen colonies and stations so long as your outputs are in the black you can time warp away without risk. This takes KSP beyond being a simple one-off mission, flags a footprints sim (though you could certainly still do this in sandbox) and allows players to set up a whole interplanetary civilization.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-03T12:53:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2022 12:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-03T13:31:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224194696\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210405\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221667458904\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Space exploration\u0022 \u003Ci\u003Eis\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0\u0022How long until these things die without food or water\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you\u0027re comparing apples to trapezoids here.\u00A0 The context of my post, which you missed and failed to include in your response, was that this is a VIDEO GAME, not real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-03T13:47:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224194794\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210405\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221667482295\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow71\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, Scarecrow71 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you\u0027re comparing apples to trapezoids here.\u00A0 The context of my post, which you missed and failed to include in your response, was that this is a VIDEO GAME, not real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed.

In fact I think the game should be as fuss-free and simple to use as possible. The thing is keeping people alive for long periods in space is one of the central challenges of spaceflight, and more than that helps players understand the relationship between efficient transfers and flight times. This will be especially important as we get into interstellar travel, understanding the main advantage of getting to a new star system in 10 or 40 years instead of 400, helping players wrap their mind around just how crazy these distances are. If there\u0027s a way to abstract all that down to a single food resource thats pretty comparable to the way KSP abstracts rocket engineering down to simple fuel tanks and engine parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
