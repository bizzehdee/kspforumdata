Also good because it allows an increased horizontal aspect at launch. Carries hydrogen and oxygen for higher efficiency, so 450 starting ISP instead of 300. This has alot of advantages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAc = v^2/r\u00A0 4000000/6371000 = 0.65 m/s this mean you need only maintain starting 9.1 m/s force/mass vertical. If you launch with 3 g of acceleration it means that the down vector of thrust need only\u00A0 be 17.8 degrees, the cosine of 17.8 is 0.95 therefor little of the initial thrust is wasted, even getting a 5 m/s2 climb still keeps more than 80% of the thrust horizontal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor launching sensitive equipment like large telescopes. The reason here is that you start your launch and need to gain velocity going vertical, a burn option, that means that by the time you start to turn to horizontal, you are above 100000 meters. you know longer have to worry about dynamic pressure. At maximum dynamic pressure CRS-8 was at 10000 meter, if you launched from say 20,000 meters, you would be at 90,000 meters when you reached the same speed, that atmosphere would be 1/30th the density.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no affinity for any launch system that stresses the payload. Oh another benefit, no fairings or nose cones required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblems. Lets just say we had a gas 1/10 as thin as air and we had a heater in the gas and a layer of insulation to keep the gas at STP. How much gas would we need to get to 20,000 meters. So lets estimate this to be 1/10th ATM. So the last rocket launched was 555,000 kgs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo at STP there are 22.4 liters of N2/O2 per. If we then take this 29.2 grams per mole then there is about 1.30 grams per liter of 1300 grams per cu. m. (1.3 kg) If that is then at 1/10th atm it can amounts to .13 kg per cubic. meter.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor a 555,000 kg rocket I would need 1.11 * 555,000 / 0.13 volume of gas (presumbably hydrogen)\u00A0 = 4.7 cubic meters of hydrogen. That constitutes a sphere of around 150 meters in radius. That is roughly 3 time as long as a football feild in all dimensions. The surface of the sphere would be, if there were 3 layers of plastic to retain heat it would need around 77000 sq. meters of plastic, and in the lowest sections the plastic along the lower few meters of rocket along the boundary of a perimeter of 1200 meters would need to be strong enough to support about 500kg (1100 pounds per meter of length), this plastic would have to be stronger and heaviery than standard 3mil plastic which can support about 100 lbs per meter on edge. To distribute the weight there would have to be wires and a weight distrubition structures inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see this system being developed because it lacks simplicity, but I suspect that some space agency might begin trying this as soon as ground launch cost reductions have started to equilibrate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTHe problem with this system in a Space X scheme is this. Lets say we used this system to launch a rocket with a bigger dV in space, the launch phase for retroburn is going alot faster, and its all horizontal, so there is less control in where it comes down and more of a reentry burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second problem is what is going to happen when you release the rocket, that balloon is going to go up, and actually you want it to go down, so you would have to massive pump hydrogen into a reservoir.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe third problem is high altitude balloons are at the mercy of upper level winds, you might launch ok but you might have to wait several months to recover the launch vehicle\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe forth problem is that humans cannot work outside at 20,000 or 30,000 meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to add my, a jet powered hovering launch platform, made from 100,000 lb MSL thrusters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
