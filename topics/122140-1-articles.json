Specifically, I\u0027m talking about docking two vessels in orbit. I\u0027ve been trying for over a month. I can get craft into essentially the same orbit, within 100 meters, match speeds fairly well. But primarily because of the defective circuitry in my own peripheral nervous system (meaning I have extremely poor hand eye coordination), I can not get two craft stationary relative to each other or dock them. I\u0027ve tried with both airlocks and the Klaw. I\u0027ve even been considering cheating by launching two craft docked, and undocking in orbit, then docking again before they get more than 20 meters apart. At this point I\u0027m just sick of it and want to get rid of that contract to open up another slot for a three star contract. I haven\u0027t tried using addons; not because I\u0027m against them, but because I\u0027m not sure they\u0027ll work in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if there a way I can get rid of this contract? It has no expiration date or cancel button. And if I get rid of it, is there a progression i\u0027ll miss.

Use your main engine to get into the vicinity of the target craft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2.

Active Docking Port Alignment indicator, and select the correct target docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 4. Right-click on the docking port of your controlled craft and select \u0022Control from Here\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 5. Activate RCS and SAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 6. Orient (rotate) your craft correctly, which means the docking port directions are parallel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 7. Fix your offset on each axis one by one, using the Docking Port Alignment indicator:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Get a feel for how a marker moves when you use RCS into one direction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Pick one direction (x or y, not z just yet) and move so that the large green bar is centered. Then kill your velocity in that direction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Pick the other direction (y or x, not z just yet) and move so that the large green bar is centered. Then kill your velocity in that direction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Get closer to the target docking port (that would be z-direction)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - While getting closer, fix the other axis offsets that will arise (x and y). If you feel that you can\u0027t because it\u0027s going too fast, slow down in Z again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - When you are within 2m, you can stop fixing smaller offsets in x and y because they will be amplified by the small distance in Z and because the docking ports are actually *very* magnetic and very generous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you feel that the other docking port has \u0022grabbed you\u0022 magnetically, disable SAS and RCS, let go of controls and let the crafts wobble itself out.
