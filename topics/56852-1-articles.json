My chosen landing site was on the other side so whilst waiting to travel round I decided some SCIENCE was in order. So I filed a crew capsule report. Then did a quick EVA, (nothing more than exiting, filing the report, entering again - never letting go of the capsule ladder) and got a Minmus Slopes EVA report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut again, Minmus Lowlands EVA report, in again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut again, Minmus Lesser Flats EVA report, in again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut again, Minmus Midlands EVA report, in again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut again, Minmus Greater Flats EVA report, in again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut again, Minmus Highlands EVA report, in again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, scientific reports all make sense, and EVAs teach us (and kerbals) much but I\u0027d argue staring at an airlock door for five seconds doesn\u0027t teach us much about specific biomes. But sitting in a capsule, looking out the window and with a full rack of gadgets, dials, big red buttons and readouts that go \u0022Bing!\u0022 should teach us more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027d suggest swapping the behaviour - allow low orbit capsule crew reports to be biome specific and in return make low orbit EVAs singular \u0026amp; generic. I\u0027m aware there\u0027s a slight science point difference between the two, so may need tweaking values to ensure overall science gain remains the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T13:41:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like it the way it is, it makes sense to me that on EVA the Kerbal looks around and observes what\u0027s around the ship and what\u0027s on the surface of the planet while crew reports are more about how the crew feels inside the capsule and eventually about microgravity experience. There are no science tools in the pod and the helmet provides better view than pod\u0027s windows in most cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, we have great zoom available IVA.

Stuff like: \u0022You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.\u0022 EVA Reports in space on the other hand all, except the Sun, have the same generic description: \u0022You\u0027ve recorded your observations about the situation.\u0022 Also pods have plenty of science stuff. The Hitchhiker even has two drawers labeld Science. Additionally, EVA biome reports, are just one of the most annoying things in KSP. Get out of capsule, hang on the door, press EVA Report, get back in, wait till next biome and repeat. Switching biomes to Crew Report won\u0027t make it more excited, but at least you have to do less annoying tasks to get it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started working on a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62411-ScienceRevisited-New-and-improved-ways-to-do-science-ALPHA-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emod\u003C/a\u003E that, among other things, changes this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S4qFBxkFFg","CreatedById":83727,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T17:25:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with OP - the out, in, out, in, out, in... routine is pretty tedious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably better than 0.22 though, I think the reports can be stored now without entering the capsule?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
