I love space planes, in fact I\u0027m terrible at rockets, so here I am trying to do stuff with aircraft as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve unlocked the Whiplash turboramjet, but I can\u0027t yet get a decent payload all the way to orbit. So, my space planes are sub orbital craft, which launch the rocket upper stage at high altitude, which i have time to stabilize the orbit of, before switching back the plane which i guide in for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, the plane tends to come down the other side of the world from the space centre. Sub orbital flights you know, hazard of the job. Hypersonic 180 degree turns are not advisable, by the time i\u0027ve slowed enough to make the turn, i\u0027m so far downrange there\u0027s no way to get back on remaining fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that you end up recovering only 25% of the cost of the plane for landing it so far away from the space centre, even though you put it down completely intact and all it needs is a tank of gas and it\u0027s good to go again. Use a rocket instead, get nothing back, and it works out cheaper because the launch cost is less \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne answer would be to put airports all over Kerbin , but as a simpler workaround, why not make it possible to fill up on Liquid Fuel only any time you are stopped on the surface of Kerbin. Bringing over a tanker of jet fuel to a plane that\u0027s landed in a field so it can take off again is no big deal, after all the stuff\u0027s pretty ubiquitous, filling up solid motors, loading LOX or Hypergolics probably requires a space centre..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that way I can refuel my space plane on the ground and fly it back to the space centre before hitting the \u0022recover vessel\u0022 button. A lot of leg work, and something you\u0027d rather have abstracted out, but fairly realistic for a sub-orbital launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T16:20:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is already possible.

The logic in KSP is that a fuel tank and engine costs only a few 1000, and mission completions are worth more. In reality expendable rockets are expensive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to constant refueling upon landing... Yeah no. Easily OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I would suggest to solve your problem- \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeploy a resource sat into orbit above Kerbin so you can see where the resources are. Then you have two choices, either make a mobile ISRU refinery which your spaceplane can dock to- OR save yourself the trouble and make your spaceplane carry the refinery with! Then find a spot which is near where you usually slow down enough to land, and is near to a point with high resources, then mine, process and fly back off. Or go with idea A and just drive a mobile refinery there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, in KSP, refueling SRBs are impossible. They do not permit refueling. It is 100% impossible to completely replicate a space shuttle mission since you can\u0027t reuse the boasters! LFO you can refuel. But in reality you do need a space center to do so... Granted you still need a bit of maintenance while refueling a craft with jet fuel... It isn\u0027t as easy as refueling your car.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul23","CreatedById":120544,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T19:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAs you said, it is weird that an expendable rocket in KSP is cheaper than a reuseable spaceplane.

And only with liquid fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working around this ATM by landing, then enabling the infinite fuel cheat to take off again and fly back to the space centre, abstracting the recovery flight from a downrange airbase a sub orbital launcher aircraft would have to make. Obviously, if i damage the plane putting it down, you\u0027re looking at an almost total loss - which is also realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy sandbox aircraft with Rapiers and LV-Ns can do SSTO with good payload and IRSU, but I hit upon this idea to make the Whiplash planes work better. The wings, control surfaces, airbreathing engines, jet fuel tanks, and landing gear aren\u0027t useful above 40km, so if you can only lift so much rocket fuel, use it on the upper stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBee-lining High Altitude Flight, my first proper spaceplane still had fixed gear (which tended to burn off), the \u0022swivel\u0022 rocket, and 30 parts limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still managed to launch probes with it - the jets were pod mounted, i moved the tailfins to the wingtips, and put a stack decoupler on the rear half of the fuselage. At 40km up, I\u0027d jettison the tail, which contained the rocket motor, rocket fuel tank and probe stuff, fly that to orbit, and land the rest of the plane. Unfortunately that design became unstable when scaled up, so my current ride has an internal cargo bay most of the length of the fuselage (3 large type 2 cargo bays) which contains the upper stage. It\u0027s taken Jeb to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BAn, to Minmus, and sent probes out to Jool. The manned upper stages have small wings and parachutes (heatshields are for wimps!) and re-enter with everything attached. When I make a mission to Minmus, everything that leaves the runway comes back eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seeker89","CreatedById":78437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T13:06:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould the Davon supply mod be what you could be looking for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37012-Part-1-0-4-Davon-supply-mod-v015\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37012-Part-1-0-4-Davon-supply-mod-v015\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou could land, hit the supply button, get resupplied and take off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also used USI Kolonization Systems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588-1-0-4-USI-Kolonization-Systems-%28MKS-OKS%29-%280-31-11%29-2015-10-16\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588-1-0-4-USI-Kolonization-Systems-%28MKS-OKS%29-%280-31-11%29-2015-10-16\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a Logistics Hub, that I have used to send fuel around the planet and in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T14:32:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AeroGav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AeroGav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBringing over a tanker of jet fuel to a plane that\u0027s landed in a field so it can take off again is no big deal,\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s so easy, why not just go ahead and fly a tank of LiquidFuel to your ship? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/a\u003E would come in handy to link the planes and transfer the fuel, or you can just use docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also create a refueling station on the other side of the planet.. or several around the globe.
