Then I switch to free or chase camera and rotate docker without RCS so that nav ball is not rotated in order to tranlate easier. Then I point towards target prograde, turn SAS and RCS on and do a single push towards it. That way RCS will be used only to slight corrections of translation. All You need to do is just pointing towards target prograde (pink) and keeping your prograde (yellow) at the pink dot just by translating.
