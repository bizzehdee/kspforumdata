So far there is an unmanned probe in orbit around Kerbin, and a 3-man crew on their way back from a test flight of a new rocket that was ideally going to take them to Mun, but alas it doesn\u0027t have enough power. Even if I would have any idea how to go about setting the guys up for orbit and return (no landing yet) from there, but we\u0027ll see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a rare thing to find a game like this nowadays, something that actually requires thought and planning.

His videos are fantastic. Since I watched his one about getting into orbit, I\u0027ve had success every time (well, if we ignore the incident with the solid boosters...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESirine, I had no idea you could maintain orbit that low! I\u0027ll have to send a Kerbalnaut up to see if I can manipulate an orbit enough to manage it. Planning for the return trip is one thing when all you\u0027re doing is launching into a 200km orbit, just need to save a tiny bit of fuel for a retrograde burn and that\u0027s it. Landing on the Mun and having the guys return is going to be a whole different ballgame, and one helluva rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips, they will certainly come in handy. I wonder if I can get a probe into solar orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing, is it weird that I got a little panicky when Jebediah lost his grip on command module during an EVA?
