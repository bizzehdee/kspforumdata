On the opposite side, if you have read something that is helpful or funny or inspiring, you can like or leave a positive comment that not only has the ability to brighten someones day, but might inspire them to post more stuff you like. When people treat each other well, then age is just a number that doesn\u0027t matter in the forum. I put no importance on age, gender,nationality,heritage,sexuality and the like. All that matters is how you treat others. Enough people on this forum treat each other well to make a good and safe feeling place to be. If you do come across the rare rotten apple, just let the moderators know quietly and then move on to happier things."},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-04T23:37:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 11/1/2021 at 12:21 PM, adsii1970 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Last I checked, we are about the same age\n\u003E \n\nCannot possibly be true.
