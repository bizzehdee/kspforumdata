It would not be farfetched to assume that at this point in their R\u0026D cycle, dozens of Merlin engines have successfully burned for dozens of consecutive mission-length firings, possibly even in full clusters of nine. And if that requires replacing parts, then they know precisely which parts are prone to degradation, what must be done to refurbish after each mission-length firing, and what can wait for a once-per-10-firings general maintenance.\n\nSeriously. This is like, the most basic, most obvious form of homework that SpaceX should be doing ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) And I cannot possibly imagine them not doing it. Heck, their Grasshopper anf F9R-Dev1 test vehicles never swapped engines, they always used the same (set). There are additional stresses involved with returning from actual flights, yes; but those will be examined in the context of knowing exactly how the engines are supposed to behave over their lifecycle. As such, these additional stresses will be much easier to spot, assess, and address.\n\nThey have also gone through four major iterations of their engine, with another small tweak coming up this summer. Reflying engines was the goal from the outset. These engines are intentionally designed with many, many firings in mind and have gone through many revisions to ensure that this goal can be reached.\n\nSpaceX is not going to just randomly start thinking about reflying engines after recovering a stage. That process already started over a decade ago. If after all this time they\u0027re still advertising the capability to refly engines cheaply, the chance is very good that they will be reflying engines cheaply.
