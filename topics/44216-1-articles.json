The greenhouse model of environment heating is simply wrong. An actual glass greenhouse placed in vacuum would have the same equilibrium temperature as a bare rock. The reason greenhouses work down here is because they are placed in an environment. The way the atmosphere heats up the planet is way more complicated and has to do with convective cycles and radiation equilibria at different altitudes. The atmosphere, in this case, works as a heat pump, not a greenhouse.
