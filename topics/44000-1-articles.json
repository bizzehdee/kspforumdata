Here are some general tips. Some people like to fly everything at full throttle, from runway to (almost) landing. Others tend to use lower settings. The higher the setting, the less lift surface area you may need; the lower the setting, the more surface area. If you intend to glide (say, after running out of fuel), you\u0027ll need more wing area; if you are gonna drop the plane for a glide test with full tanks, you\u0027ll need the most wing area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T11:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI normally use 3 lift stages, no matter what I\u0027m sending up.
