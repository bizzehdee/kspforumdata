Eventually you will be able to build assemblies, like satellites or lifter designs, then save them so they can be added in like a part when building a new craft.

What i meant is when you disconect parts it would be cool to be able to work directly on the other parts and not just the part with the Capsul, know what i mean? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E but so far i love this game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
