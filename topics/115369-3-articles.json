When I finish sorting out the config files for my new realistic engines, I\u0027m probably going to change this to a month, to better match with reality.\n\nAction groups, like most people, are consistent between parts. 1\u00262 are usually engines, 3 are air intakes, 9 is usually solar panels (put far away from the engines so that I don\u0027t accidentally activate the engines whilst powered up and smash a craft into another one).\n\nDon\u0027t pay attention during approaches to space stations, which inevitably leads to either multiple passes, or smashing the solar panels off. Kinda ironic, when I\u0027m returning the tug to the space station after deorbiting the orbital insertion stage for the replacement solar panel array.\n\nDespite only having the one launch pad, I still put some LKO space stations (science ones, not refueling ones) on inclined orbits, to better mimic the ISS (and also make it easier to access from map view)\n\nI aim to have LKO at 72km above the surface each time. This is probably going to be a problem when launching two craft one after the other to intercept, but I\u0027ll deal with that when it happens.\n\nAnd I\u0027ve never left the Kerbin system, aside from a spent booster stage that picked up a gravity assist from the Mun back when I was just learning how to play.\n\nFinally, all of my maneuvers are planned out in a book I\u0027ve got on my desk, which is great, but the maneuvers usually end up not working out and I have to just fiddle with the nodes to get them to work anyway.

Months would go by at the KSC without anything going on. I decided I don\u0027t like that.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\*\\*I do still timewarp for missions within Kerbin SOI\\*\\*\n\nThis is actually my intention with my current career. I had just today sent a probe to intersect Duna\u0027s orbit(the probe was actually launched to do science passes of Mun and Minmus. Sadly the stars didn\u0027t align that much for a Duna rendezvous), and looked at the TOA at the orbit\u0027s Ap. I think it is about 273 days, and the first thing that entered my mind was, \u0027That\u0027s a lot of contracts that could be done in that time.\u0027\n\nSo far I have only landed on the Mun once, sent a mission to the North Pole for some science, and that is about it other than the passes of the Mun and Minmus. I fully expect that landing a mission on Minmus and returning will allow all the tech under the 500 science threshold in R\u0026D, to where I will finally spend the funds needed to hit Tier 3 for that building. I could send a kerballed mission to Duna and, before it got there, finish the first landing on Minmus, explore more biomes on Kerbin and the Mun, and have my tech tree finished out before Duna landing occurred. I may just do that, as landing missions don\u0027t require custom-built craft and something already on-mission can be used to accomplish it, and I haven\u0027t gotten a contract to land on Duna, yet, only to put a satellite in orbit there.\n\nIt does make you wonder how the ground crew assigned to the first manned mission to Mars will be delegated, and whether they will also have responsibilities for other on-going missions, as well. It definitely isn\u0027t going to be just a 7-10 day job like the Apollo missions were."}]}
