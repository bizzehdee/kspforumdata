Let me back up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo days before we left Kerbin, a huge asteroid was detected on a collision course towards Kerbin. The Kerbal Citizen Union\u0027s military had been building warships, in secret, for several years, excepting a conflict with the Kerbin Republic. When they saw the asteroid, they quickly retro-fitted three of those ships, the K.C.U. Turco, the K.C.U. Ethan, and the K.C.U. Spaatz into colony ships. They picked 2000 people from the military and government to go on each of those ships, and head to three potential colony targets: Laythe, Kerbol System, Mesbin, Kaywell\u0027s Star System, and Gael, Ciro System. A total of 6000 Kerbals got off the planet before the asteroid hit. The launches were all conducted in secret, at night. Nobody knew that they happened, and even if Kerbals managed to survive on Kerbin, nobody would notice 6000 missing people. We thought that Mesbin had an O2 atmosphere and water. We were wrong. As the K.C.U. Turco neared Mesbin, we realized that we had been wrong. Then we saw one of its moons. This moon had an atmosphere, and water on the surface. We realized that our Kerbin based astronomers had been seeing this unnamed moon, and mistaken it for its parent body. We decided to name this moon Kerbmun, as it was like Kerbin, but also a Mun. Not that that was much of a priority for us at the time, as we were going to crash into Mesbin. I was the captain of the ship at the time. Here\u0027s what happened.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBridge of the K.C.U. Turco.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Sir, we\u0027ve got a problem,\u0022 The navigation officer said to me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Yes?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022The planet we\u0027re heading to, Sir,\u0022 He said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What about it?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Our sensors are showing that it is 70 Kerbin masses, with a minimal atmosphere, and no surface water, or life of any kind,\u0022 He said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 I asked. I didn\u0027t believe him. It couldn\u0027t be true. It couldn\u0027t be...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Look at it for yourself, Sir,\u0022 He said. I looked at the screen. He was right. There was a gray, oval-shaped planet on it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022It gets worse, Sir,\u0022 He said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Worse? How?\u0022 I asked with disbelief.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022One of its moons, the third one, has a thick atmosphere, with oxygen in it, and liquid water on the surface,\u0022 He said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Can we go there?\u0022 I asked. Oh please, let the answer be yes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022No,\u0022 He said. \u0022We\u0027re being pulled towards Mesbin and don\u0027t have enough fuel to capture into orbit.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What are we going to do, then?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Calculations show that we have just enough Delta V for a suicide burn, which should put him down safely,\u201D He continued. A suicide burn? That\u2019s all we have fuel for?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHow long well the burn take?\u201D I asked. What I really wanted to know was the ship\u2019s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, and therefore the gravity of Mesbin.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C5 minutes,\u201D He said. \u201CAnd to answer your real question, the ship has a starting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 0.9,\u201D He added. \u201CIf you\u2019re wondering why it\u2019s so high, it\u2019s because Mesbin spins. There are 5 gees at the poles, and 1 g at the equator. Luckily, we\u2019re going to crash- I mean land- on the equator.\u201D\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell that\u2019s good,\u201D I said. \u201CWhen do we need to start the burn?\u201D I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C30 minutes from now,\u201D He said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COkay, I\u2019m going to go lay down,\u201D I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n30 minutes later.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe K.C.U. Turco approached Mesbin, the huge planet growing bigger in the portholes.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CT-minus 10 til burn,\u201D The navigational officer said. \u201C5, 4, 3, 2, 1, ignition,\u201D He continued. Nothing happened. Absolutely nothing. I didn\u2019t feel any acceleration. \u201CEngines failed to ignite! Restarting in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, re-ignition!\u201D He continued. This time I felt the engines roar to life beneath me.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHow are we doing?\u201D I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ll have some fuel left over, but...\u201D He trailed off.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut what?\u201D I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe... we\u2019ll hit the ground at 100m/sec,\u201D He said.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUh-oh,\u201D I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4 1/2 minutes later.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe K.C.U. Turco hit the surface of Mesbin at 100m/sec. It hit engines first, to protect the delicate passengers and crew. The engines exploded on impact, followed quickly by the massive fuel tanks and power truss. Then the bridge, put in the middle of the ship, to protect it from impacts, was hit. It survived the impact, being hardened against it, but the g-forces from the impact were enough to kill the captain, who had not put on his restraints tight enough in the confusion of the pre-crash. The ship stopped, angled at 45 degrees. Then it fell over. It hit the ground again, this time at a gentle 10m/sec. The crew checked the captain, and upon finding he was dead, the second-in-command stepped up.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CStatus report,\u201D He asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAll stasis pods are functioning normally, but...\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut what?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve lost the payload section,\u201D The nav said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat does that mean?\u201D The first officer asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve all of our industrial equipment.

I am one of the first Kerbonauts in this new world. 5 years after we first landed, we started a new space program. Our goal was to get all 1999 Kerbals on this planet, off the planet, to somewhere more habitable. Our first goal is Kerbmun, and our telescopes have also discovered what appears to be another habitable planet, farther away. A probe will need to be sent to investigate it. We built this space center to look like the old one, out of materials we mined from Mesbin. Unfortunately, we had to do mining the old fashioned way, with picks and shovels, because we lost all of our industrial equipment in the crash. Since we didn\u2019t have a lot of materials to work with, the space center wasn\u2019t as epic as the other space center we had back home, but we even put in the now fairly useless SpacePlane Hanger and Runway. We even made the runway look like a dirt one since we didn\u2019t have the concrete to \u201Cpave\u201D it. I was a pilot in the Kerbin Citizen Union Space Program, back on Kerbin. When there was still a Kerbal Citizen Union. Back before we left, there had been some talk of all the nations of Kerbin banding together, and digging tunnels to try to survive. Personally, I didn\u0027t believe it would work, but then again, I did volunteer to get launched on a big can o\u0027 boom from an alien world which a huge, high-tech ship barely survived landing on, and I think that\u0027ll work, so maybe their plan worked, but I doubt it. Anyway, enough with all the boring stuff! It\u0027s almost time for the launch of the FIrst Steps 1, a probe designed to gather some science data and test if it\u0027s even feasible to launch something from this planet. Its command module is the Kaputnik Mk. 0, and it has 3 Cavern Goo modules, which are apparently some sort of tasty possibly sentient goo, that can give us great science data by simply observing how it reacts in different situations. Anyway, I\u0027m going to shut up now and watch the launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022S8aE5Z8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022682\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/S8aE5Z8.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022T-10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, gathering science data, 1, ignition!

I\u0027m sitting on top of the First Steps 2, waiting for launch. The goal of this mission is to ensure that we can return a Kerbal safely to Mesbin and also collect some more science data. Oh, and for some reason, the Mesbin World First\u0027s society didn\u0027t count our 5 meter hop into the air \u0022launching\u0022 anything, so we\u0027re also planning on getting that contract completed.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Sara, we want you to get some temperature and pressure readings, record your observations, then step outside and record your observations there.\u0022 MSC Control said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Roger that, MSC,\u0022 I said. \u0022Stepping outside the capsule now.

I did what they said, and got back in the capsule, waiting for launch. Fun fact: I was a newly minted Kerbonaut in the K.C.U. space program and I hadn\u0027t even been to space.
