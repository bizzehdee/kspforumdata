Next up Jedwig Jebediah and Rodsy head to Jool for a \u0027footsteps and flag\u0027 style mission to as many moons as they can manage. At least that was the plan. We\u0027ll see how well they do eh?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExpectations\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Forty nine days.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene turned, startled, to see Dunkel standing in the doorway, arms crossed and with his ever-present scowl on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pardon?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A while back you asked me how long it would take to get it ready.\u0022 He said, nodding towards the ship on the pad that Gene had been staring at the last few minutes. \u0022Well, it took forty nine days to get it to there, and she\u0027s as ready as she\u0027s gonna get... unless the Council has deemed we actually have time to spare?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/001%20Jool%20Explorer.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022001 Jool Explorer.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESighing Gene glanced back at the huge construction on the pad. Easily it was the tallest rocket ever built. Perhaps not quite the heaviest, the Munbase launch had been quite a load on the pad, but this was trying to launch everything needed to explore the Jool system and mine it for fuel in one rocket. Gene thought the idea was crazy. Frankly, the whole idea of travelling the length of the Kerbolar system and relying on fuel you mine to get home again... nuts! But he\u0027d been over-ruled by the high and mighty, though there were grumblings in the government about it, even openly. Tension was rising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027d spoken to Sendo last week and the guy seemed burned out. Trying to keep control of the council and avoid it doing something stupid was a full time job, and given what he\u0027d seen this last month Sendo had failed. Of course in the government this was all the Director\u0027s fault, not the council\u0027s fault as a whole. Scape goats. Politics. Gene had pretty much given up the idea of succeeding Sendo, if and when the old guy retired. He no longer wanted that job!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDunkel coughed and Gene realized he\u0027d been lost in thought for a few seconds. Yeah, he was getting old too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sorry Dunkel, a lot on my mind.\u0022 He said turning back to his friend. \u0022No, no extensions on time from the council. We go ahead as planned.\u0022 Glancing back at the ship for a moment Gene smiled \u0022You\u0027ve really outdone yourself though. She\u0027s quite a rocket.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, a lot to put into a small ship admittedly. I like how it\u0027s gone. Still think the safety\u0027s been pushed to the limit though. We need more testing.\u0022 Dunkel put his hand up, forstalling Gene\u0027s rebuttal. \u0022I know, I know! Not going to happen. We have to make do with what we have. Still, it would have been nice to actually prove this thing worked.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027ve flown the test version to orbit and back three times now Dunkel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And revised the design each time Dammit! Come on Gene, you know this is wrong.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a sigh Gene turned back to his Head of Engineering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I know, but we don\u0027t have a choice, and to be frank we may be overly cautious. We\u0027ve flown hundreds of missions and, other than a few mishaps in early orbital launches, we\u0027ve had a spotless record.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not spotless. The munbase was a near disaster, and for what? Badly designed computer hardware.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We still aren\u0027t sure of that Dunkel. Those reports of magnetic fields affecting the ship en-route to the Mun first...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Was beside the point. The docking systems malfunctioned and blew everything to heck. Those docking controllers were just shoddy workmanship, no two ways around it. Yes, the computer problems probably would have affected them without that, but it made the problem a whole lot worse. So far we haven\u0027t had any recent fatal disasters, but we\u0027ve had plenty of non-fatal ones.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a sigh Gene brought a hand up to Dunkel\u0027s shoulder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Look, I hate this as much a you Dunkel, but there\u0027s nothing we can do. Demands have been made of us and if we don\u0027t perform the budget cuts would likely stop any launches beyond the Mun for a long time.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hogwash! The council may cut us back, but the government would over-rule them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022In time, perhaps. But then again, it wouldn\u0027t take much for someone on the council to slurry our name and blame all the failure at our door, not the rushing the Council\u0027s been heaping on us. Then they\u0027d go for the near-Kerbin science missions they\u0027ve always wanted, exclusive of everything else. If popular opinion turns against us the government would be forced to allow us to be downscaled... permanently.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth Kerbals turned to look at the ship before them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I guess I couldn\u0027t really live with me\u0027self if that happened.\u0022 Dunkel said tiredly. \u0022But...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I know, I know.

A lot of the room was taken up with the large hibernation capsules on one side. There were even folding partitions for decency\u0027s sake when getting ready for hibernation. They had simple regenerative life support systems, good for ten days and took over two months to regenerate that life support capability when not being actively used. He hated the idea of relying on the machines to wake them all up. The original designs he\u0027d seen were for cabins with life support that could keep one Kerbal alive indefinitely, and that one would oversee the others in hibernation for the trip. However tests on Kerbals cooped up for a year or more on their own... hadn\u0027t gone well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here he was babysitting two newbies, one of which wouldn\u0027t be with them for long. He surveyed his two compatriots in the seats beside him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELolorf was due to take over from Jebediah on the VKM Two, ferrying fuel from the Mun up to orbit, or to other craft on the surface of the Mun. He seemed solid enough, but was rather quiet. In fact he hadn\u0027t said one word since boarding the capsule. Rodsy, the crew member that would be joining them on the mission, was a different story. Wide eyed and eager, gaping at everything. Jedwig hadn\u0027t left the academy that long ago, but he had plenty of other experience under his belt in aircraft. Even out of flight academy though he hadn\u0027t been that green!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey look!\u0022 Rodsy exclaimed. \u0022They\u0027ve finished connecting the water tower!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh boy, this guy needed to get out more!

I\u0027m trying to work out the flight path.\u0022 Lolorf interrupted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s done.\u0022 Jedwig said. \u0022I double checked it myself when I came in. Here.\u0022 He sent the flight plan to Lolorf\u0027s terminal. \u0022Telemetry was only out a few hundredth\u0027s of a percent. Not bad.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELolorf looked confused, but skimmed Jedwig\u0027s data none-the-less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um, OK.\u0022 He said timidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jool One, this is Flight. All systems are go. Coming up on one minute to launch. Standby.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedwig went through the preflight automatically. After all, this was child\u0027s play! Grinning as he worked, he still had nagging doubts of how Jeb would react to meeting his new \u0027commander\u0027 for the next couple of years. OK, most of it would be in hibernation. Still...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022T minus five... four...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Gene took over the countdown Jedwig settled in, hands on the controls and set up for the flight.

Things were going well for once. The government representatives were gone. Dansey was off \u0027playing with the rover\u0027 somewhere, and Dunkel said he\u0027d finally found where the squeak above the command pod was coming from. He was up in the crawl-space now with a welder trying to iron it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Er... Bob, sir?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurning Bob saw Seanbur at the entrance to the command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Seanbur, haven\u0027t seen you in a couple of days. How\u0027s life on the Mun treating you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, well sir, very well. I... well, I\u0027ve been doing some research, and cross correlating from the adaptive filtered sensors here, the Melvey sats, the Diego Ring observatories and twelve of the...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Seanbur... what\u0027s up?\u0022 Bob interrupted. Sometimes Seanbur got into a rut and wouldn\u0027t shift until you practically kicked him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, yes... well, I think I know what happened to the docking computers.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob sat up straight in his chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Really? What is it? Defective components? That\u0027s what Dunkel is saying. He swears he\u0027s going to rip whoever shipped them a new one. A new what I didn\u0027t ask.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Right, of course sir... but no, that\u0027s not it. The components were stressed, but I think all of that was from the physical damage after the incident. No, the cause was Kerbolar.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Excuse me?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeanbur shuffled in nervously and put a laptop down on the desk in front of Bob. Shown on the screen was a representation of something Bob recognized. The Melvey belts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, magnetics. I get it. You\u0027re saying things got fried on our way from LKO to hear in the belts?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, but that\u0027s the point. We\u0027ve known about them for ages and rated all parts outside the faraday cage of the hull to withstand the magnetic strength we\u0027ve charted. But it\u0027s changed. It looked like we were lucky. Just after we got to The Mun the magnetics reached a peak, then settled down again. If it hadn\u0027t settled quickly the replacement drone that was sent would have been fried too.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s incredible! I didn\u0027t know the Melvey belts changed like that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeanbur paused for a moment, licking his lips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No... they don\u0027t.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m sorry, what? But you just said...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They don\u0027t normally.\u0022 Seanbur interrupted \u0022But I don\u0027t think it\u0027s the belts themselves. I think this is similar to a phenomena I witnessed during my trip to Minmus. The magnetic fields there became lobed, sending peaks of magnetic strength out at different amplitudes. I haven\u0027t worked out the data yet, and I may have to wait for another anomaly to turn up to properly chart it. Somehow the sun is affecting our magnetic fields in intense and unusual ways. We need to know more before we start exploring beyond the Kerbin system.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s a little late for that Seanbur. Jool One has launched and is on it\u0027s way here to refuel and change pilots. I don\u0027t think they\u0027re going to change their minds if you don\u0027t have something concrete. Do you think the ship is in danger out there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I... I don\u0027t know. I doubt it, we\u0027ve only had two recorded events and both seemed focused on planetary bodies. Even though this is a stronger one I...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Stronger? I thought that when you went through the last one there was a danger of radiation exposure from magnetic focusing? Something to do with the Kerbolar wind being channeled? We\u0027ve had no deleterious effects since then and it\u0027s been a month and a half. I think we\u0027d have seen illness or something showing up in the medical checks if it was serious.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well it was serious, but this ship is far better shielded than Minmus One. We were lucky sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob sat back, pondering while he watched Seanbur\u0027s display.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How long do you think the period of danger is? If these events are focused around the Kerbin system at least then Jool One will soon be outside the effect, right?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s the point sir, we don\u0027t know. We barely have any data from beyond the Kerbin system. Four satellites and the Duna mission. That\u0027s it! We can\u0027t be sure these events are all that\u0027s out there. What if they\u0027re struck while the crew is in hibernation? The automatics won\u0027t know what to do with events that weren\u0027t programmed into them and the time delay will get significant as they get further from Kerbin. Mission Control may not be able to save them!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, calm down Seanbur. I know this is nasty, but what\u0027s the chance it could happen?\u0022 Seanbur\u0027s face seemed to crumple. \u0022I\u0027m not saying we ignore this! Oh heck no! But Seanbur, so far we have no real proof. We need to tell the crew of Jool One and Mission Control, but I think things are just going to have to just play out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I... I understand sir.

He began the rather boring step of warming up the converter and getting rocket fuel and oxidizer flowing into the tanks. Over the last month and a half he\u0027d been doing a lot of fueling missions, mostly for the Munar transport when they didn\u0027t make the trip quite as efficiently as planned and didn\u0027t have enough fuel to land back at base. The trip to Kerbin and back took a lot of the fuel and was fairly difficult to do it with full tanks from the surface of the Mun and back again. But that was what this ship was here for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnglamorous perhaps, but fun, and he got to Munwalk as often as he wanted!

Jeb sat back in his couch and dreamed of exploring Vall, Bop and Pol. Their current lander might be capable of Laythe, but that would be pushing it. Doubtful they\u0027d get the go ahead to test that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/014%20Dawn%20on%20the%20Mun.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022014 Dawn on the Mun.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few hours later, fuel and kethane tanks full, Jeb lit the drive once more and rocketed off the Mun.

What if there was a mechanical fault they couldn\u0027t fix at Munbase Alpha? From what Jeb had heard though it didn\u0027t sound like the Council was going to go for that. Flashy Jool missions? Sure. Boring fuel supply ships? Maybe not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, wasn\u0027t his problem now. Lolorf would be the one doing the boring grunt work.

It was over half an hour before he made rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There you are.

Give me a chance will you?\u0022 Jedwig said nervously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrinning he watched Jedwig disconnect from the lander and slide away, clearing the from docking port. As Jool One swung to face him Jeb engaged RCS and slid towards the exploration vessel. Pondering on what he\u0027d thought back on the Mun Jeb wondered if Interplanetary ships would become just as routine in the future? Well, eventually sure. But would he live to see it? Did he want to?

Come on in Jeb.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESliding up and docking the hatch closed, and hearing Lolorf close his docking port, Jeb checked out the extended capsule that he\u0027d be calling home for the next few years. It was a little cramped. One of the new three Kerbal capsules connected to a four kerbal hitch-hiker pod, but with a lot of the space taken up with three hibernation pods and their control equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, best get to work.

We\u0027ve recently had an anomalous magnetic flux in the Kerbin/Mun system and he believes it may have been responsible for the docking malfunction when the Base landed last month.

Jeb didn\u0027t deign to notice him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Come on Bob, what\u0027s the worst that can happen? We get a little toasty. As I recall the cabin\u0027s been radiation proofed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not proofed, shielded. And the water blanket won\u0027t stop all kinds of radiation, and even the types it can stop it won\u0027t protect against a large strike. Seanbur is worried that either radiation, or the wierd magnetic fields themselves, might damage computer systems outside the protective layers. If something affects the computers while you\u0027re in transit... well, your guess is as good as mine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wait... Seanbur... magnetic flux...

Seanbur just seems to have been lucky... er, unlucky I guess. Anyway, others have corroborated his findings on Minmus, and I\u0027m sending his current data back to be checked too. But just take any extra precautions you can. Shut down non-essential systems, make extra backups of software, that kind of thing.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point Jedwig, tired of being ignored, slammed his palm onto the comms switch (with a wince.. that thing could be sharp if you catch it wrong), and butted in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t you worry about it Alpha One.

Rodsy coughed a couple of times to get attention, then spoke up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um... we will get a little warning won\u0027t we? Won\u0027t the radiation, or magnetic fields, ramp up slowly? I mean, as long as we have warning we just shut everything down and we\u0027d be fine.

It will stop it messing with active signals, but a strong enough field will generate electricity in the circuits randomly, frying the system. No, the best bet would be to beef up the faraday cage of the hull, plus some solid material to protect versus radiation.

He sighed, but unbuckled and got up from his seat. This ship was only the second one to have a real airlock. The first being Munbase Alpha itself. Jool One had the conventional hatch near the controls up top, but then further down, alongside one of the three hibernation pods, was the airlock leading to the side of the ship.

But at least most of it would be asleep in hibernation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/021%20Rodsy%20couples%20struts%20up%20for%20transit.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022021 Rodsy couples struts up for transit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was over eight hours later when they hit their burn time. Jeb was a little worried. Apparently Jedwig had had a long conversation with Milton and they\u0027d come up with a faster trip than the originally planned one. True, they weren\u0027t on line for a Hohhman transfer so it had to be higher than usual, but this? Over two point seven kilometers per second delta v? KSC had signed off on it though so Jeb went along with it. It made their trip considerably shorter, but now they had very little reserve. They had to get the mining lander working quickly once they arrived or they\u0027d be out of fuel. Not a pleasant thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nagging thought of what Seanbur had warned them about kept buzzing in Jeb\u0027s head as he got the ship battoned down for transit. However, there wasn\u0027t really a lot else they could do other than what they had. Unless they took a detour to the asteroid belt, found a comet, rigged up some extra pipe blankets around the ship, melted some ice in... that was way beyond what they were kitted out for on this trip and would have set them way behind too. No-one had even rendezvoused with an asteroid as yet anyway. Who knew how difficult it would be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, for now they just had to double check everything and hope it all went well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Primary life support system and the backup both check out fine.\u0022 Rodsy reported from his console. \u0022We\u0027re at ninety two percent efficiency at present. Lander systems aren\u0027t tied in so that gives us... maybe nine days life support.\u0022 he clicked a few buttons. \u0022With the lander systems tied in that gives us... about sixteen days. That\u0027ll be ample once we wake up at Jool for a rendezvous with Pol for refueling.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yup.\u0022 Jeb agreed. \u0022And it looks like propulsion is all set too. Lander systems look good.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb had checked them out manually on EVA \u0027just to be sure\u0027 on Jedwig\u0027s express order. He hadn\u0027t questioned it that time. It was only sensible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well,\u0022 Jedwig said finally. \u0022I think the controls systems are also fully operational. Computer and backups all have had their systems wiped clean.\u0022 Both Jebediah and Rodsy looked aghast at Jedwig. \u0022What? Oh come on! It\u0027s just a little joke. Some people have no sense of humor!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb pushed himself down into his seat and buckled up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If you call that humor!\u0022 He muttered, but louder he continued. \u0022OK, warming up main systems. Checklist.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERodsy called up the checklist and Jedwig and Jebediah slowly get things verified.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Main initializer... check.\u0022 Jeb said tiredly a few minutes later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pump feeds one through four on Main drive.\u0022 Rodsy read out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Turbopumps one through four... green.\u0022 Jedwig reported. \u0022That looks like it. OK...\u0022 He flicked the comms on. \u0022Flight, we\u0027re about ready here. First launch window is in... two minutes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey had two more backup launch windows later on with the current burn schedule. With all the checks good though it looked like they were going with the first one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Best of luck Jool One.\u0022 Gene\u0027s voice wafted across the cabin. \u0022Kod be with you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Amen!\u0022 Jeb muttered as they prepped for acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this they\u0027d go into hibernation and when they awoke they\u0027d be over two light minutes from Kerbin. Communications would be awkward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last couple of minutes were tense. They were all well aware that no Kerbal had ever gone as far as they were going, and this was pushing things to the limits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I just wish Wernher had got the nukes working in time.\u0022 Jeb said under his breath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022With the way the Council is rushing us it\u0027s no wonder he didn\u0027t have time for it. Still, our engine is pretty efficient. Don\u0027t worry, we\u0027ll get there intact, even without any LV-Ns.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb raised an eyebrow. Jedwig was being nice again. That usually meant he was scared. Not a good sign.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022T minus five... four...\u0022 While Gene\u0027s voice read the count down Jeb double checked a couple of things, just to be sure, then tensed. \u0022two... one... ignition!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/023%20On%20their%20way.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022023 On their way.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drive lit and over half a gravity hit them roughly after their long hours in freefall.

OK, this was weird. \u0022I mean, OK, normally he doesn\u0027t let me get away with stuff, but he\u0027s... well, jovial about it. Right now he\u0027s more agressive than I\u0027ve seen him in a while.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERodsy managed to quell the urge to say \u0027Probably just realized he\u0027s stuck with you for the next few years.\u0027 A silence drifted with them for a few seconds, and eventually Rodsy found something tactful to say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um, yeah. Does seem like it, with you at least.\u0022 OK, not that tactful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hmmm, maybe you could talk to him about it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERodsy quirked an eyebrow at his commander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Seriously? I\u0027ve known him all of the four weeks of training we did for this mission and that\u0027s it.\u0022 He glanced up to the other end of the cabin where Jeb sat in the co-pilot\u0027s seat doing flight calculations to see if their trajectory was correct. \u0022Besides, I\u0027m not exactly the person you want for that. I tend to... blurt things on occasion.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA grin on Rodsy\u0027s face belied his inner qualms. He wanted to be friends with people, and he really tried. It was just he tended to say inappropriate things at odd times. The fact that Jedwig hadn\u0027t freaked already just meant he\u0027d realised this over the last few weeks training with Rodsy. Dealing with Jeb\u0027s shenanigans had given Jedwig a somewhat hard shell against such things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, just keep an eye out. I worry for him.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedwig didn\u0027t catch the look of abject disbelief on Rodsy\u0027s face and instead just waved absently and floated back up the cabin to the pilots couch to finish his post flight checks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, weirder and weirder.\u0022 Rodsy muttered and went back to his checks on the hibernation pods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright. Jeb? You get the one by the airlock on the dorsal side.\u0022 Jedwig proclaimed when they were all ready. \u0022Me and Rodsy will take the ventral ones. That means the bottom ones.\u0022 He added, rather to the annoyance of Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb didn\u0027t comment, being rather reticent for a change and he shifted in the awkward, one piece med-link body suit. They all wore them to send data to the ship\u0027s computer about their health during the hibernation period. Didn\u0027t make them comfortable though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, remember, according to our seminars the down cycle... going to sleep thing... only takes a few minutes. It\u0027s the up cycle, waking, that\u0027s going to take a while. Be prepared to cope with the disorientation and stamina loss.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally Jeb would have been both surprised Jedwig was going to the trouble of telling them these things again (since it wasn\u0027t only for his benefit) and annoyed he was going over the same things that KSC had drilled into them for their training. Now however he just felt drained. Almost as if he\u0027d already been through the damned pods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah. This bothered him. His whole metabolism was going to be slowed down to a crawl and his body put into artificial, slow life support. Anything went wrong with the systems and... he\u0027d never wake up. True, he lived with danger and the threat of death every day, but that was something he could fight, something he had the skills to deal with. This? He\u0027d never even know it if it happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShivering despite the raised temperature in the cabin he stepped into the pod, twisted around, and started going through the connection ritual the docs had taught him. Soon he was in (and Rodsy nearly done too opposite him) and the canopy hinged shut with a faint hiss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t worry you two.

Why weren\u0027t we woken sooner?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Critical?\u0022 Jeb gasped, somewhat more with it, the adrenalin kicking in. \u0022How critical?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedwig pulled himself down into the seat and strapped in, starting to skim data screens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t get it. There was some kind of fault according to this... quite a while ago. One hundred and eighteen days!?! An alarm went out then too. We should have been woken ages ago!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What kind of fault?\u0022 Jeb said, pushing himself up, a little shakily, towards the co-pilot\u0027s seat alongside Jedwig. \u0022Brains, speak to me? Come on, what\u0027s wrong?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m getting power spike readings... fifteen times during the trip. Oh no. Is this from Seanbur\u0027s magnetic fields or something? Mostly nothing happened all these times, the system coped. Once... I think it\u0027s affected the central power regulation system first. That one didn\u0027t get flagged. Then the one a little over a hundred days ago it affected the RCS system. We got a nudge off orbit and the alert was triggered.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEyes scanning across the screen Jedwig looked panicked while Jeb seemed to be getting calmer. This at least was familiar enough to him and he could do something about it... at least probably. He started going over his screen, monitoring the trajectory and seeing what the damage was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, looks like we\u0027re heading directly to Jool. As in \u0027head on collision\u0027. We\u0027ll need to burn radially, if that means much on a direct impact course, to bring us into an aerobrake... it doesn\u0027t look good. It\u0027s going to use most of our fuel just to get the aerobrake to bring us to any altitude!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, let me do it.

It wasn\u0027t external.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth looked at him as he waved a circuit board over his head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What is that?\u0022 Jedwig said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is the power regulation controller for the primary bus. It\u0027s the wrong model.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESilence hung in the cabin for quite a few seconds. Eventually Rodsy broke it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It looks like someone miss-typed the requisition for the system. One digit. 045 rather than 043. The system is close, works most of the time, but about one time out of a hundred when it activates it bombs out and puts the power system briefly to maximum output. Power spikes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re saying...\u0022 Jeb said, aghast at what this meant. \u0022... This was... from a typo? Someone didn\u0027t check it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What do you expect?\u0022 Jedwig said sullenly \u0022Consider how much we were rushed to finish this thing!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith resignation Jeb sank back, letting his belts pull him into his seat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The Council just killed us.\u0022 He muttered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We are NOT dead yet!\u0022 Jedwig said, suddenly fierce again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time Jeb didn\u0027t contradict him. They had work to do!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took nearly an hour to figure out the exact problem and make a jury rig around it. The spikes still happened but with an L.C. board plugged in it damped the effect, minimizing the effect to other systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, while Jedwig plotted the burn, Jeb contacted KSC to give them the bad news. Seems they already knew from on-board telemetry streamed back to KSC. They hadn\u0027t noticed early on as Kerbin\u0027s radio telescopes couldn\u0027t accurately position such a small object as Jool One at extreme ranges, but once the errors were noticeable to Jool One\u0027s own computers they tried to waken it\u0027s crew remotely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say it hadn\u0027t worked. Something had been overloaded by the power spikes and signals weren\u0027t getting through to the hibernation chambers. They were left to their own devices and just woke the crew at the appointed time anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene was horrified, not only that this could have happened but that the problem was traceable to misappropriation. What was worse was that a couple of months after the launch The Council had bent to pressure from the government and had dialed back it\u0027s expectations... and unfortunately also it\u0027s funding allocations. Things were scarce right now, even if the frantic pace had been cut back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So basically we\u0027re left to our own devices.\u0022 Jedwig said dejectedly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Come on Bra... Jedwig.\u0022 Jeb said carefully. \u0022We have a burn to do, then an aerobrake to perform. We\u0027ll make it, and after that we need to sort out which moon to go to to refuel us!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowly Jedwig nodded and they started working things out. KSC called back while they were running the last sims.

Poor Kerbals must have starved to death on various moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERescue Vessel Launch\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene stood at his picture window in his office and stared across towards the VAB and the frantic activity around it. For months he\u0027d been praying for more funding to build ships, and now he had it. It was true what they said. \u0027Be careful what you wish for... you might get it!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Knock knock!*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ahem, er Flight Director?\u0022 Came the familiar accented voice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Come in Wernher.\u0022 Gene said without turning around. \u0022I take it this isn\u0027t a private matter. Since when have you called me \u0027Flight Director\u0027?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ach, well, yes... Gene... I\u0027ve run into some problems.\u0022 Gene\u0027s head turned round and looked sardonically at the nervous looking scientist. \u0022I know, I know. Nothing compared to what they\u0027re facing.\u0022 He said, nodding his head skywards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene sighed. Things had been rather hectic this last two days since the word came through that Jool One was stuck in a low orbit. Well, two thousand kilometers was low for a Jool orbit anyway. First recriminations, though surprisingly few from the Council. Next finger pointing, with the obligatory talk show presentations from all sides. Now... cash. Of course it came with strings attached. Frankly the limitations were ludicrous. \u0027Bring them back quickly before the public gets nasty\u0027 must have been scribbled in at the last moment on the thick memorandum (you could hardly call a three hundred and fifteen page work a simple \u0027Memo\u0027) that came from the government, but it was an apt summary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, of course they\u0027d bring them back quickly. Life support problems alone dictated that. The problem was no matter how much fuel you threw at a problem it was simply a long way to go. With the electrical problems they still weren\u0027t absolutely sure the life support hadn\u0027t suffered during the trip. At present it was hovering at a little over eighty percent efficiency, which was good. No telling how fast it would drop when put under full use for more than a couple of days though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um..\u0022 Wernher continued, breaking Gene\u0027s train of thought. \u0022We have a tentative design put together, planned to get there in one hundred days.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene suddenly turned around and gaped at Wernher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A hundred days? How in heck did you manage that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher shrugged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Honestly? The budget went up, so we just upped the size of the rocket. Right now design plans are for a nine hundred ton unit, assembled at the launch pad.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, that was incredible. Even the Munbase ship had only been a little over five hundred tons!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And we can build that? Reliably?\u0022 Wernher nodded. \u0022Good god, if we\u0027d only had that kind of resource to throw at Jool One this wouldn\u0027t have been the...nasty problem we have now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027d been about to say \u0027Disaster\u0027 but managed to stop himself. Can\u0027t think like that! We haven\u0027t lost anyone in space in over ten years! Not going to start now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Herr Director? I don\u0027t think it is helpful to think like that.\u0022 Wernher said,echoing Gene\u0027s thoughts \u0022We have what we have and have to make do. At present the Council seems to be attempting to make sure no blame sticks to themselves. I say we just do the best we can and ensure the same for ourselves.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene couldn\u0027t help but notice that, despite some mannerisms, Wernher seemed to suddenly have lost most of his accent. He decided it wouldn\u0027t be helpful to point this out right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, so a hundred days there. I take it that will be a quick trip back too?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, it\u0027s using approximately seven thousand dv to get there, but it is carrying very little in extraneous weight. We actually have three K-sats attached in the designs at present to alleviate the need for the mothership to venture to each world and spend time scanning. Right now time is of the essence, yes? Well, the vessel is mostly fuel tanks, three of the new LV-N\u0027s we\u0027ve been testing these last few months and one skipper to assist with launch. I\u0027m not sure whether to have the skipper detach to save weight or not. Having a high thrust propulsion system on the craft later might be advantageous and it doesn\u0027t loose that much from the added weight.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher coughed, looking more nervous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What is bothering me more, \u0022 he continued, \u0022is that to get that schedule it needs to use most of it\u0027s fuel to reach Jool. Again we will be dependent on the lander to mine the return fuel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We based the entire Jool One mission around that philosophy Wernher. Why change now? No, if we can get it to them faster like this all the better. It will take much less than a hundred days to reach a moon and refuel there, even assuming a lot of landings and launches.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022True, but what I worry about are those multiple landings and launches. This is a big ship and will need many trips by the lander. Current estimate is between ten and twelve journeys. That is a lot of trips and in a short period of time. The lander has ten days of life support for it\u0027s occupant and the longer it is used the more chance it has to go wrong. Beyond that there are hundreds of chances for mechanical problems with the lander that could happen every time it launches or lands. The more they need to do the bigger the risk.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I think they can handle that side of it. Jeb\u0027s been doing this for a long time, and Jedwig... well, despite his shortcomings he is a good pilot. I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll pull through that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Only one of them. As I said, there is minimal equipment beyond engines and fuel tanks on this and for it to carry the lander the main Jool One craft will have to be left in low Joolian orbit. The other two will hibernate again and wait for the ship to refuel and return. Then the fueler can undock from the lander and dock to the Jool One and carry it home. It\u0027s engines are much more efficient that those the Jool One possesses.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I see, so someone is going to have to stay awake this whole time huh?\u0022 Gene pondered Jedwig\u0027s reluctance about Jeb\u0027s acceptance of command authority. He wouldn\u0027t want to let Jeb roam around alone most likely. \u0022I think we know who that will be.\u0022 He said with a glum face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelying on Jedwig to do that kind of mission... not ideal to say the least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Things will turn out OK sir, I know they will. As you can see the teams are already building the scaffolding for assembly, even though the rocket has not yet been even started construction on yet. I did assume I had the go ahead to do that?\u0022 Gene smiled and nodded. \u0022Good. Vell, I think zat covers it. I vill get back to the design laboratory and zee vhat I can do to tveak it a little, Ja?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene had to resist the temptation to chuckle at Wernher. Sometimes he was really weird with that accent of his.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Er, yes. You do that Wernher. I\u0027ll certainly sign off on your design. I know I can count on you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a friendly pat on the shoulder Gene showed him out and sighed. Now, again, he didn\u0027t have much else to do than stare down at the VAB as the activity continued to increase. Soon he\u0027d be busy again as this whole base got working once more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe just hoped they\u0027d be in time to save Jool One and it\u0027s crew!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/030%20Emergency%20fuel%20transport.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022030 Emergency fuel transport.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDunkel spat on the pavement and crossed his arms as he stared at \u0027The Abomination 2\u0027 as he liked to call it (He\u0027d talked to Bob about that of course). Ending up over a thousand tons in mass, just the orbiting section had a total of ten thousand eight hundred delta v, and had taken over a month to build (Now they could take the time to do it right!). It also included three Kethane scanning satellites to check out moons of Jool, and the whole rocket was entirely automatic. Well, once it got beyond remote control range anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven from down here he could see, way up on the top of the ungainly mass of tanks and struts, a faint light blinking from the new, improved mechjeb unit. Apparently it could now automatically adjust for atmospheric drag and predict orbital courses after aerobraking, and even where your sorry piece of junk was going to crash after being lightly crisped after re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least that was the way he\u0027d described it to Gene. Dunkel didn\u0027t think Gene had got the joke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Isn\u0027t it beautiful?\u0022 a young voice said from behind him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDunkel turned slowly to see... oh, what was his name. That geek from Mission Control... Ipswich? Iphop? Ipdel, that was it Ipdel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh, yeah.... beautiful.\u0022 Dunkel said noncommittally as he turned back to Emergency Fuel Transport One as it sat on the pad. \u0022So, you gonna be flying that... ship?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIpdel nodded enthusiastically, still staring at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Was I ever that green?\u0027 Dunkel wondered to himself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How long before it goes autonomous? I mean, signal degradation alone\u0027s a problem much beyond the Kerbin system and the whole light speed signal delay... Huh!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe young electronics specialist quirked an eyebrow at the elder engineer questioningly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um, about twenty to twenty five million kilometers we\u0027ll start to get significant degradation. Enough that we can\u0027t get the bandwidth for full navigational readouts in real time. Theoretically we can still control it further out and allow for both bandwidth limitation and signal delay, but realistically there is a threshold when...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDunkel glazed over. Good god that Kerbal could talk! He heard odd words wash over him. S-plane analysis. Signal to noise ratios. Intermediate frequency shifting. Phase analysis... OK, Dunkel knew what they were, he was an engineer after all! Though he was self taught. This kid... this was just over the top!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022... And allowing for current planetary configurations it\u0027s not optimal. I mean Kerbin is in opposition to Jool right now, leaving a signal delay of over four minutes! The ramifications of just current problems from data analyses from Jool One have been just...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes... OK...\u0022 Dunkel butted in a little harshly. \u0022I just... realized I have to... be somewhere. Wow, would you look at the time? You take care Ipdel. Be seeing ya!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaving happily, with perhaps a little too much of a fixed grin on his face Dunkel strode off towards the VAB. Ipdel stood with a smile, waving back till he was gone. Then he let out a sigh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Dang! I thought he\u0027d never leave. Almost ran out of stuff to say! Sheesh!\u0022 he muttered, shaking his head and then heading towards Mission Control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022T-Minus Five... four... three...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIpdel stared fixedly at his displays, full monitoring equipment relaying everything to his terminal from EFT-1. The last countdown settled and he watched the prefeed on the fuel lines steady, then reach full pressure. With a glare the ignition system lit and the engines flared, vibrating under the huge structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Liftoff!\u0022 Gene\u0027s voice echoed into Mission Control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/031%20Launch.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022031 Launch.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey could feel the vibration from here as the huge rocket blasted off the pad. It shook a bit, and Ipdel worried that the fifth stage tanks were vibrating too much. Would the connections hold?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowly it rose from the pad and gradually gained speed, inching into the sky atop a blaze of smoke and fire. The big screen and all the smaller side screens showed various views of the massive craft as it headed ever upwards. A minute later the twelve solid rocket \u0027helpers\u0027 separated from the still roaring fifth stage, effectively making a semi-sixth stage all it\u0027s own, and the craft\u0027s acceleration slowed, but only briefly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIpdel held his breath almost as he watched the figures. Frequencies of oscillation were stabilizing between tanks. That wasn\u0027t good! They did not want resonance to amplify anything. But the vibrations didn\u0027t worsen and soon the ship started to turn over. The fifth stage was a big one, huge tanks linked to nineteen Skipper rocket engines. The ship actually went into it\u0027s gravity turn before that stage was done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/032%20Last%20booster.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022032 Last booster.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt thirty seven kilometers altitude the fifth stage was finally done and Ipdel watched nervously as the readings suddenly jumped, a heavy jerk translated through the ship as they were jettisoned. Another explosion (controlled thank Kod!) echoed from the sky as the fourth stage kicked in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIpdel leaned back, letting out a heavy sigh. The hard part was over, the rest was a more normal flight and he started to relax. It was going to work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good job people!\u0022 Gene said proudly. \u0022Now lets get this thing heading to Jool.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/033%20Another%20high%20speed%20transit,%20they%20didn\u0022 alt=\u0022033 Another high speed transit, they didn\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-27T16:04:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2014 04:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Patupi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EExtra \u0026#039;Have\u0026#039;... at least no extra have nots. :)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T10:09:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProblems\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet again Jeb struggled awake, the stickiness, the unresponsiveness of his body, and... oh yes... the pain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uuuuurrrgh!\u0022 he groaned, shuddering as much as he could given his lack of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t worry Jeb.

I haven\u0027t seen all the data yet, just read the summary in that last recording. Seems the triple secure remote wake up call worked.

The new ship, even on a bad phase angle between Kerbin and Jool, had traveled the distance in less than a quarter the time they\u0027d done it in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/034%20Rendezvous%20with%20Jool%20Explorer.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022034 Rendezvous with Jool Explorer.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, EFT One was entering the Jool system, preparing to aerobrake automatically and use the new atomic engines to match orbits with Jool One.

It could have held enough fuel to take us directly home.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um...\u0022 Jedwig said, while Jeb still fumed. \u0022Haven\u0027t reached that bit yet.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedwig was going over a review of \u0027KSC Update #142\u0027 and attempting to pass on the relevant information to the crew. After a few minutes Jeb decided the slight twitch Jedwig was developing in his right eye was probably a bad sign.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK... do you want the good news or the bad news?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb groaned and found himself doing a perfect, zero gravity face palm.

The young kerbonaut was still not quite his rosy self after his brief bout of space sickness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, seems they had to work fast to get here as early as they did so our life support wouldn\u0027t fail before getting back to Kerbin.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s the good news?\u0022 Jeb groaned. \u0022What\u0027s the bad news?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That even as fast as they are going, our life support is going to be taxed when we wake up at Kerbin orbit finally. We\u0027re going to have to do the final maneuvers rather carefully with only a few days awake, or rely on KSC to remote guide us in if any course changes are necessary.\u0022 Jedwig said slowly. \u0022Right now, if we completely refuel the ship via mining and head home on immediately it will probably be something like another... maybe two hundred day journey home. The extra mass of Jool One slows the ship basically. Best guess is we\u0027ll have at most three days of life support when we wake.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But our original plan called for us to take a little over three hundred days to get back to Kerbin anyway. Isn\u0027t that about the same, all told?\u0022 Rodsy said nervously. \u0022We were supposed to have almost seven days life support by then.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, if everything was working right. Something must have been stressed by all the power spikes. KSC thinks our life support is fading faster than planned, but no-one is exactly sure how long we have on it. This is all estimates at present.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESilence drifted in the cabin along with the three Kerbals for a while as they digested this. Finally Rodsy broke it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, at least we have a plan now. Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027ll work!\u0022 He said with a grin, though perhaps not quite as cheerful as it usually was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was nearly three days later when EFT One edged in to Jool, with Jeb monitoring the aerobraking. Right now they were relying on Jool One\u0027s own life support as much as possible, not taxing the lander\u0027s, so they had maybe six more days before they had to hibernate again. At least two them would have to. One had to fly the lander. The decision about who that would be still hadn\u0027t been made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022She looks good.\u0022 Jeb said, watching the reports as EFT One started it\u0027s dive into the green sky of Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/035%20Aerobraking%20with%20new%20Mechjeb%20planner.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022035 Aerobraking with new Mechjeb planner.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn his monitor flames licked across a camera view from the port side of the ungainly ship. It seemed stable and on a pop up window a plot showed the advanced Mechjeb\u0027s predictions of orbit interception after aerobrake, still plotted at a hair under two thousand kilometers apoapsis, just meshing with their own periapsis. Unfortunate that the orbits coincided like that. It would have been better if they could have matched at Jool One\u0027s apoapsis, but you couldn\u0027t have everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA sudden whistle of amazement jerked Jeb a little. Jedwig had been watching over his shoulder apparently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wow, over eleven kilometers a second? That\u0027s a heck of a speed to be tearing into the atmosphere. Can it withstand that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Once, yeah. Ablative material on the underside, though the engines themselves can withstand a good deal more than that as far as the raw heat is concerned. They may be slightly ablated on the external sections of the nozzles, but there are ablative shutters to protect the main parts of the engine bell. It\u0027ll be good. Luckily the dive back into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at the end of this will be a good deal less frenetic. Though it\u0027ll likely wreck the engines even then. We\u0027ll probably have to use Jool One\u0027s engines to stabilize the orbit there.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedwig nodded. He\u0027d been rather quiet this whole time since waking. Jeb had come to know him quite well and realized there was something on his mind. He\u0027d been letting it slide, hoping he\u0027d open up, but now with rendezvous nearing Jedwig had been getting even more withdrawn. Jeb had an idea what this was about and it was probably not a good idea to let it go any longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So...\u0022 Jeb said cautiously. \u0022Who\u0027s flying the lander?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first Jedwig didn\u0027t answer, just grabbing the hand-hold near his seat beside Jeb and pulling himself to float beside him. When Jeb looked up he saw Jedwig staring out through the window at the sight of Jool\u0027s atmosphere, it\u0027s storms seemingly frozen from their point of view. Anyone dunked in them would disagree when they felt four hundred kilometer an hour winds, but out here at this distance it looked serene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes.\u0022 Jedwig said finally, still staring out the window. \u0022I\u0027ve been meaning to talk to you about that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah felt himself tense. He\u0027d put off thinking of a third batch of hibernation, the horrors of putting his life in a damaged machine\u0027s hands again, but realized it had been unconsciously weighing on him. Yeah, of course Jedwig was the natural choice for the position wasn\u0027t he? With the computers possibly compromised, and here they had a guy who could do most of the calculations without the computers anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh god, he was going to have to under again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re going to have to do it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first what Jedwig said didn\u0027t register, then Jeb gaped at him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What?\u0022 he managed weakly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedwig turned to face his second in command and Jeb could see fear in his eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ve done a solo mission to another planet Jeb, and that one went as planned. It\u0027s not... pleasant.\u0022 The guys hands were actually shaking slightly. \u0022I work best in a controlled environment, with lots of information to make decisions on, lots of... well, lets say Duna was not actually \u0027fun\u0027 for me. I did it, but I can\u0027t say it was my skill that pulled it off.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowly he pushed himself round to look at Jeb straight on and he gulped slightly, obviously his mouth dry as he licked his lips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You thrive on the unknown Jeb. You launched on rockets before they even knew what the properties of the upper atmosphere were, let alone the Melvy belts or conditions in orbit in general. You can take an unknown situation and run with it, manage things on the fly and have proven you\u0027re good repairing ships off world as well, should anything go wrong.\u0022 He paused for a second. \u0022I hate to do it, as I\u0027ve been running the numbers.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb\u0027s brow furrowed for a few minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What do you mean?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Our best bet is Bop. Lightest gravity here, a small body with the likelihood of kethane deposits near the surface slightly higher due to less convection in the mantle of...\u0022 Jedwig paused, realizing he was switching into \u0027science explanation mode\u0027 and visibly reigned himself in. \u0022Well, best choice anyway. But even with that it\u0027ll take a few days, probably two or three, to get there, then a lot of landings and launches to refuel EFT One. KSC estimates ten such trips.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain Jedwig paused and Jeb began to see where he was going with this. Oh Kod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah,\u0022 Jedwig said, seeing realization spread on Jeb\u0027s face, \u0022it looks like the whole trip, out to Bop, refueling then returning, will likely take about thirty days. The Lander\u0027s life support at the moment can sustain one person for ten.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That... is a problem!\u0022 Jeb managed weakly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUn-noticed on his monitor, clear of atmosphere once more, EFT One automatically made it\u0027s maneuvering burn to finally tune it\u0027s orbit to coincide with Jool One. The crew had less than a day till it arrived to figure out how to get the Lander and it\u0027s pilot to last long enough to get the fuel back to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/036%20Showing%20off%20the%20new%20nuclear%20engines.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022036 Showing off the new nuclear engines.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T19:02:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEFT Rendezvous\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/037%20Final%20adjustments.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022037 Final adjustments.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt had been a hectic day as they struggled to bolster the life support of the little lander. The only way they could do it was to push it past it\u0027s limit, and this meant the life support would likely fail completely after it\u0027s stint out at Bop. That was fine, they would dump the craft when it got back to the Jool One anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Is it going to be enough?\u0022 Rodsy worried, for at least the tenth time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Honestly, we don\u0027t know.\u0022 Jedwig said nervously. \u0022The system is not meant to be used like this. But aside from the unknown life support duration the whole thing could just catastrophically fail. Increasing tank pressure to 200% isn\u0027t disastrous in itself. There\u0027s a danger of leaks or explosion, but it\u0027ll get used up and get down to a reasonable pressure soon. The other issues are what worry me. The catalytic disassociators running on high voltage. Air and water pumps with safeties removed. The electrification of the filters in attempt to clean them in-situ. It\u0027s all very nasty. Things could go horribly wrong part way through.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe was a dry chuckle from behind the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Aww, you\u0027re just saying that to make me feel better.\u0022 Jeb said as he suited up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, a failure in just one system could snow-ball and cause the whole thing to collapse. On reserve air you\u0027d last a day, tops. Barely enough time to get back here from Bop on a high speed transit. Assuming you\u0027d mined enough fuel by then to attempt that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb stared back at Jedwig and nodded slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I know.\u0022 He said softly. \u0022And thanks for caring.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedwig blushed and coughed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t be ridiculous! I just want you to bring the fuel back! Without it we\u0027ll be stuck here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA grin crested Jeb\u0027s face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Of course Brains, of course. I\u0027ll believe you.\u0022 and he winked before he slid his helmet on and fastened it tight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedwig just stared back as Jeb finished getting ready, then the Commander turned to the panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Looks like EFT One is on final approach. Best get out there. Last exterior check and all.\u0022 He said, his throat dry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure boss. Keep a seat warm for me.\u0022 Jeb said and kicked over to the airlock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/038%20Jebediah%20takes%20a%20look.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022038 Jebediah takes a look.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutside Jeb did a cursory check of the Jool One just to be sure everything was OK. The crew could check it themselves before they went back into hibernation. Off in the distance he thought he could make out a faint moving dot. Was that the EFT One? Probably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hmm, be here soon. Best get started.\u0022 He muttered to himself, then activated his flight pack and jetted away from the vessel, over to the Lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/039%20First%20separate%20the%20Lander.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022039 First separate the Lander.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn first inspection it all seemed pretty good. He could see where they\u0027d cut and welded in a couple of extra heat sinks for the primary power bus they\u0027d installed. Once plugged into the EFT One that should be able to handle the extra power for life support needs at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few minutes later, after going over every modification they\u0027d done this last day, he could see the \u0027dot\u0027 in the distance gain substance. Yup, that was definitely the EFT One. It was slowing down. He RCSed his way to the Lander hatch and opened it up. Fairly familiar little thing used on most of KSC\u0027s small one kerbal ships. With a little wriggling he slipped down and into the seat that would be his home for the next month. Not exactly comfortable, but it\u0027d do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/040%20On%20his%20own,%20the%20others%20hibernate.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022040 On his own, the others hibernate.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, I got EFT inbound. Plot says it\u0027s about two minutes from matching speeds about four hundred meters off our port side, starboard for you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb looked and saw the ship, still mostly a dot, moving in, flickering slightly now with the faint emissions of the nuclear drives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m about ready here. Switching on the upgraded life support and disconnecting from the Jool One system.\u0022 He said, then paused with his finger over the switch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe closed his eyes and flipped it, then heard a faint thrum from behind him. Dials turned, numbers altered on the main panel, then the exterior connection shut down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It works!\u0022 He said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t sound so surprised!\u0022 Jedwig bit back. \u0022I designed most of it!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ahh, then my ghost will have someone to blame then? Good.\u0022 Jeb said jovially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only response he got from Jedwig was a grunt. Rodsy spoke up then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, Jeb sir? We\u0027re just about ready to undock here. Just waiting for the EFT to park. Want to be sure the automatics work OK.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutside, to Jeb\u0027s right he saw the dot gain shape, the engine exhausts slowing as it came closer and got slower. Finally, it\u0027s acceleration diminishing, it slid to a stop, the glow from it\u0027s engines dying down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That looks like a bit more than four hundred meters.\u0022 Jeb said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedwig reluctantly agreed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I think the computer decided it was unsure of conditions and went into safe mode.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t fret. I\u0027ve enough fuel and tons of RCS.\u0022 Jeb said. \u0022I\u0027ll get there.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few more double checks Rodsy released the clamps and the mag lock and the docking ports uncoupled. Slowly Jeb gave a burst on the RCS and the Lander slid away from Jool One.

Doing post flight checks before going out to lock the docking ports in tight.\u0022 Jeb said, chuckling to himself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You sound way too happy for someone heading off into a very risky enterprise Jeb.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, I\u0027m flying a ship further from Kerbin than anyone has ever before. Why shouldn\u0027t I be happy?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Fine, but snigger about it on your own time will you?\u0022 Jedwig said shortly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, spoilsport!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb leaned back and took a minute to just relax. It was nice to just be alone for a change after being stuck in that small cabin with Rodsy and Jedwig. But, he did have work to do so after a way too small a break he popped the hatch (he hadn\u0027t bothered to pressurize it) and went out again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe EFT looked a rather blocky somehow, but he welcomed the three probes sitting out there. At least he wouldn\u0027t have to sit and wait for his ship to scan Bop, and he could do another couple of moons too. The plan called for Laythe and Vall, the most likely for the next mission to visit. Yes, the next. They hadn\u0027t quite discussed it, but all on the Jool One crew knew their original plan to check out the various moons was a bust. They didn\u0027t have enough reliable life support duration to risk it, even if he brought enough fuel back from Bop. And the last thing they needed was to use fuel up on landings, then find they had to go back to Bop to refuel again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/044%20Now%20to%20strut%20it%20up.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022044 Now to strut it up.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he jetted around his new craft he got the tools ready to lock down the KAS struts. After Rodsy\u0027s attempt to re-link the Lander and Jool One after refueling in Mun orbit, Jeb was rather adamant he\u0027d do a better job (He still thought it was more to do with Jedwig\u0027s docking than anything Rodsy did though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took quite a while to tie together all the struts, and half way through he backed off and looked down on the ship he had now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/045%20Isn\u0022 alt=\u0022045 Isn\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not bad Dunkel, not bad at all.

It looked like the power readouts from the solar panels read maybe two thirds of what they\u0027d expected from these things according to the notes Dunkel had left with the EFT\u0027s computers. With power settings like that it was likely it wouldn\u0027t charge up well in the daylight while orbiting moons. He\u0027d have to be careful with it\u0027s orbit to maximize power input. Hmm, maybe he could adjust the other two sats and move some of their panels into a grouping on one side? That\u0027d get more power available to charge the batteries.

Jeb hadn\u0027t really appreciated it during his last EVA, as focused on the EFT as he was. Now he was glad for some time alone with the planet. The wisps of white on green were mesmerizing and he had to force himself back to the task at hand. Solar panels! Come on Jeb, get with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe took the one he\u0027d removed from K-sat two and slid to the other side of the little satellite and welded in place behind the other two on that side, then rigged up a cable to link it into the satellite\u0027s power network.

Once back in the cabin he only released and launched K-sat two, that would head for Vall. The one for Bop he kept on board. The Vall window was a little ways off, but Bop was coming up. However, to get a good trajectory for Bop he\u0027d have to do some fancy flying. Doing it twice, once for the K-sat and once for his ship, really didn\u0027t appeal to him. So he left it connected to the EFT while he plotted his course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis fuel was... well, not critical, but tight enough, so he was careful to leave himself plenty of spare for final course changes at Bop.

Jeb wasn\u0027t worried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the initial burn to leave LJO was over he laid his head back and took a rest.

He\u0027d woken, a fast fading dream of running after Jedwig who for some reason he couldn\u0027t catch up to, despite him being asleep at the time. He shouted but Jedwig wouldn\u0027t wake up! He much preferred that other dream he had on occasion. The \u0027all you can eat desert menu\u0027 on Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of sleeping some more, or at least trying, he filled his time with various checks on the course and a few cat-naps here and there. He even sent a few messages back to KSC, but with the time delay measured in minutes it was rather monotonous conversation. He was pretty much alone out here. But soon enough he reached his first moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe. Couldn\u0027t see much yet, but still the little blue ball was welcoming. Someday he\u0027d set foot on that moon, but right now he had to do some science while he could spare the time. When he got low things would get rather hectic, doing his burn and trying not to crash as he passed by. That last bit was rather important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/048%20Probe%20investigates%20Laythe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022048 Probe investigates Laythe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst he monitored the satellite that had gone in ahead of him as it headed into it\u0027s own aerobraking maneuver, while at the same time warming up the science package on the Lander. While instruments examined Laythe from afar he gave a few tweaks to K-sat One\u0027s course so it should get a nice polar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/057%20Science.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022057 Science.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe report from \u0027Junior\u0027 was a little alarming. This little lander didn\u0027t have the extensive radiation shielding around the capsule that Jool One did. It wasn\u0027t really designed for long term habitation! Still, so far it seemed tolerable, and he wouldn\u0027t be in Laythe SOI for long anyway. Out at Bop the levels should be way lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/049%20Aerobraking.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022049 Aerobraking.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy now the K-sat had started it\u0027s atmospheric approach and Jeb got ready to do some real-time course adjustments if needed. Watching the little remote guidance screen he could see it start to edge into the outer reaches of Laythe\u0027s atmosphere, and soon flames began to course around the tiny craft. It didn\u0027t have a dedicated heatshield, but the speed of entry wasn\u0027t steep and the engine coped quite well with the moderate heating. The tiny craft slowed rapidly, then left the air of Laythe surprisingly un-exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s engine worked quite well for circularization, though it\u0027s orbit wasn\u0027t aligned with the terminator. With it\u0027s solar panels not as efficient as planned, and without Jeb\u0027s emergency fix for the other two sats, it would brown out on the dark side before getting power back on the light side, and not enough power to fill the batteries before night time descended once more. He couldn\u0027t do it now as he was too busy, but later he\u0027d tweak the orbit to be over the terminator with what fuel was left in the satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/056%20Oberth%20effect%20burn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022056 Oberth effect burn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill it did work though it would take twice as long to scan the whole moon for Kethane. The other satellites should do better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it was the Lander\u0027s turn to head into Laythe and he focused on the timing for his burn at periapsis. This would be tricky. However he was interrupted by something special. Blue light flooding into the capsule as it rotated and he gazed up as Laythe swam into view. This close the view was even better than Jool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/058%20Here%20we%20go.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022058 Here we go.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe definitely wanted to come back here! Still, no time just sit and gaze! He got back on the controls and readied for the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was a tricky one, a few seconds here or there and he could dip into the atmosphere and wreck his course adjustment, and his later meeting with Tylo. Such complicated courses helped a lot in getting trajectories on low fuel, but they tended to amplify little adjustments into huge variances in the end. He just hoped Rodsy was right and he was good enough to manage this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERacing in at breakneck speed the lander swung past Laythe quickly enough that he could easily see the moon swelling and moving against the background stars as he plotted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENearly there. Nearly....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ignition!\u0022 he said aloud and tripped the safety switches, letting the nuclear engines of the EFT let rip once more.

Mainly as the craft didn\u0027t have that much mass, it\u0027s fuel mostly gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe edged around the curve of the moon, the oxygenated atmosphere calling to him, wanting to pop in for little visit. Jeb resisted stoically. Um, was he feeling alright? Shaking his head and attempting to keep his mind on the business at hand he watched the maneuver dv drop till finally he cut the drive and sighed. He\u0027d stayed out the atmosphere and was on course. If he needed any further minor corrections he could do it outside the Laythe system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not bad if I do say so myself.\u0022 He said, chuckling... then wondered who he was talking to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlinking Jeb coughed and tried do some checks on the ship.

It should leave him with plenty to circularize and land on Bop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, not a lot to do at all...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb twiddled his thumbs for a few minutes then started rummaging in whatever was in the locker. Snacks of course, but beyond that there were only a few magazines, scientific periodicals unfortunately. Well, it was something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027d read them all... twice... before he arrived at Tylo. Unfortunately it was just a bland hunk of rock, and his flyby was a bit too distant to really see much detail so he checked his course, set his alarm for when he left Tylo\u0027s SOI, then took a nap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe beeping woke him abruptly, for a moment Jeb not knowing what emergency that alarm was for... till he remembered it was just a timer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Son of a...\u0022 He sighed, switched the alarm off and fixed his seat straps. \u0022Hmm, not bad. On course pretty much.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than a few tiny adjustments he left the ship alone and went back to sleep. Several times he woke to... well, strange dreams. Several times when he went to sleep he got this horrible, nagging suspicion that he shouldn\u0027t go to sleep at all. That something would happen to him if he did. Still, the longer he slept the longer his life support would last. A sleeping Kerbal uses far less air and food.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last day before Bop he could barely sleep at all. A combination of fear, nervousness and anticipation pretty much wide eyed and shaking the whole time... or it could have been the five bulbs of koffee he\u0027d drunk that \u0027morning\u0027. Not that there was a different between morning noon and evening here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally though he was heading into Bop orbit. He prepped the last K-sat, still sitting on it\u0027s decoupler on EFT One, and planned his circularization burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBop. Very little was known about it. Vall and Laythe, and even Tylo, had received quite a bit of attention from astronomers, but Bop and Pol were too small to really make much detail out from Kerbin. He made sure to record as much in the way of images as he could on the way in. As he slid closer and closer Jeb felt more and more uncomfortable. As if there was something he should be doing and had forgotten. Something important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShrugging it off he turned his attention to the burn and ignited the atomic engines once more, braking slowly, but easily into a steady orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There, finally I can get started on fueling.\u0022 He said to himself. \u0022Oh... right. First the K-sat.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe had no clue where to land right now, so that was pretty important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/061%20Last%20probe%20to%20polar%20Bop%20orbit.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022061 Last probe to polar Bop orbit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK-sat Three separated easily and a few short burns cleared the EFT and Lander, then he set up a burn to flip it\u0027s axis so it went over the poles. The little engine ignited once more, the exhaust visible through his hatch window for a few moments, before it zipped out of sight. Only after it\u0027s orbit was stabilized did he remember that he should have waited to get it into an orbit over the terminator!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/062%20Beep%20beep%20beep.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022062 Beep beep beep.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Humph! Well, at least with the panel moved it should be OK.\u0022 He muttered, then aligned it so the panel he welded on was pointing at the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrace began to read off as it scanned across the surface of the little rock and Jeb set a continuous feed into his data-banks so he\u0027d have the planet\u0027s Kethane plot. He was about to go to sleep when he realized the pass he had on the scan plot while his ship had been sliding into orbit showed an equatorial strip of data... and right in the middle was a Kethane deposit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Huh, lucky.\u0022 He said softly, then grinned. \u0022Right then! Time to get going.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a click he separated from the EFT and felt the shudder as the docking port released. Going through the check list as he drifted clear of the EFT One he made sure everything was working then plotted the burn for descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/063%20There\u0022 alt=\u0022063 There\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What d\u0027ya think of that Brains?\u0022 He said, turning to his left... and his face dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat was he doing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a shake he got focused again and watched the altitude drop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on such a small body was odd, but not really a challenge. True, he hadn\u0027t even got to Minmus yet, but he\u0027d run sims for it and this was even lighter. Drifting down he checked his fuel levels repeatedly, but there was ample for this. Perhaps too much. He needed to cart as much up to orbit as he could each time so next time he\u0027d try with a lighter load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/064%20Low%20gravity%20landing.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022064 Low gravity landing.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few more tweaks and a check on the Kethane map and he slid across the dull, brown landscape. Why was this so ordinary looking compared to the Mun? I mean, thinking logically the dull grey of the Munar soil should be the \u0027ordinary\u0027 stuff, and this brown soil the unusual. He guessed it reminded him too much of Kerbin soil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few jets from engines and RCS thrusters matched speeds with the surface and he extended the landing gear. Slowly drifting down he managed to find a flat bit of ground... though not level unfortunately. The angle wasn\u0027t huge, but probably would have been too much in normal gravity. Gently the legs hit dirt and the little craft shuddered, bounced a couple of times, and then settled. Jeb had to tweak the SAS unit to get the ship to stay level. It wanted to sit on two legs, the other stuck in mid air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmiling he leaned back and cracked the hatch. This was where he\u0027d be for most of the next couple of weeks. Gonna be a long time! The view wasn\u0027t particularly inspiring and he wished he had better reading material. Still he hopped out and slid down the ladder to get some samples at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/065%20Filling%20the%20tanks.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022065 Filling the tanks.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrouching on the ground, scooping brownish sand into a little pot, Jeb stopped and sat up. Why wasn\u0027t he thrilled with this? This was what he had dreamed of for over a decade! He was the first to set foot on a moon of Jool! The first to make boot-prints here so far from home.... and yet something marred it, made him want to curl in a ball and just sit in the lander while the mining equipment worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of which... With a scowl he closed the sample container up and bounded back into the lander. Yeah, here he hardly needed ladders. Almost didn\u0027t even need RCS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb settled back in his acceleration couch, engaged the mining system and waited. He didn\u0027t even monitor the drill and it was only after the instruments noted that Kethane was filling the tanks that he remembered he should be checking that the head wasn\u0027t wearing or over heating. Blinking he just sighed and turned on the convertor and went to sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027d never felt so alone before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/066%20This%20will%20take%20a%20lot%20of%20shuttling.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022066 This will take a lot of shuttling.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlasting free of the surface as soon as he could Jeb felt a little better once he reached orbit. The docking maneuver seemed a little laborious, but hardly difficult. Soon he was filling EFT One\u0027s tanks and he pushed it a little, leaving less on the Lander this time, then... back down again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was going to get monotonous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was over ten days over Bop, \u0027Bopping\u0027 up and down, and that sent him well beyond the safety margins on the life support, and with the refueling nearly finished that Jeb began to wonder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid Bop hate him? Every time he landed he felt irritable, annoyed, but mostly full of despair. Back in orbit he started to feel, well, a little better. He knew he\u0027d been feeling bad when he got here, but this was way worse. Maybe there was something on the little moon that was affecting him? Some rare element that made Kerbals insane?... Was he insane? He didn\u0027t think so, but then, would a crazy kerbal think he was insane?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDown he went again, forcing himself to be happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yay!\u0022 He said in a depressed tone of voice\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t seem to be working. As Jeb touched down for the last time he stared out the window and tried to remember why he was here. What was wrong with him? Jeb activated the drill and converter then popped the hatch. He wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep and be done. Just get out of here and... why was he so desperate to get out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb paused. He most certainly did NOT want to go back into hibernation again, and that was what awaited him.... why was it that whenever he was down here he desperately wanted to be somewhere else? Something had done this to him, it was affecting his mind! Aliens, must be. Something out here was trying to get rid of him!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYanking himself out of the hatch he drifted down to the surface and yelled out to anyone who could hear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well you\u0027re not gonna get me! I\u0027m staying here forever! HA! SEE HOW YOU LIKE THAT!\u0022 and he started jumping because... well, he had no clue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/067%20Jeb%20practices%20flying%20on%20one%20landing.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022067 Jeb practices flying on one landing.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrinning like a maniac he yelled and screamed and surprisingly felt much better... Then realised he was acting like an idiot. With a few stuttered steps he bounced to a halt and looked around. He had yelled to an alien in a vacuum. An alien?!? What had he been thinking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the moment the panic and fear had subsided but still this place seemed creepy to him so Jeb climbed back up the ladder and got back in the lander. He sat in the little capsule and watched the numbers climb, waiting the tanks to be full. It was a long wait, and while he waited the fear returned, full force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the time came he just hit ignition and retracted the drill during the ascent. To hell whether it damaged it or not!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like the last times as he climbed into orbit the panic retreated and Jeb started to think a little clearer again. What was doing this? Wait, was that his insanity talking? Looking for \u0027aliens\u0027 to blame this on? He struggled to remain in control of himself, keep calm and sensible. Forget all this nonsense about aliens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince his launch had been a little, spontaneous, he had to adjust his orbit a fair bit to meet up with the EFT. Eventually he got there and docked and pumped in the last load of fuel. Soon he\u0027d be free of this horrid little lander. He hadn\u0027t thought it bad to begin with, but with what he\u0027d been through inside it he\u0027d be glad to be rid of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/068%20Nearly%20full.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022068 Nearly full.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe took a few minutes of peace to just collect himself. The mounting panic was gone, but still that lingering fear and dread remained, but with an effort he quashed them. Gotta stay focused! Plotting the return burn a little more directly than his outbound course had been he waited for the launch window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Jool%20Explorer/068%20Heading%20back%20to%20Rodsy%20and%20Jedwig.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022068 Heading back to Rodsy and Jedwig.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETen minutes later the engines lit and he heaved a sigh of relief. As he started to accelerate out of orbit he felt his fears abate, like a warm wind washing over him. This whole experience seemed more like a nightmare than a dream come true. To land on such a body so many time just for... wait.... did he?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb blinked glancing out the window back towards the little brown lump that was Bop. He\u0027d landed twelve times on that horrible moon and never once put a flag down!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gahhh!\u0022 he vented, then shook his head as he at least set some of the science instruments going. Best not to waste the opportunity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as he was about to sit back in the couch something caught his attention, like a raindrop sliding across the window... but it seemed too far away.
