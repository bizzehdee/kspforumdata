Fit for rendezvous and Kerbin orbit operations. Kerbal scientists think it probably has enough Delta-V to do a simple Munar fly by if you\\\u0027re really efficient, but that\\\u0027s not what it\\\u0027s meant for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is some launch vehicle information:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn launch, you\\\u0027ll have about 2,552.672 m/s of Delta V to get you very high into the upper atmosphere. There are four engines on this stage called \u0027Outboard Engines\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thrust to weight ratio of this stage is 1.957 fully fueled. Meaning you can expect a MINIMUM G-force during this burn of a little under 2 G\\\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the fuel depletes, however, the G\\\u0027s build up. Peak G comes right before fuel depletion and subsequently before staging. The G\\\u0027s will then peak to approximately\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.2 G\\\u0027s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell survivable, of course. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe full mass of the launch stage is 44.875 and the empty mass is 20.875.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe total Engine thrust is 860.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can expect an approximate average Specific Impulse on this stage of about 3,433.5 or 350 seconds..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis stage should cut off at about 96 seconds based on the mass fuel flow rate calculations. It will not be exact, however, as the engine ISP actually increases with altitude when the atmosphere becomes thinner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, after staging, you\\\u0027re down to the Orbital Insertion stage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe total mass of the vehicle after staging is then 12.375 with an empty mass of 6.375.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will have a full engine thrust of 200. The thrust is vectored, which helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine ISP is about 3629.7 or 370 seconds now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has a thrust to weight ratio fully fueled here of 1.647. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsequently, you can expect a minimum G force of 1.647 when this stage burns at full throttle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximum G force if this stage gets all the way to fuel depletion at full throttle will be just under 3.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a picture:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xveMf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xveMf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EDOWNLOAD\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76061308/Aquarius%20Rocket.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/76061308/Aquarius%20Rocket.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T09:49:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel the desire to ask an obvious question: Why a zip file for such a simple vehicle?
