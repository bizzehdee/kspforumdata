How this can be controlled? After it expells fissionable materials, reaction occurs outside spacecraft. So you have no controll over strength of reaction, right? It might disperse quickly without reacting much and in another case reaction might be stronger. Isnt it kinda random?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd woulnt it require some kind of shielding from structural stress for spacecraft, like with orions pusher plate? It seems to be continuous fission explosion so it woudl be rough to spacecraft, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T15:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, all rocket engines are a controlled explosion, so yes they do have to be mounted to the vehicle in a strong enough manner to transmit that force. That\u0027s not a big deal though, aircraft are dragged through the air by their engines, and engine pylons don\u0027t have to be enormous either. Given that the force is (hopefully) strongly pointed in one direction you\u0027re talking about fairly linear compressive and tensile stresses, which aren\u0027t too challenging to deal with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T15:57:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut what is signifcant about this drive is that most of reaction occurs outside of craft, no in some kind of combulsion chamber.

It all has to do with the neutrons. In order to sustain a nuclear chain reaction you need to produce a sustained population of slow (or thermal, in the technical jargon) neutrons. (Yes, that\u0027s right, slow neutrons, not fast. The faster a neutron is travelling, the less likely it will be absorbed into a U235 atom.) So the idea with the NSWR would be to store the fuel in a tank that is filled with a matrix of neutron-absorbing material, like boron-impregnated plastic. This would prevent the neutron population from increasing enough to produce a chain reaction. When the fuel is injected into the combustion chamber, the water in the fuel would act as a moderator, slowing down the neutrons produced by the fission events, allowing them to produce more fission events, and leading to a chain reaction. Once the heat from these reactions transforms the water into steam, the water will no longer be dense enough to act as a moderator and the nuclear chain reaction will stop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, I still wouldn\u0027t ride in it. Any leak of fuel would have the potential to produce an accidental reaction (essentially a criticality accident). This would produce a steam explosion near some location which stores the fuel, which would lead to more uncontrolled fuel release, which would lead to a Very Bad Day. I\u0027ll stick with good-old NTRs, thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T16:18:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with Nuclear Pulsed Propulsion isn\u0027t that the reaction is happening outside the vehicle, it\u0027s that you\u0027re using a very large force periodically, instead of a lower constant force.

The fuel would get critical only inside a reaction chamber, and most of the energy would be released there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put it simply, nuclear fuel is usually not very radioactive, and doesn\u0027t react much by itself. When a fissile atom receives a slow neutron, it sometimes disintegrates, releasing energy, fission products, and a few neutrons, but these released neutrons are too fast to cause other fission events.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you put hydrogen, deuterium, carbon or a few other things in the middle, neutrons bounce off them and slow down, increasing the chances of causing more fission. It\u0027s called moderation, it obviously increase the power output, and it\u0027s very difficult to do properly because a bunch of things will absorb neutrons instead. When one spontaneous disintegration causes on average more than one other fission, you reach criticality, and you get a lot of power (nuclear bombs or power plants need that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of a properly designed nuclear reactor is to make as much stuff react while in the reactor. Typical nuclear reactors us solid fuel, which means they have to keep the concentration low (to burn slowly) and accumulate waste (which often absorbs neutrons, killing the reaction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA salt-water reactor can use nearly pure fuel (if it can keep it from going critical when stored), can achieve much higher burn rate (less non-fissile junk, waste is ejected) and higher temperature (no need to keep the fuel and its container solid, the whole chamber can be made of graphite). Once the water is out of the chamber, concentration will fall quickly (expanding exhaust), moderation will stop (no graphite to slow the neutrons) and the waste will absorb neutrons. As a result, the reaction will grind to a halt. Of course, the exhaust will be radioactive, which means you can\u0027t use it everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T16:29:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, i think you put your finger on the problem with this reactor, Thesaint \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Especially as space travels could be threatened by micrometeorite impacts - a single perforation of the fuel tank would be catastrophic indeed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alchemist","CreatedById":8825,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T16:34:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs in case of combustion heat from the reaction zone heats the newly fed fuel components to the temperature they start actively react, in this system neutron flux from active zone should kickstart reaction in newly fed fuel to rates similar to nuclear explosion (that further exponentially growing chain reaction would release most of the energy in fraction of second). The good question though is piping leading into the reaction zone - you\u0027ll have to ensure the fuel won\u0027t go off before being injected into reaction zone because of all that neutron flux from there (as with any explosive monopropellant). Another question is ability to throttle (or if the continuous reaction will be stable only at some specific fuel flow rate) and the ignition procedure (that\u0027s always an issue, especially if the thing doesn\u0027t allow much throttling)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T16:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI went back and read some of the references from the Wikipedia article.
