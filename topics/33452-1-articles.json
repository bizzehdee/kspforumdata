I finally cracked down and bought it after playing it for a while to support the dev team for a great game! So far the KerBush Space Program is in it\u0027s infancy and has yet to land on the Mun. I have Jebediah orbiting the planet however, and have repeatedly sent a rover to the Mun which has crash landed on it\u0027s final entry 4 times now. Going back and slightly modifying my design I think I have it down now with plenty of fuel(My biggest issue was running out of fuel while trying to land and coming down to hard). However my piloting skills are shoddy at best so I slammed into the Mun last night after dropping my rocket and not expecting how easily the rover portion would then turn hah. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways a great game and happy to be here, I will probably record my first attempt to land a kerbal on the Mun for laughs!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T16:33:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
