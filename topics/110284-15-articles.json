I\u0027m excited about the update. Any release date yet?\n\nAs soon as I fix a few bugs. I\u0027ve learned not to give time frames so it\u0027s done when it\u0027s done. Unfortunately, that\u0027s the best answer I can give.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, it seems that even if it does, it weighs almost twice as much as the stock lab. Again, if the rocket parts cost reflects the enhanced utility of the other configurations, then those configurations should be what requires the most parts, just a basic inflatable version of the science lab should be lighter than a stock science lab because it lacks the structural elements, and is balanced by the fact that you need to set it up.\n\nIt should be the same mass in the current release, actually. The template is supposed to set the mass to 3.5t once you switch to the science lab. I\u0027ve maintained that RocketParts is an abstract representation of the stuff that you fill the structure with. Things like desks, chairs, lamps, computers, etc...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E My main questions I have here after following this discussion of weights, rocket parts etc etc...\n\u003E  1) If you have issues with carrying the rocket parts with you, why not build them on site instead? This mod gives you the buildings you need in order to do that without having to carry a massive amount of parts...\n\u003E \n\u003E  2) If you have issues with weights of any of the structures, again, why not build them on site? Using the Workshop from the Ponderosa or the Clockworks from the Hacienda, you can build out your entire base by simply harvesting the materials you need and building everything there without having to carry very much at all.\n\u003E \n\u003E The costs to convert the buildings are fairly reasonable, especially as you start gaining experience with your engineers/scientists and the ability to switch functionality of any part you want is a HUGE advantage to have in the field and reasonably should cost a fair amount in order to utilize. I\u0027ve been playing with this mod since before Angel added in the costs to swap the buildings and not once have I encountered an issue where I was looking at the costs and wondering why they were so high. This also applies to the weights of the structures since I no longer carry them with me and instead build on site.\n\nI will also reiterate that the mod is still in development. Today for instance I fixed a couple of bugs and evened out the part costs for various templates. here\u0027s a breakdown:\n\n[TABLE=width: 842]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Template[/TD]\n\n[TD]Mass(t)[/TD]\n\n[TD]RocketParts[/TD]\n\n[TD]\\*[/TD]\n\n[TD]\\*\\*[/TD]\n\n[TD]\\*\\*\\*[/TD]\n\n[TD]\\*\\*\\*\\*[/TD]\n\n[TD]\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*[/TD]\n\n[TD]Equivalent Part[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Clockworks[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]5[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]2000[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1800[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1600[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1400[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1200[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1000[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Doc Science Lab[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]3[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1200[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1080[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]960[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]840[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]720[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]600[/TD]\n\n[TD]Mobile Processing Lab (3.5t)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Fireworks[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]5[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]2000[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1800[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1600[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1400[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1200[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1000[/TD]\n\n[TD]EL Workshop (15t)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Pathfinder Geology Lab[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1.5[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]600[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]540[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]480[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]420[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]360[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]300[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Hot Springs[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]7.5[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]3000[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]2700[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]2400[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]2100[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1800[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1500[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Ironworks[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]5[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]2000[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1800[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1600[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1400[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1200[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1000[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Pigpen[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1.5[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]600[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]540[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]480[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]420[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]360[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]300[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Ponderosa Habitat[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1.5[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]600[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]540[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]480[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]420[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]360[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]300[/TD]\n\n[TD]Hitchhicker (2.5t)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Prairie[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1.5[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]600[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]540[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]480[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]420[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]360[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]300[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Sunburn Lab[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]3[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1200[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1080[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]960[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]840[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]720[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]600[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Watney Chemistry Lab[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]3[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1200[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1080[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]960[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]840[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]720[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]600[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Blacksmith[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1.5[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]600[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]540[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]480[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]420[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]360[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]300[/TD]\n\n[TD]OSE Workshop (2.5t)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n To me this is a good balance between the initial cost and the adjusted cost with a skilled specialist.

Been anxiously awaiting your LS interpretation so now I REALLY can\u0027t wait! \n\nAs for the Ironworks I fully agree about sandbox - it works fine and really isn\u0027t an issue there and I was mostly looking at it from the career perspective. Do you know if it is possible to make things mode sensitive? As in, would there be a way to put the Ironworks out there that presents different configurations based on which mode you\u0027re in? I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s even possible much less how difficult it may be to pull off but was curious if that could be done.\n\nAn alternative also might be to reconstruct the template and make the different pieces become available according to tech level. Kind of along the lines of Ironworks\u002BProduction opens at Advanced Metalworks, storage gets added with Meta-materials...something like that. Based off what I\u0027ve accomplished toying around in templates so far I \\*think\\* this might work but I\u0027m not sure.

Specifically, it updates the Chuckwagon and it adds optional life support templates that will appear if you have a life support mod installed. Pathfinder supports TAC Life Support (the gold standard of life support), and Snacks out of the box. Other life support options are possible; just read up on how to edit a template file on the wiki. You may also want to check out the MM\\_TACLS.cfg and MM\\_Snacks.cfg files for examples. Additionally, you can now generate power using the Hot Springs Geothermal Plant. Keep in mind that it\u0027s maintennance intensive, a bit finicky, and not 100% efficient on all worlds. You also have the Solar Flare Experimental Fusion Plant and it\u0027s also a bit ornery. Together the Hot Springs and Solar Flare represent the upper end of Pathfinder\u0027s power options- lower-tier options are in the works. Finaly, the Ponderosa Habitat is now more than just a placeholder... if you have kOS installed.\n\nChuckwagon\n\n- You can now science the kraken out of the Chuckwagon and convert it into a greenhouse.\n\n- Added front and side attachment points.\n\n- Added temporary IVA. IVAs are on backorder.\n\n- Added airlocks.\n\nTemplates\n\n- You can now retool the Blacksmith to use RocketParts instead of MaterialKits, just like the Clockworks.\n\n- More than just a habitat module, the Ponderosa template is also used as a command and control center. The template now provides support for kOS if you have that mod installed and if you\u0027ve researched Precision Engineering. kOS is great for creating power management scripts; it works best with Action Groups Extended.\n\n- Added the Pigpen Recycler to the Ponderosa. With a life support mod, it has some useful recyclers.\n\n- The Geology Lab now shows the current efficiency improvements for Science, Industry, and Habitation- based resource processors for the current biome.\n\n- Added the Hot Springs Geothermal Plant to the Hacienda. Hot Springs generates lots of power but it is maintennance intensive and can break down. Don\u0027t want it to break? No problem, just use the Settings window to make parts unbreakable. It\u0027s available after you\u0027ve researched High-Powered Electrics.\n\n- Added the Solar Flare Experimental Fusion Plant. It\u0027s available after you\u0027ve researched Specialized Electrics. Like the Hot Springs, it too can break down or be set to unbreakable in the Settings window.\n\n- Did a balance pass on the templates. Some weigh less and need less RocketParts than before, others are more expensive. Skilled Engineers give discounts to inflate/reconfigure modules.\n\nModuleManager Patches\n\n- Relocated the MetallicOre, Metals, and Ironworks MM patches for Extraplanetary Launchpad to a central file called MM\\_ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads.cfg. This will make it easier to modify Pathfinder to support other production chains than the EL standard MetalOre-\u003EMetal-\u003ERocketParts.\n\n- Added MM\\_TACLS.cfg and MM\\_Snacks.cfg patches to configure Pathfinder to use TACLifeSupport or Snacks, respectively.\n\n- Added MM\\_CommercialSciLab.txt, an optional MM patch that will enable the Doc Commercial Science Lab\u0027s lab functionality on all parts with lab modules. Simply rename MM\\_CommercialSciLab.txt to MM\\_CommercialSciLab.cfg if you want to enable this functionality.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n- Fixed an issue where the module info window would not properly show the template decal.\n\n- Lights should now properly turn themselves off when deflating a part.\n\n- You won\u0027t be able to turn on the lights when a module is deflated.\n\n- Resource converter efficiencies are now being calculated properly.\n\n- Fixed an issue where converting storage to a battery was reporting incorrect values.\n\n- If you stack a box of RocketParts onto a Ponderosa and try to inflate it, the Ponderosa will now properly check to make sure it has enough parts.\n\n- Drills will now remember the correct resource that you switched them to.\n\nRecommended Mods\n\nTACLifeSupport: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40667-1-0-2-TAC-Life-Support-v0-11-1-20-5Apr](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40667-1-0-2-TAC-Life-Support-v0-11-1-20-5Apr)\n\nSnacks!: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90841-1-0-2-Snacks!-Kerbal-simplified-life-support-v0-3-5](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90841-1-0-2-Snacks!-Kerbal-simplified-life-support-v0-3-5)\n\nkOS Scriptable Autopilot System: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68089-1-0-4-kOS-Scriptable-Autopilot-System-v0-17-3-2015-6-27](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68089-1-0-4-kOS-Scriptable-Autopilot-System-v0-17-3-2015-6-27)\n\nAction Groups Extended: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74195-1-0-4-%28Jul09-15%29-Action-Groups-Extended-250-Action-Groups-in-flight-editing-Now-kOS-RemoteTech](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74195-1-0-4-%28Jul09-15%29-Action-Groups-Extended-250-Action-Groups-in-flight-editing-Now-kOS-RemoteTech)"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T06:15:45Z","Content":"That .txt to .cfg for the labs is awesome.

The Buckboard and Ponderosa now have stack nodes on their topside, so I could make stackable static solar panels that also snap together. They could also be mounted to a saddle, and the rover might gain a connector port.
