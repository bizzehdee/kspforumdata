One would think that for Gilly it would help having the softest possible suspension, but it doesn\u0027t...you just keep bouncing, without touching the controls, like a high-bounce rubber ball. Having some dampner should stop this, but minimum spring is also dangerous as legs like to *poof* when they are compressed all the way\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-09T08:49:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2017 08:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Blaarkies\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-09T08:26:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222980369\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157291\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221489032976\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153700\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blaarkies\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Blaarkies said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChange the \u0022spring strength\u0022 on the legs.

So for a still standing base on Kerbin, lowering this will lower the amount of weight the leg can support...it will give in more, the base will end being lower to the ground(on Minmus, that same base would stand high, since weight is much less there). Think of spring as the thickness of the spring inside the landing leg\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDAMPNER is the same as for shock absorbers. They stop the legs from springing up and down repeatedly(they limit the speed at which the leg may extend). Maximizing these wont make the static base stand higher, but you will see it slowly sinking down to the spring strength\u0027s height. Think of dampner like a lot of friction inside the legs, so they can only move slowly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
