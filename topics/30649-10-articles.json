It\u0027s always been bizarre to me how a magic beam in orbit can detect the deposits, but then we use gravimetry to find candidate deposits of lots of minerals here on Earth so there\u0027s precedent. These only expose candidates though, and false positives are common so the certainty of a deposit size and location being immediately visible doesn\u0027t seem right. The idea is the same for any resource (H2O, CO2, whatever).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real payoff though is exploring these candidates (including the false ones, yay!), and this is where I see this plugin coming in handy as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFrom orbit, find candidate sites for resource\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESend probe to collect sample either by:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbal on EVA (high payoff, since they can select better samples than automated rovers)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERover (limited by available fuel/part endurance)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELander (limited to immediate vicinity of lander)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EImpactor and supporting orbital observer (depending on deposit type and depth) - probably out of scope here but mentioned for completeness\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EInitial analysis \u003Cem\u003Ein situ\u003C/em\u003E on-board the lander (if it survived, and your kerbal did too if applicable \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOn Kerbin (better payoff than lander as implies better equipment)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEach extra step gives higher proportion of accessibility to resource in question and/or eliminates false positives, e.g. A Kerbal returning a sample to the lander for analysis (but leaving them behind as too heavy) and an unmanned probe return samples to Kerbin might have the same benefit, but nothing beats a Kerbal returning a load of samples to Kerbin that have already been identified as extra interesting thanks to pre-analysis in the lander.\u003Cbr\u003EMost of these would likely require collaboration with Kethane development, but makes for a much more interesting (and realistic) exploration/exploitation experience.
