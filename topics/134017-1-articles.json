The downside to this approach is that the SMA will drift slightly whenever a satellite is made the active vessel, and will need to be reset, but that\u0027s a form of station keeping that I\u0027m much happier with than constantly tending to my satellite network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"charlesjto","CreatedById":160211,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-12T07:45:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do understand that satellites will eventually drift, the orbital period (according to mechjeb) was within ~30 secconds of 1 day on each of them.

Wish I could find it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse RCS and or a thrust limited ANT engine to get \u0026lt; 1 sec error... Also, once you get it ~1sec, if you rotate the craft, even just using reaction wheels, you can throw off the period by as much as a couple of secs or more... So if you want a satelitte to orient in a specific direction (this is mainly for aesthetics, since physically pointing dishes does nothing, like in RL), for example to point a dish or scanner always at Kerbin, or to always point at the sun, its best to orient it in that attitude, THEN use RCS/ANT for fine period adjustments (this means taking this into consideration during satellite design \u0026amp; construction), and when you get \u0026lt; 1 sec, just leave attitude and orientation alone.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(also, the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/102277-10x-persistentrotation-102/\u0022\u003EPersistent Rotation\u003C/a\u003E mod helps with that)...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: Actually, if you havent seen this, you should take a look (this isnt the \u0022chart\u0022 I remember seeing, but it\u0027s listed on the RT tute, so it must be legit:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech/tutorials/keo/#optional-steps\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech/tutorials/keo/#optional-steps\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont know if its a linear equation for those calculations, but if it were, then 30 sec error would only last 40 Kerbin DAYS...

In your case, if you dont mind warping all your other craft/missions, till they align again, once they are, THEN you can possibly attempt to make adjustments to the periods if you still have a means of maneauvering the sats...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-12T17:50:17Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2016 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"charlesjto","CreatedById":160211,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-12T20:51:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 2nd picture in my original post is only ~20 seconds game-time before the following picture, I\u00A0find it highly unlikely it could have drifted that far in 20 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn regards to using the ANT engine, my satellites were equipped with Dawn electrical \u00A0engines, which as far as I know have the lowest thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you though Stone Blue for showing me that chart of orbit tolerances.
