I know some basics though... Swept wings offer decreased drag at sub-sonic speeds, straight wings offer increased lift but lots of drag as the speed increases... Delta, not sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now I\u0027m designing aircraft meant to get to most/all of the biomes on Kerbin in the 3x Harder solar system. This means extended range and flight time. I have an experimental 4 engine jet that can get 8-10 hrs flight time (get there and back BTW) at 12,000m. Its a Delta wing design, and I did reach mach 0.86 at level flight. It might get faster as it looses fuel.... could probably also climb faster. I doubt AJE has supersonic jets in the .625m size so upgrading may be out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeriously guys, some pointers on wing design please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-13T01:39:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSwept wings offer reduced zero-lift drag at subsonic speeds, and generally reduced drag (even with lift) at transonic and supersonic speeds, but offer less lift at the same angles of attack, greater drag due to lift at low subsonic speeds, and introduce very strong dihedral effects that you might not want.\u00A0 Straight wings are as you said, delta wings are basically the same as swept but with a much lower taper ratio and sweep angle (technically, true delta wings must have a taper ratio of 0 to have their wingtips come to a point).\u00A0 Tapered wings always have benefits over non-tapered wings, so tapering is always something you should do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your goal is maximum range, you don\u0027t want delta wings or supersonic flight, but transonic is fine.\u00A0 You want to build something that looks like a boring-as-hell jet airliner.\u00A0 If your goal is maximum speed, then you should probably stick to delta wings.\u00A0 In either case, you want to area-rule your plane to decrease transonic and supersonic drag as much as possible, but that\u0027s less to do with wing design and more to do with have the fuselage account for wing shape and tail placement.\u00A0 If you\u0027re going to try and keep your speed below about Mach 0.6, you shouldn\u0027t bother sweeping wings at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sovek","CreatedById":57251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-13T03:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEssentially the goal is decent range\u002Bgood speed.
