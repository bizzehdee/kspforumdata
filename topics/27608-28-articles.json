That an asymmetric CoM might be causing my issues was just a theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing a little more research, it actually looks more likely that the crashing was due to a bug with units flexing more/less based on the order in which they were placed, that has been around for years now (it\u0027s the reason so many spaceplanes end up in a flaming ditch on the side of the runway- because one wing flexes more than the other). My guess is that what was ACTUALLY happening is that the control surfaces were flexing awkwardly, and actuating them was exasperating the control issues- hence why disabling them fixed the issue. Stock/B9 control surfaces are smaller, so the flex is less noticeable- but I was using control surfaces the length of much of the trailnig edge of a wing (real life planes often have flaps and spoilers this long- but apparently trying to do that in KSP was a mistake). The thickness was varied to attempt to match the change in thickness of the wing itself (but was ending up asymmetric like shown), but the REAL cause of the crashes was the large control surfaces flexing like large wings do, and the SAS logic not being able to adapt to that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe asymmetric control surfaces are still a bug that needs to be fixed. And now that I\u0027m running FAR, they actually *DO* affect the aerodynamic properties- since they will stick out causing drag at different places (even if FAR doesn\u0027t include thickness in its lift calculations, it uses a vector approach for drag calculations- which is part of why cargo bays and fairings work in FAR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LMA","CreatedById":75775,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T03:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny plans to add fuel to the wings so that fuel scales with wing size and thickness?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mastermapmaker","CreatedById":115104,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T05:15:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LMA\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LMA\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny plans to add fuel to the wings so that fuel scales with wing size and thickness?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can add fuel in the wings manually....but the thickness is hard to calculate\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlyxMS","CreatedById":92280,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T03:06:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust saw the update, this is still alive!

I change the size of a wing but if something else is behind it, that ends up getting changed when I don\u0027t want it to. I was putting a tail on, and when I moused over the tail to change it\u0027s size, the wings behind it which I had already gotten exactly how I wanted changed size to something else. That\u0027s one problem I can\u0027t seem to figure out but it also brings me to another point, is there not an \u0022Undo\u0022 button?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-24T15:31:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2014 03:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDCollie","CreatedById":103176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T07:02:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kadaf Industries\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kadaf Industries\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-SNIP-.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoooooly **** man, those are some seriously impressive builds o.O\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"montyben101","CreatedById":74173,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T07:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003EWOW\u003C/span\u003E that is some amazing stuff you have there \u002Brep\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DYJ","CreatedById":8636,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T16:52:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose are some absolutely brilliant looking replica vehicles, guess I should have a look at making a \u0022 Procedural panels\u0022 extension pack thing and see if I can find a nice glass shader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the cost issue, I have literally no idea what the cost of the parts is set to and can\u0027t fix it properly until the devs make the cost parameter less hardcoded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m on a plane right now but when I get back home I\u0027ll have a look at potentially adding optional API Extensions support if that\u0027s been updated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"acc","CreatedById":80018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T17:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally amazing building skills.
