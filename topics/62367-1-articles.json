I mostly play on creative mode, but find the lack of an objective...a bit boring, and I don\u0027t want to switch to career because I already have a lot in creative. Are there any extraterrestrial mining mods or mods that give a sort of goal, like permanent settlement? Those are specifically what I want, and, I would get the Kethane mod if I knew where to find it. Any good mod references are GREATLY appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pontiac","CreatedById":62216,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T18:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Permanant\u0022 is relevant, but, there is Kethane Mining you can build a base to refuel your ships for extra-planetary exploration.

And so on. I think the first items have to be randomly located near the vicinity of spacecenter (1-3 kms max).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese items and unlocked parts work like a reward system, to keep players motivated. So the more stuffes you find the more far you can go and the more advanced vehicles you can build. For example, somewhere, in the ice of Kerbin, you may find a crashed ship, with a damaged nuclear engine but in good condition enough to be reverse-engineered then added as a new part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
