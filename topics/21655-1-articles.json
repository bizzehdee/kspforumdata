CG Ventures is proud to present the Dreamweaver!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeighing in at a modest 5 tons, the Dreamweaver design has a similarly minimal power plant, producing a TWR of only 0.3 on takeoff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe can achieve liftoff as slow as 36 m/s, though for a more stable takeoff I recommend 41m/s or above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xBC4P.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xBC4P.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe\u0027s pretty easy to fly and quite stable, though you won\u0027t want to pull off a lot of stunts as the 15 kN of thrust provided will not be enough to get you out of trouble once you\u0027re in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LKQ48.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LKQ48.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith solar panels deployed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VrDjR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VrDjR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here she is in the hangar, with control surface settings available in case they\u0027re not already set in the .craft file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/511vy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022511vy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe range of this beauty is roughly 36 km on full throttle, which provides precisely 8:06 of burn time. YMMV based on piloting skills.

With this design philosophy in mind, CG Ventures has created a new beast, the Dreamsnatcher. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6fbjm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226fbjm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Dreamsnatcher is everything the Dreamweaver was not: fast, agile, and powerful. Capable of reaching 6000m or higher, with a range of ~55km and a tentative top speed of 160m/s, the Dreamsnatcher is competitive with mainstream jets. Weighing in at less than 12 tons fully charged, she\u0027s still pretty lightweight for a craft of her size. When the power is depleted, she\u0027s only 8 tons and pretty easy to land, even at speeds of 50m/s. Be very careful with the stick, if you pull up at the last minute and don\u0027t have enough speed to keep her gliding straight, she\u0027ll nosedive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe can even fly, for a time, with solar deployed. Just don\u0027t try to land with them deployed, as the drag will pull your nose down 20 degrees or more when you least expect it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enote\u003C/em\u003E: do NOT empty your fuel cells, as once they are dead, they are impossible to recharge. \u003Cem\u003EShould be fixed in 17.1.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Epilot\u0027s tip\u003C/em\u003E: yaw is useful once again, and combined with pitch, is the best way to steer your plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMods Used:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet Ferram\u0027s Aerospace Research \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/20451-PLUGIN-0-17-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-4-Aerodynamics-Fixes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E for a semi-realistic drag model.
