Whenever I look at the error.log, it says that there is 0mb being used out of 0mb. The log is here: [http://pastebin.com/Mp7NJBEq](http://pastebin.com/Mp7NJBEq). My mod list is also here: [http://pastebin.com/KnsCbC1v](http://pastebin.com/KnsCbC1v). I\u0027m not sure what to do in order to get this to work, I\u0027ve tried reinstalling. ActiveTextureManagement doesn\u0027t work because it just crashes without giving an error log. I\u0027ve tried deleting various mods such as FASA, scatterer, and ATM. Any help would be appreciated!"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T02:34:57Z","Content":"A) Running astronomer\u0027s visual pack without getting Active Texture Management running (recommended on aggressive) is not possible at anything other than lowest res. Its just too huge.\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Aside from the obvious fact you\u0027re getting an out of memory crash, there is the weirdness of apparent lack of memory allocation.\n\nMy recommendations:\n\nRemove the Regolith folder. Thats deprecated with 1.0 (Regolith is made by Roverdude, who also did the stock ISRU system; stock ISRU is a variation of Regolith). Also, remove FASA, Infernal Robotics, and EVE \u002B Astronomer\u0027s visual. If it still won\u0027t run, check back here with more logs. Also I need your output\\_log.txt instead of your error.log. That will give me more info on *where* the game is crashing.\n\nEDIT:\n\nPro tip: Create a folder in your KSP directory named holding next to gamedata. You can cut and paste any mods you don\u0027t want to load into there, no deleting necessary. KSP never looks for a folder called holding so its presence has zero effect on KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"scavenger","CreatedById":111989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:40:59Z","Content":"hi\n\nI will also give you an advice, since you seem to use deprecated mods: use the CKAN mod manager: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager-v1-6-16-13-May-2015](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager-v1-6-16-13-May-2015)\n\nit also resolves mods conflicts and is far better than KSPModAdmin"},{"CreatedByName":"Samlow","CreatedById":144473,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T22:44:26Z","Content":"Ive actually done quite a bit of research for that same problem.
