I\u0027m not sure what to do in order to get this to work, I\u0027ve tried reinstalling. ActiveTextureManagement doesn\u0027t work because it just crashes without giving an error log. I\u0027ve tried deleting various mods such as FASA, scatterer, and ATM.

Also, remove FASA, Infernal Robotics, and EVE \u002B Astronomer\u0027s visual. If it still won\u0027t run, check back here with more logs. Also I need your output_log.txt instead of your error.log.

You can cut and paste any mods you don\u0027t want to load into there, no deleting necessary. KSP never looks for a folder called holding so its presence has zero effect on KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"scavenger","CreatedById":111989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:40:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehi\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will also give you an advice, since you seem to use deprecated mods: use the CKAN mod manager: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager-v1-6-16-13-May-2015\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager-v1-6-16-13-May-2015\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit also resolves mods conflicts and is far better than KSPModAdmin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Samlow","CreatedById":144473,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T22:44:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIve actually done quite a bit of research for that same problem.
