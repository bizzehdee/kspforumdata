If you don\u0027t want to use a seat or ladder, it\u0027s doable without too crazy of a craft if you launch from a high altitude. Build your lander on a rover-mobile launch platform and you don\u0027t even have to be as careful about your landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ladder-based Eve ascent vehicle is the lightest I\u0027ve seen, at around 5 tons (just over if you include the rover wheels and parachutes on the landing platform, just under without). I\u0027m working on a single-launch round-trip version at around 12 tons from the launchpad on Kerbin, it\u0027s just so many parts that it\u0027ll take forever to fly without MechJeb (for purposes of the Reddit challenge).
