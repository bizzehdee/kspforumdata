It is much easier to cover the Martian polar caps with low-albedo dust than to burn enough fossil fuels to raise the temperature by even four degrees Celsius on a planet with four times the surface area in terms of how much money is spent in my opinion.

Are we able to shift one of the moons into a polar orbit and bring it down? Phobos might work. Deimos won\u0027t get the whole cap, but it is very dark and will spread dark ejecta over the cap. According to [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~mfogg/zubrin.htm](http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~mfogg/zubrin.htm), we only need to raise polar temperatures by 4 degrees Kelvin to trigger a runaway greenhouse effect. We should be left with about a third of a bar of mostly CO2. If this is made entirely into oxygen, then it is more O2 partial pressure than oxygen on Earth (0.2 bar).\n\nAlso, in response to Wesreidau, atmosphere loss because of solar wind will probably be negligible during the process of terraforming. We only need Mars because Earth\u0027s not big enough for the future population assuming our numbers keep growing. Once we have the technology to live in deep space for decades or centuries Mars isn\u0027t needed other than materialistically, because if we can survive our lifetime without planets we no longer need planets at all.

It has also happened several times since then if I am not mistaken. Population growth happens, and expansion of infrastructure and farming happens, allowing growth to continue, as it has for the last more than seven billion people.\n\n--Now, there are environmental problems that are associated with population growth that we need to be concerned about, but they are somewhat more complex than simply overcrowding. Probably, with an efficient plan and well layed out growth, the Earth could support hundreds of billions of people at the very least, but not following current means of sustenance.We do not need to expand to Mars, as a consequence. Sure, it would be neat; but there is much that you are assuming about why we should go there. Many issues have been raised before, questions of how humans and other animals would develop at low g levels, the actual value simply of being on planets in the first place, et cetera.\n\n--Furthermore, terraforming of Mars (even if technically feasible) would be a difficult thing to convince people to do. Sure, many find the idea stimulating, and probably it would be possible at least on some levels, but we have tons left to figure out about the place. At the moment, Mars is the subject of incredible amounts of research, the focus of NASA\u0027s search for non-terrestrial life, an interesting analog for Earth\u0027s history and development, and in general a simply very interesting, and accessible planet. It will be a challenge to convince people to come in and start engineering the place, before we understand it properly. And perhaps, by that time, we will be past the stage of lusting after territory.\n\n(Apologies for the wall of text.
