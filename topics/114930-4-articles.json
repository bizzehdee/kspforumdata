The internet has made \u0022protesting\u0022 into a pastime, which means inflated emotions like this is taken as inflated emotions, rather than something corporate has to actually consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, consider, all Reddit needs to do is temporarily disable the ability to make forums or whatnot private, and revert the changes. The REAL protest is when people actively boycott Reddit, preferably not using Reddit to spread messages about boycotting it (not because Reddit can remove it, but because it defeats the purpose). If Reddit knows people WANT to use its service, but cannot due to temporary issues, they don\u0027t give a crap about what caused those issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider a \u0022store side\u0022 protest, where people are trying to convince others who don\u0027t care about their plight to not shop at a store... usually they don\u0027t work out because people just don\u0027t care and walk right past the protests... some may just resolve to come a different day if protests are violent enough. While directly blocking people from entering does get you more attention, it only gathers negative attention. You haven\u0027t convinced anyone not to shop at the store, you only prevented it; if anything people, having resented your actions, are MORE LIKELY to shop there and spend more money because of how poorly you treated them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider the Gas Protests, \u0022Everyone, don\u0027t buy gas this sunday... the gas stations will lose millions!\u0022 Of course they will, but then TOMORROW you will NEED to buy gas, and while daily profit will take a large hit, weekly profit would barely change... let alone that no one really knows why the protest occurred, where is the list of demands? The commitment to further protests if demands are not met? And since with crowd-sourcing like this, you get large groups without firm demands, all that can really be said is that people are angry; but don\u0027t have a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEffective protesting is slow, it takes large amounts of planning, it takes a large commitment. It costs REAL money, and REAL effort on your behalf, often individual protests are unsuccessful so you keep campaigning and seeking more and more followers over long periods of time until change finally happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR; Internet protests are \u003Cem\u003EHIGHLY emotional\u003C/em\u003E but very short lived, their frequency has made them a \u0022cost of business\u0022 rather than an indication that something needs to change.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T20:22:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 08:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
