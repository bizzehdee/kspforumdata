It\u0027s that large because it stores the electricity it uses, and even speeding up a mass of 15 by 800m/s would cost over 20k units of electric energy. It quite literally changes the speed at that instant, at the cost of energy, so there\u0027s no thrust in the sense of an engine shooting exhaust. In that sense, it could be put anywhere, even at the core of a ship. It will never be capable of FTL, because the energy cost is far too prohibitive, scaling with ship mass and the requested delta-V.\u003Cp\u003EThe warp field generator simply changes it\u0027s own mass at a constant draw to electric energy. Also a somewhat prohibitive cost, which scales with ship mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to use either of these is with a pile of batteries and solar panels, which would probably be torn off if used in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, seeing as how I actually thought of official names after I posted, I\u0027ll share those:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe IVM will be called a Ship-Wide Inertial Field Transformer, SWIFT. The energy cost for a change in velocity (either positive or negative) is at least abs( shipmass * requested dV).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe warp field generator will be called a Higgs Field Gradient Generator, HFGG, since it is directly changing it\u0027s own mass. The energy cost per second of doing this will probably be (|new mass| \u002B 1) ^ ln(|shipmass| \u002B 1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could also make an absurdly powerful Ion thruster that works on it\u0027s own (sans-plugin file), if you\u0027d like, but it looks like someone else above has already started on one. Once again, I\u0027m just dipping my toes into plugin programming, and changing velocity and a part\u0027s mass is easy enough, but also has interesting consequences on play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell right, I\u0027ll add it to the list, but I\u0027ve got tons of things now, I think I\u0027m going to begin wrapping the thread up and turning it more into a discussion about what I am doing, while retaining the ability to suggest, but stopping the emphasis on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moon Goddess\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Moon Goddess\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027d love to see a Command pod in the 3.75m size, with a cool IVA.\u003Cp\u003ENot like futuristic or anything styling as the core, just like something big enough you could move around in for a long duration flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably not even for more than 3 crew, just more empty space like someone was actually living in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically to free up the kerbonauts.

Tomorrow is the great day of Friday. This means its time to stop procrastinating as school is \u0022hard\u0022 and \u0022time-intensive\u0022, and really get down to work, I\u0027ll draw up some preliminary stuff, and post it into the thread to hold you guys over while I get my (now not anymore secret) test parts working (the parts themselves aren\u0027t the bane, its more about getting the textures to match the model currently as well as testing exportation, going to update unity 3D and acquire the .mu and .mbm file writers \u002B devkit).

The extension would simply be a 10m separator away from the station-node as to avoid stupendous collisions, I\u0027m also thinking of a In-Line Clamp-O-Tron which has a bit more extension on it than its current iteration, provided I figure out how to make docking nodes work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ummwut","CreatedById":29846,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T10:06:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Cryo, how did you learn about blender?
