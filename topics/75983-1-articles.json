I used a little ship I built dubbed the ITV-1 (Interplanetary Transfer Vehicle-1) to put it there. Pleased with myself, and with the amount of propellant left in the ITV-1, I sent it home when the next Duna-\u0026gt;Kerbin window opened up. Transfer went great, I came in inclined and hot, but it was no problem to insert in to orbit. I then used my high apoapsis to rotate the orbit to be equatorial, and burn my periapsis down to 120km to intersect my station orbit. Perfection! I started to really feel smug at this point, I played with the maneuver nodes and got it set up so I would burn most of the way down to a circular 120km orbit, and then one orbit later intercept the station. So chortling away like the genius I was, I did the burn and then warped around to closest encounter....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.....at which point my space station whipped by at 2x the orbital speed! Yep, all that clever interplanetary piloting and I was going the wrong way round Kerbin. Krap!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I was low on fuel too, so I sent up another ITV ship (the ITV-2) in to retrograde orbit and docked with ITV-1. Together the ships burned in to a Mun encounter, at the Mun Pe I did a retro burn, but not enough to insert in to orbit, just enough to whip around and escape Mun going the other way. This dropped me in to a pretty huge Kerbin orbit, but in the right direction. This time I was able to rendezvous with and dock to my station, hooray!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I was wondering, that maneuver I pulled whipping around Mun to change my orbit direction, is that considered a gravity assist? I wonder only because that is a wicked amount of dV I got out of it, considering it totally reversed my orbit direction. Admittedly I was in a much higher orbit after, so it wasn\u0027t a 2x orbital velocity change, but still... not bad!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust curious what I should call it when I describe it to my non-KSP playing friends (who really don\u0027t care... but I will tell them anyway! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMatt\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-26T23:44:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2014 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by photogineer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T03:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome (including myself) would say yes because you used an orbital body\u0027s gravity to modify your vessel\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOthers would say/have said no, because you burned at periapsis.

In that other thread, this doesn\u0027t happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may seem like it happens since you start out on Minmus and then swing by Kerbin. But Minmus is itself orbiting Kerbin. When you escape from Minmus\u0027 orbit you are back in Kerbin orbit, and you can\u0027t get a gravity slingshot from a body you are orbiting. So I would say that the analysis in the other thread is correct: there is no gravity slingshot happening there. Rather, it is indeed just making use of the Oberth effect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that you\u0027d actually do this of course... the only reason for dropping back down to a low Kerbin periapsis in that thread is to make it easier not to miss the transfer window, since this significantly reduces your orbital period, meaning you are travelling in \u0022the right direction for ejection\u0022 more frequently.

The critical factor for something being a gravity assist is using a body\u0027s orbital speed to change your orbit, by entering and leaving that body\u0027s SOI. So you can\u0027t do a gravity assist on your origin or destination body, only some third body that is not the parent of either of the first two bodies. In the OP\u0027s case, that third body is the Mun. In that other thread, Kerbin can\u0027t be used for a gravity assist because it is the parent of the Mun or Minmus; Mun and Minmus already have Kerbin\u0027s orbital speed in addition to their own. The best that can be done is to drop periapsis to maximize the Oberth effect, but that\u0027s not a slingshot because nothing is gained by the addition of Kerbin\u0027s orbital speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn or no burn is irrelevant, there are both powered and unpowered gravity assists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if you feel I gave you a hard time about the difference (then or now), but the Oberth effect and gravity assists are confusing at first and often combined; conflating one with the other only makes things harder to understand.
