In .22 you could transmit all the data and never have to return. So whats changed exactly? I know you get only one use now until you get the lab. Besides returning some what getting expensive. Is there any reason to transmit still? Is it just for a temp boost in science till you can recover the craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-18T23:27:19Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2013 11:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tobjv\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T23:13:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.23, it works like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENO MOBILE LAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If all you do is transmit, you can only ever get a max of 40% of the points available for that experiment in that location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A single experiment can only be transmitted 1 time per ship per location per mission. So like crew reports. If you do a crew report in LKO and transmit it, you can\u0027t do another crew report in LKO with that ship. Well, actually you can go through the motions but it will give you zero points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Each individual Goo and Material part by default can only be used 1 time per mission. Either you bring it home full or your transmit it. If you transmit it, you can\u0027t use it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWITH MOBILE LAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mobile lab adds 15% to the transmission efficiency when transmitting an experiment. So, IIRC you only get 20% of the returned value if you transmit Material. But if you run the data through the Mobile Lab first, you\u0027d get 35% of the returned value. HOWEVER, this is still limited by the 40% overall cap on transmissions, except when the 15% efficiency buff puts you slightly over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mobile lab can be used to reactivate Goo and Material after you\u0027ve transmitted them. Or alternatively, you can EVA a Kerbal, fly him next to the Goo or Material, right-click, and collect the data from the experiment. Then fly him into the ML where he can store the data. You can then reactive the experiment using the ML, and at the end of the mission recover the ML with all the data stored in it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tobjv","CreatedById":50269,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T23:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Geschosskopf\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
