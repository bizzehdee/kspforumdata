I also looked up the parts I want to use, and, despite being a little hard to find some things like the joystick and screens (as someone living in Brazil, with little to no knowledge of where to buy this kind of electronics online or not), there is still one part that I haven\u0027t been able to find a good one to buy or any tutorial on how to make one: the throttle thingy (stick, acelerator, controller, I really don\u0027t know even what to call that thing lol), though I suspect making one will involve potentiometers and such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I want to ask anyone who might know something on this matter if you know any good tutorials or where to find this kind of thing. I am looking to make or acquire one that looks like the ones in the game (the only ones I found are more like the airplane ones). Apretiate any help or ideas in any aspect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I\u0027ll make a cardboard model of what I\u0027m thinking later this week and post it here, but for now, I\u0027m really concerned about the throttle thing.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSpaceDinos4037","CreatedById":229961,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-02T03:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t wait to see what you come up with!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
