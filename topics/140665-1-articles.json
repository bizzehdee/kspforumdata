I would like to know how to parent the various components so that if I\u00A0rotate a main torque panel at the base, that all the linked radiator panels and scissor linkages move respectively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tested an animation where the radiator panels are parented to one another (from top to bottom) and animated each radiators via\u00A0rotation keyframes.\u00A0I\u00A0then did the same for the scissor linkages. When deploying the radiator, it seems that it looks OK during the whole animation cycle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, even though this workaround seems to work, would anyone still know how to do a \u0022proper\u0022\u00A0scissor jack rigging?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/8Kyhg/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T05:34:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif it *looks* good the whole way through. then it\u0027s \u0022proper\u0022 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T16:00:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni guess if it aint broke, don\u0027t fix it\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T01:41:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep, no need to overcomplicate things if it\u0027s working.
