In the middle of dinner, a single gunshot, a single dead body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour mission is to find the killer. Each day the kiler is un-named, he kills someone. You are aloud as a group to guess one person a day (the leader will message me). Each person will be asigned a advantage (eg. you are aloud to ask one person that they have to answer truthfuly except are you the killer or anything related).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo sign up reply below or message me. You are aloud to talk with other forumers in the game but they don\u0027t have to answer your question truthfuly. Use your advantage, guess wisly, and don\u0027t get killed! Sign ups close when we have fifteen players, so first come first serve. I will run a second if this is succesful so you can reserve spots for yourself then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
