I don\u0027t see any core temperature variable documented on Part, so is it up to a PartModule to store that state? Is there an internal counterpart to AddThermalFlux(..)? Or do I set part.thermalInternalFlux directly? Is part.thermalInternalFluxPrevious a way to read the influence of the environment on the core? Or do those interactions simply not happen outside PartModule logic?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T10:25:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParts use ModuleCoreHeat to get Core heat simulation.
