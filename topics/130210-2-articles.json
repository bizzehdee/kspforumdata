CAMWISE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhen we awoke from our rest period, the sun had not yet risen over the crater rim but we were didn\u0027t want to wait any longer so we set out. The rover was now topped-up with oxygen, hydrogen, water and food. The fuel cells should be able to power the vehicle for many days, and a small electrolysis unit would use excess power to regenerate some of the hydrogen and oxygen. The small crew cabin was cosy but quite sufficient for the two of us, and the rover\u0027s cockpit offered an exceptional view of the Moon\u0027s landscape. Froemone had surpassed himself with this design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCatbeth drove the first leg of our journey, taking us out of Drygalski crater almost due North. We passed \u003Cem\u003ELentillac\u003C/em\u003E and our toppled lander on the way out, but even that didn\u0027t dampen my spirits. Looking upwards out of the cabin\u0027s small window on the right hand side, I could see the Earth, mostly shrouded in darkness as the planet was between the sun and us. The thin crescent of light from our home planet was sufficient to illuminate the landscape to our eyes that were now accustomed to the darkness of the lunar polar regions. \u003Cem\u003EArcambal\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s brilliant headlights would pierce any of the remaining shadows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WXKUHwy.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WXKUHwy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAs Cat drove on, my thoughts drifted back to our home world and its fragile equilibrium. It is a strange place, if you think about it for a moment. A vast, empty planet, most of which has remained unconquered by my people\u0027s civilization. After generations of living underground, we have only just started to invest the surface, starting a few small settlements here and there, but mainly just building the infrastructure enabling us to get around such as ports and runways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOur rover trek across the Moon reminded me of the very first journey I had made from my birthplace in the karstic caves near the western tip of the Eurasian continent, all the way across to the Pacific Ocean. A primitive vehicle with an internal combustion engine had carried my cousins and I across thousands of miles of bare landscape to the coastline bordering the planet\u0027s greatest ocean. There, an airship burning some sort of dirty hydrocarbon carried us, a lucky few, to the atoll where I would eventually become an engineer of the space programme.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThat voyage above the ocean had taken us four days, and I had discovered the delights of turning pink and throwing up most of what I could manage to eat over the side of the airship from airsickness. How Kerbals ever came to conquer the skies I simply cannot imagine. Even our flight to the Moon had been shorter than that endless journey, and today I could make the same journey in less than an hour if I so desired, screaming through the upper atmosphere at some insanely high Mach number in one of our supersonic jets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd if the jet were to fly back across Eurasia, it would still soar above league upon league of bleak, empty expanses of moss and lichen covering the hard, baked dirt. A whole planet to explore, yet here we were already trying to leave it. What does that tell you about our people..?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMy train of thought was interrupted by the rover braking to a halt. We had reached the northern rim of Drygalski after a long climb out from the crater\u0027s floor. I made a short EVA to collect some rock samples and paused to look back across the one hundred mile wide dent in the Moon\u0027s surface that we had called home for the past month. The foothills of the crater\u0027s peak were still covered in darkness, and I could no longer make out our outpost. It was a pretty lonely feeling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222rXPUjN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2rXPUjN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI relieved Catbeth at the controls and crawled through the narrow tunnel into the cockpit. The glass canopy allowed an almost all-round view of the Moon\u0027s surface and gave me the strange impression of being in a fish bowl, looking out at the hostile, alien environment. It had felt a little unnerving at first, but I had quickly got used to it and I now thoroughly enjoyed driving \u003Cem\u003EArcambal\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI engaged drive and set a course north-by-eastwards that would bring us down through a narrow valley into the neighbouring crater named Le Gentil. The terrain quickly became much steeper and more uneven than the gentle slopes we had encountered up until that point, so I selected four wheel drive. Plumes of moon-dust spewed into the vacuum behind \u003Cem\u003EArcambal\u003C/em\u003E as the wheels skittered in the low gravity. Despite this, we continued to make good progress and by our next halt, we had reached the crater floor, and were well over one hundred kilometers from Drygalski Base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWe took five minutes to rest before continuing and I reclined the driver\u0027s seat back to look up at the stars. It just so happened that while I lay back and gazed into the heavens, Vers Seven - one of the very first satellites we had launched to observe the Moon \u2013 drifted past above us, a tiny point of light skimming through the endless void. I realised at that precise moment that leaving my home cave to become a space engineer had been damned good idea, and for a moment, I couldn\u0027t think of anywhere else I would rather be. My kind had dug far into our planet for millenia, to places deeper and darker than you could ever imagine. Yet here we were, the most isolated two Kerbals in history. No one could reach us. Ahead of us: mile after mile of unexplored lunar desolation, and behind us our tracks that would remain in the lunar dust for almost forever showing that we passed through here. It was thrilling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCatbeth offered to take the wheel but I told her I was cool and would drive to our next stop. We blasted through Le Gentil in no time and were soon climbing the northern wall of the crater to the midlands that separated us from Bailly and the primary objective of our trip. Margaret had requested we head just a little further northwards until we reached the border of the massive Aitken Basin before cutting eastwards towards the anomaly in order to sample the rocks there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe terrain began to get even steeper as we pushed on, and our path brought us around the rims of some smaller craters. \u003Cem\u003EArcambal\u003C/em\u003E dipped in and out of the shadows as the terrain we traversed was in darkness or sunlit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd finally, after several hours of driving mainly uphill we came to the highest point of our journey, several thousand metres above the crater floor at Drygalski, with the rim of Bailly crater to our right, and to our left, the vast expanses of the Basin stretching away into the distance. Catbeth and I both geared up to go on EVA to witness this spectacle firsthand. We stood, gazing mutely at the stunning view for several long minutes before we remembered what we were here for and started gathering rock samples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022v8hCsq2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v8hCsq2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWe secured the rover for a short rest after having traveled about 250 kilometers across the Moon\u0027s surface.

CAMWISE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nToday got off to a bad start. I nearly wrote-off the rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI\u0027d just taken the wheel after Catbeth had driven the first leg. We were starting our descent into Bailly crater after negotiating some pretty rough terrain. It had looked pretty smooth to me and I had allowed \u003Cem\u003EArcambal\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s speed to run away. Partially blinded by the glare of the low sun, I hadn\u0027t seen the crest in the terrain in time and Cat and I became the first Kerbals to unwittingly get air on the Moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022U0niWZL.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U0niWZL.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt probably wouldn\u0027t be all that spectacular if you saw a replay, but it sure scared the hell out of me, and the sickening crunch as the rear wheels contacted the surface once more, followed by an ominous scraping sound from the back of the rover certainly weren\u0027t reassuring. But at least we were still upright, and I managed to bring \u003Cem\u003EArcambal\u003C/em\u003E to a shuddering halt quickly, as Cat yelled \u201CWhat was that?!\u201D from the crew cabin behind me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI crawled through the tunnel into the cabin where Cat was rubbing a bruise on her forehead. She\u0027d been lying on one of the small bunks in the cabin and my stunt had thrown her against the ceiling. I looked at her sheepishly and managed to say \u201CWe might have a problem\u201D. I suited up to inspect the damage immediately. The good news was that all six wheels were still attached and were still more or less round. The bad news was that the Kevlar belt of the rear right wheel had been badly damaged by the initial impact and the tread was hanging off in places. We could probably still move, but we would have to do without four-wheel drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCatbeth decided she would prefer to drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWe pressed on, and it turned out that \u003Cem\u003EArcambal\u003C/em\u003E could still get us where we wanted to go. The ride was a bit noisier, particularly from the back of the crew cabin, which is precisely where I spent the next couple of hours feeling stupid. My mistake had brought back the sickening apprehension we had both felt back when we\u0027d just touched down at Drygalski. There would be no towing service out here: if \u003Cem\u003EArcambal\u003C/em\u003E stopped moving, Froemone\u0027s lunar rover would be nothing more than a comfortable, high-tech hearse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI briefly toyed with the idea of informing mission control that we had encountered technical issues and we had aborted our attempt to reach the anomaly and intended to head straight back to Drygalski and relative safety. I had no trouble imagining what the responses of Angun, Margaret and the rest of the Investigators would be. Besides, we really weren\u0027t far away from our target now: less than fifty clicks. I gambled that if \u003Cem\u003EArcambal\u003C/em\u003E could hold on for that distance, she could make it back to Drygalski. Or could she?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOptions, Camwise, find the options. If she couldn\u0027t make it, maybe our friends Macfrey and Mitzon could remotely guide \u003Cem\u003EPadirac\u003C/em\u003E to our position and we could hitch a ride home on our favourite nuclear mining rover. Catbeth and I would take turns driving and hanging on to the ladder in our suits. Not exactly an elegant way to travel three hundred kilometers across the Moon\u0027s surface, but it would be something to tell my grandchildren if it came to that...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CCamwise?\u201D came Cathbeth\u0027s voice above the noise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYeah?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThe anomaly we\u0027re looking for, is it supposed to be made of metal?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CUh, right now, it could be made out of dead badgers for all I care.

Despite myself I sat up and crawled forward into the tunnel that lead to the cockpit to look over her shoulder as she drove towards our objective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAs the rover cleared the last crest that separated us from the anomaly, we were greeted with a sight that left us momentarily stunned. A moment passed before Catbeth recovered the presence of mind to apply the brakes and bring \u003Cem\u003EArcambal\u003C/em\u003E to a slow halt. At that moment I finally understood what Margaret had felt when she had ordered \u003Cem\u003ECirq\u003C/em\u003E Two to take off. Maybe this was worse: the rock arch she had examined might just have been some sort of freaky natural occurrence. The object before us was clearly nothing natural, it was the work of sentient beings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAs if in a dream, we both suited up and depressurized the rover\u0027s crew cabin for EVA. I called mission control and requested the immediate attention of Investigators Angun and Margaret. Despite it being just after three in the morning in Omelek, Angun responded within seconds, and his voice was unusually tense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CCamwise, what have you found?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI don\u0027t know what it is, but I think we have found your new material.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227aHSVGP.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7aHSVGP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-03T00:47:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2016 12:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by UnusualAttitude\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-25T03:13:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill loving Camwise\u0027s narrative voice very much. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-25T03:13:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2016 03:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UnusualAttitude","CreatedById":129962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-25T15:49:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222428668\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130210\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456370020\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022111501\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kuzzter\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Kuzzter said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill loving Camwise\u0027s narrative voice very much. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey, thanks Kuzzter.

During the course of his EVA, I began to feel tremors through the Moon\u0027s surface that were strong enough to actually physically shake the rover. I understood that the anomaly was the source of this activity and I started to drive the rover forward in order to extract my teammate as quickly as possible and leave the area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe tremors had kicked up a lot of dust and I could barely make out his location. I had just passed the top of the crest when some sort of power surge disabled the rover entirely. Communications cut off and all of the vehicle\u0027s controls and screens went blank. The tremors came to an end at this precise moment, and a few seconds later power was restored. The ER\u0027s drive system was functional once more, although I later discovered that some of the other systems, such as communications and certain science instruments, were still partially or wholly disabled. I still could not contact SE Camwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe dust was taking a long time to settle and I didn\u0027t want to risk driving into the area in case my teammate was incapacitated and prone on the ground. Therefore, I performed an EVA to search for him on foot. I found him lying on his face just a few meters away from the anomaly. He did not respond when I rolled him onto his back but a quick inspection of his suit showed it to be intact. Mist on the inside of his helmet suggested that the suit\u0027s life support system had been compromised but also that he was still breathing. I managed to drag him back to the ER as quickly as possible and into the crew cabin where, once pressure had been restored, I removed his helmet. He appeared to still be breathing normally, but he remains unconscious as I speak.

And because I was in a small bunk with a low ceiling, I bashed my head against the metal bulkhead above me, which didn\u0027t make things any better in the hangover department, and certainly didn\u0027t improve my memory. The light was dim but I could just about see, and for some strange reason I felt compelled to look down at my own body; my arms, my legs.

And it didn\u0027t go away completely, although I was pretty sure I was now fully conscious and no longer dreaming. It remained there, chattering away to itself at the back of my mind. This time, however, I made it out of the bunk and managed to stay upright on my own two feet without falling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI nearly stumbled over my own space suit that lay discarded on the floor near my bunk. In a stroke of inspiration I grabbed the regulator and gulped in a huge breath of pure oxygen that cleared my head somewhat. Then I staggered over towards the communications corner of the hab module, following the sound of Catbeth\u0027s voice. She was just signing off a conversation with someone. The good news hit me: I recognized my surroundings and things were starting to click back into place. I paused in front of the view-port and the desolate landscape of the Moon beyond. \u003Cem\u003EArcambal\u003C/em\u003E was parked just a few metres away, her damaged real wheel an unwelcome reminder of my bad driving... yes, I remembered now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCat appeared looking concerned and... there was something else.

And that\u0027s when things got fuzzy, no matter how hard I racked my brain for details. I could remember the ship starting to vibrate and kick up dust, and I could remember the voices of various people screaming at me to stop just standing there and bug out as quickly as possible (huh, it\u0027s easy for you guys to talk when your sitting in your comfortable swivel chairs three hundred thousand klicks away from the nearest menacing alien technology...), but that\u0027s where my memory cut off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCatbeth reckoned that the same power surge that had knocked out the rover had also caused my suit\u0027s life support system to malfunction and that I had lost consciousness. She then went on to tell me about her lonely drive through the lunar highlands, making shortcuts through the rugged, unknown terrain with a damaged rover and no communications. And finally arriving back at Drygalski where she finally managed to contact mission control who had been going nuts, despite having received some of the messages she had sent while en route.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nShe cut off her story there and looked over towards the radio. \u201CUh, Camwise.

And finally, she admitted, \u201CHe said nothing about \u003Cem\u003Eus\u003C/em\u003E, he just said that \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E must return to Earth.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWhat...?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYou know perfectly well that it is possible for one of us to leave.

We drove the two kilometers that separated us from the scene of our crash landing. \u003Cem\u003ELentillac\u003C/em\u003E was still parked nearby, as she had been since our failed attempt to right the lander with her winch.

I felt like I should hide the keys to the base under the doormat; but there was no key, and no doormat, or even a convenient flower pot.

My head banged once, twice against the hull, then I spun round once more and somehow managed to brace my feet against a frame of the ship\u0027s structure and stay in that position. I could feel the rumbling and vibrations of the shuttle\u0027s wheels careering through the dust through the cable, and after what seemed like an eternity, silence as they unweighted, a jolt as they hit the dust once more, and silence again as \u003Cem\u003ELentillac\u003C/em\u003E left the lunar surface for good.

However, it proved to be more of a strain as time went on, as \u003Cem\u003ELentillac\u003C/em\u003E burned fuel and got lighter, and her acceleration increased.

Catbeth had opened the cargo bay, and hundreds of kilometres of lunar landscape were spread out beneath me. I was floating, weightless once more, my feet dangling into a majestic open void framed by the bay doors.

I felt the short jolts as the RCS sputtered and killed velocity relative to our target. I didn\u0027t even mind the banging of my knees and elbows against the ship: I was transfixed by the sight of the lunar farside rolling past beneath us. Then I saw \u003Cem\u003EFaure\u003C/em\u003E slip into view on our port side, coming up along side \u003Cem\u003ELentillac\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022E7IgDdL.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E7IgDdL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNow came the final gamble of my plan: Catbeth was the only one of us with fuel for her KMU. The cable attached to my back was the only thing that prevented me from drifting off into space. Cat would EVA over to the capsule and maneuver it very carefully into the cargo bay, hopefully getting it into a position where I could grab onto the ladder, and not crushing me against the bay walls in the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CGoing EVA.

The radio was also silent until she powered up the capsule\u0027s communications system.

The challenge is shoehorning this stuff into a plausible plot, as many more accomplished KSP story-tellers than myself can attest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Camwise has already stated, the next destination is a crewed Mars orbiting mission. Eventually, thanks to the magic of Near Future Propulsion systems and a little bit of hand waving and .cfg file hacking, we may acquire the technology to reach the outer planets and more exotic destinations.
