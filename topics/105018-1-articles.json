So this discussion is for ideas that would give added depth to the game once you\u0027ve actually gotten to the planet. A good example is MKS/OKS which adds a ton of new resources and the challenge of building a self sustaining colony. Science and contracts feel cheap, and new planets or *gasp* a procedural system (even though Squad decided this was a bad idea for some reason...) just give you a new place to land on and then a few minutes later leave. I\u0027m not knocking a proc system, I\u0027d play the .... out of it and I think the game needs way more procedural content (seriously the terrain sucks) but essentially the depth of gameplay hasn\u0027t changed since .18 days (they added some asteroids).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t mind seeing a robust supply economy based on space mining with multiple independent AI actors and obviously multiplayer \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E, and if the n-body mod ever completes (and figures out a stable configuration for KSPs wonky system) could see some really amazing flightpaths to hit up multiple mining sites (one day I\u0027ll find a use for Mathematica outside my physics hw). As of now the system feels really dead once you figure out how to get around, I think that should be a priority. ofc just my idea and it probably sucks, so post yours and have fun with it, think outside the box of what is practical or what ksp has been so far (a sandbox game with some misplaced game elements tacked on) and go wild.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly I\u0027m just looking for a programming project lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T14:40:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s see how ISRU changes the gameplay. I personally predict that it will give us a reason to set up bases, orbital refineries, land and orbital tankers, etc. If that\u0027s not enough, then yeah maybe we need a colonization feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T14:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think anything close to commercial exploitation of space resources should be OUT OF QUESTION, for realism first (as it would take higher-technology and tremendous economy of scale to make it worth) and because it won\u0027t really fit a game where every single spaceship must be flown by hand. Same for Space colonization, it ask for technology beyond the modern-era KSP suggest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy that\u0027s my opinion, no doubt people will keep insisting it would be the next best thing since the wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn more reasonable subject, taking and \u003Cstrong\u003Estoring physically\u003C/strong\u003E sample in box, having experiments to deploy from toolbox to the surface of planet would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I would like KSP to be less grindy on science first. The ability to generation science from Space station will surely help, but at that point maybe we could actually automatize lesser experiments (thermometer / the various detector...etc)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"notcomplex","CreatedById":61300,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T15:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh resource mining has been around since Kethane and with the system being so small and LVNs being fairly OP I\u0027ve always found it pointless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think we would need much different tech to pull off a mining economy. My line of thinking is you would mine asteroids which aren\u0027t that large and then ship it to various industries around the system for profit which would work under the mysterious forces of supply economics from multiple actors contributing. It would also be cool if you could set up actual space bases on planets so you can get to certain asteroids easier, which would require you to mine metals to build rocket parts on site as well as runways launchpads etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly you could just scrap the economy bit and find a way to build functioning space bases on other planets (so you would build up a KSC on Laythe for the hell of it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the devs have stated gameplay \u0026gt; realism, not like anything in KSP is realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
