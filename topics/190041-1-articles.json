Which would you not want to and why? Based on their behavior only?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRace 1: Take a positive view most all the time of situations, but can still adopt a negative view... it just takes considerably more to get them there than it would a human. Usually by the time they get negative a human will be inclined to tell them, \u0022It\u0027s about time!\u0022 These aliens are mortal and therefore have adopted a negative view of death, but cushion it with the philosophy of dying a better person than they were, or no worse than they feared. They also have longer than human lifespans\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRace 2: Accept, support, and provide what is true. Everything that cannot be verfied is viewed as speculation or theory. They never assume anything, but still put their trust in others with the understanding that there will be consequences for failure to do as agreed upon via contracts. Contracts are sacred. They can theorize and speculate, but are incapable of lying. Rather than saying I can do this or that, they are more likely to show you awards they have received that can be verfied, or demonstrate their skill if they have the time. Lifespan is shorter than human, about that of a dogs. Which also means their bodies mature faster, but their minds mature at the same rate. So a 3 year old is actually in their late 20\u0027s. By the time they reach 16 human years they would be in their 80\u0027s.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRace 3: Naturally inclined to repay debts owed, and not doing so means they hate you. Lifespan is very long, longer than race 1. Tend to prefer warm environments, since they are cold blooded.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRace 4: View optimal physical fitness for one\u0027s occupation as the highest virtue. To do otherwise is considered sin. For example sumo wrestlers would be OK, since their job requires it, but anywhere else people that big would likely be frowned on or looked at with contempt. Indeed... that is actually a form of punishment... makng people fat in prison, which means they will work hard to work it off upon release. Lifespan is human.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere you go... you may answer.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022font-size:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#9d9d9d;font-size:12px;text-align:right;\u0022\u003E\nLast\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-27T17:31:28Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2019 05:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-27T21:32:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRace 5, the one who doesn\u0027t create n threads about essentially the same thing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-27T22:19:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll-4-in-1\u003Cbr\u003E\nAliens with quadrupolar disorder with unpredictable phase switching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-27T22:20:39Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2019 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
