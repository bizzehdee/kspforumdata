Some examples include a puff of smoke for the ALSEP mortar firing, and a particle getting zapped as it passes through an ion trap instrument. While the latter may be achievable with just a small chunk of transparent geometry and animated emissives/lights, others do not have an obvious workaround. I looked around but didn\u0027t see anything\u00A0 - is there any information on having custom particle effects? I hesitate to look for standard unity tutorials because I don\u0027t know what would and wouldn\u0027t work in KSP. Would the move to 1.1 change anything?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
