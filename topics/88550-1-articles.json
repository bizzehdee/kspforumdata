Ceres actually requires a lot of delta-v to reach, more than Mercury orbit (with gravity assists), and a longer mission time. Ceres is very easy to land on once in orbit. Jupiter is not that hard to reach in terms of delta-v, but requires a lot of time (about 2 years there and 2 years back for a fast transfer). Callisto is the only one of Jupiter\u0027s major moons that doesn\u0027t have a deadly radiation environment. The Saturn system is a lot more forgiving in terms of radiation, but it takes a lot more time than Jupiter. Mercury has the surface gravity of Mars but without the helpful atmosphere, so it takes a lot of delta-v to land and take off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T07:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022astropapi1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022astropapi1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBorn too late to explore earth, but too early to explore space.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of Earth is under water, and almost completely unexplored.
