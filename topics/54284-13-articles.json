These allow you to actually build things. To build things you right click the Launchpad or orbital dock while and select \u0022Show Build Menu\u0022. This will open a window that allows you to select one of your previously saved crafts. If you select the craft you want to build it will show you how much rocketparts, fuel, electricity etc it costs. If you agree with those costs and you have the required resources you can click build and the selected craft will spawn on the launchpad or docked to the orbital dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get rocketparts you need the Kethane mod and the mining equipment that comes with this mod. (If you don\u0027t have Kethane I think it allows you to build things for free, although I am not sure on that). You first need to scan a planet from orbit using one of the scanners to find ore the same way you would locate Kethane. Land in a ore rich area and use the Augur to gather it. You then need to convert the ore to metal in the smelter part and then the metal to rocket parts with the Rocket Workshop.

As is the 2 are pretty close, with the orbital base requiring twice the dV to make a ship, but saves you from having to actually launch the ship.

Remember that each dV means sitting through a repetitive launch/landing sequence and the time of the player is the most important resource in a sandbox game.
