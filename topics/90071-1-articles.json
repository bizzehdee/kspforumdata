Phalax on Nimitz) can target only a certain range of missiles (things like speed and trajectory play a huge role here - hence noone knows how Phalax would behave against real attack using, say, 4 Russian-made missiles fired from a single fighter) at certain range, average expected kill distance being 500meters doesn\u0027t give you much of a chance for mistakes. Add to this a fact that none of NATO CIWS were ever tested against Russian or Chinese supersonic cruise missiles - which is what most likely would be used against that carrier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird - you don\u0027t need nuclear missiles to take down a super carrier. There are many alternatives, including large calibre artillery fire, thermobaric bombs, heavy bombs (assuming you can deliver them over target, which is highly unlikely). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth, the most important point: CIWS isn\u0027t always turned on. If I\u0027d making bets how that stupid idea of flying mega-carrier would be destroyed, it\u0027s precisely that: Surprise attack (I\u0027m pretty sure Russians would \u0022accidentally\u0022 happen to \u0022loose\u0022 one of their launchers to some random \u0022insurgents\u0022 if US would push them too far).
