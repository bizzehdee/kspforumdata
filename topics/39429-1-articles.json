Steve Burg (who recently designed the Prometheus for the Ridley Scott movie) described what we talked about as the most in-depth examination of his methodology and approach to design ever carried out. Which, considering Steve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s career, came as a bit of a surprise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a link to a facebook page set up last year to let folks know about it, before the site is taken down.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.facebook.com/B5Scrolls\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.facebook.com/B5Scrolls\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is genuinely legit, as is the offer for anyone to download and keep it, (nearly 50,000 already have), 3DWorld ran a short piece on it last year\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/27/the-vfx-of-babylon-5-artist-interviews-and-artwork/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/27/the-vfx-of-babylon-5-artist-interviews-and-artwork/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s interested, and ain\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t on facebook, here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a link to the website itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.themadgoner.com/B5/B5Scrolls/B5Scrolls.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.themadgoner.com/B5/B5Scrolls/B5Scrolls.htm\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, with the download, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m just making sure all that work \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and the information the site contains which can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be found anywhere else \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just disappear like a fart in the wind when it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s inevitably taken down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Triple F","CreatedById":76293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T17:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@ the admins.
