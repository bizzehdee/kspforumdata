Next you SVL toward the moon, but detect four vessels trying to intercept you while in SVL.

How it changes its position is irrelevant. The point is that to the defending observer, it appears seemingly out of nowhere, and can seemingly disappear into nothingness provided it stays 3km away as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, 4 makes it even easier to set up chains, as you can have a mass for other ships to lock on to 3 km behind the vessel that jumps in, so they can chain in 6km away, more safety and time to set up the relativistic kill chain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also means that you can have a nuke/antimatter weapon 2.99km in front of the SVL trive when activated, and then you jump in and nuke them from point blank immediately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBravo, you\u0027re making it worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, point 5 is easily over come by point 4. All you have to do to stop is to throw a 1 kg mass in front of you, it reaches the front of the bubble, and then causes the bubble to stop. You can now jump in at an arbitrary distance from your target. Awesome. BTW, what is the velocity of the mass when it leaves the bubble, if it hasn\u0027t shift locked to anything, it just drifted out of the bubble, its initial velocity?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf so, this means that you can now get relativistic velocities super easy: start falling towards a large mass (sun, black hole), then before getting within 3 km of 1 kg, shift drive farther away (and you can drop out at will by just ejecting a 1 kg mass in front of you to act as a brake), fall back towards the mass, repeat as needed, for only a few kg, you can now SVL anywhere you want and launch your projectile from an arbitrary distance, at an arbitrary velocity. Relativistic kill weapons made even easier, cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, FTL requires a 7 light second distance, within that distance, you\u0027re only going to get to 1/60 c using this method (still one heck of a fast first strike). Of course things are already going faster than this relative to each other, so SVL\u0027s speed limits make no sense, as if there is a preferred reference frame, but all this means is that you go FTL to reach something that is going fast relative to your desired target, match its velocity, then come at your target with that velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note that earth is 500 light seconds from the sun. You\u0027d get a lot of velocity repeatedly falling to 8 light seconds from the sun, and SVLing back away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr you just double the size of your heat sinks, and allow it to fire off twice before your heat sinks are full and you need to cool your vessel down... but wait... you said earlier:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis implies heat is generated by unit time, and you only need 7 minutes to go FTL, and you have 8 hours worth of heat generation, which means you can do FTL SVL 68 times in a row before risking meltdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso this implies an 8 light year drive radius, which isn\u0027t enough to cross some gaps between stars, so if you come up with a \u0022rule change\u0022 to stop my easily thought of work around for stopping at will and building up to relativistic velocities (eject something out of the front of your bubble to stop you), then you also change the rules such that\u00A0 many stars and star clusters are unreachable or inescapable with this drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the problem with fictional science... it always breaks down or leads to ridiculous capabilities that have to be ignored for story purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS, since this drive allows for FTL displacement (and no, moving space instead of the vessel doesn\u0027t change anything for this purpose, just as a point to point jump wouldnt), how are you going to deal with the resultant ability to time travel?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are not limited with FTL travel. Just cool your SVL generator and fly out again. 7 LY max to be safe yeah, but you can SVL again once you cool off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood math by the way, but your average reader won\u0027t dissect the heat generation with math anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime travel?

They will be on high alert anyway. And the time it takes your ship to get here it can be intercepted and destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere actually is a tactical difference between translocation space moving past yoy and just blinking there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBliniking ia clearly superior.
