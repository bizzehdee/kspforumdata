All of the mods are said to work with .24.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried running it multiple times. Each time, the game will do one of a few things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 32-bit, the game runs out of memory while loading, despite ATM being installed, and the only parts/textures mod installed being B9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 64-bit, the game runs most of the startup, until it reaches a specific point, usually the stock cupola cockpit interior space, and freezes. It will continue to stay frozen for at least half an hour and most-often crash if I tab out or ctrl-alt-delete. I know it isn\u0027t eating all 16 GB of RAM, usually just ~4.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did one thing that might cause an issue. I set the 64-bit version to run with my NVIDIA card because on a previous install with the new B9, \u0026lt;100 part ships were lagging worse than I would expect a 1000-part ship to lag, and had what looked like 16-bit lighting quality, which I strongly suspect was related to KSP_x64 choosing to use my Intel card.... or perhaps even the CPU, for running graphics. It wasn\u0027t physics, since everything ran fairly smoothly in the map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid another test, this time with ATM set to 4 times compression (which, if I\u0027m not mistaken, means that they are scaled 4 times in EACH DIRECTION). 32-bit works now, albiet with all lighting, including the sun\u0027s reflection, 16-bit-looking and the physics timerate moving at only 80% realtime for a 120-part craft (which would normally not make my PC even think about lagging. I\u0027ve got a 770m and a 4700MQ and 16 GB of RAM).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea how to fix the wierd lighting bug, framerate issues, and preferably the 64-bit? I know that the 64-bit version is semi-compatible with these mods, since I ran them earlier today on it. I just got lethal amounts of lag and the same wierd 16-bit or 8-bit lighting bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot pics of the derpy 8-bit lighting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood lighting in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zJcc3nl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zJcc3nl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWTF bad lighting while running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/119nyxF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022119nyxF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: Welp, it appears that B9 has had another update a few minutes ago. Looks like I\u0027ll try that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT3: Turns out that it uses an updated moduleManager beyond the updated one. Good lord things are updating faster than I can download and test them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT4: Nope. That didn\u0027t fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT5: Redownloaded ATM and didn\u0027t edit the config to compress textures. Seems to have improved the situation, though lighting quality still seems better in the editor than ingame, but by a dramatically less severe amount. Takes up 400 megabytes more, but at least it runs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT6: it had nothing to do with ATM and everything to do with the pixel light count being set to maximum, which for some reason, makes the graphics worse. I am setting it to 0 for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT7: HOT DAMN! That plane right there, even at a TWR of less than 0.5 under typical conditions, with the torque disabled, is capable of supermaneuverability... with 155 tonnes and 241 KErbals onboard... It\u0027s a fraking airliner so neutrally stable with such good thrust vectoring that it can do Pugachev\u0027s Cobra or a Kulbit. Best part is.... The center of lift actually moves BACKWARD at supersonic speeds. It becomes MORE STABLE the faster it goes. Yup. Confirmed. I just did a double Kulbit with no SAS and no cockpit Torque and survived and pulled into normal flight.
