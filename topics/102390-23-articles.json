Could you please remove \u0022Station Core Docking Port\u0022 from science list?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Right now its just a duplicate part, which will confuse any unaware (like me), it appears in science list, it requires initial purchase and looks exactly like clampotron.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Or perhaps rename it to \u0022(outdated) Docking Port\u0022.

Agree though it should be removed.
