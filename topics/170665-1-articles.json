And in my rolling around trying to get back to sleep I was thinking about Star Wars a bit, and why Force Awakens bugged me. I came up with a hypothesis, and going to see Last Jedi today confirmed it for me. Here was the conclusion I came to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeorge Lucas was an auteur. Despite his famously bad filmmaking skills, what was undeniably there was a man who had a story that he wanted to tell. And we all wanted to hear it, so he told it. The fit and finish were pretty poor a lot of the time, but his story got told. And he was done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then Disney backed a \u003Cs\u003Edump truck\u003C/s\u003E \u003Cs\u003Esemi-trailer\u003C/s\u003E bulk freighter full of money up to his house and bought the franchise off of him. Not because they had more story to tell burning in their minds, but because they believed they could make more money off of it. And they brought on J.J. Abrams, not because he had this awesome Star Wars story taking up space on his computer, but because he has a history of turning out well-performing science fiction movies. They didn\u0027t bring on Rian Johnson because he shopped them a fantastic Star Wars story, they brought him on because they thought Looper was really creative and they wanted to see what he could come up with. None of these people are living out the dream of seeing the story they dreamed up in their film school dorm room brought to life on the screen. They\u0027re churning out quality product. And it shows. The production values are light-years ahead of the original movies. The dialog is polished. The pacing is tight. The action keeps you on the edge of your seat. And the story is going in circles. Because nobody actually has a story to tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I just sort of decided that, for me anyway, Star Wars ended with George\u0027s story, with Episode VI.

The new movies, I\u0027m not really thinking of them as part of the same story anymore, because they aren\u0027t. They\u0027re modern, mass-market, blockbuster films. I\u0027ll go see them, but I\u0027m going to walk in with the same attitudes and expectations that I would have walking into Infinity War, or Spider-Man, or Justice League. (Strike that.

But that\u0027s going to be a problem with any sequel to a finished war story, especially when the war was epic in scope but sketchy in detail, so there\u0027s not\u00A0really much worldbuilding, or motivation to fall back on. The Emperor wanted to rule the Galaxy because he was Evil (RTM) and ruling Galaxies is what Evil(RTM) characters want to do. OK, we see Evil(RTM) conveniently labeled as the Dark Side(RTM) of the Force(RTM) but a label is all it really is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good guys won at the end of ROTJ.\u00A0\u00A0Yay, good guys!
