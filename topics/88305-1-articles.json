I did that a while back and it at least ran smoother for a while. I can run and load and launch one mission but when I go to return to VAB to launch a second mission the game gives me a CTD and I have to start over. I hate 32 bit for its low memory usage and 64 bit for its lack of support. This is one reason I am installing a Linux partition and going to try 64 bit Linux to see what happens with RAM usage in that version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
