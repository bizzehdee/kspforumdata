I see now that much is fixed in 2.3 The part thats eating me is how well rotating the ship itself worked and why. The problem is that everything cooled off too quickly as it rotated away. Flipping end over end around 40 rpm the ship cooked up to about 700 only to chil down to normal as the section went retrograde. Is there a mod that alters heat retention/dissipation or a value somewhere I can alter to do so?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T03:35:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECouple of things; 2.2f.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Now this is all fine and dandy except that I\u0027m guessing the gap between the fairing halves allowed my lander inside to get cooked and I lost the parachute before I had time to react and begin a panicked roll to distribute heat. I should say that my second entry burn into Eve went much better after I jettisoned the fairing halves and used the fairing base\u002Bheatshield part to shield the craft.
