Man\u0153uvre nodes are only a rough approximation of the real behaviour of your rocket because they assume that any change of velocity is instantaneous. You may notice this when trying to effect a burn planned using a man\u0153uvre node: you never quite get things right because the actual burn doesn\u0027t cause an instantaneous change of velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is good enough for fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants, cowboy-style piloting, but it\u0027s entirely inappropriate for more complex missions where it\u0027s important to make the best use of your engines. Thus, Principia includes an elaborate flight planning system which let you plan burns in a much more realistic manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile Principia makes it possible to plan complex trajectories, it\u0027s important to understand that there are two things that it \u003Cem\u003Edoesn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E do because, well, they are part of the fun of using realistic N-body physics:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrincipia doesn\u0027t help you optimise the flight plan, e.g. by minimising the \u0394v. You\u0027ve got to look for good flight plans yourself, using intuition and trial and errors. You\u0027ll get better over time. And yes, it\u0027s hard, that\u0027s why they hire PhDs to do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrincipia doesn\u0027t help you execute the flight plan. Once you are done with the planning, you need to execute the man\u0153uvres by hand by starting and cutting off the engines just at the right time. You will not get this completely right, and in some cases a delay of a fraction of a second may cause significant changes to the trajectory down the road. That\u0027s ok, don\u0027t try to overdo it, you can always schedule a minor correction to compensate for any inaccuracies. In real life rocket scientists do just that as they learn more about the gravitational fields around unexplored celestials or because of intrinsic inaccuracies in the intensity of the burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe controls that let you plan your flight won\u0027t allow you to tune your \u0394v or your burn times extremely precisely (typically no finer than 1 mm/s). That\u0027s intentional: even if you were able to construct a flight plan that way, you wouldn\u0027t be able to execute it. If a small change of your \u0394v has a large effect on your future trajectory, you probably want to make smaller burns at different points along your mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
