KSP is getting boring to me. Just more... frustrating than boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need to find other games like KSP (well not exactly like it, but games that run like it). You see, KSP and Minecraft work on my, how you say, \u0022half dead\u0022 computer. Something happened to the motherboard, and trying to install AAA games and what they require, causes my computer to have an \u0022allergic reaction\u0022 and \u0022violently sneeze\u0022 out BSODs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have yet to isolate the issue, but it seems that as long as I play either game and don\u0027t use Antivirus software, I\u0027m fine. You may think this is a virus. I\u0027ve reinstalled Windows 7, five times. Each time was a complete clean install. Maybe it\u0027s what a virus did to my motherboard that caused it. *shrug*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway, I\u0027m looking for games, as I said, that will work like KSP and Minecraft do. Both games are Indie (I think KSP is Indie, anyway. Know Minecraft is), so... I need suggestions, if you don\u0027t mind. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nutbag Deluxe","CreatedById":45966,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T08:41:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInstall .NET Framework?
