EA means when i buy i buy as is and i have no guarantee that the game ever gets finished and/or in what state - therefore its normal for EA games to cost way less. To me what they have done seems pretty de-valuating to me - they want the full price of an AAA game now, they dont want to give me any guarantees for the finished product, they released the game in a rather bad state with not much content and im supposed to pretend that thats okay.\u00A0 In my personal opinion that doesnt show much respect for the community and im not even talking about the EULA in regards to privacy and modders ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also bought Sons of the Forest - the game is buggy - doesnt have that much content yet - but guess what - im okay with it because i see it as an investment/purchase and for that reason i only had to pay about 30 USD for it. It feels like the community is appreciated as investor and helping to make the game better. But when someone wants the full price of an AAA game for a really really early EA game then i feel more like a walking wallet ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-02T10:00:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2023 10:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Moons\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T09:57:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s an indie developer struggling to keep their nose above the water, I buy from whichever source gives them the biggest cut of the revenue, even if it\u0027s a bit more inconvenient for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s a mega-publisher with a turnover larger than some countries\u0027 GDP, I figure their beancounters have factored in all the cuts intermediaries take, and buy wherever is most convenient for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"securityinstruts","CreatedById":195356,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T10:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, I totally forgot the mods since rarely use them but they have been keeping KSP1 relevant for many people.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSeeing that many aspects of the game will be updated in a manner that will -most likely- break mods, having to manually install\u0026amp; manage the version that I would be using is preferable to sudden surprise update that -maybe- breaks the current save/mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor this reason I\u0027m leaning towards buying directly, can you change my mind?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a off-topic question for those that have the game;\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs there a launcher from which you can manage the version being launched?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T10:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can switch off auto-updates on Steam.
