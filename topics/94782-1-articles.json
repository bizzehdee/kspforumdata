But- because this is career mode I\u0027m on a budget. The best I\u0027ve done is about 1 Orange Fuel tank for $300,000. I\u0027m starting to wonder if numerous small runs are better then one large run. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbiting Space Station: Currently has two fuel tanks mounted on the bottom- but there\u0027s room for 4 if I ever can find a cheap(ish) method to send fuel.
