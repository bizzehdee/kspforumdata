However, Moho has the same problem and is much harder a target to hit because of its speed and orbital inclination. Eeloo is a long trip for which to try to plot the kind of hole-in-one precision you need to achieve an intercept. So probably the next easiest planetary system to visit is Jool and its moons. Both Jool and its moon Laythe have atmospheres you can use to brake, and Jool\u0027s SOI is a relatively large target. However, once you get there, you can get bounced around by the crowded moons, so navigating can be quite a trick. Plotting a return to Kerbin from an orbit of a moon is also an added degree of difficulty when you\u0027re ready to return. So there\u0027s no simple, best answer, but on the whole, I\u0027d suggest Dres, as it is much like a scaled-up version of a trip to Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T06:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr, you could not let the grumps discourage you and feel free to discuss the game you like.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a \u0022grump\u0022 and \u0022discouraging\u0022 for trying to get another player to set their own goals in a sandbox game and hopefully reinforce their already demonstrated explorative nature?

They are small and atmosphereless and their dv requirements are moderate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho is also quite small, but it needs much interplanetary dv and very accurate timings and burns. Even very small errors, seconds or single m/s, may cost 1000 m/s more than optimal. Beware also inaccuracies in orbit calculations, it is good idea to check orbit several times during flight (at least in 0.23, when I last made Moho trip, but as far as I know, they have not updated physics after that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool\u0027s moons are always interesting targets. They have very different properties. You can land nearly gravityless Pol. Vall is same type than Mun, but needs somewhat more dv. Laythe\u0027s atmosphere sets very special needs, descending is easy but ascent needs about 3500 m/s. Tylo needs about 3500 m/s to land and 3000 m/s to ascend, very heavy thrust and correct timings during descend and is clearly most demanding place in Jool\u0027s system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, there is only one place left. The ultimate challenge. Eve. Easy to land and very comfort place to drive rovers, but ascent stage must have enormous thrust and dv capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you see, different bodies need different ships and you have to decide if you want to learn atmospheric tricks, high thrust landers for heavy targets or accurate orbital adjustments for Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T05:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022merendel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022merendel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEven looking at the planet stats on the wiki can give you a prety good guesstimate for the airless bodies, just take the escape velocity and double it and you have a prety good shot at landing and takeing off agian with a bit of room to spare if you make an efficient landing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoubling the escape velocity is very conservative rule. It works on smaller bodies and novice players, but Tylo\u0027s escape velocity is 3100 m/s. 6200 m/s needs a huge two stage descent stage. Mechjeb uses about 3400-3500 m/s to land to Tylo from about 200 km orbit and I have done it by hand with about 3800 m/s. I have used rule, that descent from relatively low orbit needs one escape velocity or little more (especially Tylo, where limited thrust is an issue too). Ascent can be done with little less dv, but if you take one escape velocity, you have a reserve to make a little plane change to rendezvous mother ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
