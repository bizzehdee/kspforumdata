The pop-up to write something on the plaque never pops-up which I think it the main issue. The unresponsive Kerbal will still have the right-click menu (and can even take the flag back down), but that Kerbal will never move again.\n\nAs a workaround, I have to hire a new Kerbalnaut, bring them to plant a flag, and then just leave them there forever. Really unsatisfying.\n\nAny thoughts on a workaround for this?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOkay, I\u0027ve narrowed it a bit...
