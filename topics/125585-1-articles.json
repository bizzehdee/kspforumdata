BUT !!! There are ways to treat the problem , since there is no vaccine.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. You can use hyperedit and place your craft more than 2.5km away from where you are docked. Its important to make sure your orbit is moved by that much or you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be in physics range and bad stuff will happen.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. You can make all your docking ports a decoupler with a 0 force. This requires you to place a code into a .cfg file . I can help you with this one if you want cuz im fairly versed in module coding. The possible side effect on this method is that you will lose your port once its jettisoned. Try to decouple from the ship side, not the station side. Most the time the undocking ship is leaving a space station to be disposed of anyway....aka Soyuz, Dragon ect.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T13:51:37Z","Content":"\nI haven\u0026#39;t had it in 1.0.5, so I\u0026#39;ve been crossing my fingers, but it wasn\u0026#39;t on the list of bugs fixed so I\u0026#39;m trying not to get too hopeful.

As I noted above, the replication is unknown. It\u0026#39;s hard to track down a bug when the cause is completely unknown, and it happens relatively infrequently. So it becomes a question of how much time to spend tracing a single bug vs. fixing others, or working on content.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nA bug always feels like the worst bug when it afflicts someone. If it happens frequently to you, then please try to keep note of what\u0026#39;s happening. Perhaps you can help find the cause. It took me almost a month of working with a couple other people and poking about to track down a claw bug. And even then, it didn\u0026#39;t replicate 100% of the time. That was only one bug, and it took a lot of time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe docking bug is another one of those bugs that is really annoying and known to happen, but the steps are completely elusive. Same with the \u0022crashed into VAB\u0022 bug. Bugs that take hours to trigger with unknown steps are just about impossible to squash.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCheers,\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Claw\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T19:00:21Z","Content":"\nFew things I\u0026#39;ve noticed, and if any of this is already known to the OP feel free to flame. I can handle it. :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think there are two \u0022can\u0026#39;t undock\u0022 problems.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first is what seems the primary problem in this post. Somehow the ports are still connected but have a status \u0022undocked.\u0022 And since you can\u0026#39;t undock what isn\u0026#39;t docked... You get stuck. I might be wrong but I got the impression that this is a problem that primarily happens with the large docking port. I haven\u0026#39;t encountered any undocking problems of this kind anymore since I\u0026#39;ve stepped away from using the large docking port for \u0022docking\u0022 (as in: with the intention of undocking later) purposes. I still use them to piece large stations together (they\u0026#39;re a lot stiffer than the medium and small ports after all) but I hardly ever disconnect them once they are together. I\u0026#39;ve never encountered the bug anymore since I stopped undocking large ports.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe second seems to happen frequently with medium ports when the docking collars slide behind each other. The ports are truly undocked but somehow still interconnected and can\u0026#39;t get lose. Spinning might work to decouple but more often than not it rips one of the ports off completely which is often not desirable. A much simpler solution, since as far as KSP is concerned, the two parts are not connect, is time warp -- without physics active the two parts will simply float apart and the problem fixes itself.\n"}]}
