I put up an issue on the bug tracker, but I think lo-fi got a bit burnt out after our big push for a release and then the frantic fixing of critical bugs that followed. If you notice any actual missing textures in game (areas of a model that are pure white, not including the APU in which case that white area was never textured in the first place) let us know and I\u0027ll see what I can find and/or see if I can release a texture file you can stick in there for a temp fix. Otherwise, it shouldn\u0027t be an issue and you can safely ignore it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe invalid integer values are something I see in a lot of modded parts and I\u0027m still trying, occasionally, to track them down. Sometimes it\u0027s due to a module wanting a certain parameter to be formatted as an \u0022int\u0022 when the actual input is formatted like a \u0022float\u0022 in the config. The most common case is when a decimal place value is defined where a single digit was expected. From my experience there is no serious impact and, if the input truly is in the wrong format, the module simply reverts to the default value. The only real danger comes from badly formatting input where there \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E no default value defined in the code, but in those cases you would expect the code to not even compile properly. So, in the end, unless you are experiencing an error while using the part in which the invalid integer was detected, then you can safely ignore it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf lo-fi continues to be out of communication for an extended amount of time, I may look into issuing a patch for the latest release that you could all get from here.

This will, during loading of KSP, cause lockups when ram usage gets over the maximum load of the game or the maximum available on your system. Load-up lockups can also occur when a major error is encountered such as exceptions from mods that run during the loading process or formatting errors in texture replacement calls commonly made when compiling a part that uses a MODEL node to swap a texture but cannot locate the required texture to apply. It should be noted that USI Kolonization, while optimized rather well, is not the most ram-friendly mod. There are a lot of large textures being used which could easily be smaller, and a lot of models loaded which do not even fit very well with the current style of the main parts.

We\u0027d also need to find a way to apply the steering mechanisms to the separate parts of the single model. I won\u0027t say it\u0027s a bad idea, but it\u0027s a complicated one. Also, I really don\u0027t experiment with that sort of thing. That\u0027s all lo-fi. I do stuff in teh coding part, and I\u0027m still hard at work on adding new things for the day when lo-fi decides to return to us and lead us all into glory... whoops, wrong story... ahem, moving on... I will say the idea of having less physics joints to deal with and wrapping a ton of wheels into a single part for those rovers that simply require an absolute ton of wheels is a nice thought. However, without a way to dynamically generate these multi-wheel constructs, I don\u0027t see it being very practical. To make it work really well, you\u0027d need to implement something like a procedural wheel-mount frame which, depending on the length of the frame, would contain a number of wheels spaced according to the selected scale of the wheel and the base wheel part-size. You would then attach the frame to the craft via a single attach position, but for stability of the craft you would need to strut the ends of the frame to the hull as well. The technology to do this exists, even within KSP, but has never been done quite to this level. For instance, the older procedural fairing mod has a fairing base that can be scaled, which affects the base number of fairing stack nodes it has, but then can also take a modifier for how many stack nodes to include and will then re-position them based on their size and the number requested, and also by an offset position from the center of the plate. In our case, the nodes would be replaced with complete wheels and we actually wouldn\u0027t need a modifier for the offset since ours would be linear. If we could do this, however, then we would have already done it with the tracks to make the long-requested procedural tracks. We don\u0027t have procedural tracks though, due to some limitations in the game engine. These same limitations would likely limit us here as well. If you simply have a ton of separate wheels on the craft, you might have more physics joints, but you also don\u0027t have to strut anything down since they\u0027re already attached to the vessel at multiple spots and will interact from that position correctly. With the procedural frame, you\u0027d end up with the entire set of wheels interacting only with the part in the middle of the craft where the frame is attached... much like the way Tracks are right now, which is another reason why making super-long tracks isn\u0027t really practical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy most recent dabbling relates to all the checks we have to do with our modules to control whether or not they are allowed to exist or be active. My most recent idea to get around all these necessary checks is to simply assume that, if the module is present on the part and the vessel is a valid vessel for those modules, the module is allowed to be run on that part. Then, using a vessel module for simplicity\u0027s sake, we attach a KFController module onto any craft that is loaded into the flight scene. This vessel module will first take stock of the presence of several modules on any part within the craft: KFRepulsor, KFModuleWheel, ModuleWaterSlider, and KFDustFX. all it needs is a single instance of that module on any part attached to the craft to return true on any of those. Then it takes a reading on what the vessel is currently flagged as (VesselType) and if it returns as \u0022debris\u0022 or something like \u0022Kerbal\u0022 or \u0022EVA\u0022 (I forget at the moment what it returns for EVA Kerbals) then we start a routine that will systematically run through every part of the craft and look for the modules which should not exist and will then, first off, disable anything that needs to be disabled (such as the water slider itself, and the possible debug option for it\u0027s view state, which I have working perfectly now by the way) and then, upon completing that, removes the module from that part. At the same time, this new vessel module could, potentially, also keep track of the adding of certain modules to parts that require them but don\u0027t have them defined in the part configs. It\u0027s still very much a work in progress, but progress is being made. The initial work on this new module was inspired by the possibility of the water slider spawning in the air when BDArmory missiles are fired from a repulsor-enabled craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood to have some discussion back.
