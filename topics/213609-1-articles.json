This doesnt need to add a crew space. I used to use the 2 person cylinder but it seems to no longer have an airlock. The 1 person lander is useful but it sticks out beyond the basic diameter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you give us airlock parts matching the cylinder diameters. On clicking the door the game would bring up the list of the crew and allow us to choose who comes out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere would be no flight controls so it should be lighter than the lander cans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
