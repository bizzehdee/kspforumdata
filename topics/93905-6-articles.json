On Venus the lack of normal force means you need to hang under a buoyant balloon, this is a well established technology and simply means that every habitat must carry some parasitic mass fraction of balloon and lifting gas, it is likely to be less then the parasitic fraction to land things on Mars. The radiation issue is moot for Venus as you have Earth-surface levels of radiation in the clouds due to the atmosphere above, to match that on Mars the habitat has too be buried which requires Regolith moving equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not practical initially to mine any body for any kind of raw metal that would be usable for building, that takes enormous equipment, infrastructure that is nearly global in scale and lots of fossil-fuel energy here on Earth utilizing the optimum ore deposits discovered over centuries of prospecting. Rocks are simply not a good feedstock, here on Earth EVERY industrial process benefits from operating on a gas or liquid rather then a solid, given that it is inevitable that atmosphere will be the only effective feedstock for industry on both Mars and Venus until populations are into the tens of thousands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth atmospheres are broadly similar in composition and have CHON elements in similar ratios, Venus atmosphere has 2 orders of magnitude higher density and it\u0027s Hydrogen is concentrated in a defined layer which will make collecting it somewhat easier. In addition Sulfur and Chlorine can be obtained in the Venus atmosphere at trace levels which have industrial uses. Overall the extraction of water and breathable air, and plastic feed-stocks looks to be broadly similar on both planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe presence of acidity is negative for Venus but it is again a highly OVER-RATED, conventional materials on Earth hold acids of the concentrations found on Venus all the time as part of our normal routine industrial processes. Simple Polyethylene plastic is highly resistant and should serve adequately as a skin-coat on every exposed surface. A person exposed to Venus atmosphere at the tops of the cloud layers would need to have a respirator mask both for breathing and to protect the mucus membranes from irritation, but the skin is not immediately burned by such diffuse droplets as some people wildly speculate. A plastic bunny-suit would be desirable for longer term work, this is comparable to the level of protection needed when spray-painting a car here on Earth and it pails in comparison to the equipment needed to go out on to the surface of Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemperature and Pressure being at life-sustaining, and indeed life-optimum levels at the target altitude on Venus removes HUGE difficulties in the design, construction and maintenance of the habitation spaces being contemplated for Venus as compared to Mars. On Venus in the event of fire it would be practical to sound an alarm don small breathing-masks littered all over the habitat at WWI speed and vent the atmosphere, a move which would kill every person not in a space-suit on a Mars colony. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all likelyhood the construction of new habitats on Venus by simply building a scaffolding between two existing habitats and tenting it over with plastic and breathable air would be comparable to building suspension bridges or high-rise buildings here on Earth, safety nets and safty lines are all thats needed and the fact that your 55km above Venus matters not a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe high difficulty of Mars Entry-Decent and Landing which promise to eat up large mass fractions even if they can be scaled up to the sizes necessary to get reasonable sized habitats to the surface. Venus with it\u0027s higher atmospheric scale height, lower gravity and lack of a solid surface is by far the Easiest EDL in the inner solar system, and that includes Earth. On Venus an inflatable decelerator will bring a vehicle down to sub-sonic speeds well above the target altitude at which point balloon inflation will halt the decent, decelerators can be deployed before entry has been committed too so this leaves only one simple system that is life-critical, Martian EDL requires a half dozen critical systems to work during EDL, up to and including not putting the landing-legs on excessively large rocks at the last second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe largest detriments for Mars colonization are the long transit times and radiation experienced in transit, this is really the Mars Akilles-heel, we do not have ANY mitigation or control of GCR and the dosages will be too high on a Martian mission. Transit in space is the worst for GRC, but Mars surface continues to expose crea to half the in space dosage. Venus clouds bring dosages down to nearly Earth-surface levels leaving only the transits as windows of radiation exposure.

For Venus we have 128 and 96 day outbound and inbound transits, total 224 day. But on Mars the outbound transit is bigger then the whole combined Venus transit at 336, and then the inbound is 320, total 656 days! Worse the 336 day surface stay on Mars will effectively expose crew to 168 days equivalent GRC dosage bringing the total up to 824 days equivalent, a multiple of 3.67 over the Venus mission. In addition the total mission duration for Mars is almost exactly 1 whole year longer at 2.72 vs 1.88 that\u0027s a whole years worth of food and supplies needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA is only now looking to look at do 1 year stays on the ISS now that 6 months has become operationally routine. Outside the radiation belts they are willing to do 6-month flights to things like NEA and that is the edge of the envelope right now. Venus would be the next step after that, as the radiation dosage would be only a modest increase over the Asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Biggest downside to missions to Venus is return to orbit from the cloud level. This is not a complex problem though, it is one that is simply concurred with mass as we already know how to do this on Earth and the Venus assent is comparable. Considering that many hard-core Mars advocates now don\u0027t even want to bother bringing people back from Mars this would by their own logic not be necessary on Venus either and the largest down-side to Venus would be off the table. Not that I support that kind of one-way silliness mind you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T16:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome reminders:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMars\u0027 surface gravity is about 1/3 of an Earth G. Its CO2 dominant atmosphere is roughly 1% the density/ pressure of Earth. This means that launching from its surface requires less dV than from Earth\u0027s surface, even with weather challenges. But even that relatively small air density allows for some aerobraking and chuting during entry/ landing. The stationary landing target can relatively easily be acquired and landed at. There are pros and cons regarding the dV required for a round trip to and from Mars. A base can be partially or completely buried in order to provide radiation protection and moderate temperatures.

While its air pressure is about the same as Earth sea level, the dominant CO2 makes for denser air than the less dominant nitrogen at Earth. Even with aerodynamic assist (and weather challenges), this means that launching from the clouds would require at least as much dV as from Earth\u0027s surface. While aerobraking and chuting would be practical at Venus, even at high altitudes, a problem which presents itself is the ability to target a relatively delicate moving platform and successfully match its speed and actually safely land there. There are pros and cons regarding the dV required for a round trip to and from Venus. A floating base would generally be protected from deadly radiation by the atmosphere.

No atmosphere in practical terms, so no aerobraking. But at less than 1/5th of an Earth G, landing at a fixed target and launching are relatively trivial, as is the dV for a round trip to and from the Moon. A base can be buried in order to protect from deadly radiation and to moderate temperatures. While there are no atmospheric resources (unlike at Mars and Venus), the logistics of exploiting surface resources on the Moon are more feasible than doing so at Mars. Space suits required outside. Since the Moon is days away (rather than months or years), personnel and animals can be rotated such that any negative effects of low G can be mitigated. We can learn how to extract resources at the Moon and how to live there, which will help us know better in some ways how to live on Mars and even at the clouds of Venus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may have erred on making a distinction between air pressure and density.

It is also within easy delta V reach of the main Asteroid Belt, meaning that Mars could export any goods and resources needed by asteroid miners that they can\u0027t produce for themselves locally and can\u0027t afford to import from Earth. This would allow a \u0022triangle trade\u0022 to be set up, where Mars imports high tech goods and skilled workers from Earth, the Asteroid Belt mining colonies import anything that can\u0027t be economically produced locally from Mars, and Earth imports rare and precious metals from the Asteroid Belt that aren\u0027t in adequate supply on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA case has also been made for why we would want access to resources from Near Earth Asteroids. The high cost of lifting equipment and consumables from Earth, and the relative ease with which we can transfer between Earth and NEAs makes them attractive sources of in-situ resources. For example, a highly automated process might allow rocket fuel and any other useful resources to be shipped from NEAs to a station in a Highly Eccentric Earth Orbit (HEEO). If such a station could support manufacturing, then potentially most of the hardware and resources needed to get from Earth to anywhere won\u0027t have to be lifted from Earth, while the remainder (such as the crew) could be lifted to the station via SSTOs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking a case for the settlement of Venus needs to be economically realistic. We need to know how self-sufficient a base at Venus could be made to be, and how it would fit in with the economics of a developed inner solar system. If a colony at Venus can provide a valuable contribution to such an economy, then it should be sold on that basis. Unfortunately, the video does not explain what this contribution might be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should also be noted that in the outer solar system, floating \u0022cloud cities\u0022 in the atmospheres of the gas giants could offer an incredibly valuable resource. The atmospheres of all four of the gas giants are rich in the insanely valuable isotope helium 3, which is the second highest energy density fuel known to man behind antimatter, and the highest energy density fuel available naturally in our environment. Helium 3 can be used to fuel highly efficient and clean burning fusion reactors, and also as fuel for fusion thermal rockets. Helium 3 offers such high energy density as a fuel that it provides more than adequate delta V for starship propulsion. It will take longer to settle and develop the outer solar system than the inner solar system, but the potential economic value of helium 3 is so ridiculously high that it will be well worth the trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T16:48:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo if NASA do this we can expect amazing sunrise and sunset pics \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"randomness5555","CreatedById":53367,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T17:06:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo when\u0027s somebody going to replicate this with RSS and Hooligan labs?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Before you say \u0022Why don\u0027t you do it?\u0022, I will point out that I have tried RSS before.

It is both self defeating and unproductive. I will however make a few observations from the responses I\u0027ve read here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a conceptual point of view, a Venus mission is very possible. There are technical challenges to be sure, but we have some amazing human beings living all over the world today and I\u0027ve no doubt that the issues could be solved. Mars presents a different set of challenges, and it would also have the talent applied to those challenges as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if we then consider that all the responses bring up valid points, and we also consider that this thread is actually a microcosm of life on our small planet, then I have this to say:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It is a simple fact that EVERY human being on this planet is both unique and inextricably dependent on each other. We simply cannot survive alone. Yes, you can live in the wild, and feed off the land, but in the end, without another human being (more specifically one of the opposite ...), then survival is a guaranteed fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Given then, that we are all interdependent (especially in today\u0027s world), we cannot \u0022ignore\u0022 the opinions of others. Wars are fought for precisely that reason. As this thread demonstrates, opinions are as numerous as the number of people living on this planet. How do we resolve this fundamental \u0022conflict\u0022 that exists with so many opinions competing for attention? This is the problem we as a people face existentially, as well as a nation, state, city, and family. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. To do great things is hard. It takes a large number of people coming together for a common goal, and the resolve to \u0022see it through\u0022. This is especially difficult to achieve in a democracy, for the very reasons stated in 2, above. In a \u0022totalitarian\u0022 state, more \u0022control\u0022 is exerted and people are \u0022forced\u0022 into a common goal. The reasons may well be altruistic, and \u0022righteous\u0022 in the minds of the leaders, but in the end it is a small number dictating to a large number. Even though \u0022great things\u0022 can be achieved, there will be a cost in terms of our humanity. So with this said, Who is the boss? Great things require a leader, someone to move the vision forward to completion, and to \u0022motivate\u0022 the group to work together to achieve it. Great leaders change the minds and hearts of the people. As we get more and more interconnected, this problem will increase in scope. Even now, we see \u0022mob rules\u0022 in our daily lives with twitter and other social media platforms. We see nation states using this same technology to control their populations. Such a dilemma... Who among us is willing to take on the astronomical challenge of \u0022changing the hearts and minds\u0022 of the worlds people?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. NASA is well aware of the \u0022flighty nature\u0022 of United States politics. At this moment in our history we have a roughly 50% split between 2 competing ideologies, and this is also present across the word. As we as a species become inevitably more interdependent, we must learn to better coexist, or we will perish of our own hand. NASA has a difficult challenge to address in \u0022igniting\u0022 the minds and hearts of the people to \u0022see the vision\u0022 of what space exploration can provide man for its benefit and ultimate survival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Whether or not we go to Venus or Mars is not in the hands of the engineers and scientists. They push the boundaries, and explore what is \u0022possible\u0022 and have little say in what \u0022humanity\u0022 will chose to do. It is my great hope that we can, through dialogs such as this all over the world, come to a consensus on what is \u0022important\u0022 to our survival, and work towards realizing those dreams. I dream of a future society where human dignity is respected and revered, and the opinions of those I would spend a lifetime opposing are considered on their merits just as I would hope mine are by those would spend a lifetime opposing me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Finally, all the real science discussed here warms me, as I\u0027m a geek at heart, and I simply cannot understand why anyone would NOT want to learn all there is to learn in the universe. So much to learn and so little time. 1 lifetime is NOT enough, and I hope we solve that problem too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-01T23:08:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2015 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa_Joe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
