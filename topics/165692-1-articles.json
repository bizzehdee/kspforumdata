Some pretty horrendous footage coming out of the country and I\u0027m concerned for everyone caught in the disaster.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks and good luck to everyone\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: turns out the most recent earthquake has been tagged onto the last earthquake thread.

Frankly there will be more important things to be doing than checking in with the forum. Assuming nobody at Squad has had their personal safety or that of their families threatened at all, there remain the sustained problems of structural checks, power cuts, transport infrastructure issues and broadband failure are likely to be a problem. Equally if anybody has been seriously affected, Squad are hardly about to make a public service announcement about it - it would be disrespectful.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think this is a great place for well-wishers to offer sympathy and concern, but I recommend avoiding conjecture or starting rumours at this point.
