Its a nice tool if you dont care 100% about perfect physics and want to go faster, but it will knock off or add a small amount of velocity/altitude here and there if used. Another possiblity if that you have eneterted atmosphere if any planet that has one. This means that you are feeling drag, which will lower your speed and altitude. Another possiblity is that you left throttle at a very low setting that you did not notice. Ive had this happen, as some of the engines do not create any sound or effects when they are at very close to 0 throttle, but still give some thrust. One more possibility is that you could be experiencing a krakendrive effect. While it is an actual engine that has been made multiple times, many clipped parts can often end up causing anything from minor to server acceleration/torque. If possible, check that there is minimal clipping, and make absolutely sure no moving parts are clipped (landing gear, wheels, ect).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T06:50:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is also some bug which changes orbits occasionally. It is very rare event, maybe about one ship of hundred see it. I do not know how to demonstrate it reliably or is it due to KSP or some mod. It effects most often when ship is on trajectory from outer planet to inner planet. Effect is probably around tens of meters per second. It can not be immediately seen on map view, if I fly other crafts, but when I try to execute deep space maneuver, I notice that I have not encounter and it may take hundreds of meters per second to fix it. I try to fly optimal ships on optimal trajectories, so typically it means failed mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be some error in SOI detection. I installed Kerbal Construction Time couple of weeks ago and when I warped time with KCT, once it interrupted acceleration and showed message that some craft, which had left Kerbin\u0027s SOI couple of hours ago had detected SOI change. That craft went to Eve, so its velocity referenced to Kerbin was low and it was still near Kerbin. When I had correction maneuver about one hundred days later, I noticed that just that craft was on wrong orbit. Magnitude of the error suggested, that it may be due to false SOI changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI warp always manually to SOI and run transition at low warp factor, when I insert my craft to interplanetary trajectory. After SOI crossing I check changes in orbit, use MechJeb to calculate midcourse correction, and put alarm to Kerbal Alarm Clock. Typically the maneuver is after tens or hundreds of days and I go to make other things with other crafts until KAC alarms. So the bug can not be real SOI crossing at too large time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T13:08:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Epanzerb has mentioned the most common culprit; phantom acceleration forces due to part clipping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve noticed it a lot more since .90. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T13:18:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027s quite unfortunate.
