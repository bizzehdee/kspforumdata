On top of that, all the side boosters are hanging on the fairing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the sideboosters may be well strutted, but the fairing base fails to hold that weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ESo why does the disassembly happen when you stage the first boosters?\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs far as I can tell it has 2 reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne reason is the less obvious one which is change in G force by differentiating \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E when you drop the first side boosters. This might be the final trigger to shock the construction into disassembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EThe other more obvious reason: \u003C/u\u003EThe tanks are also strutted to one another in a circle around the fairing. This actually strengthens the integrity of the fairing. By the looks of it you have 14 boosters attached that are strutted to each other in a 2x7 symmetrical setup. When you stage the first set you basically have 2 groups of 6 boosters that strut each 6 boosters on either side. But those 2 groups of 6 are not connected anymore because the tanks you dropped on the first stage held them together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now you have alot of weight hanging on both sides of the fairing, but both sides hang loose. So there is suddenly a large peak in centrifugal force on either side at the base of the fairing holding both halves because 1750tons is pulling on either side of the fairing. That in combination with the change in G force due to staging is what is causing the disassembly by the looks of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EThe solution to this.\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can procedurally increase the size of the fairing base up to a very large width. Stretching a procedural fairing base in it\u0027s width increases the joint attachment strength of the fairing base and may increase the bar to how much stress the fairings can take. So try to create a larger fairing base (as large as you can to rule out this posibility)\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe even strut the fairing walls to the fairing base, and the fairing base to a root or grandfather part (mammoth engine). Strutting the fairing walls should be possible with procedural fairings. But it\u0027s a long time since I used the mod as I\u0027m rather pleased with stock fairings and not much into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E lately which I mostly use this mod with.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for the procedural fairings mod, it had and probably still has bugs. I can tell you I had problems with the procedural fairings mod a long while back in v0.25 causing parts ripping of when seperating them. This is another case entirely, but the point is that the mod did have bugs, and might still have bugs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the long and detailed input, hope it gave some ideas or better yet the solution:d\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-21T06:15:57Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2016 06:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporized Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
