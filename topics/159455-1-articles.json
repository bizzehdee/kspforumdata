Thermal control systems are much better than the radiators, and you can put them anywhere on the ship instead of right on top of the part. If I had to guess though (and I have to cuz I can\u0027t see your ship), I\u0027d say you don\u0027t have an engineer on board. Or he\u0027s a low-skill engineer. That\u0027s usually the biggest culprit for crappy drilling rigs. Post a screenshot, though, and people can help you better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-19T23:35:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a bug in version 1.2.2, where radiators do not work for drills when attached to asteroids.

You can use apps like Dropbox or imgur, but I\u0027ve just used postimage. You Don\u0027t need an account or anything. Hit upload image and choose which folder to grab it from. You\u0027ll have a KSP folder, which will have a screenshot folder (you probably already know you can take screenshots by just hitting F1). Pick the one you want and upload it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen on your reply here, hit\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Einsert other media\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eand\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Einsert image from URL.\u003C/em\u003E Copy the link with control c and paste it with control v and it\u0027ll show up in your post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
