The fact that an object (like a ship) sweeps an equal area in equal time around a body (like a planet) is the result of how the object orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring an orbit: When the object is further out from the body, it\u0027s speed is slower.

(Hopefully you\u0027ve seen this while playing the game.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when the object is further away AND is traveling slower, it just so happens that the area covered is equal to when the object is closer AND going faster.
