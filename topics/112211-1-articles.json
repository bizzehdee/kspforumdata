Running windows 8 64 bit, I\u0027ve seen that this is a conflict, but It\u0027s ran fine for me many times before.

I realized that Nvidia dropped an update yesterday and that\u0027s the only thing that has changed. So I went to the Nvidia folder in my drive and ran the setup.exe. Not sure if it got corrupted along the way through the install or what. But apparently rerunning the setup fixed it. It\u0027s 337.88 so if anyone\u0027s having a similar issue hope it helps. If anyone could give insight on why that caused that it\u0027d be great to hear, I\u0027m assuming it was just a bad install, it caused a few of my games to go down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
