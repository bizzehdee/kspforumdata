Too much detail, too much going on... However with 64 bit KSP things might be different, although I am yet to see much improvement from the 64bit version. Sure, graphics are being processed faster, but the game still chugs when I put say, a heavy object attached to another object without struts. the bouncing/jittering thing still happens and the game runs like mud. So yeah, I can put all the settings up super high now and its great, but I still don\u0027t see that 64bit power being used as far as the physics computations going or the actual game itself. Loading time slightly improved, but hardly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weltraumpony","CreatedById":40545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T23:53:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei been registered at your Site but i cant post new Topics or Answers. \u0022Security Violation....\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if i switch to internal View of the Freelancer command Pod, Sight from inside is 90 Degrees moved upward. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Please can you fix this ?! thx in advance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egreetings WP\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T15:57:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Weltraumpony\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Weltraumpony\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehi,\u003Cp\u003Ei been registered at your Site but i cant post new Topics or Answers. \u0022Security Violation....\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if i switch to internal View of the Freelancer command Pod, Sight from inside is 90 Degrees moved upward. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Please can you fix this ?! thx in advance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egreetings WP\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel bad for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xenon2462","CreatedById":106973,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T16:40:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Devo you wouldn\u0027t know me but that is not the point.
