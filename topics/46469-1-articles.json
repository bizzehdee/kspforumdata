This can be used to cheat... er... to change your orbit without using any fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen physics is turned on, I have the feeling nothing is really stationary. Everything \u0022vibrates\u0022 perhaps due to roundoff or perhaps on purpose to give a seed for dynamic instabilities. I believe SAS can even contribute to the vibrations if it is trying to counteract the small perturbations and creating perturbations of its own. I\u0027m sure you have seen the AP/PE markers wobble when very nearly circular, and AN/DN nodes wobble with very low inclinations. These are the vibrations I am talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say try building a craft with the command module or remote guidance unit as close to the center of mass as you can possibly manage.
