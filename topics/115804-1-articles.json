This breaks the fairing, and this might be what causes the time warp bug. I\u0027m not sure why it would cause the orbit line to break, though. This is solved by having the fairings deploy before or simultaneous to the LAS firing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T18:32:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TJPrime**"}]}
