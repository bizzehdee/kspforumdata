I am having huge problems with managing the fuel of spaceplanes with both LF only engines and LF\u002BOx engines. I have TAC Fuel Balancer installed, and one solution seems to be to set my rocket tanks to IN for both Ox and LF, but is there a stock solution to jet engines taking LF from your rocket tanks?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T19:26:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wisnoskij\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T05:40:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re having problems with your center of mass moving, it\u0027ll be less complicated to use an empty RCS tank paired with a full one to help balance the plane out throughout the flight. Unless you have very, VERY heavy RCS usage during your flight, the loss in propellant in those tanks won\u0027t have as big of an affect on your COM compared to the draining of your fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother good tip for SSTO\u0027s is to try and figure out how much delta V you want/need to get into orbit and then to carry out your mission. This number should represent all your dV requirements from the jet/rocket engine switch to landing. Depending on where you want to go, anywhere from 2k-3.5k dV will give you a good margin and some usefulness. Once you have this number figured out, all you then have to do is put in enough LF to bring your plane up to Jet engine cutoff. It requires a lot of playtesting and a more standardized ascent profile (IE, almost the same every time), but it will simplify fuel management if you set it up so that the LF drains without affecting your COM. (Which can be done by having the LF be right on the COM)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Col_Jessep","CreatedById":4071,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T10:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use RCS Build Aid: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996-1-0-2-RCS-Build-Aid-v0-7-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996-1-0-2-RCS-Build-Aid-v0-7-1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod shows you the center of mass and the dry center of mass. Keep them close together. Try to design your entire spaceplane around one large center tank and run fuel lines from it to the engines if necessary. To avoid ugly, long fuel lines it is sometimes useful to pipe your fuel into the wings and from the wings to the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wisnoskij","CreatedById":143705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T14:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is not fuel use unbalancing the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of my tanks are connectioned (I have three stacks of the second level plane parts), jets on the outside, reliant\u0027s on the inside.
