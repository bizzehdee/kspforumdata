There is a map in the ebook that shows the relative locations and distances used between landing sites and the book itself details scenarios fairly well. The same thing with the vessels, other than a physical description there are pretty good descriptions of systems and engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I\u0027ll have to finish the book and see how it turns out, but so far I think the challenge should start like the book starts, so some pre-planning and initial placement of assets would need to be done first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it could all be done with stock parts but KAS/KIS might be needed to keep it close to the book. For instance the main character takes solar panels from the Hab array and uses them on one of the rovers. He also travels and searches for a buried RTG to use in one of the rovers and actually takes it back and buries it later. So maybe being able to pick up parts and move them around would make the challenge even better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll go back today and make notes of the distances and relative locations so far and see if this would be actually feasible. If it can be kept to Stock Parts (Even allowing for KAS/KIS) then getting the challenge setup and ready to go could actually be saved and shared as a gamesave for everyone to try. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of right now, 50% through the book the main character has had to get rovers working for long distance travel, gone a few Km\u0027s to retrieve an RTG, gone a couple hundred KM\u0027s (I think) to retrieve the old Pathfinder and Sojourner Lander/Rover (For communications with Earth) and Mission control is planning on re-routing a ship bound for earth into a new trajectory for a near-earth rendezvous with a resupply ship, which will then head back to Mars to get the stranded Astronaut. His main mission at this point is to make it 3200Km to a waiting ascent vehicle to renezvous with the newly-inbound ship coming from Earth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge will most likely change as the book progresses, I\u0027ll try and finish it quickly and outline the rest of the challenge accordingly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest case scenario would be for me (or anyone who has had a similar idea) to build the ships, rovers and Hab and place them to start the challenge and then simply upload the save file and let everyone follow the order of the book.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone else has already done this, or has ideas, post em here!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T13:44:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 01:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Eleven\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gigaboom2","CreatedById":112218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T22:06:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is my favorite book of all time.
