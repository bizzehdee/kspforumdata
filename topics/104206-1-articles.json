There is a map in the ebook that shows the relative locations and distances used between landing sites and the book itself details scenarios fairly well. The same thing with the vessels, other than a physical description there are pretty good descriptions of systems and engines.\n\nOf course I\u0027ll have to finish the book and see how it turns out, but so far I think the challenge should start like the book starts, so some pre-planning and initial placement of assets would need to be done first. \n\nI think it could all be done with stock parts but KAS/KIS might be needed to keep it close to the book. For instance the main character takes solar panels from the Hab array and uses them on one of the rovers. He also travels and searches for a buried RTG to use in one of the rovers and actually takes it back and buries it later. So maybe being able to pick up parts and move them around would make the challenge even better.\n\nI\u0027ll go back today and make notes of the distances and relative locations so far and see if this would be actually feasible. If it can be kept to Stock Parts (Even allowing for KAS/KIS) then getting the challenge setup and ready to go could actually be saved and shared as a gamesave for everyone to try. \n\nAs of right now, 50% through the book the main character has had to get rovers working for long distance travel, gone a few Km\u0027s to retrieve an RTG, gone a couple hundred KM\u0027s (I think) to retrieve the old Pathfinder and Sojourner Lander/Rover (For communications with Earth) and Mission control is planning on re-routing a ship bound for earth into a new trajectory for a near-earth rendezvous with a resupply ship, which will then head back to Mars to get the stranded Astronaut. His main mission at this point is to make it 3200Km to a waiting ascent vehicle to renezvous with the newly-inbound ship coming from Earth. \n\nThe challenge will most likely change as the book progresses, I\u0027ll try and finish it quickly and outline the rest of the challenge accordingly. \n\nBest case scenario would be for me (or anyone who has had a similar idea) to build the ships, rovers and Hab and place them to start the challenge and then simply upload the save file and let everyone follow the order of the book.\n\nIf anyone else has already done this, or has ideas, post em here!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T13:44:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 01:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Eleven**"},{"CreatedByName":"gigaboom2","CreatedById":112218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T22:06:30Z","Content":"This is my favorite book of all time.

We do know from the book that the Hab is a dome with 3 airlocks, the Hermes has a ring for artificial gravity, the MDV has an apollo style design in the respect that it leaves the landing struts and descent stage on Mars when it takes back off again. \n\nThere was a quick glimpse of the rover in the teaser trailer but it looked generic, same thing with the MDV, it looked like an Orion style craft. \n\nI\u0027m working on the designs for the rovers, hab and MDV right now, they\u0027re all pretty beta right now, and I\u0027d love to be able to properly deliver and land them in the game as well as just use them in a scenario/challenge. Right now they are just basic designs, I think if I get them all to the point where I\u0027m happy with how they look, I\u0027ll start working on delivery systems for them too. I\u0027m also confident that KIS will be the only mod needed, and only because it would be more true to the book if you actually had to go pick up the RTG and place/store Solar Panels as you traveled around. I don\u0027t think there is a way to do that kind of thing with the Stock system\n\nHere\u0027s a couple shots of my first attempts at the Hab, Rover, MDV and a preliminary version of Hermes:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Same thing with the Pathfinder/Sojouner. All I need to do now is tweak the Hab and make it launchable, as well as come up with simple designs for the satellites they have in orbit around Mars, and the Hermes resupply. \n\nAt this point, I\u0027ve been able to keep everything stock, except for KIS, you really need to be able to take things apart to keep in line with the story. I\u0027ve tested taking sojourner apart and placing the solar panels on the rovers, that was fun to do.

Here were my suggestions:\n\n1) Send 2 unmanned ascent stages to Duna. These are our DAV\u0027s (Duna Ascent Vehicles). These should be landed at least 3,200 KM apart since this is the distance Mark Watney travels. These were Ares 3 and 4 in the book, but lets just call them A and B so that everyone can name their own.\n\n**BONUS)** The DAV\u0027s should be capable of mining their own fuel (since if I remember correctly the Ares mission MAV\u0027s had to be on Mars ahead of time in order to have enough time to create fuel for when the Ares crew needed to take off). \n\n**BONUS)** DAV \u0022B\u0022 is a sketchy as possible. Mark Watney had to strip Ares 4 to the bare minimum in order to get enough dV to catch up to the Hermes.\n\n2) Send a multicrew mission crew to Duna and land at the \u0022A\u0022 site. They should bring at least 1 rover. One of these crew members must be an Engineer: this is our Mark Watney.\n\n**BONUS:** Bring 2 rovers\n\n**BONUS:** construct your rovers so that one rover can tow the second.\n\n**BONUS:** bring along a Hab unit / Duna base. if you choose not to go this route your lander will serve as your Hab\n\n**BONUS**\n\n3) Evacuate your crew in the DAV \u0022A\u0022, leaving behind your Engineer (lets call him Pirate Ninja, that\u0027s easier). Your Pirate Ninja should now be by himself, with no means of leaving Duna other than to rover his (or her) way over to the DAV \u0022B\u0022 site.\n\n4) Let the roving begin! Make your way to DAV \u0022B\u0022\n\n**BONUS:** bring both (if you brought 2) rovers form site A to site B\n\n5) Reach DAV \u0022B\u0022 and launch and rendezvous with your interplanetary vehicle and bring Pirate Ninja home. \n\n**BONUS:** Your interplanetary ship takes a trip back to Kerbin before returning to Duna to pick up Pirate Ninja\n\n**SUPER BONUS:** Your interplanetary ship only slingshots past Kerbin on the first return, and slighshots past Duna for the final pickup. This means you can\u0027t establish an orbit!\n\nThere you have it. I\u0027m normally a career player, but perhaps I\u0027ll spend time this week in Sandbox trying to complete this mission myself, since I don\u0027t currently have the tech or money to do it in Career.\n\nI think this provides a pretty thorough recreation. The only thing that would be better would be if the engineers can construct/repair ships on the fly, especially if you can rob parts from one to add to another. Then we could add mission elements for scavenging parts off of another rover like Watney does with the Pathfinder probe. \n\nIf anyone does this challenge, please take and share pictures!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T16:10:40Z","Content":"This might help.
