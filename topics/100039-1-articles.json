It is exceptionally interesting for anyone with an interest in chemistry, engineering, or physics. Anyway, the logistics of fuel and oxidizer as presented in KSP doesn\u0027t really match up with the properties of any real chemicals. KSP fuel is apparently instantly hypergolic with oxidizer yet stable enough to function in every kind of rocket motor as well as being air-burnable. At any given temperature range it neither degrades nor freezes even over decades of storage, and always maintains extremely low viscosity, but without \u0022sloshing\u0022 or vaporizing in a partially empty tank (although this could be an argument for magic insulation, not magic fuel). At the same time, it\u0027s available and economical enough that effectively unlimited amounts are available for bulk launches.
