The Intrepid Mission will land 4 kerbals on Duna by day 500, and include 16 kerbals by the end of day 1000. After this time, continuing Intrepid missions will function at a much reduced cost, or allow expansion of Intrepid Base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe location of Intrepid Base has been predetermined, based on the ease of landing at said site. It is near the equator, and is in a large and deep valley. All resources will be landed near this site, and the base modules are planned to be within 1km of everything, depending on the accuracy of our landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch vehicle, Explorer, is rated at 30-tons to orbit, and has a turnaround time of 45 days thanks to its reusable boosters. This gives us an even 5 launches per full window in the 1000-day plan, with a total of 150 tons-to-orbit each window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from our launch vehicle, Intrepid will use nine pieces of hardware, all of which will be made for multiple launches to increase efficiency and reduce cost. This mission will have a high degree of redundancy and safety. All modules will have a backup or a contingency plan in case of failure or destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach 4-kerbal crew will spend about 376 days on the surface of Duna. Each crew will have a second crew on site during their stay, with an 80 day changeover when only one crew will be on-planet. All crews will have access to rovers in the mission plan, giving the crew good mobility. These rovers are short-term vehicles, as long-term rovers can be lifted as the mission progresses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, this mission will become self sufficient by the end of this 1000-day plan. The presence of kethane in-system will allow our vehicles to refuel on-site. This allows a wide range of options unavailable if only Kerbin-launched fuel and resources. Oxium and other supplies will still require launch from Kerbin, but these are much cheaper to launch than fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EEquipment\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/BsfmE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Given the planetary cycles, that gives 5 launches per window in the initial period. Each window has at least one launch that can be scrubbed to ensure than any lost primary payload can be replaced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring Phase 5, a maximum of 2 launches are required to continue operations, leaving 8 launches for scientific operations or additional infrastructure. Intrepid Base can be expanded at a rate of 1 Eden SHM per window, given that supplies can be sent to cover all kerbals currently on-planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any point during the mission, an emergency launch can be readied to retrieve stranded kerbals. A Janus vehicle with its ITS can make a one way, high delta-V, off-window burn if necessary to cut down on the interval time. In case of a single SHM failure, any other single SHM can be used to house all 8 kerbals on-planet until either a new SHM arrives or extraction can take place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe IHMs will remain on station for the duration of each mission, providing emergency egress if needed. This vehicle can make slightly off-window burns without refueling, but after kethane assets arrive, the vehicle can make emergency transfers off-window if needed. This redundancy keeps the mission on track even if any one vessel is lost at any point, either during launch, transfer, landing, or on-planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly in the mission, the schedule will be tight as we build up the resources and modules needed in-system for Duna. After the initial build up, more secondary launches open up, making emergency launches more available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EDetailed Mission Schedule:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://f.cl.ly/items/2D0T013t1W0c2W261u3B/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-14%20at%2012.36.40%20PM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen%20Shot%202013-08-14%20at%2012.36.40%20PM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EType column -\u0026gt; colors designate which Phase each launch/transfer is a part of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHardware column -\u0026gt; green designates transfer out, red designates an arrival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EScores\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven a fully completed mission with no emergencies, scoring should be as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrimary Scores:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly Mission Value: 612\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly Mission NIMLKO: 11 launches, 330 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly Mission Efficiency: 1.85\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESustained Mission Value: 3796\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESustained Mission NIMLKO: 22 launches, 660 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESustained Mission Efficiency: 5.75\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAchievement Scores:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Execution - 0 (will fly missions in the future)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew Mobility - 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBase Mobility - 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew Safety - 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Robustness - 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETOTAL: 5 (hopefully 8 with full Execution score later!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods used: MechJeb, KW Rocketry, NovaPunch, AEIS, B9 Aerospace, KSPX, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Crew Manifest, TAC Fuel Balancer, Kethane, Procedural Fairings, Editor Extensions, Fusty\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Station Parts, Kerbal Attachment System, Chatterer (doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t affect craft performance), Subassembly Manager (doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t affect craft performance), HyperEdit (testing in \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csimulator\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 only)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods installed, but not knowingly used: Fusty Station Expansion, MapSat, pWings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther notes:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could have maxed out my score a bit by not worrying about kethane on Duna and not worrying about my Robustness and Safety scores.

The autopilot took care of the vessel and no manual input was needed, much to Jeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s disapproval. Eh, autopilot lets us take pretty pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoosters separated at around 12km and splashed down near the KSC to be reused for a later mission. The core stages will either burn up on reentry or splashdown too hard to be reused (or salvaged, for that matter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond stage was a little unstable, but nothing out of safety limit. As this was an unkerballed mission, if the vehicle did spontaneously disassemble, no lives were at stake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third stage performed well, and pushed the Janus/ITSa up to orbital velocities. The whole lifter could have used a bit more fuel, as this was a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Clighter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 load than many of our payloads, and a few will need help circularizing from transfer stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this mission doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t require any docking, since the ITS was launched pre-attached, the Janus craft will sit in a parking orbit awaiting the appropriate transfer window to open. According to our notes, that should begin around day 55, which is also the next launch of our schedule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EDSM Launch\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay 55\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the second launch of the Intrepid mission, and the first DSM launch. The DSM will supply the kerbals on-planet for the duration of their mission. It is also the least-used module, and it is the most tight on delta-V. This makes the launch a very important one. If we lose this module, the whole program will be pushed back by at least one launch, if not more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch went well, and the vessel held together without issue. However, during the second stage, the autopilot was correcting the trajectory when the third stage kicked in. Because there was much less control authority on the third stage, the vehicle went towards the horizon at only 30km altitude. The issue was corrected, but we lost some precious delta-V for the craft. Nothing mission critical, but our margins are now lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe circularization burn was done by the transfer stage LV-N, outside the atmosphere per regulations. Once completed, the orbit settled at around 80km. Since the transfer window opens up today, the parking orbit didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t last too long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EPhase 1 Duna Transfer\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay 55\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the Janus (dubbed the Janus I, since there will be a few of them) and the DSM needed to do their transfer burns during this window. First to set up was the DSM. We set up a 1050 m/s burn that placed us inside Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s about as close as can be expected, and we can make fine adjustments during the mid-course correction burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Janus I did much the same, but an orbit behind. Unfortunately, the burn times are on the order of 8-9 minutes a piece, thanks to the efficient LV-Ns we are using for transfer engines. That also means that we can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t control two burns at once, so we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll need to space those out when needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDSM completed the transfer burn in 9 minutes. No issues or oddities, but due to the length we burned about 1170 m/s following the autopilot. It may be good to not rely on the autopilot for such long burns in the future. DSM had 440 m/s delta-V afterwards. This will force it to use aerocapture to stay in Duna orbit once it arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJanus I, again, did much the same. Burn was a bit shorter at 8 minutes, but used the same amount of delta-V. At the end of the burn, Janus I had 2270 m/s delta-V left in the transfer stage. This should be enough for capture and return. We may try an aerocapture for Janus I as well, just to conserve fuel for the return trip and/or refueling operations in LDO if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay 56\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the autopilot calculated our course outside of Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI, it plotted a 39.5 m/s course correction to aim for a 10km periapsis at Duna. Should leave about 400 m/s dV for maneuvers inside Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFloating out of Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI, it will be a long wait until the vessels arrive at Duna. Janus I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s mid-course correction was plotted at 43.1 m/s on day 60. This should put the Duna periapsis at around 12km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay 57\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMid-course correction for the DSM is completed. 403 m/s dV is left in the transfer stage. With the calculations updated post burn, it looks as if the encounter with Duna is dead on. Maybe even to close, as no periapsis is showing. Will need another correction burn inside Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI to get the periapsis at the correct altitude, and to make sure any encounter with Ike does not affect our capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay 60\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like travel times will be right on 60 days or so from transfer burn to capture. Right on schedule, per the calculations. After Janus I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s correction burn, we saw the same outcome as the DSM. Duna SOI corrections will still be needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin is but a glimmer now, and Duna is yet to be visible.

First up is the launch of the two ITSs needed to get the first two SHMs to Duna. The launch itself went well. Second stage of the Explorer LV is still wobbly, but a few extra struts seemed to help out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third stage brought us just under orbital velocity, so we needed a 50 m/s maneuver to circularize using the LV-N on the transfer stage.

Bit longer than the initial trip here, but still within our supply budget for the IHMs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe burn will take place in 37 days, so we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have a few things to do in the meantime. Like, doing all the transfer burns for Duna for Phase 2! And, finally Jeb, Bill, Bob, and Shelgel can hop in a shuttle and get started on their journey!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also picked the crews for our mission. There are 4 crews needed for the initial 1000-day plan. They will be as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew A: Jeb, Bill, Bob, Shelgel (Phase 2 crew)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew B: Geofwig, Geofdin, Seanbert, Halrey (Phase 3 crew)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew C: Billy-Bobburry, Samsey, Mac, Dudvey (Phase 4 crew)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew D: Dobart, Halrod, Derlock, Mergan (Phase 5 crew)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll probably rotate in new kerbonauts with the previous crews so that every crew has at least one Duna-experienced kerbonaut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ENotes:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly 3 unique launches left to go in the entire mission, and only 1 in the first 500 days. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve gotten through a quarter of the mission without much issue yet. Although, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve only had to land on Duna once, so we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll see how accurate I (well, MechJeb) can be in landing. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve gotten within a few hundred meters myself with MechJeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s landing aids (but no autopilot, as HyperEdit seems to mess with the maths involved).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest worry is the SHMs coming down, as they can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really be moved once they are down. None of my modules are mobile, but the Janus RAVs I can jump around with and the rovers, well, are rovers and can cover any distance they need to really. I tried to make a short hop when I landed on a hill in testing, and that ended in unplanned rapid disassembly (i.e. the pilot stinks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the SHMs come down in a wide pattern, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be nigh impossible to correct without much F5-ing, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to keep that to a minimum. They also don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t carry a lot of fuel (only about 750 m/s delta-V) and the TWR is doable on Duna. Here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s hoping I can pull that off!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
