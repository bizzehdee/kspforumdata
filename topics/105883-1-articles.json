My Nephew found this bug once again. He built a craft to simply see how fast he can get a rocket going before the heating destroys it. The MK1 command capsule, with the basic \u0022Aerodynamic Nosecone\u0022 on top lasts only 10 seconds before overheating destroys the command capsule. The command capsule has a heat rating of 2400C. The MK1 Lander Can, with the same nosecone on top, lasts until the engines explode from overheating and continues upwards into space, showing no signs of heating at all. It only has a heat rating of 2000C.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConfirmation is needed for this bug to prove it an actual bug with the part, and not just a problem with his instal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
