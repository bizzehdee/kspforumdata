It makes things a lot harder in many occasions when returning to Kerbin atmosphere. The radial parachutes seem to explode no matter what I do, unless I install a significantly bigger heatshield compared to other ship (for example 1.25 meter ship with 2.5 meter heatshield). This of course causes the aerodynamic features of the ship to be less than optimal when flying upwards, because of FAR. Do you, who have more experience with DRE, have any good tips or examples on how to protect those radial parachutes from overheating during descent?
