The theoretical side of the project was easier for me than the coding. I studied Aerospace Engineering as an undergrad and graduate student, so the orbital Mechanics review was a wonderful trip down memory lane. The programming side, however, was more tricky; I had to learn Java from scratch in order to develop the calculator. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoding began about a month ago, and I\\\u0027ve worked diligently to complete each section in a timely fashion. The inclined orbit transfers section was definitely the most challenging, as the number of logical statements/tests (e.g. if/then checks) required to account for every possible user input was significant. I also enjoyed producing the reference graphics and the raw data/graphs in Excel. Some of those graphs are just beautiful for the elegant mathematics they bring to life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe signature graphic was an attempt to responsibly advertise the calculator and provide a convenient download link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for the feedback.

If you like optimal transfer orbit analysis, which is really what the calculator is all about, then give the three-impulse bi-elliptic orbit inclinations a try. Coplanar bi-elliptic transfers are fine, and can save you fuel in the right circumstances, but the bi-elliptic maneuver really shines when performing inclined transfers. My friend (and chief beta tester) just successfully executed a 45 deg plane change maneuver around the Mun using \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Orbit Mechanic\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and it worked like a charm. For plane changes between 50 and 60 deg, the bi-elliptic inclined orbit transfer can really save you a significant amount of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/49Aff.png\u0022 alt=\u002249Aff.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll have to do some research into your suggestion.

I picked up a great text on holiday break that gave me some interesting ideas for new features in the calculator. A quick summary of planned changes thus far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- YouTube how-to videos demonstrating how KSP Orbit Mechanic can help you execute Hohmann, bi-elliptic, and inclined orbit transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A modification to the intercept condition sections in the Hohmann and bi-elliptic forms; specifically, the syzygy reference times will be changed so that the user will need to supply the time of the last opposition or conjunction so that the game time of the next intercept opportunity can be determined. In v1.1, the time between syzygies is provided (which is not as useful).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EOrbit phasing\u003C/span\u003E: if your spacecraft is leading or lagging a target in an identical circular orbit (e.g. trying to intercept the Mun, but not within its SOI), an orbit phasing transfer can be conducted to place your spacecraft on a trajectory designed to intercept the target on the original circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPatched conic analysis\u003C/span\u003E: basic interplanetary mission design with the ability to select the aiming radius and/or the peripase fly-by altitude for hyperbolic orbits. In theory, this would allow the user to select the desired fly-by altitude of the target object (e.g. depart a 200km parking orbit around Kerbin to intercept a Venus-equivalent planet with a periapse fly-by altitude of 500km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Incorporate mean orbital motion into elliptic orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Transfers utilizing only one tangential burn (i.e. not Hohmann) between two coplanar orbits. This should be used when the user desires orbit transfers that will optimize time (vice fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Miscellaneous UI tweaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will also attempt to incorporate a user-requested feature that displays apoapse and periapse data for a supplied orbital period. The math is simple, but I have to find a clean way to design the UI and present the data in a meaningful way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope to have the next version out in early January but, as with any software revision, I can\\\u0027t make any promises.

I\\\u0027ll drop an ETA as soon as I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I\\\u0027ll look into ways of streamlining the data. I can appreciate the desire to make the most important information easily accessible. As for the user-customized data, that may be more difficult to code than it would seem (at least with my Java programming skills). I\\\u0027ll play around with some design tweaks and see what I can come up with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I think I know what you\\\u0027re getting at here, but I\\\u0027m not sure how to implement this in a meaningful way. If I understand correctly, you would like to know how small perturbations in the intercept angle or impulse will affect your proximity to the edge of the sphere of influence? Perhaps a context would help me understand how you would like to use the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I\\\u0027m already working on an improved intercept algorithm that provides the user with more meaningful information. Specifically, you will be able to enter the game time of the last sysygy (i.e. opposition, conjunction, inferior conjunction, or superior conjunction) and the game will use the synodic period and the transfer geometry to compute the game time of the next intercept opportunity (i.e. the time the user should initiate the transfer, or burn). I\\\u0027ve done some simple tests with this method and IMO it\\\u0027s far superior to methods that require the user to estimate the relative angular separation. If this doesn\\\u0027t seem helpful, please feel free to give me additional feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m also hoping that the YouTube how-to videos will help to demonstrate how many of these features work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for the feedback!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CardBoardBoxProcessor","CreatedById":10179,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-03T02:21:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou should see if harvester coudl make it so it out puts the ships data and ythen you could ake your calculator pick it up again and make aniamtiosna nd junk \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
