I understand that you select a target and it time accelerates to put you in relatively close orbit to the target (in this case a space station). In all the vids I have seen, this \u0022relatively close\u0022 distance is about four kilometers, but I have done over a dozen launches using this and the closest I can ever get is 100 kilometers. Am I doing something wrong?
