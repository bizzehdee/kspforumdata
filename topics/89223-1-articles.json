Once you\u0027re at that regime, you should be able to cover huge distances on tiny amounts of fuel. To get there, you\u0027re going to want to climb at the fastest rate you can manage to 18-20 km, at which point you should mostly level off and start accelerating horizontally. Be sure to have enough intakes (I think maximum efficiency in stock is 1 ramjet intake per ~2 tons of plane, though that is aesthetically ridiculous), and if you\u0027re still running short of intake air, you can dip down a bit to speed up and get to denser air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERight now, my big, fat plane has trouble breaking 10 km altitude and 200 m/s forward speed (largely due to its payload).

Double your speed, you need twice as much fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy climbing, you reduce drag, exponentially with altitude. You can halve the drag by climbing a bit less than 3500m.

There\u0027s basically three ways to do that: lifting surfaces, thrust, and orbiting. (Actually, four ways: but balloons aren\u0027t in the stock game) Lifting surfaces are great but they lose effectiveness just as fast with altitude as drag falls. Thrust means that slower-is-better no longer applies: now, slower means less drag but more gravity, so there\u0027s a tradeoff (which I\u0027m not going to carefully calculate for you, because it\u0027s hard).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbiting is the most fun one: the higher the orbit, the less speed you need to maintain to stay in orbit, *and* the less air there is, so that\u0027s a double-whammy in terms of reducing fuel consumption. You can spin around the whole world on just fumes. Even better, burn a little more, and you can pop out of the atmosphere for a bit and avoid all that nasty drag stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big problem is getting back down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
