When Science Alert alerts about EVA for a common terrain (grasslands, water, shores), EVA out, right click on the Kerbal, \u0022EVA Report\u0022, then return to the craft. Begin warp. As its in orbit, eventually the craft will leave that biome .. and since its common, eventually it will re-enter it. Re-entering the biome triggers the \u0022EVA Report\u0022 Science Alert again, even though the report for that biome is already onboard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I EVA, right click, \u0022EVA Report\u0022, and return to the craft, I am told that the craft can\u0027t store the experiment data and I\u0027ll have to dump it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a tough case, because a.) I want it to Alert when I get to a biome that is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E on the craft, as I can collect multiple EVA Reports, and b.) its really annoying when its the \u0022Shores\u0022 biome, as it jumps you out of warp about 16 times per equitorial orbit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * * * \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep up the great work!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ManaaniWanderer","CreatedById":28850,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T18:10:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, Thank you, Thank you!
