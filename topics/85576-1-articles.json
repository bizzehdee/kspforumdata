I found them all in the configuration files but one I could not find is the research collected when ships return from orbit. Is there a place in configurations that I can set this to 1 maximum also? or any way I can tweak this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother question is in configuration there is settings for research and research cap. Im assuming the research is for a report and the cap is for the maximum amount of data you can return for all reports?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
