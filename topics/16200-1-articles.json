The planet is the most likely candidate for intelligent life beyond Earth. While much smaller than Earth, the planet has similar gases and gravity and more amazingly of all, abnormal radio band transmissions for a planetary object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis paper however finds interest in the moons of Kerbin. The closest object to the planet is \u0027Mun\u0027. This object is suspected to be similar to Earth\u0027s moon. More bizarrely is the highest orbiting moon, Minmus, a celestial body similar to that of Europa in orbit around Jupiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus itself seems to be an anomaly and it is the aim of this paper to discuss the theories to the formation on Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPlanetary Collision\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar to the formation of Earth\u0027s Moon and Mun, this theory suggests that a planetary collision between Kerbin and another object formed both moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin however, due to the smaller gravity of the planet, caused a wide spread debris field which coalesced into two moons. The denser materials, such as silicates \u0026amp; metalic oxides, formed Mun in lower orbit and the lighter materials such as water \u0026amp; methane formed Minmus in a higher orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EComet capture\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis theory suggests that Minmus was once a comet from the dwarf planet cloud of Kerbol\u0027s outer system. The comet was then captured from its irregular solar orbit by Kerbin. Protected in Kerbins magnetic field, Minmus lost its tail as it was protected from Kerbol\u0027s radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus shows signs of glaciation which suggests the moon was once warm enough for the ice to form water and liquid methane in order for it freeze as a smooth surface. This could because Minmus was previously much closer to Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPlanetary capture\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis theory suggests Minmus formed as a planet on its own close to Kerbin\u0027s orbit however as Kerbin grew, the heavier materials were more attracted to the larger planet. The gravity of Kerbin could have also ripped Minmus apart several times over, leading to Minmus\u0027s distorted shape and eventually incorporating the failed planet into the Kerbin system as a moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbit of Minmus being not along the orbital plane with the planet suggests it is highly likely the moon was captured and not formed in the Kerbin system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThe Geography of Minmas\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe major difference with Europa is while the ice moon in our system is close to Jupiter. The gravitational tides of which cause the moon to have a molten core, which could very well warm an ocean of water under the ice, which very well may support life. Minmus is too far from Kerbin and too small to have an active core and appears inert. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ice Oceans however could be subject to tidal friction, either from the gravity of Kerbin or solar radiation during the day cycles. The expanding and contracting ice against the shore rock causes weathering and gives the ice oceans their distinct canyons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinding evidence to support the theories will provide difficult at this distance. Maybe the Kerbins have discovered the answer and will one day share their secrets...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img407.imageshack.us/img407/8039/minmuseuropa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022minmuseuropa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
