I use MJ for pretty much everything except rendezvous and docking, which it\u0027s terrible at, and Stock Bug Fixes makes rover wheel brakes non-useless.* \n\nA bunch of engineers drinking coffee in the R\u0026D building trying to think of a use for the Mark I air-portable rover they had designed and recently tested, came up with the brilliant idea of sending one on a circumnavigation of the Mun. In addition to testing the rover, they supposed, the mission would collect samples and data from various regions of the Munar surface as well as searching for ore deposits for possible future exploitation. \n\n So they came up with an extremely complicated and expensive plan involving a modified Mark I rover deployed by a dedicated dropship, and brought it to the director of operations, who told them the plan was much too expensive and would never fit in the budget. Disappointed, they went back to their coffee. \n\nThen, one of them had an idea. \u0022Why,\u0022 said he, \u0022does the rover have to go in the *middle* of the dropship?\u0022\n\n\u0022So as not to upset the center-of-gravity when it\u0027s deployed,\u0022 said another. \u0022Don\u0027t you know *anything*?\u0022\n\n\u0022But why,\u0022 said the first, \u0022does that matter in space?\u0022\n\nHe was right, of course. Excited, the engineers sat down again, poured new cups of coffee, and designed a new mission. This is what they came up with:\n\n![J10n5qI.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/J10n5qI.jpg?1)\n\nThe redesigned rover would be launched in a fairing by a standard reusable booster and be carried to the Mun by a standard Aqualung unmanned tanker, where it would be deployed on a suborbital trajectory and land under its own power, then drive around the Mun. Since several boosters were already in stock, and several Aqualungs were already in orbit, the whole mission would cost less than a quarter of the engineers\u0027 original plan. Much to the delight of the engineers, the director of operations approved the new plan and the Mark II rover was ordered for production. \n\nA few weeks later, it\u0027s ready for launch. \n\n![FBkdQrx.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/FBkdQrx.jpg?1)\n\nLiftoff. The engineers had worried that the large fairing would upset the rocket\u0027s stability, but with added tail fins and a slightly slower-than-normal ascent, it makes orbit with no trouble. \n\n![3R8UKSH.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/3R8UKSH.jpg?1)\n\nFairing jettison. *This is why I use Procedural Fairings, not stock fairings. Note the lack of confetti.* \n\n![x5pZztq.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/x5pZztq.jpg?1)\n\nBooster recovery.\n\n![vUgRRi9.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/vUgRRi9.jpg?1)\n\nSpace!\n\n![mgpnRXB.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/mgpnRXB.jpg?1)\n\nRendezvous with Kilgore Station in low Kerbin orbit. \n\n![O9GcGwn.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/O9GcGwn.jpg?1)\n\nEngineer Shannon Kerman, who will drive the rover, transfers to it by EVA. An engineer is necessary, of course, in order to repair potential wheel damage, and Shannon is the most experienced one available. \n\nUnfortunately the docking with the Aqualung happened at night, so no pictures of that. \n\n![jDOKvfM.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/jDOKvfM.jpg?1)\n\nTo the Mun!\n\n![fT0zOlS.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/fT0zOlS.jpg?1)\n\nBurning into Munar orbit.\n\n![dgQoUKP.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/dgQoUKP.jpg?1)\n\nSeparation. The Aqualung burns back into orbit to rendezvous with Barbicane Station; Shannon and the rover descend to the surface. \n\n![5Uqq4Rg.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/5Uqq4Rg.jpg?1)\n\nPowered descent. \n\n![HaxMDWG.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/HaxMDWG.jpg?1)\n\nTouchdown. \n\n![PagRCMP.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/PagRCMP.jpg?1)\n\nShannon establishes the origin base for the circumnavigation.\n\n*I don\u0027t expect most updates to be quite so pic-heavy as this one, most will probably just have a couple pics of the rover and maybe a progress shot of the map.
