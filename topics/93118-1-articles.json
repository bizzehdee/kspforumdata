If you\u0027ve done these rescue missions before with patched conics and manouvre nodes you can do a decent job of it without them. If you can guess your way to being some 25-50km away, get out of map mode and double click the kerbal in the distance. From there it\u0027s just as difficult as it always is. When I accepted the mission without thinking too much about it I was also afraid that I wouldn\u0027t be able to complete it but it was surprisingly doable.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T21:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few ideas for anyone trying to do a rescue without upgrades:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Wait. Yup, wait. Put the rescue lander on the pad and wait until ImLost Kermin is directly overhead. The idea is you want to pull into an orbit a little lower than them right behind them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Before you launch, Mouse over their Apo and Perios and find out what height you need to aim for. When you get to 60-65k (best Isp), throttle back up and push your Apo to the Perio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Circularize as normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you haven\u0027t caught up to your target beforehand, try to line up your Per and Apo to their Per and Apo. You want to only be 1k off their orbit, slightly behind, slightly lower. Adjust this if you\u0027re way off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Eventually you\u0027ll get in range.
