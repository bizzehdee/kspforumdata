I was also the alone-type that you\u0027re sure to find in any area if you look around enough, and the Boy Scouts program in my area had a larger focus on social interaction, so that was another nail in the coffin. I still know some of the knots stuff and it comes in handy sometimes, but if I need to know anything else I still have my book.
