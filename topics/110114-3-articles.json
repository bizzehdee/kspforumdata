Or did you go right into Boy Scouts?\n\nI started as a Cub Scout. I don\u0027t remember exactly which year it was, but I do remember that the Tiger Cub program started about the same year I started Wolf. If I remember correctly, at the time Webelos and Arrow of Light were also done in the same year. I think it was split into a two year program the year after I had moved to Boy Scouts.\n\nA lot of changes have happened since then. :~)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wesreidau","CreatedById":75430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T19:17:25Z","Content":"Eagle, Gold Palms, OA.\n\n*The first rule of OA is we don\u0027t talk about OA.*"},{"CreatedByName":"temporalExile","CreatedById":127675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T20:18:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E E\n\u003E *The first rule of OA is we don\u0027t talk about OA.*\n\nNo, thats the first rule of Mao.\n\nAnyways, I recently hit star, and I\u0027m aiming for eagle.

It was something different than school for me in Cub Scouts but then it started to get to be like school, and I wanted to get away from it. It\u0027s a lot like how a guy that\u0027s an accountant might wanna get in a rowboat and go out fishing on the lake on the weekend; I wanted to get away from school but then Boy Scouts was just like school. I was also the alone-type that you\u0027re sure to find in any area if you look around enough, and the Boy Scouts program in my area had a larger focus on social interaction, so that was another nail in the coffin. I still know some of the knots stuff and it comes in handy sometimes, but if I need to know anything else I still have my book. I don\u0027t regret my decision to leave, I got what I wanted out of it and the politics surrounding the BSA would\u0027ve conflicted with my political opinions anyways, so it was inevitable that I would leave."},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T15:49:21Z","Content":"Nice thread.
