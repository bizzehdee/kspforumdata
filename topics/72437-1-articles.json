So before you do it, be sure to F5. Then give it a try and if you don\u0027t like the results, F9, tweak the Pe up or down as needed, and try it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, aerocapture Pe altitude depends on 3 things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EVelocity at Pe, as Streetwind said\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhether or not you have FAR\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhether or not you have Deadly Reentry\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real goal here is to at least capture into a closed orbit without having to burn any fuel, even if that orbit is a huge ellipse that takes you out nearly to the edge of the SOI. Once captured, you can just make multiple passes, tweaking your Pe up or down as desired, until you finally get an Ap about where you want, then circularize there. The number of passes you can do is limited only by the time you want to spend doing it and any life support or electrical constraints you might have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAssuming you don\u0027t have the above mods installed\u003C/span\u003E, at Kerbin I\u0027d be FAIRLY aggressive when coming in at what is essentially interplanetary speed with an asteroid. 35-38km is what I\u0027d start with. Again, this is trial and error so if that doesn\u0027t do what you want, reload and try something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Duna, usually somewhere between 11-13km works just fine. The main variables there are the speed on arrival and whether the ship is going to orbit Duna or go out to Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Eve, it also depends on whether you\u0027re staying there or going to Gilly. But I find somewhere between 65-70km usually does the trick.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jananton","CreatedById":83920,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T15:09:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAm I the only one who thinks you\u0027re bound to expose your kerbonauts to intolerable G forces when one reduces speed like this? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreets,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T15:19:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jananton\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jananton\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAm I the only one who thinks you\u0027re bound to expose your kerbonauts to intolerable G forces when one reduces speed like this? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreets,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJan\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou won\u0027t.
