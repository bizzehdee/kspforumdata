I can play for quiet a while as the 1.0 memory handling is very different than in previous versions. I am able to move from scene to scene and watch the games memory move up and down. But truth be told as this games vanilla size continues to scale up the need for a functioning 64x version becomes all the more important with respect to players who wish to play heavily modded versions. The other option at present is to run a separate Linux partition, something I am leaning toward as I love a rich and heavy modded experience \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T18:46:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zlsa\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zlsa\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have the same issue; what graphics card do you have?
