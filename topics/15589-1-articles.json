(see below)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe:\u0027It has come to my attention (quite late) that my friend, Caesar15, was banned for a post that included an image from the series \u0027My Little Pony\u00271 on the offtopic \\\u0027games games games!!\\\u0027 subsection in his game thread, \\\u0027Control-v game\\\u0027. It is in my opinion unjust for the moderator (whose name I won\\\u0027t say except to other moderators) to ban him for such a post, especially permanently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven more stupid is that it was on his birthday...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 No comment.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkunky: \u0027He was banned for repeated rules infractions.

He immediately locked the thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not believe you fulfill your moderator/community manager role by locking threads as such without giving a response. I do not think it would take more than 1 minute to tell me what rules he didn\\\u0027t respect. I have all the respect for Skunky but this isn\\\u0027t how I believe a community manager should act.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Skunky answered that they do not discuss details about user bans. I consider this abominable. If I believe a ban is unfair let me know why it was fair (if it was). Simply stating you do not discuss this is stupid and shouldn\\\u0027t be a rule. It should be the complete opposite of the rule. If someone has an objection let him object until we find out why someone was banned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Imandreas","CreatedById":18071,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-29T18:18:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait, your debating a ban?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*Imandreas hops into his bunker*\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StelarCF","CreatedById":13985,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-29T18:20:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Imandreas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Imandreas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, your debating a ban?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*Imandreas hops into his bunker*\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, is this the Leninist or Stalinist Communism happening around here?
