below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDemographics\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, I\u0027m not at all surprised that they chose Chinese to localize, because, first, the Chinese market is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehuge\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and, second, a large percentage of Chinese people don\u0027t speak English at all and can\u0027t/won\u0027t buy the game if it\u0027s only in English.\u00A0 So localizing to Chinese\u00A0 unlocks a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egiant\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E source of potential new revenue \u003Cem\u003Ethat they wouldn\u0027t otherwise have access to\u003C/em\u003E, making it well worth the effort of doing the localization job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompare that, on the other hand, to German.\u00A0 I can\u0027t speak to the size of the German market, since I don\u0027t have access to Squad\u0027s marketing and sales numbers, but I\u0027d guess that it\u0027s considerably smaller than China, probably by at least an order of magnitude.\u00A0 Also, my experience has been that a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elarge percentage of Germans can speak English\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 I\u0027m sure they would \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elike\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the game better if it were available in German... but they \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecan\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E play it in English.\u00A0 It\u0027s not obvious to me that lack-of-German-KSP is stopping large numbers of Germans from buying the game.\u00A0 If they localized it to German, I\u0027m sure they \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewould\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E pick up a few new sales... but \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehow many\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E?\u00A0 Would it be enough to justify the cost of localizing to German?\u00A0 And would it be enough to justify spending the money and time there, instead of spending it to develop new features?\u00A0 I assume the answer is \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eno, it\u0027s not worth it (yet)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E... because if it were, they would have done it already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to put too fine a point on it:\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou, yourself, speak English.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 You\u0027re posting here in the forums, in English.\u00A0 I\u0027m guessing you\u0027ve already bought KSP.\u00A0 So from Squad\u0027s perspective, if they get zero additional dollars from you if they localize into German, then you\u0027re giving them zero additional incentive to localize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a lot fewer Germans than Chinese, and the proportion of English-fluent Germans is a lot higher than the proportion of English-fluent Chinese, which is a double whammy.\u00A0 Therefore, it\u0027s not surprising to me that they would prioritize Chinese over German, from a business perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMarket scale\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome products have giant markets that sell to hundreds of millions or even \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebillions\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of people.\u00A0 Other products have much smaller target audiences, and may have sales measured in thousands rather than millions.\u00A0 This is really, really important from a business perspective, because \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethe \u003Cstrong\u003Ecost\u003C/strong\u003E of localizing is the same regardless of market size, but the \u003Cstrong\u003Eprofit\u003C/strong\u003E from it varies directly with market size\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 This means that the more widely a product sells, the better the economics look for localizing.\u00A0 Tiny products with small markets have a lot less incentive to localize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt one end of the scale, consider Microsoft Windows.\u00A0 The \u003Ca href=\u0022https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14236/language-packs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWindows language packs

style=\u0022background-color:#ffff00;\u0022\u003E (!!!)\u003C/span\u003E different languages, if I\u0027ve counted them correctly.\u00A0 That includes a fair number of languages that most people probably haven\u0027t even \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eheard\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of.\u00A0 Why is that?\u00A0 It\u0027s because \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethe market for Windows is gargantuan\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 It makes sense for them to localize it into virtually every language on the planet with more than a million speakers, because Windows is ubiquitous.\u00A0 It sells so many copies everywhere that it\u0027s worth their spending the money to localize into Obscure Language X if it will sell another million copies of Windows.\u00A0 From Microsoft\u0027s perspective, the cost of dedicating a few translators to spend the time to localize is just a drop in the bucket, compared to the additional profits they can make from doing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the opposite end of the scale, consider KSP.\u00A0\u00A0 Compared with Windows, KSP is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Evanishingly tiny\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Squad doesn\u0027t release sales numbers, so this is guesswork, but I\u0027d guess that the total number of copies of KSP ever sold is probably a lot closer to 1 million than it is to 10 million.\u00A0 So, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eany\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E feature implementation (localization, or anything else) is going to be a lot more constrained by market forces:\u00A0 the development cost is going to loom a lot larger, relative to potential profits, so they\u0027re going to have to be a lot more ruthless about whom they choose to cater to.\u00A0 It\u0027s not personal, it\u0027s just the numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMicrosoft can localize into Wolof and Maori and Quechua and such, because even in those (relatively speaking) \u0022obscure\u0022 languages, they can anticipate sales figures with a lot of zeroes after them, so it\u0027s worth their while to spend a few hundred thousand dollars or more to localize into them.\u00A0 Whereas I\u0027m not expecting to see KSP localized \u003Cem\u003Eby Squad\u003C/em\u003E into Wolof or Maori or Quechua in my lifetime, because I seriously doubt they\u0027d pick up enough sales in those languages to justify the expense of doing it.\u00A0 Heck, until KSP 1.3, they didn\u0027t have \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eany\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E language other than English!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s how to look at it, from a business perspective.\u00A0 Say you\u0027re a software company (such as Squad) and you\u0027re considering which languages, if any, to localize into.\u00A0 Essentially your decision matrix is going to look like this:\u00A0 Make a list of all the languages in the world.\u00A0 Sort them in descending order of \u0022effective market size\u0022.\u00A0 (I\u0027m defining that as \u0022how many people speak that language, who \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewill\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E buy the product if it\u0027s available in their language, and who \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewon\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E buy it if it isn\u0027t.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nEnglish will likely be solidly at the top of that list.\u00A0 My guess would be that Mandarin would come second.\u00A0 And then there will be other languages going on down the list, with a long tail of \u0022small\u0022 languages like Wolof and Maori and Quechua.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe list has \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eprofit numbers\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Next to each one of those languages is a dollar amount.\u00A0 \u0022How much extra profit will we make if we localize into this language?\u0022\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNow, you have a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecost\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E number.\u00A0 This consists of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eimplementation\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E cost (\u0022how many dollars does it

developing some other feature instead\u0022).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSo.\u00A0 Start at the top of the list, and keep going down it until you get to a language whose profit number is lower than your cost number.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDraw a big red line above that language.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENothing below that line is going to get localized.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bigger the target market of a product, the farther down that list the line will be.\u00A0 Microsoft Windows is huge,
