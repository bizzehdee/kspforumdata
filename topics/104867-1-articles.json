Fortunately, my next attempt was indeed my first successful attempt at Mun landing which happened around the same night. Anyone else got screenshots from older versions?\n\nP.S.: This of course has the long dead original Command Pod. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T21:01:17Z","Content":"My first \u0022landing\u0022.\n\n![Oeis3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Oeis3.jpg)\n\nRemember when construction looked like this?\n\n![UqWGl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UqWGl.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T21:03:56Z","Content":"The very first \u0022eclipse\u0022 system in KSP generated shadows that looked like this:\n\n![screenshot0.png](http://www.skyrender.net/screenshot0.png)\n\nHopefully we won\u0027t see a return to that."},{"CreatedByName":"Bandock","CreatedById":28934,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T21:08:29Z","Content":"Very nice screenshots.

Yes, that\u0027s my second landing. My first looked quite a lot like yours, Bandock and Dizzle. Quite the emotional roller coaster, to finally touch Mun, knowing there \u0022should\u0022 be enough fuel to get them home, everything worked, and.... no.\n\nHere\u0027s the contraption that got us there:\n\n![Stock_Munship%20mk%201.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78157466/Stock_Munship%20mk%201.jpg)\n\nPretty sure it needs more boosters!\n\nThose are both dated Feb 14, 2012. So, version 13.2, I think. To me, the most important thing about these shots are all three crew are in their traditional places. If you look closely at the loading screen 2001 easter egg, you\u0027ll notice they are arranged this way."},{"CreatedByName":"SpenSpaceCorp","CreatedById":98977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T02:04:46Z","Content":"That launch tower...
