Sure, it would realistic to have to bring along a hundred tons of food and water, but not very fun. On the other hand, some kind of life support would be nice to have, so we need a compromise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say that, for simplicity\u0027s sake, there\u0027s only one life-support resource, let\u0027s call them snacks. Each kerbalnaut would use some amount of snacks per minute, and each command pod would come stocked with a reasonably large amount (a few days\u0027 worth, say). Once they run out, the kerbalnauts\u0027 \u0022snack meters\u0022 would start to drop (from 100%), and they would reach zero after an hour or so. The kerbals wouldn\u0027t die, they would just be in hibernation. Once another source of snacks was obtained, their meters would start to rise until they hit 100% again. The kerbals couldn\u0027t do anything unless their snack meter was at 100, so no EVA, no flying from the command pod, nothing. I think that the resource itself should be massless, just to simplify things (you don\u0027t want to have to account for consumables loss when planning maneuvers far in advance), but the tanks should be decently heavy. We can just say that the Kerbalnauts hate littering in space, so they store all of their trash in the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s say you had an interplanetary mission to Duna. You would launch normally, then once your craft was on course, you could cut off the snack supply like any other resource, and the brave kerbalnauts would go to sleep. You would need a probe onboard to stay in control, so you can wake them up for their exploration time. Either that, or you could have all but one of the crew asleep in the hitchhiker pods, and that one lonely pilot in the command pod would eat snacks the whole way there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"notfruit","CreatedById":68730,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T16:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut what would the snacks be?

And, for that matter, generation wouldn\u0027t be too hard to do, just have a hydroponics part (maybe ~hitchhiker size to feed one kerbalnaut). All it would need would be electricity (and a lot of it), but it could keep your watchful pilot happy and fed for journey, or sustain a base or station or something.
