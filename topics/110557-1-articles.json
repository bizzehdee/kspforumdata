There are no clipped parts.\n\n**How to recreate:** Put together a basic launcher and probe. Place it into LKO and activate SAS- Do not engage anything other than the setting that maintains stability. The vessel should start to slowly roll, and the rotation will accelerate. Note that the input indicators in the lower left corner of the screen do not show any input being applied along any axis. \n\n**Impact:** It becomes harder to change headings in order to execute orbital maneuvers and docking.\n\n**Output Log:**\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/h0cimaebgnlib3v/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h0cimaebgnlib3v/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\nAny help or thoughts are much appreciated! \n\nThank you all in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T07:34:57Z","Content":"Your link is broken Fizwalker, you will need to re-upload the log.\n\nThis kind of issue is usually caused by inadvertently setting the trim by pressing Alt with any movement key, or by a controller with too small a deadzone."},{"CreatedByName":"Fizwalker","CreatedById":78337,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T12:34:46Z","Content":"Thank you for the reply, and help! I\u0027ve been using a 360 controller to fly aircraft, so that could be the issue. I think I saw in another thread that Ctrl\u002BX clears trim settings. Is that correct?\n\nAgain, thank you for the help!\n\nEdit: I\u0027ll have to fix the link when I get off work"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T12:37:12Z","Content":"Alt\u002BX will reset any trim on Windows, control is bound to the throttle.\n\nHope this helps ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
