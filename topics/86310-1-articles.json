DR (and a better aero) also benefit from service modules and telescopic legs. Then there is the issue of whether use heat shield parts or use tweakables to place heat shielding on a side (or the entire) ship, at a weight and funds cost. Other parts could also be added, like radially mounted inflatable heat shields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there is the issue of funds balance: a proper DR may not be keen on returning empty fuel tanks to the KSC from orbit (or, at least, without a heavy penalty on weight) for recovery, so funds might need to be balanced accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T00:25:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven that even on \u0022Hard\u0022 running out of money is pretty difficult (the only reason I didn\u0027t ay \u0022impossible\u0022 is because I guess it is theoretically possible), I doubt there needs to be much work on money balance.

Please keep in mind what dre means for spaceplanes and shuttles. If you have any form realistic aerodynamic system like we most likely will get sooner or later you need airbreaks for those to slow you down. Sure, you can do it without them but that makes reentry time consuming as hell because there isn\u0027t that much drag on a winged vessel to slow you down and if you reenter too steep your wings burn up. Either they add airbreaks or wings get a MUCH higher heat resistance than they currently have with dre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother point to keep in mind is that some parts (pods, maybe some SP parts) might need an offcentered COM to keep them stable on reentry. That might screw up some of the current designs even if you disable the DRE function on easy and normal difficulty settings. That could upset people. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do love dre though and would like to see it implemented in some form \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E it makes hard mode a lot more interesting. Reusability is a lot more complicated to achieve with dre and far and increases the challenge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I think it is a lot better and less work to add aerodynamics first. Otherwise you have to rework the reentry system with it\u0027s implementation.
