I have been playing for 6 month and I never dock manually because it was boring me to figure out my position in space and try and try again docking...I used ORDA computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I did here was to align my SS with my lander by designing it as a target for the SS, then I use smart ASAS from mechjeb to align SS with Lander. Could have done it manually then use ASAS to stay aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did the same thing with my lander. This way you don\u0027t need the upper gauge nor the directional arrow and you can align, whatever you position in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-So first step is completed and Orange circle centered.If not well centered, \u003Cstrong\u003Euse RCS with staging mode to complete this step\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I centered the Yellow circle \u003Cstrong\u003Eusing precision input in docking mode\u003C/strong\u003E.
