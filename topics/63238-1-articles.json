Let\u0027s discuss them, shall we?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, at the moment they\u0027re in a pretty solid state, yes? I\u0027d say so. But there are some features that would be nice to have for them that aren\u0027t in the game yet. While there\u0027s obviously the scope for more to do in EVA which will in turn enhance rover-use, I\u0027d like to hear people\u0027s opinions on how they themselves could be improved. We\u0027ll start with a little suggestion or two of mine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERover/Small Payload Assembly Building:\u003C/strong\u003E I have mentioned this \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E back, and am unsure if it comes under \u0022graveyards and suchlike\u0022 in the \u0022what not to discuss\u0022 thread. But since it doesn\u0027t seem to be a taboo topic, I\u0027d like to spout about it. A building dedicated to building small payloads or rovers would be great. It could have specialised tools and options to make construction easier, and an option for fairings (which I won\u0027t go into detail about - they are taboo) of some description. There could then be a test option, in which you can put your rover to the test on various surfaces, at varying speeds, and stress-test them. The .craft could then be saved into a sub-section of the sub-assemblies labelled \u0022Rovers and Payloads\u0022. There\u0027s a lot that could be done with such a building, and I for one would greatly appreciate having it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal Interaction:\u003C/strong\u003E Kerbals should have more interaction with rovers. At the moment, if your rover rolls, your rover is stuck. But what if kerbals could right it? I think that Kerbals should have the option to move a craft by hand - grabbing it somehow and moving with it in tow: whether by hand or rope. This would be a great feature, missions would be less stressful and Kerbals would have a point other than wheel maintenance and science. And it opens up the opportunity for towing crafts along the surface of a body (such as for base assembly or general recreation).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis topic is open for discussion.
