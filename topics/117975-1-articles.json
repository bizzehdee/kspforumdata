Your parachute module/part is burning up.\n\n2. The module is fine, the parachute itself is burning up after deployment.\n\nFor #1, make sure it is out of direct heat. It doesn\u0027t necessarily need a heat shield, a Mk16 parachute on top of a Mk1 command pod that re-enters with no heat shield, SAS off, and a 45km Pe on Kerbin should not burn up either the pod or the chute module.\n\nFor #2, new heat mechanics require you do not deploy the parachute until you are well below the speed of sound (which is 300 m/s). So for safety, deploy at about 250m/s. It will be low to the ground but from orbit with a shallow descent it should be fine. Suborbital is another story, I would just avoid doing suborbital missions for now, they are incredibly difficult to get right (people are going to immediately post a reply to this saying I am wrong, they are very expert at this game and for most people it\u0027s an overly complicated task right now). If you must attempt one, DO NOT go straight up and back down, you will not slow down in time to deploy the chutes. Target an arc that leads you over to the water near the \u0022Korean-like\u0022 peninsula. Once you have drouge chutes unlocked, it becomes easy however.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T20:07:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 08:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusF","CreatedById":142152,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T20:33:26Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to add to #2, that there\u0027s an info label \u0022Safe to deploy?:\u0022 when you right-click the parachute.

Reentry speed from space isn\u0027t as important as the trajectory. Straight down is trouble. Ballistic, or in an arc, is safe-ish for the simple reason it will take longer to travel in an arc downwards and time is what you need to slow down. More time is good, little time is bad.\n\nIf your mission is just to pop out of the atmosphere and return, don\u0027t go straight up. Do a normal launch. That will add that horizontal speed for a safe trajectory. In addition, you can make a small burn at apoapsis. You don\u0027t need a lot, 150m/s or so should be enough.\n\nNow, on the decent. one trick that isn\u0027t entirely safe but if you stay alert it works well. Make sure your navball shows orbital speed and know how the normal marker looks like (blue circle). If you want to bleed off energy faster, at high (70-45 km) altitude, point the nose at the normal marker and have the entire ship work as an airbrake. Pay close attention to heat and if you hear the sound of wind, point the nose retrograde again before the air and drag goes ape on your ship. At around 45 km it is best to go retrograde as things start to get a bit rough.\n\nDownwards, work on keeping the blunt edge prograde. You might struggle but don\u0027t allow the ship to flip. Early on in career mode you don\u0027t have extra batteries but the pod holds some charge you can use to point the blunt edge into the airstream. Be economical about it as it won\u0027t last very long but it is enough to get home safely.\n\nExpect to drop below 1000m/s at around 10-15km. That\u0027s when heat is dropping quick and drag and shock waves are your main concern. Keep the blunt edge prograde. Flipping around is bad news.\n\nWatch the speed as you get closer to ground. At around 230-250m/s, it is safe to deploy the chutes. As mentioned above, right clicking on any chute will tell you if it\u0027s safe, risky or unsafe to deploy. At this point it is entirely about speed.\n\nIf you\u0027re still coming in a bit too fast for safe deployment say if the speed is more than 300m/s at 3000 meters, spend the remaining charge on pitching the nose over for greater drag. It\u0027s not a super brake but will help.\n\nHope this will help you and remember, it is well worth doing small launches for them world first contracts to see how a particular ship design falls back to Kerbin, and even more importantly, how many chutes your rocket needs. As a rule of thumb, 1 chute per 1000 kg will get you down at around 5 m/s.\n\nLast: The total mass of the returning ship is important in several ways. One is, if your ship is very heavy say 10 tons, you might want to stage the chutes so that 1 chute will deploy first. Else you risk the g-forces rip the chutes off the ship.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T19:43:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 07:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LN400**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T23:22:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...it is well worth doing small launches for them world first contracts...\n\nYou get all the height/speed/distance awards even if you don\u0027t take them as contracts.
