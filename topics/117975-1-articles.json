The module is fine, the parachute itself is burning up after deployment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor #1, make sure it is out of direct heat. It doesn\u0027t necessarily need a heat shield, a Mk16 parachute on top of a Mk1 command pod that re-enters with no heat shield, SAS off, and a 45km Pe on Kerbin should not burn up either the pod or the chute module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor #2, new heat mechanics require you do not deploy the parachute until you are well below the speed of sound (which is 300 m/s). So for safety, deploy at about 250m/s. It will be low to the ground but from orbit with a shallow descent it should be fine. Suborbital is another story, I would just avoid doing suborbital missions for now, they are incredibly difficult to get right (people are going to immediately post a reply to this saying I am wrong, they are very expert at this game and for most people it\u0027s an overly complicated task right now).

As mentioned above, right clicking on any chute will tell you if it\u0027s safe, risky or unsafe to deploy. At this point it is entirely about speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re still coming in a bit too fast for safe deployment say if the speed is more than 300m/s at 3000 meters, spend the remaining charge on pitching the nose over for greater drag. It\u0027s not a super brake but will help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this will help you and remember, it is well worth doing small launches for them world first contracts to see how a particular ship design falls back to Kerbin, and even more importantly, how many chutes your rocket needs. As a rule of thumb, 1 chute per 1000 kg will get you down at around 5 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast: The total mass of the returning ship is important in several ways. One is, if your ship is very heavy say 10 tons, you might want to stage the chutes so that 1 chute will deploy first. Else you risk the g-forces rip the chutes off the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T19:43:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 07:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LN400\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T23:22:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LN400\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LN400\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...it is well worth doing small launches for them world first contracts...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get all the height/speed/distance awards even if you don\u0027t take them as contracts.

My first science/career is on the pad, because you don\u0027t have any parts worth taking anywhere else. Second a \u0027hopper\u0027 with the flea engine, just to get away from KSC and pick up some different biome science. Third to orbit, lots of EVAs all the way around, land. Fourth, science probe to Mun - although you may well be able to pick up some easy test, science from space and tourist contracts by then too. I never bother with anything other than \u0027landed\u0027 (ie; on the pad) test contracts unless it\u0027s for something I was planning to do anyway. I never bother with EVA surveys (use waypoint manager mod if you want to do those) and hardly ever with the crew report ones either; again unless they happen to be where I was going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn essence, career mode is science mode unless you strap down the rewards a lot.

Learning how the physics of flight and space work, in KSP, is hard enough anyway though - so don\u0027t dump all the extra complications of career mode on yourself. I\u0027m almost exciusively a sandbox player but science mode is arguably the best for beginners, if they are overwhelmed with sandbox choice, since you unlock components at your own pace.
