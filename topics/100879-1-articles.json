Easiest way i found to do it is set up a maneuver node so I can see what way to burn, then delete the node and burn my engines a bit before the AN/DN, depending how much I have to change. If you burn a bit early you will \u0022push\u0022 the an/dn away form your vessel so you cut your engines and trust a little bit when you get closer again, getting closer and with less trust each time you can get the an/dn to 0.1% quite easy. mod like MJ or engineer redux helps without having to look at map and mouse over the AN/DN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen your orbit is matched check your orbit to see if it is still nearly circular, if it\u0027s not make it circular again\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet up a maneuver node a few minutes ahead and then adjust your Ap to 200km and check teh closest approach markers, then change your maneuver node by dragging it forward(or with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-0-90-0-Precise-Node-1-1-2-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eprecise node\u003C/a\u003E or mechjeb) till your closest approach is within 1km.

After it you can still fine tune your closest approach by making a new maneuver node about a quarter of an orbit before rendezvous and tweaking it a bit, should take only a few m/s change(combination of pro/retrograde and radial in/out. shouldn\u0027t take much normal as you already matched planes before) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eset up a new maneuver node at your closest approach and raise your Pe to 200km and try to overlap your new orbit as much with your targets orbit, when you execute it make sure your navball shows your velocity compared to your target and execute your maneuver burn and check your target velocity as well, when you see that is increasing(should be around 5-10m/s) cut your engine, at this point you can switch to docking mode and use your rcs to get to your target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor docking I suggest \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901-0-90-Docking-Port-Alignment-Indicator-%28Version-5-1-Updated-01-10-2015%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDocking port alignment mod\u003C/a\u003E.

If you\u0027re lower than the target you\u0027ll orbit in less time and catch up, if you\u0027re higher your orbit will take longer and the target will catch up to you. You\u0027ll want your orbit touching the target orbit at one point (with matching inclination) with the rest of the orbit either inside or outside the target orbit (to catch up or slow down). If you set the orbits fairly close you\u0027ll be able to observe how the distance to target changes with each orbit. If you set up a slow closure rate you\u0027ll get a close approach but it will take a long time so a higher closure rate is usually preferred. Once the projected target position overshoots you, you can apply a small prograde or retrograde burn to dial the projected target position back to get a very close approach and on the next orbit you can kill the majority of your speed relative to the target (which should be fairly low at this point) and set up for docking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T22:26:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHkY3FusJIQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T23:22:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I do is create a maneuver node to get the encounter pips to show up, then right-click the center of the maneuver node (the white circle) to cause the \u0022prev\u0022 and \u0022next\u0022 orbit indicators to show up.
