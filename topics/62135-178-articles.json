I found the new version more stable, as in it never crashed. I flew three flights of the original KSO and the Super25. The KSO is bugged and broke on the pad, solid boosters showed constant engine firing graphic, no power. KSO toppled over, but IVA, buttons, and such all worked fine. Super 25 launches all experienced fuel tank explosion after booster separation, but again, IVA, flight, lights, all working. I repeated this test cycle twice, once with the updated ATM and once without ATM at all. I have to admit I did enjoy running KSO without ATM for the graphic quality. Is it me or does the IVA control consoles look... different in x64? I remember the Super 25 being more glowy and the angle of cockpit view being different. Zooming in on the RPM monitors made it easy, but I get that feeling that something is different. No matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI presume the craft problems I had were likely my own fault. Probably wrong saved craft files from an older version. Regardless they don\u0027t concern me, the stability of running this mod does and it\u0027s night and day over a few days ago. C\u0027mon x64!

On loading to the launch pad, the boosters would graphically look like they were firing. When launched, they provided no thrust and my KSO toppled. Manually cycling the boosters made no change to thrust or graphics. I then put a KSO booster and a probe core on the pad. The booster operated normally. My next experiment was to remove the boosters from the KSO Block 8 and replace them with \u0022new\u0022 KSO boosters. On launchpad load, I had no graphics issues and my KSO launched normally (minus the struts, so unsuccessful).
