Try adding PQSMod_VertexHeightMap, PQSMod_VertexSimplexHeightAbsolute, and PQSMod_VertexHeightNoiseVertHeightCurve2 (that one\u0027s harder because Duna has 3; I don\u0027t think I have a way of distinguishing between them yet in RSS so any value changes will apply to all three I think) nodes to the Duna node in RSS.cfg.

If you\u0027re using Realism Overhaul with SFJackBauer\u0027s RealEngines, then engine-proxies (KSP engines that look close enough to real counterparts) are scaled to their size in real life. So a J-2X with a 3m bell is scaled so it has a 3m bell ingame. What makes this a problem is that, following Squad\u0027s annoying practice, most modders (and most all Squad engines, whence the practice arose) don\u0027t just include the engine (which ends at that industrial-tube-looking thing) but *also* the whole bottom part of the tank (the giant dome). IRL tanks, as pressure vessels, end in domes; in KSP tanks are cut off and the dome is considered part of the engine. That means that rather having an engine with a nice small top you could mount to any stage, you get the giant awful domes that are often larger than the engine itself and limit what it fits well with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, rant over. The point is, if you\u0027re using Realism Overhaul, two things are true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Most parts are rescaled to a 0.5m/1m/2m/3m/etc system, except tanks (because presumably you\u0027ll be using StretchyTanks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You\u0027re thus probably using either SFJackBauer\u0027s RealEngines (the default in Realism Overhaul), which leads to the problem I mention at the top, or you\u0027re using my RftSEngines, which obeys the 0.5m/1m/2m/etc rule (mostly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why I include rescaled fairings in RO, to fit most stage sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR yes this is working as designed; use stretchies.
