Make 2 or more agencies that can either work together, or compete. Each new agency having to start their tech tree from scratch, but you can buy new technology from a more successful agency in the save. I\u0027m not sure how much you\u0027d do with the being able to do this, but I thought it would be cool idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking maybe have one agency focus on science experiments and furthering science, while the other agency focuses on giant missions to Laythe or such, and then could share research with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anister","CreatedById":66553,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T13:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure you should post this in suggestions\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T14:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this Idea a lot and suggested it before \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think you might like this mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82785-0-25-Kerbin-Side-v0-39-1-It-s-Scott-Manley-s-Fault\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82785-0-25-Kerbin-Side-v0-39-1-It-s-Scott-Manley-s-Fault\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T14:19:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not quite sure what the benefit would be, over multiple launch spots. You can do both with the one agency- role play, give some missions one flag, others another. Having to go through the tech tree multiple times does not appeal to me. I\u0027d rather see them flesh out other aspects of the game, like better exploration of planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T18:30:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure I\u0027d like this if it was implemented.
