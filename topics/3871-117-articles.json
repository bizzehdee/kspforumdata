It was 9/10ths witchcraft and 7/10ths mysticism but I think they\u0027ll work out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those curious about what i did:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiplied Vac ISP by 0.85\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiplied Sea Level Isp by 0.8 for lifter and radial engines and 0.3 for orbital engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor orbital engines I divided the maxthrust by the ISP Ratio (VacIsp / SeaLevelIsp) - this has the effect of weakening the engines in the lower atmosphere while leaving them mostly unchanged out of the atmosphere (with regards to thrust) - for lifter engines I left the old thrusts in place for now since the Isp Ratio is usually between 1 and 1.2 (whereas it can be 3 or 4:1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen for all engines I added a new key at 0.8 atmospheres with the Isp set to the midpoint between the upper and lower Isps. This has the effect of nudging the Isp curve up so that more of the in-atmosphere time is spent at the lower Isp, allowing me to limit efficiency inside the atmosphere without destroying it in space. In theory anyway; it should make it easier to tweak engines that are \u0022upper\u0022 stages as well, not really orbital but not sea-level launchers either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll see how it goes I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference, thrust is calculated as thus now:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecurrent thrust = maxThrust * (currentIsp / SeaLevelIsp) (or MaxThrust * ISP Ratio)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also added the \u00223rd\u0022 key to the engines; its used for EVE mostly as is a representation of Chamber pressure. The \u0022key\u0022 is basically the engines internal pressure, which counters EVEs native pressure. So if an engine has a pressure less than EVE, it won\u0027t produce thrust; otherwise the ISp and thus Thurst falls off along the curve; the result is basically high-pressure engines will work on EVE, at least some, and low pressure engines won\u0027t. For now I am going with the powerful Sea level engines having high pressure and the orbitals having lower pressure, with the others somewhere in between. The aerospike will have excellent eve performance just as the stock one does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll see how it goes I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELORDPrometheus: it might be somewhat close to FAR in difficulty (not especially) but it doesn\u0027t function in the same way; FAR had a very forgiving way of finding nosecones and such and reducing drag based on that, stock aero works differently and there\u0027s no easy way to know how \u0022tall\u0022 a faring-covered section is using the current style of fairings, so anything FAR related won\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really try not to add plugins to Novapunch, and I think I can make a good enough set of stock clones for now anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hardcard","CreatedById":89166,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T09:03:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday I decided it was time to update my KSP mods and give version 1.0 a try.

I\u0027ve just modified all the bottom nodes for all the parts that have them, so far everything seems to work fine.
