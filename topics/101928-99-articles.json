Dock ports have own logic which may get broken when KIS is used to modify the station. As a workaround, detach \u0022crazy port\u0022 and put it into inventory (any). Then pull it out and attach back. This should reset the port\u0027 state. In the future avoid using KIS detach function to break connection between two docked ports. Only a properly undocked port behaves well for now.\n\u003E \n\nThank you. I already did that and it worked, but for your final advice: I am not sure what exactly I did (I basically repaired a broken lander in space with parts moving everywhere) but I am quite sure neither docking port was in docked mode when I manipulated them - but maybe I remember wrongly. I\u0027ll see if I can replicate the issue with undocked ports. If I can, I\u0027ll give you more feedback."},{"CreatedByName":"LordAssault","CreatedById":162727,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T08:08:26Z","Content":"I got a few Nres which are not listed in known issues got this two ![49fe4c65d2.jpg](http://puu.sh/oRjfd/49fe4c65d2.jpg) when placed this item in inventory ![7fc1c755d1.jpg](http://puu.sh/oRjg7/7fc1c755d1.jpg) that\u0027s from Surface Experiment pack, so that\u0027s might be mod related, I will post it in mod\u0027s thread too.

Another of my pylons and its attachments have sunk beneath the asteroid surface.\n\nI haven\u0027t changed versions of KIS since I got it to work (I still have to use the press-an-extra-key workaround, but it works).  \n\nScreenshots:\n\n1.
