As an adolescent, he would attempt crazy stunts like biking off his apartment\u0027s roof. He discovered the joy of rocketry while reading Kerboy Scout magazine at the doctor\u0027s office (awaiting treatment for a broken leg... again), and decided he wanted to attempt to replicate the model rockets. Unfortunately his family was poor due to constant medical bills. Instead, Jeb merely decided to use cheap, illegally purchased firework skyrockets for these purposes, and strapped little tinfoil kerbals to the side. His brother Bob helped Jeb in these endeavors. His older brother Bill meanwhile, attempted to keep Jeb from harm and constantly called their parents whenever he heard a WHOOSH sound. Luckily for Jeb and Bob, all the evidence of the rockets would be gone aside from a piece of paper used as a log to record the many failures. When he became an adult, he purchased a Junkyard. He used this junkyard to further the production of larger rockets. \u0022If a bomb can ride a rocket, so can I.\u0022 He was hired by the Kerbal Space Program for his badass mentality and willingness to test out experimental contraptions.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersona:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJebediah Kerman was known as a ladies man in his school, and everyone thought he was \u0022cool\u0022.

He studied engineering as best as possible, but he\u0027s not the first one to call as an engineer. He tried to link Jeb\u0027s passion for rocketry into the newly developing space science.

The school was since named for Bob, but at any rate at the time he was failing. He\u0027d read all about the latest news of rocket ships, astronomy, chemistry, and would be able to explain it all to you in as best a way as possible. The other kids thought he was a huge nerd. His brother Jeb was supportive of him, he wouldn\u0027t let the other kids bully his little brother. Bob got used to the bullying, but still came home sad each day. Eventually the other Kerbadolescents saw that Bob was actually pretty cool to know all of these new things, as new discoveries in astronomy and engineering made more kerbals respect smart kids. He joined Jebediah Kerman Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co. as the head scientist and engineer due to his extensive researching skills.

She was born on the north of the island that\u0027s known for it\u0027s tea and crumpets. She speaks Kerblish, but with a definitive teacrumpitian accent. She was separated from her parents at birth, when they were run over by a crumpetmobile. The driver had drunk too much Root Beer, and that coupled with the fact that Kerbals are horrible drivers anyway, meant that Emmany\u0027s parents didn\u0027t stand a chance. No one could identify the names of the orphan\u0027s parents, but luckily she was just old enough to pronounce her name. She was taken to the Starlight Orphanarium on the country of snacks and military, but her \u0022creepy\u0022 red hair and accent threw off all of the visitors from adopting her. She escaped the Orphanarium at age 11 (equivalent human years) and tried to find refuge from the horrible conditions and slavery of the orphanarium. She stopped in the suburbs of The Big City, and saw a surprising object fly up into the sky, whirl out of control, and explode. Running away, stealing bus tickets, and being an all-around nuisance to people who enjoyed their fine methods of capitalism, she was caught by the police. They brought her to a foster home. She finally was able to go to school. The other students would have made fun of her red hair and accent were it not for how cool her story was. She was very ambitious and competed against some genius from the suburbs in a science fair, which she took the second place prize. Eventually she studied at college for a few years, and applied to the new KSP. She was hired for her strong character and intelligence.
