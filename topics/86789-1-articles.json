The top tanks are draining first, which moves the center of mass back and makes the craft aerodynamically unstable. The solution is either to add tons of fins to the back end, or if that doesn\u0027t help, turn off the top few tanks until the bottom ones start to run out so as to keep the center of mass at the front.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T20:36:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pecan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pecan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, yes and no.

A top-heavy \u0022lawn dart\u0022 is exactly what you want! Ever seen an actual dart? Weighed on the front, fins at the bottom... Notice that it flies tip first. That\u0027s how a rocket needs to be set up, too. A rocket needs to be stable, first and foremost (unlike an airplane, where there\u0027s such thing as \u0022too stable\u0022). IRL, the gravity turn is done exactly by tipping the rocket off balance and letting it tip over at the right rate. This can be controlled with gimbals, while to fight aerodynamic forces, you need a lot more torque (usually meaning a Shuttle-style high-range gimbal and enormous mass to go with it) and you risk ripping your ship apart in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, an oversized upper stage does tend to cause this kind of problems. Add fins at the bottom, the problem should go away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T20:47:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn addition to the above, you could add more control surfaces to the bottom of the rocket.
