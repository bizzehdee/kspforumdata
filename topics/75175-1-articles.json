I read the wiki entry couple of dozen times now and I\u0027ve tried to place the hatch and ladder triggers like the copula pod. I\u0027m using Unity Box collider for ladder up the middle, and airlock on either side. but wherever I place the Airlock pivots, inside or outside the physics collider, I get the hatch obstruction error. The closes I get to a working airlock is the Kerbal spawns at the COM of the pod, and gets ejected outside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Pod requires compound colliders, but I made sure the airlock triggers are only intersecting top convex collider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U2YPKz6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022U2YPKz6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere should the airlock pivot be placed? how big should the airlock trigger be? It looks like the Kerbal is spawned where the trigger\u0027s pivot is, but that doesn\u0027t seem to work when the pivot is outside of the pod\u0027s collider.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orionkermin","CreatedById":91013,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T03:51:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1276.photobucket.com/user/morrowindorion/media/Untitled_zpsb2afbbeb.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1276.photobucket.com/albums/y477/morrowindorion/Untitled_zpsb2afbbeb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Untitled_zpsb2afbbeb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps, as you see the box collider is the area that the kerbal will spawn in and the blue pointer is the direction he will face. Also make sure your Airlock and Ladder are tagged as such. In your case you\u0027ll want to make the ladder a tall collider box so they can climb up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T23:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOoooh kay.

That\u0027s just how my example ended up. It\u0027s more about the position of the transform and the box mesh. Think of the box as needing to be big enough to contain the kerbal and the transform has to be in the middle of the box.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T02:31:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehm... after testing a bunch of different set ups, the only way I\u0027ve been able to get it to work is with the transform Y at 0. The X doesn\u0027t seem to matter, the game forces it to 0 once on the launchpad. The actual trigger box can be off center and flat. Kerbal spawns at 0,0, transform.z. Z position also must be negative, behind the CoM. really strange how it works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eB1Xb8j.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eB1Xb8j.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-17T02:58:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2014 02:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by nli2work\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
