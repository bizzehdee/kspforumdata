Then you would automatically know, aha i need 1 green lazor combined with 1 yellow lazor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECool idea Tosh. So in terms of the lazor system you would use a violet \u002B a red lazor to detatch the part. Then use a green and blue lazor to create a tractor beam effect, move the part to where you want to place it and veld it on with a violet and green lazor .... 8) Edit: oooooh and in theory you could use this same process to weld lazors on and off, creating new lazor systems in flight!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-30T00:31:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems Disperse already resets the Lazor\\\u0027s angle to it\\\u0027s starting position, but pointing side mounted Lazor\\\u0027s directly ahead of the ship would be useful as thats the first place most people will be looking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe start with single beams with basic effects, and have multiple beams increase effects?
