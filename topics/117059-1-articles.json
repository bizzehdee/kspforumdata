All planets are uninteresting, and they need to be updated, keeping their own characteristics, while adding to them. For example, geysers as you\u0027ve said, storms, canyons, more radical mountains, and that each should have very interesting, unique thematic. They should also be detailed, as currently, (nearly) all your landing sites are uninteresting, large flat surfaces. But anything like this is only possible after the game is efficient enough to be able to handle this. Currently, the waste of rescoures is not ablieng anything that would mean even higher requiements."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T23:40:58Z","Content":"I would love some sort of weather that would literally wreck and tumble your stuff around.

Perhaps not a pressing issue, but something to keep in mind for the continuing development of the game."},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T19:13:49Z","Content":"\u003E *Emergency take-off!
