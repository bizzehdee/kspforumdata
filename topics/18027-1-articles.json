In order to endure this immense heat, it has to be concealed in a very strong shell,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Easwell as use cooling systems to help it survive such unbearable heat. it will then come back out at earth, and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eget sent even further out, and will then be on it\u0027s trajectory to Saturn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkip ahead a couple years, and Saturn will be the size of the moon in the sky. at this point, the outer shell\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edecouples from the probe, and then extends it\u0027s solar panels. It then sends it\u0027s first signal back to earth in the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhole flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the probe gets closer to Saturn, it will approach Epimetheus, and let loose it\u0027s first of three probes. This\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprobe is named Epim-A, and will de-orbit itself and land on Epimetheus, and then send back signals to the JOHNDOE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprobe, which in turn is sent back to Earth. The individual 3 probes do not have strong enough antennae to beam\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eback signals directly to Earth. The Epim-A probe will then drill into Epimetheus, to research it\u0027s theorized\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplosive past. It will also take 240p images, and it could point itself to take more than one picture to make for\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea larger picture, but it is not capable of a complete panorama. The entire probe is powered by the decay of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esomething radioactive and heat into energy or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will then deploy another probe before it fires it\u0027s engines, because it is on a trajectory to hit titan right\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein the face. It will then pass by titan, still recieving data from both craft. And then a while later it will pass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eby titan. The newly deployed probe, named Snegyuh will hit Titan\u0027s athnosphere at incredible speed, and the heat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eshield will have to endure ridiculous heats as it reaches 12 Gs. This probe NEEDS to be extremely durable to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esurvive this pounding, not to mention the heat. The solution? We make it as compact as can be. Almost everything\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estays inside a little cylinder, and then unfolds. Once the craft slows down enough, and goes down to a reasonable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Espeed, we activate the parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to Titan\u0027s thick atmosphere, this large parachute will slow us down to 2.5 m/s. The outisde of the probe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eunfolds, to be used as landing legs. After the probe lands at 2.5 m/s, it will unfold all of it\u0027s instruments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd will have soalr panels, along with a spectrometer and other things to study the influence of light from the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eatmosphere, and give us the most precise readings on Titan\u0027s atmosphere yet. It will also include a radiothermal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egenerator of the likes of Epim-A, and will also bring drills and such to study Titan in more detail. Not to forget\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe all-unimportant camera! It can actually take pictures in many wavlenghts, and contains something to study\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emagnetic fields from the surface. As JOHNDOE passes by Titan, it will go over the north pole and also study any\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eelectro magnetic activity it can detect. And after Titan is behind us, JOHNDOE decouples an american flag. Don\u0027t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eask. Infact, the flag is predicted to freeze, and then shatter as it leaves Saturn\u0027s magnetic field, on the escape\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etrajectory it is, infact, on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, JOHNDOE fires it\u0027s engines, using up the rest of it\u0027s fuel, and puts itself on a orbit around\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaturn, and one that won\u0027t get interrupted by the moons. After a few (Earth) years, all of the moons will be\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealigned so that the next probe to be deployed, Epiphony, will be able to burn away from JOHNDOE and go into a\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etrajectory that will intercept with Mimas, recieve data which it can beam straight back to Earth, it will then\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epass by enceledus, epimetheus, Janus, Titan, Dione, and then back to Titan, where it will spend the rest of it\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edays orbiting, and aswell as studying Titan, it will help amplify the signals from Huygens and Snegyuh alike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd JOHNDOE will continue to research saturn and it\u0027s moons, aswell as take pictures. Pretty pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---(And yes, Snegyuh is Huygens backwards. Because we estimate that everything about it will go backwards.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EI\u0027m not really sure if this thread should be here, but that\u0027s for a mod to decide now.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"halocon720","CreatedById":34910,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T05:13:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no Earth in KSP.
