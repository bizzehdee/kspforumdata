IMHO the problem with the KAL-1000 is that it can\u0027t use sensors like the angle of a robotic arm, the distance to a different part, energy levels, temperatures, the distance to the ground, the angle of a surface, difference in the amount of light etc. All RL robots use sensors, all we have is a timing based system.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCoils and magnets: wouldn\u0027t it be nice to be able to build generators and motors?

Like, if you pop a barometer (pressure sensor) on the ship, it should show up as an additional axis in the action group list.

Like, if you are on Kerbin and you need to get altitude, you can make an inverse pressure curve in KAL-1000, feed barometer reading to it as scrub position, and you\u0027ll get altitude on the output. Yes, only relative to sea level and only within the atmosphere of a specific body, but it\u0027s a great start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikewise, an accelerometer fed into the play rate input of the KAL-1000 can be used as an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIGA_accelerometer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eintegrating accelerometer\u003C/a\u003E.

A barometer might as well have a direct pressure-altitude readout that adjusts for whichever body you\u0027re on, provided it has atmosphere, of course. Gyros seem like a must. Ground radar can work great to give you altitude, up to a limit, relative to ground on any planet or moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am a bit less confident about something like GPS. Without having to build a constellation, it feels overpowered, and making something that works with arbitrary constellations a player might build becomes far more complex than simple sensors we are talking about.

Like, when you are running a rocket engine in the game, it needs to be fed oxidizer and fuel and will give you different thrust depending on the fuel flow and external pressure. But what you, as a player, get presented with, is just a throttle axis that you set as percentage of maximum thrust under given conditions. The game figures out for you where the engine should get fuel and oxidizer from and how much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a similar vein, if we had some sort of a method for combining sensor readings to improve quality, I would probably expect the game to solve it correctly, such as by using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKalman filter\u003C/a\u003E, but that can be done completely in the background. As a player, all you should see is that if you collect more data, you get better precision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, there is still a matter of when and what data should be combined. A classical use case in robotics is combining range-finders and accelerometers when you want to keep track of position and velocity. This sort of goes back to the GPS discussion above. Roughly speaking, if you have a GPS or similar distance-based measurement of your position, you can look at changes of position over time and compute your velocity. Because you are taking multiple measurements, you can have very precise measurement of your velocity even with significant uncertainty of position. So a GPS might only get your position within a few tens of meters, but it will track your velocity to within a fraction of a meter per second quite easily, because it will measure your position a bunch of times and take an average. Problem is, this kind of measurement takes a while to respond to any changes. Clear on the other side, you can measure accelerations and adjust velocity estimates rapidly. Problem is that the errors in this measurement accumulate over time, so if you try to measure velocity only from accelerometers, the result will drift over time. So the solution is you combine the two inputs, again, with something like Kalman filter. That can give you very precise velocity measurements that are stable over time and respond instantly to any acceleration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the game, I suppose, this could be presented as a purely inertial navigation unit to begin with, which can only be so precise, and then can be \u0022upgraded\u0022 by placing more and more satellites or ground stations to augment the position and velocity readings. That seems like a reasonable option to do something like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClear on the other side, of course, is the DIY approach. If we get scripting or some other means of performing algebraic and logical operations on sensor input, then it could be an interesting challenge to build your own filters for collecting and combining data from multiple sources. That does, however, start crossing into a different kind of game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dientus","CreatedById":209823,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-09T12:48:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I see... as a compromise between over simplified and over complicated while trying to stay true to realism within reason.\u00A0 I think that may not be too bad.
