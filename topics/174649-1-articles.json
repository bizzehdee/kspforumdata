Let me say from the outset: if this is what you want to do this probably isn\u0027t the thread for you. I fully agree with a lot of players that career mode needs some work, but it seems to me that what we have just really isn\u0027t all that bad. Not perfect, obviously, but getting there\u003Ci\u003E.\u00A0\u003C/i\u003EMany players (most possibly?) play some version of career mode and love it. I\u0027ll also submit\u00A0from a pure development standpoint it is next to unfathomable that Squad would at this point utterly scrap everything they\u0027ve done since 2014 and start over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to offer then a series of ideas I think could tune-up and expand upon what we already have to make career mode a truly great game. The hardest problem, always, is that there are about as many ways to play KSP as there are players. That flexibility and dynamism is what gives it such potential, but it also can\u00A0lead to unstructured, muddy game design. The goal of career then, I think, is to create a strong backbone set of mechanics that enable as many playstyles as possible while sticking to the core of what KSP is about: \u003Cem\u003Ebuilding rockets and flying them\u003C/em\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFog of Science:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience is probably the section that needs the most TLC. I know there are those that disagree but to me the central issue is not the underlying mechanic (gather science, unlock parts), but in how that plays as an in-flight experience. Science points are ubiquitous, which is nice because you can go out there and fly where you want and gather them, but the actual process of gathering them ends up being fairly monotonous. This monotony is reenforced by the fact that the planetary surfaces themselves are fairly monotonous. Nothing feels like science because there\u0027s nothing really out there to discover. Here\u0027s what I think we could do to fix that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1)\u003C/strong\u003E Add surface features with a more sciency feel like ice crystals, geologic formations, geysers, volcanoes, signs of life, etc and spread them across the planetary surfaces.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2)\u003C/strong\u003E Make those features mapable from orbit, highlighting biomes where they are common and\u00A0placing automatic waypoints when important features and anomalies are spotted. Biomes\u00A0should also be visible in map mode.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3)\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Differentiate the value of different biomes and give surface features science bonuses so players are incentivized to find them rather than land any old place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4)\u003C/strong\u003E Give on-screen notices that new science is available and a science action group to gather and store it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5)\u003C/strong\u003E Give the experiments themselves additional perks in flight and/or information valuable to the player later. For instance thermometers could enable visible heat bars, barometers could enable flight trajectory factoring drag, having a gravoli could increase the chance surface features are mapped, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022X4HmvGh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022512\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/X4HmvGh.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat this produces is in effect a fog of war/discovery feel to the game. The planets are just blank orbs from space, and its the process of unveiling and discovering whats on the surface that allows you to develop. You\u0027re also being given strong incentives to bring rovers and\u00A0learn things like precision landing. Streamlining is also important: clearing away all of the repetitive clicking to check when you\u0027ve entered a new biome, gather and store that information so players can focus on flying and exploration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERejiggered Tech Tree:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother problem we have going on I think is many players are feeling left out by the current structure of the tech tree. Now of course we can\u0027t exactly suit the tree to optimize things for everyone, but I do think we could do better for two groups of players: the folks who like planes and the folks who like to start un-manned. Here\u0027s one I thew together for another thread:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022g4rXkoR.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022737\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/g4rXkoR.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe main point being to give stronger branches right at the beginning to allow players to dive into their preferred mode of play. I also think there are a number of other ways the tech tree could be more tightly optimized which you can find \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/166676-lets-rebalance-the-tech-tree/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E if you\u0027re interested.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBetter flight tools:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother perennial ask is for some better aids to help new and old players get to where they want to go with as little time-wasting as possible. Players should at least have the opportunity to optimize their vessels, find transfer windows and manage multiple active flights without mods or going to a browser.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1)\u003C/strong\u003E Add Delta-V and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E readouts in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and in flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2)\u003C/strong\u003E Include a stock alarm clock for setting reminders on manuvers, encounters, transfer windows, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3)\u003C/strong\u003E Include a transfer window finder. This needn\u0027t be a list of dates, in fact its probably better if players can play with optimization a bit. Something like Transfer Window Planner with an orrery so you can see how it works?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4)\u003C/strong\u003E Improve maneuver nodes. They\u0027re really fiddly at the moment, so either something close to Precise Node or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/121368-new-maneuver-node-editing-tool/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EAlshain\u0027s maneuver widget\u003C/a\u003E would be fantastic. Better Burn Time also provides some much more useful flight information.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMake Milestones the MainQuest:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP doesn\u0027t really have an end goal, nor should it in my opinion. The open-endedness of it really is what makes it great. It could though benefit from a backbone set of goals for players to work towards. The best example of these are the Milestones--flying to, landing, and planting flags on each planet and moon.\u00A0The funny thing about Milestones is they\u0027re actually the main contracts that everyone is most interested in and yet they\u0027re almost completely invisible within the UI. I quite like that that they\u0027re passive and don\u0027t rely on any linear track to unlock, but most new (and old) players would be forgiven for not knowing they exist. As soon as you open Mission Control they should be right up front and visible to players so they know the big headline missions they could pursue and what the rewards would be for achieving them. One way to do this would be to break mission control into separate tabs for each world, with the main exploration contracts listed at the top and any other contracts associated with that planet listed below:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PGuLPPF.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022375\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/PGuLPPF.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese contracts could\u00A0either be constantly available, or as I\u0027d prefer, active automatically with their advances becoming available with sufficient reputation. In either case they should be constantly visible in Mission Control so players at least knew they are there. Having planetary tabs would also be handy with information on transfer windows, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirements, atmospheric information etc. that could be filled automatically or by using experiments^^.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBetter Strategery:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the current set of strategies are... fine. At the moment they seem more like expedient hacks to fix broken mechanics though. What the Administration building really needs are more strategies like Transponders and Leadership Initiative that allow a player to make gains on a given style of play. They also need to be more flexible, allowing players to pick up and drop strategies as their careers evolve and progress. The main thing I\u0027d like to see them do however is give players more direct control over the type of career missions they\u0027d like to pursue.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1)\u003C/strong\u003E Create a suite of strategies that directly effect the probability of a specific contract type coming up in Mission Control. For instance Tourism Inititiative, Rescue Program or Mining Enterprise.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis would give players a little more direct control over the type of space program they\u0027d like to develop. They also would help players from getting locked into or pigeonholed by the contract weighting system with one set of contracts early that they may not be interested in later.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMake Time a thing:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis\u00A0is another huge factor that I know a lot of players are interested in. Its of course very tricky because of time warp--anything that comes with a benefit over time encourages players to just time-warp through it (see the Mobile Processing\u00A0Lab).\u00A0Worse, if you try to hinder that with factors that cost over time it punishes players for\u00A0time-warping when they really need to,\u00A0\u00A0something that\u0027s desperately difficult to calibrate when some players want to play around KSOI and others want to warp out to Jool. I think there are a couple of ways\u00A0that this could all be managed, however:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1)\u003C/strong\u003E Give Milestone\u00A0contracts calendar based bonuses--ie, if you get to the Mun or to Duna before X date you receive World First\u00A0bonus rewards.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2)\u003C/strong\u003E Give building and research upgrades a duration to completion on a toggle. Rocket construction could be based on cost, with construction speeds increased with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/SHP upgrades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3)\u003C/strong\u003E Open the door for experiments that\u00A0take time to complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4)\u003C/strong\u003E Add life-support with a toggle. With a simplified habitation mechanic I think \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS is basically ready for stock.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis way you have to think carefully before you just time-warp through research and construction, because you risk missing World First bonuses and/or wasting LS resources. I think with toggles and difficulty settings this could bring so much to game strategy without overcomplicating things for players who aren\u0027t interested.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo that\u0027s what I got. I think there are a bunch of other areas as well (fully fleshing out Experience perks and making some refinements to building upgrades etc.)\u00A0but I think this covers the main sections of the game that are lacking at the moment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-10T16:50:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2018 04:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-05T21:18:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105624\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Pthigrivi\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0A well thought out and presented set of ideas.\u00A0 And i think the approach of adding to and/or tweaking the existing system is the most likely, and practical, way forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne tweak i wondered about was to link the science gathering to the \u0027Hack Gravity\u0027 cheat and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E indication.

Of course to do that properly I\u0027d have to sift all the parts into more appropriate nodes and think more carefully about the path-routes, the above is really just a conceptual diagram.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven if you were to stick with the current framework there are some major areas I think could be improved upon. Solar panels, batteries, ladders, lights and rover wheels should really come at least a level earlier across the board. Many of the structural pieces also seem to come too late. Other things like radiators, IRSU and the LV-N could be held further back. All Im saying is the whole thing could use at least a second look and probably a systematic restructure.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223372989\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174649\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221525695403\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, 5thHorseman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like a lot of these ideas, especially the science stuff. In particular, I like the fog of war coupled with specific (and randomized!) places to land and visit, which encourages both precision landing and rovers.

The trouble now is all of the biomes are worth the same so even on a 2nd or 4th landing on a given body there\u0027s really no experiential or strategic reason to land anywhere specific. With just a little bit of randomization and having to weigh between high IRSU resources and\u00A0high science payouts\u00A0you could make a real game of site selection. When it comes time to collect I think you still need some level of interface and an option to manage what you\u0027re collecting but if we could get all those results into 1 clean window with a hotkey the process would be about as unobtrusive as it can be.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-07T19:31:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2018 07:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DAL59","CreatedById":180784,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-07T20:24:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what we need for 1.5.\u00A0 Very little actual stuff has changed since 1.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-07T22:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223373080\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174649\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221525704249\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022173591\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Dunatian\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, The Dunatian said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see you haven\u0027t played career mode much.
