The launch phase to 36,000 meters is all but identical to an 090 heading (except the 270 heading on the gravity turn). Between 32,000 to 36,000 meters lower the pitch more heading west bound, otherwise the prograde angle at 36,000 meters will be higher than the trip heading eastbound and the gravity turn will be delayed and the orbit more eccentric than planned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that some elevation in apoapsis at 36,000 may be desired, because at 36,000 meters your omega-squared radius will likely be lower, this means effective gravitational force will be higher during the early part of the orbital burn. Because of this one might want to add more thrust to carry the weight and compensate for the loss of delta-v, and you will want to max that thrust during the 32,000 to 36,000 turn west burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dragon7722","CreatedById":57914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T23:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SRV Ron\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SRV Ron\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EInstead of turning East during your orbital turn, turn West.

So if you want zero inclination, you fly due East; 180 inclination, you fly due West; 45 inclination, fly North-East.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat works because at the equator, so whatever direction you\u0027re going, that\u0027s the direction your orbit inclination goes (except zero inclination means East, whereas zero heading means North). You start at the equator. When you aren\u0027t at the equator, the correspondence is more complicated, so just keep flying prograde and you don\u0027t have to solve equations during launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m eliding one little detail: you need to burn a bit West of what I said because you have to cancel your starting orbit speed of 175 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
