I looked for info about this on the Wiki, but all it said was that this was implemented in 0.23 without listing the parts. I looked back in the forum for the 0.23 announcement, but I saw no mention of this in the new feature list and no link to a more detailed change log. Could some kind soul please let me know where to find the list of parts that have had this property?

I\u0027m not sure if the same list is also physics-less, but things like cubic octagonals and ladders certainly are. The stock plane landing gear used to have no physics/mass, but I read somewhere that this might recently have changed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T15:17:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe wiki has a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Massless_part\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elist of massless parts\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T15:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jouni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jouni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe wiki has a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Massless_part\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elist of massless parts\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
