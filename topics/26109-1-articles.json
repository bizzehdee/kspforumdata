Like, you could have maybe 25 or so players around Kerbin that all can build rockets and planes, and they have a goal of beating eachother using alliances and whatnot, so there\u0027s a hint of politics. Now, think of it like this, You could build space stations and such, and that station could launch orbital missiles or lasers, BUT you\u0027d need to protect it from enemy missiles or ships. At the same time, you are flying attack bombers to enemy bases to say, damage their Hangar so temporarily they cannot launch planes, but they could choose to build turrets and SAM\u0027s using some form of income (possibly from mining and building workshops/revenue buildings that could also be attacked to hurt your income?). Now, all that would be with the KSP physics. Your wing gets shot, and you spiral out of control with chunks of your plane wobbling and breaking. Your station gets hit? it sends pieces flying in all directions, but depending on the damage maybe it\u0027s still semi-usable. It could have much potential as a strategic global war game with KSP construction and physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENOW\u003C/strong\u003E before you reply, remember I\u0027m not suggesting they change KSP in any way or form.
