Still think they\u0027re major players with strong decisive power while in fact that got surprisingly little to say with money they got and the current management issues. UKSA should take an example from Italian Space Agency - they are smaller players in ESA yet somehow manage to find a common ground with other countries in Europe and even despite of years in trouble - they did manage to push Vega and so far it works beautifully. The only good thing UKSA actually managed to do in last few years is pushing British private space sector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHermes was cancelled well before actual development of Ariane 5 started. Ariane was \u0022sized\u0022 for Hermes, but none of the actual design is currently man-rated. It would need a major redesign, which is not going to happen at this stage in the Ariane lifecycle. You would also need to invest in new facilities in Kourou for crew operations, heavy launch pad modifications, and expansion of the airbase and naval facilities for S\u0026amp;R operations in case of an abort...\u003Cp\u003EAnd why would it need a fairing?

Final approval of Ariane 5 was done in 1987, years before Hermes was cancelled. Year after that they already started building a launch pad in Kourou. Hermes was cancelled in 1992. By that time not only rocket design was done, but they even gone through series of tests for the new Vulcain engine and in 1993 EAP (Solid Rocket Booster) was tested.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-16T14:57:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2014 02:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sky_walker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"B787_300","CreatedById":31055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T14:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice post sky_walker.
