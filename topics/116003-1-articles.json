Every time I grab it with a claw, pull it away from the SPH runway so I can launch something else, release it, and go back to the space centre, it disappears. It doesn\u0027t disappear if I go back to the space centre while the debris is still on the runway. The vehicle I\u0027m using for pulling the modules off the runway doesn\u0027t disappear, I\u0027m assuming because it\u0027s not debris, it\u0027s a ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs a new feature of KSP to clear the KSC of debris? I don\u0027t think it is because I\u0027ve manually removed it before. Or is it a mod I have? I don\u0027t have any mods installed that would do that....I think? I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a bug or not, if it is I can provide more information if it\u0027s needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Reloading quicksaves doesn\u0027t make the debris come back!? And if I put a Kerbal in a part with crew capacity, they get killed (marked as MIA in the Astronaut Complex). Looking through my save files in Notepad, I can see the debris isn\u0027t even there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T22:53:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 10:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yorshee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
