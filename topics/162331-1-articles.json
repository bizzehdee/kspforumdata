I suspect these colours were changed to match the new KerbNet biome maps. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/gordonfpanam/Alien-Space-Programs/blob/master/EveSpaceProgram/EveSpaceProgram.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s the changes I\u0027ve done so far to Eve\u003C/a\u003E, but I\u0027m missing two biomes yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got the colour values from the ScanSat image posted to the KSP Wiki for Eve. Two biomes (craters and atasuki lake or however that\u0027s spelled) are missing as they seemed too close a match to other biome colours, but maybe I\u0027m looking in the wrong place. Is there a better colour map somewhere I can look at?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[21 JUN 2017] Found it here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kopernicus/kittopia-dumps\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Kopernicus/kittopia-dumps\u003C/a\u003E, which is a copy of the stock system dumped into Kopernicus-compatible config files.
