Than I found out there\u0027s no autostruct option and or hard attachment (or whatever it\u0027s called i forgot), I tested it and it was really wobbly, please help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T20:34:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like you\u0027ll have to re-learn how to properly build things, now that the crutch is gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means stuff like: don\u0027t connect two XL parts with a small part; connect them with another XL part. If you want a small part in the middle of a large stack (for example a small engine on a large fuel tank), use an engine plate to form an interstage, or use a payload bay of the appropriate size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, if KSP2\u0027s node system is anything like KSP1\u0027s (and everything seens so far implies yes), then the shorter a part is, the more it will wobble. Four FL-T200 tanks stacked will have the same length as a single FL-T800 tank, but wobble far, far more. Ergo, use long parts where you can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, struts are a part you can use to stabilize sections that wobble no matter what.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAutostrutting will return in a future release, according to the devs. No timeframe has been given.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Wandering_Jeb","CreatedById":225520,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T20:45:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, ever since I discovered this thing called part clipping and autostruct.
