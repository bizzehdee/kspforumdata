You must do it in one whole run. You don\u0027t get checkpoints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) No mods, except for MechJeb. No use of the MechJeb pod, either. One MJ unit per controlable part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Include a record of your success. A video of the whole attempt is heavily recommended. More instructions in the events.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Obey the event rules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrounded\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) At no point may your craft fully leave the ground. One part of the craft must be touching the ground at all times, unless otherwise stated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) You *are* allowed to just walk/sprint your kerbal in this event. Who knows, maybe they\u0027re faster than they seem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunway Dash:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo from the starting point on the runway to the end as fast as possible. Time starts when physics loads (MET starts). Post a screenshot of your craft at the end of the runway, with clock shown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERace to the Pole:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to the north pole from the runway. Same as above, time starts when physics loads (MET starts). Post a screenshot of your craft (or kerbal) at the north pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECircumnavigation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to the north pole and back. Twice. This is equal to circumnavigating Kerbin. Time starts when the MET starts. Post a screenshot of your craft at the north pole, at the KSC after returning, at the north pole again, and at the KSC for the finish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin Atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Your craft must leave the ground and may only touch the ground on the runway/pad at the start and end of the mission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Your craft may not leave the atmosphere, and must remain in one piece\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) No parachutes on your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoppetty Hop Hop:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to 5000m and land back wherever you started (runway/launchpad). Time is the MET timer, as always. Screenshot needed at 5000m, and landed back on the pad/runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsland Runway:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on the island runway. That\u0027s it. Post a screenshot of your craft on the island runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECircumnavigation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo around the world. Simple, yes? You craft must leave a marker at the north and south poles, though. Post a screenshot of your craft landed on the runway at the end, and of the markers at the north and south poles. You *are* allowed to split your craft at the north and south poles, for this event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin Orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Your craft must land safely on kerbin at the end of the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) You may not leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Your craft may only break into the booster and orbiter sections when manuvering. (No drop tanks once in orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERace to Orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet to orbit as fast as possible, in measured against MET. Post a screenshot of your craft in orbit (periapsis \u0026gt; 70k). Also post a picture of your craft, landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital Speed Record:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo as fast as you can, while still remaining in a stable orbit. Post a screenshot of your craft in the orbit, with your mouse hovering over your craft (showing vel and alt stats).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-entry race:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo through the atmosphere on a lithobraking trajectory as fast as possible, while surviving. Post a screenshot of your craft\u0027s speedometer and trajectory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterplanetary Orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You craft may do anything, while still obeying the overall rules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEscape orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExit Kerbin\u0027s SOI as fast as possible (this includes the mun). Post a screenshot of your craft\u0027s MET at SOI change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly me to the mun:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to the mun and back as fast as possible, landing on the north pole. Post a screenshot of your craft\u0027s MET when landed from the mun and the marker on the north pole of the mun. (Probably your decent stage)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterplanetary Tour:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeave a marker on every planet and moon, except for jool, and return to kerbin safely.

Post a screenshot of your craft\u0027s alimeter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtra-terrestrial exit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExit the SOI of Kerbol. Seriously. That\u0027s it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuindeciathalon:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreate a craft that can fly and land on any terrestrial body, and return to kerbin (that included eve, sea level!).
