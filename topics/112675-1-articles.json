After transmitting science antennae close and stay closed. They can no longer be opened by right clicking.\n\nThis is an old issue that at one point was fixed but was reintroduced one or two updates later. Best thing to do is assign an action group to toggle antennae. Once closed by science they still respond to action groups"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T15:54:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Agreed, that\u0027s been driving me crazy since I bought the game.
