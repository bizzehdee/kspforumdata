One sees the accomplishment of the first spacefaring Kosmonaut, or a probe racing through the heavens at more than two or three kilometres per second to strike a planet wind-blown with red dust storms. One sees the results of the true Kerbal endeavor... But hardly does one think of the processes and the countless hours of work that got them up there.\n\nThat\u0027s what I do. I don\u0027t fly (or at least, I haven\u0027t yet...), I work on the ground. In the trenches, as it were. I am an engineer, which means I solve practical problems. When the administration team comes up with a set of orders for a new spacecraft, a new probe, a new capsule or rover or anything else that requires designing and building, they call on me. I am the Chief Engineer at the Kerbal Space Program, an \u0022orange suit.\u0022 I run a team of fellow engineers that are grouped depending on the specific type of engineering required. Probe engineers, rover engineers, the other-things-I-mentioned engineers. \n\nPersonally, my favorite is Rover engineering. That\u0027s what I love to do- there\u0027s nothing better than driving along on a rover that I designed! Had my fair share of accidents, too... These are some fun time\u0027s were living in.\n\nAnywho, I decided to create this sort of collection, *the Engineer Diaries*, to sort of show a different side of things. While we may not get as much recognition as, say, Jebediah, Jedemone, or Richbles Kerman, the engineers are important to consider too. That\u0027s the fact of the matter. I hope the information I can jot down in my spare time can enlighten a few people.\n\n-Bill Kerman, Chief Engineer\n\n**Chapter 2: Equipment Testing** [Back to Top](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\nWritten by Bill Kerman, Chief Engineer\n\nTranslated by KSP Linguistics Team\n\nEngineering is an exact science. Quite literally. The equipment my team and I design are the spawn of perfectly drawn plans, down to a scale nearly too small to be even drawn with our slide rulers! The amount of planning and patience involved in engineering is intense. And the math... Don\u0027t even get me started.\n\nEngineering does have its perks, though. *Equipment testing!* Taking our ideas, and after the hundreds of hours spent designing and building, getting to perform tests on them. From drop tests to parachute-valiancy tests to land-speed tests- Testing is where we engineers get to have our fun. Of course, sometimes these tests themselves require engineering prowess, such as the construction of big flame buckets to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine on the test stand. Those things have to be super tough.\n\nAs I\u0027ve written previously, I love rovers. What better way to test rovers than a road trip?\n\n![e7WnBOg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/e7WnBOg.jpg)\n\nI love driving around the KSC on rovers that I design! There\u0027s no better way to spend an afternoon than driving around in a spacesuit and getting to put the machine through its paces! And if it breaks during testing, guess what? We can put it back together again! Though the testing and training phases for Pilot Kosmonauts largely behind the scenes, I thought I\u0027d write about it this time because I love it so much. \n\n-Bill Kerman, Chief Engineer\n\n**Chapter 3: Failure Is, Indeed, Always an Option** [Back to Top](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\nWritten by Bill Kerman, Chief Engineer\n\nTranslated by KSP Linguistics Team\n\nOne of the most frequent questions I\u0027m asked during, say, job shadows or interviews (not that I get a lot...) is in regards to my machines, and more specifically, what happens when they fail.\n\nIn short, I learn.\n\nFailure is literally a way of life. Not just for engineers, either! Failure is going to follow you wherever you go, hampering plans and ruining days. I know I\u0027ve had my fair share of failures. However, the important thing to remember is that failure is one of the greatest tools in your arsenal.\n\nLet me give an example: The recent Duna-1 mission, which was a pretty big gamble in itself, required just over 170,000 funds to build the massive rocket that would carry the payload. And that was after design changes and the reduction of the size of the rocket, mind you! Well, even after all that, somehow some engineers under my watch forgot to put batteries on the spacecraft. Literally, the only battery left was the internals on the probe core. \n\nThe problem went undiscovered until the craft was in space, and therefore there was an enormous controversy on the ground about what to do about it. Because the craft still had solar panels mounted on it, the craft would not run out of charge so long as the SAS systems in place were not used, and so the mission controllers decided to go ahead with the mission anyway. The craft was switched to RCS power and away it went out of Kerbin\u0027s SoI.\n\nThe mission was a failure anyway, however, because the craft missed Duna entirely.\n\nIt ALSO turns out that not only were there no batteries, but after the spacecraft shot right on by the Reddish Planet, the scientist team came back and said that they\u0027d discovered a method of using approximately one-fifth the Delta-v. Wow. That was a shocker. Though the Newsflash team didn\u0027t say so (or perhaps it was covered up... and perhaps I shouldn\u0027t mention it...), the KSP was basically the laughingstock of other rival space programs for a time afterwards. \n\nSo the point I\u0027m trying to get across to you here is that failure is always an option. Failure gives you the information you need to fix the problems associated with a particular situation, or at the very least inspires you to look for a solution or workaround. So if there\u0027s one thing you take away from this today, it\u0027s that you should never be afraid to fail! \n\nBesides, sometimes failures are fun to watch!\n\n-Bill Kerman, Chief Engineer\n\n**Chapter 4: Space in the Heart and Mind** [Back to Top](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\nWritten by Neilgrasse deKerman, Space Popularizer\n\nEdited by Bill Kerman, Chief Engineer\n\nTranslated by KSP Linguistics Team\n\nIt is quite obvious to say that space holds a particular interest in our species. One must only ever glance up at the night sky to realize that we are quite alone, tiny and seemingly insignificant in a vast and empty cosmos that stretches literally farther than the eye can see. Farther than even telescopes can see.\n\nIn early times, ancient peoples would use the heavens as a tool, a calendar to predict times when to reap and sow, when to migrate and when the herds of wild animals would come around again. The sky foretold of disasters, war, famine, disease. While such claims are dubious indeed, there was an undeniable correlation between events and sights, and those who came before us took it as law. And so it was for a very, very long time.\n\nHowever, things were not to last. As the early Kerbals began to evolve and invent new technologies, many things started to change. Before the electric light, the moon and stars were the only way to see at night, and it was a faint thing at best. Suddenly, though, we were able to bring the stars down to Kerbin, illuminating our lives and the night landscape. This had dire consequences. We began to lose the sky itself- as the light pollution from these artificial lights became more and more commonplace, the night sky began to dim, and the galaxies and even the stars started hiding from view, outshone by Kerbal ingenuity. The Kerbal race lost touch with the sky. So how do we fix such a problem?\n\nWell, there are a multitude of solutions. Kerbals seem inexplicably drawn to the cosmos, and strive to look into the vast emptiness and gaze at its wonder. It\u0027s in our genes! Then there are the works of famous scientists, engineers, and other popularizers of science and wonderment, the foremost of which I can think of would be none other than Carlgan Kerman. These great Kerbals served to instill, or rather re-instill, that sense of belonging in the cosmos in our blood, in our mind and hearts. It\u0027s a dedication I\u0027ve also made to the Kerbal species- I\u0027m writing this to you, aren\u0027t I?\n\nI have one message, and one message only. Never lose sight of the stars. Go outside some night, look up into the sky and see what you can see. We belong up there, not just down here. There\u0027s lots of places to go, and lots of things to do.\n\n-Neilgrasse deKerman\n\n*-Afterword-*\n\nThis chapter was written by a good friend, Neilgrasse deKerman, who graciously agreed to write a chapter in the Diaries for me! He\u0027s truly an inspiration, and I would recommend you look at some of his work. I agree with the whole darn thing.\n\n-Bill Kerman, Chief Engineer\n\n**Chapter 5: Dealing With Repetition** [Back to Top](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\nWritten by Bill Kerman, Chief Engineer\n\nTranslated by KSP Linguistics Team\n\nI find that one of the most challenging things about working in the space program is the constant fear of being \u0022burnt out,\u0022 as it were, on the little things.\n\nSure, in recent days, the Space Program I work under has made tremendous progress, even landing on the planet Eve for the first time ever! My boss still can\u0027t be more pleased about it, but it just seems like as of late I\u0027ve been off my game.\n\nDesigning things that go into space- *that go into space!*- is undoubtedly fun, and it is one of the best things about this world! Make no mistake, it is my passion and I love doing it. It just gets boring sometimes.\n\nThe boredom can be a killer. Things get taken for granted and people mess up. It is quite important to find a way to circumvent these stints of boredom, of monotony, and keep moving forward, to never lose interest. There are several things I\u0027ve found that can help relieve the pressure of doing everything right.\n\n1) **Take a nice, relaxing trip.** Whether for Science or fun, road trips or plane joyrides can be a blast! There\u0027s always new things to see on Kerbin, and I know for a fact, having ridden along with a pilot kosmonaut in an experimental two-seater jet, that buzzing mountaintops is exhilarating and extremely terrifying. Certainly not for the faint of heart, but it can give you the excitement you need.\n\n2) **Be inspired!** Sometimes all it takes is a little inspiration. I find that reading a good book about space, watching a good TV program, or even looking at the sky can rejuvenate interest in what I do. There\u0027s so much beauty in space, and it\u0027s important to be able to feel great about looking up there and being happy with it.\n\n3) **Set a goal!** Sometimes, all it takes is a little prompting. Set goals for yourself, and work on reaching them. In informal conversations with Maxwell Kerman, the KSP CEO, I find that he does exactly this- He tells me often of his goals and what he wants to do. Finding out how to do interplanetary missions has been a longtime goal of his, and he\u0027s recently accomplished it over the last several years of the Program. Now he\u0027s looking for a new thing to work on.\n\nSo that\u0027s my take on the matter. Boredom sure is boring, but I\u0027m confident things will pick up again.\n\n-Bill Kerman, Chief Engineer\n\n**Chapter 6: Ecstasy, Invoked by Space Travel** [Back to Top](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\nWritten by Neilgrasse deKerman, Space Popularizer\n\nEdited by Bill Kerman, Chief Engineer\n\nTranslated by KSP Linguistics Team\n\nI\u0027m so excited! Just recently, I was finally selected to be part of a mission, the first mission of the new Kosmos program as designated Engineer! Oh, it\u0027s such an amazing experience to finally get to go into space! I mean, that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been dreaming of ever since I was a little kid!\n\nSpace looks so much better once you\u0027re up there, and the planets and moons... Incredible. I was also designated to take pictures during the mission, and the Program recently released the album of my photographs. Enjoy!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/KWqNw)\n\nThese images, I hope, can convey at least a little bit of my emotion at the time. It was an amazing experience, and I surely hope that next time I will get to practice my craft in space as well. I will certainly get my engineers working on projects. I hear that there are some surface outposts and orbital stations in need of designing... Stay tuned!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T03:35:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 03:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Maximus97**"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T19:06:41Z","Content":"So this is what you\u0027ve been up to.
