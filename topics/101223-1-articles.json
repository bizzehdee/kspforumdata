Not just for engineers, either! Failure is going to follow you wherever you go, hampering plans and ruining days. I know I\u0027ve had my fair share of failures. However, the important thing to remember is that failure is one of the greatest tools in your arsenal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me give an example: The recent Duna-1 mission, which was a pretty big gamble in itself, required just over 170,000 funds to build the massive rocket that would carry the payload. And that was after design changes and the reduction of the size of the rocket, mind you! Well, even after all that, somehow some engineers under my watch forgot to put batteries on the spacecraft. Literally, the only battery left was the internals on the probe core. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem went undiscovered until the craft was in space, and therefore there was an enormous controversy on the ground about what to do about it. Because the craft still had solar panels mounted on it, the craft would not run out of charge so long as the SAS systems in place were not used, and so the mission controllers decided to go ahead with the mission anyway. The craft was switched to RCS power and away it went out of Kerbin\u0027s SoI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission was a failure anyway, however, because the craft missed Duna entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt ALSO turns out that not only were there no batteries, but after the spacecraft shot right on by the Reddish Planet, the scientist team came back and said that they\u0027d discovered a method of using approximately one-fifth the Delta-v. Wow. That was a shocker. Though the Newsflash team didn\u0027t say so (or perhaps it was covered up... and perhaps I shouldn\u0027t mention it...), the KSP was basically the laughingstock of other rival space programs for a time afterwards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the point I\u0027m trying to get across to you here is that failure is always an option. Failure gives you the information you need to fix the problems associated with a particular situation, or at the very least inspires you to look for a solution or workaround. So if there\u0027s one thing you take away from this today, it\u0027s that you should never be afraid to fail! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, sometimes failures are fun to watch!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Bill Kerman, Chief Engineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EChapter 4: Space in the Heart and Mind\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Book Antiqua\u0027;\u0022\u003EBack to Top\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EWritten by Neilgrasse deKerman, Space Popularizer\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EEdited by Bill Kerman, Chief Engineer\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ETranslated by KSP Linguistics Team\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is quite obvious to say that space holds a particular interest in our species. One must only ever glance up at the night sky to realize that we are quite alone, tiny and seemingly insignificant in a vast and empty cosmos that stretches literally farther than the eye can see. Farther than even telescopes can see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn early times, ancient peoples would use the heavens as a tool, a calendar to predict times when to reap and sow, when to migrate and when the herds of wild animals would come around again. The sky foretold of disasters, war, famine, disease. While such claims are dubious indeed, there was an undeniable correlation between events and sights, and those who came before us took it as law. And so it was for a very, very long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, things were not to last. As the early Kerbals began to evolve and invent new technologies, many things started to change. Before the electric light, the moon and stars were the only way to see at night, and it was a faint thing at best. Suddenly, though, we were able to bring the stars down to Kerbin, illuminating our lives and the night landscape. This had dire consequences. We began to lose the sky itself- as the light pollution from these artificial lights became more and more commonplace, the night sky began to dim, and the galaxies and even the stars started hiding from view, outshone by Kerbal ingenuity. The Kerbal race lost touch with the sky. So how do we fix such a problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, there are a multitude of solutions. Kerbals seem inexplicably drawn to the cosmos, and strive to look into the vast emptiness and gaze at its wonder. It\u0027s in our genes! Then there are the works of famous scientists, engineers, and other popularizers of science and wonderment, the foremost of which I can think of would be none other than Carlgan Kerman. These great Kerbals served to instill, or rather re-instill, that sense of belonging in the cosmos in our blood, in our mind and hearts. It\u0027s a dedication I\u0027ve also made to the Kerbal species- I\u0027m writing this to you, aren\u0027t I?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have one message, and one message only. Never lose sight of the stars. Go outside some night, look up into the sky and see what you can see. We belong up there, not just down here.

I find that reading a good book about space, watching a good TV program, or even looking at the sky can rejuvenate interest in what I do. There\u0027s so much beauty in space, and it\u0027s important to be able to feel great about looking up there and being happy with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) \u003Cstrong\u003ESet a goal!\u003C/strong\u003E Sometimes, all it takes is a little prompting. Set goals for yourself, and work on reaching them. In informal conversations with Maxwell Kerman, the KSP CEO, I find that he does exactly this- He tells me often of his goals and what he wants to do. Finding out how to do interplanetary missions has been a longtime goal of his, and he\u0027s recently accomplished it over the last several years of the Program. Now he\u0027s looking for a new thing to work on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s my take on the matter.
