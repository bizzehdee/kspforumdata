(While it had a higher acquisition cost than Rockwell,  it met ALL of the initial technical requirements, and had the lowest life cycle cost...go figure.)  Rockwell\u0027s shuttle was much smaller and did not meet the initial requirements established for the program, but it was cheapened up to meet the latest less rigorous technical requirements. The Chrysler/GD orbiter had a HOMOGENIOUS ablative heat shield, which could be rapidly scraped off upon her return to earth, and a new one rapidly applied - allowing one week turn arounds...NO TILES, glued on by migrant workers at Rockwell, and no Columbia diaster.\n\nThe selection of Rockwell removed Chrysler; Von Braun\u0027s synergistic partner in the Redstone,  Jupiter, and Saturn I/IB Programs; and turned the future of NASA over to the Air Force.\n\nI was on a business trip when I watched, on airport TV, the fate of the Challenger.

Maybe to play around with angle on both, wingtip angle and on tail. Main issue with any replica attempt is that you can get a good look of craft, but you can\u0027t get exact mass distribution and mass amount with KSP parts.

I use wing configs from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E so no unrealistically strong or heavy wings. I know though I can\u0027t match the exact airfoils used. For the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E placement I go off any statements regarding craft handing. Not finding anything stating its unstable or even neutral and requires \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, so I assume the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E is slightly ahead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E giving positive static stability in the real thing. Individually parts may be more or less than the real life section, but overall its very close. It\u0027s hardest to get the fuselage the exact dimensions without using ugly Pparts. So maybe body lift/drag added stability that i\u0027m lacking, or the airfoils. Those are the hardest things to account for. I just don\u0027t want to stray far from the replica look. It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve had a plane have this issue, but proves \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E is a decent simulation when you run in to issues that RL has had to deal with. I tried shortening the elevators slightly and lengthening the outer main wing and it reduced the number 4 fold but its still has the instability. It does get stable above 1.4M and it reverses and rolls left in the high transonic region. Weird thing is if I add exaggerated dihedral to the main wing it still doesn\u0027t resolve the issue. Surprises me how strong the instability is, and how it changes in flight. Just gotta find the right comprise i guess."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Buzz Alderaan","CreatedById":128577,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-23T23:19:52Z","Content":"Hi guys,\n\nHaven\u0027t played KSP  or have been to this forum for that matter in the longest time (.90 days).

So... how do I do that?  \n\nAnyway, my experience thus-far:\n\n- I was able to get quite far with Brikoleur copter tutorial (linked below), with a few key differences: he recommends using \u0027Control Surfaces\u0027 for the blades. This got me problems. I had great success using \u0027Structural Wing Type C\u0027 (the very skinny tri-angle wing) mounted on a \u0027Rotation Servo F-12\u0027 for pitch control, 4 of them on a \u0027EM-64 Heavy Rotor\u0027.\n- Speaking of angle control, I found them to be very delicate, very sensitive. It is still way better to use angle contol rather then Engine Torque for your up-down controls, but you need to adjust the Servo change speed to quite low to make the craft flyable. In my 2 craft, the magic angle seems to be about 13 degrees and change speed less then 30 degrees per second. Below that you don\u0027t get good thrust, above that and the drag on the blades will kill your RPM.\n- The old Werner K. addage still holds: not going up? Add MOAR thrust. I needed 4 EM-64 to get an empty Mk3-style craft to go up at all.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022167629\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5256070703\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/185178-stockdlc-brikoleurs-guide-to-helicopters/\u0026do=embed\u0026comment=3612939\u0026embedComment=3612939\u0026embedDo=findComment\u0022 style=\u0022height:298px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-23T20:28:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2019 08:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by The-Grim-Sleeper**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cratzz","CreatedById":157974,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-30T12:09:14Z","Content":"Celebrating my new pc with a new Mig - [https://youtu.be/apQ5gF_zF44](https://youtu.be/apQ5gF_zF44)"},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-02T17:36:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7/30/2019 at 6:09 AM, Cratzz said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Celebrating my new pc with a new Mig - [https://youtu.be/apQ5gF_zF44](https://youtu.be/apQ5gF_zF44)\n\u003E \n\nYou\u0027re right: The frame rate recorded was very good. ![\u0026)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png \u0022\u0026)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"ephemer3al","CreatedById":198242,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-01T11:18:18Z","Content":"\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/CdhY8wRDH18?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**[https://kerbalx.com/lasali3/Contour-III](https://kerbalx.com/lasali3/Contour-III)**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-02T08:39:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2019 08:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by ephemer3al**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mouhand","CreatedById":129451,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-06T16:44:08Z","Content":"![jeTY6ct.png](https://i.imgur.com/jeTY6ct.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"lucho","CreatedById":12856,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-12T11:47:02Z","Content":"ok, I\u0027m reviving an old thread, hope it\u0027s not a too serious faux pas\n\nI\u0027m considering installing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E mod..

KSP is not the type of game for which one would risk botching together mods that may or may not work.\n\nIn the end of the day, chasing mods themselves isn\u0027t important. What is important is knowing that the latest version of KSP should not be considered the \u0022default\u0022 version by any means.
