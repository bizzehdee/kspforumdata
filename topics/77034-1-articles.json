I can set up a maneuver node and fiddle with the toggles to get an highly-inclined but I can\u0027t see anything that would help me see what my orbital inclination is.

Simple as that!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn more detail, think of this as a right triangle with the base angle located at the center of Mun, and the base pointing towards Kerbin. The desired inclination is the base angle of the triangle. The base is the original predicted periapsis. The hypotenuse is the new periapsis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for example, if you want to arrive at 25 km altitude and 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination, allow 200 km for Mun radius, then:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20AC = 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPe2 = 225 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPe1 = Pe2*Cos(\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20AC)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E = 39 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubtract 200 km from that, and we get -161 km.
