So make a node, get it to the point where it will be a short enough burn (\u0026lt; 1 minute), then make another node a bit further on the new orbit, etc. If you do it right you\u0027ll get a reasonable projection of where the single long burn will send you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T07:55:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SAI Peregrinus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SAI Peregrinus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDistance is irrelevant.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E600km is the altitude you need your periapsis to dip below to count as suborbital.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T13:46:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed.
