It would be very easy to place anywhere at the KSC. I\u0027ve made a couple Mercury and Gemini statics and added them to my KSC. I also got a few amazing looking statics from ChrisPbacon. I would love a shuttle launch pad to add to my collection of KK statics.\n\nYes it is pretty cool isnt it. This mod is certianly getting bigger.

I would suggest you just do a quick read-through on the Kerbal Konstructs forum page. It\u0027s not too complicated. Of course focus on 1.7 first, but whenever you feel like doing more with the launch pad, the KK forum page will help you. Really appreciate everything you\u0027ve done the last few weeks!

I know dragon has his qualms with these forums but little to no work has been done by dragon in months. I am fully aware he is not obligated to. Don\u0027t misconstrue my tone with arrogance or entitlement. It\u0027s just this project has taken so long to revive because of dragon. Because of delays, because of dragons relationship with the moderators and the ksp community. I guess what I am saying is that you shouldn\u0027t abandon your projects because they are too beautiful hiwever there are better modders and coders in the community and if you are waiting for dragon it\u0027s probably not gonna happen.
