I tried using a lander with a Command Pod Mk 1 but was told that the pod could not handle the data, so I brought the data back to the lab. I would like to avoid transmitting the data as that will result in a loss of much of the data. Is there something else that is can land on Minmus that can handle the data and bring it back to the Space Center?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003EThank you for any help\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ninjawafflesofdoom","CreatedById":126178,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T20:22:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK the mobile lab is the only thing that can store multiple instances of an experiment (other than a Kerbonaut), and none of the capsules allow such a thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you could try to bring the lab back along with the science.
