I already have a rocket plane called the Wyvern and there are 3 of them each launch uses 2 C6-3 engines. It has amazing results for what you would expect out of strapping 2 medium level power rockets to a foam plane. I can post pictures if you want. This next one has 3 engines 2 C6-7 engines and 1 A1/2 with an undetermined fuse time (do rockets that small even use ejection charges? the smallest I have used is a \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E. And it looks a LOT like an Ares V I think somewhere in my subconscious all of my rockets are inspired by Ares rockets. It has 6 fins 4 placed around the center as usual then 2 on the side of the C6-7 rockets opposite the center. Any problems seen here? The top is obviously pointed and all of the engines will be tightly fastened with 30 day stucko tape. The A1/2 is there for the chute only and if it doesn\u0027t have a charge I may have to go to a bigger engine. Names would also be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T23:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMan, I wish my elementary school classes were half as cool as yours... post some pics of your designs! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T00:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is pretty much extra-curricular the only related part to school is the rockets \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I figured I may as well have some fun on my way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigns for the un-named rocket: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yFp9bEeh.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/yFp9bEeh.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWyvern Pi (picture is blurry): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HhaIEqYh.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/HhaIEqYh.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWyvern 3 (currently in the process of getting prepared to be a payload propeller plane): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lArifZSh.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/lArifZSh.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWyvern 2 (A moment of silence, Wyvern 2 collided with a power line while under powered flight): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/18xbUPxh.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/18xbUPxh.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWyvern 1 ( The second plane the first was Wyvern 0 that was a prototype based off of a partially broken plane): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nc6bE67h.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Nc6bE67h.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are all the planes, Wyvern Pi was going to be Wyvern 4 but a collision with the ground caused a damaged wing that was moved to Wyvern Pi/4 because i figured it better to have 3 fully complete planes and 1 kind of damaged one, rather than 2 working and 2 damaged.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T00:25:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn important step in design is deciding what you want to achieve.

Estes motors in the A-E range certainly are. To break 1.5km even in ballistic regime you\u0027d need over 170m/s of delta-V, and at that point drag is going to be significant. These kinds of motors will only give you about 30s of I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E, so it\u0027d be nearly impossible to break 1.5km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are really planning to go that high, you need to go with composite motors. These can have I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E well in excess of 200s. With one of these you can have effective delta-V nearing speed of sound, and that\u0027s going to be enough to give you 2-3km of altitude if drag isn\u0027t too heigh and you get your rocket to fly straight. The composites typically start roughly with the F class. These do cost 2-3 times more than regular motors, and they do require special igniters and launch system, but on the plus side, they aren\u0027t considered high power rockets, so you do not need special kind of licensing. All of the standard precautions apply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is something to work up to gradually, and maybe I\u0027d start with the D and E rockets, maybe even something with an E booster and C primary stage to see how far you can get that.

You can probably expect something similar out of other G motors. Of course, that\u0027s without any payload whatsoever. Reasonably, you could expect about 400m/s out of your rocket. Again, most of that will be eaten up by drag, so in reality the rocket will never get even close to Mach 1, but it should still be enough to get a couple of kilometers of altitude out of it, at least. So yeah, a G motor should do it. It just needs a rocket with a nice, aerodynamic body and good stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that as you scale up the motor, you need to scale up everything else. The amount of clear space for launch, distance between you and the rocket when you launch it, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T03:42:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, a few things I overlooked that my grandfather saw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. this thing is going HIGH in the middle of a city too. It can\u0027t be launched with that much power when it can land in nearly any of 700000 peoples backyards. this means I\u0027m going with 2 C6-7 engines and an A 1/2 like before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will still trump the competition, making it myself gets me another 20 points out of 250 counting bonus marks.

I have to remake the Wyvern launch system completely, it\u0027s an insult to call it a system we find the nearest broken asphalt or rock we can and lean it up. I hope to eventually make 1 system for all rockets that can tilt for planes and go vertical for rockets. For now 2 different systems for the rockets but the alligator clips on a 12 meter wire work pretty good still. Just put one to the back of the cigarette lighter and one to the side and watch er go. I will use dowels for rails and fasten them on wood boards for the launch. For the plane same thing but with a tilted launch at around 30 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all Have for now but since I am using smaller rockets I can get them here and do tests NOW!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T19:22:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENAR regulations recommend 1,000 feet clearance for any F motor launches. 400 feet for the C motors. So yes, if there is limited open space, definitely go smaller. Though, even with a pair of C motors your rocket might cover more ground if it goes off course and knock someone\u0027s window out. So be careful, and do the tests as far away from everything as possible to make sure your rocket flies true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor launch system, take a look at commercial systems. They aren\u0027t expensive, if you want to just buy one, or if you are required or just want to build your own, they might give you some good ideas. All of them effectively consist of a metal rod that can be angled for plane launches, a metal plate at the bottom of the rod to act as the firewall, and a tripod holding all of this fixed on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the electronic launch of multiple motors, what I found to work best is using commercial igniters wired in parallel and taking the wire to the car battery. Unlike the cheap AA battery launchers, the moment you touch wires to the car battery, the igniters will go off, so there is no guessing on when the rocket will take off, and you get as close to simultaneous ignition as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, even with simultaneous ignition I\u0027ve had trouble keeping a multi-motor rocket on a straight path. If you want something reliable, it\u0027s really best to have one motor per stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T22:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe plane had to have two motors for balance but this one is for load. Because its constructed from reinforced pop cans i may fill one and slip it in to show the power of rockets. I don\u0027t think people in the class realize the power these things have. We went through a several page booklet today about how Apollo and other programs like Mercury made some of our tech today possible. A TON of people fell asleep I am the only one with any understanding of rockets. In today\u0027s class a girl talked about that Felix guy and when she explained it said \u0022but he didn\u0027t go high enough to where you are floating in zero gravity\u0022 I could let the gravity and G slide but it was the fact that she didn\u0027t know that orbit was freefall. I know and understand she\u0027s a girl and most girls aren\u0027t interested in that stuff, most people in my school don\u0027t understand mass and weight or the way orbits and transfers work. I though it was common knowledge When I brought it up with my grandfather a few months ago he understood that all and he ended schooling and most information absorbing in 1971 before the end of Apollo.
