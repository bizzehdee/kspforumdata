Launching straight up is technically simpler, has\u00A0lower drag (because you increase altitude faster than with a proper gravity turn), and has much lower control requirements. You can achieve higher speeds faster, which helps with oberth. There is almost always a small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E penalty to launching straight up (because your gravity losses never end until you cross the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E boundary), but that penalty can be countered by, for example, not needing a fairing for your payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) You will find that, as you burn to leave Kerbin, your (constantly changing) projected orbit\u00A0always encounters the Mun \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Efrom the back\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, first. It always takes a little more of a burn to get an encounter that goes around the front. However, there is a name for a trajectory that encounters the Mun from the front. It\u0027s called a \u0022free return\u0022 trajectory. If you read about the Apollo missions, for example, you will find that they did it this way. The reason is that if your orbit insertion engines fail, then the rest of your trajectory takes you back very close to the home planet, and you can get home again with just a very small burn. Since KSP engines never fail, this is not really a concern, but it is interesting for historical and IRL reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) One interesting fact often makes a difference, here. If you are prograde orbiting a planet beyond Kerbin, and you want to come home, then your burn point is always in the dark, and usually has no comm link with Kerbin. Similarly with a moon, the burn point for a retrograde orbit will never have LOS comms with Kerbin (orientation with the Sun is random). So, having solar power is sometimes important (especially for ion drives), and having comms and control is sometimes important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-16T23:39:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2020 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-17T14:09:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223839192\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196343\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221597593340\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150391\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Crixomix\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, Crixomix said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey all.
