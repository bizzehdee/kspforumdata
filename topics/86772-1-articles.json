The only real visible gameplay change is the addition of the Admin building to KSC, where you can choose to convert some amount of rep, science, or money to one of the other currencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, there are the difficulty options you only see on the pop-up where you create a new game, name it, pick your flag, etc. Fiddling with these options alters how much science, cash, and rep you get compared to the default values, plus you can handicap yourself by disallowing reverts, quicksaves, etc. But once these options are set, you\u0027re stuck with them. They just define the rules of the game, not how you play the game. That\u0027s still the same as before, only with the addition of the Admin building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not seeing any contracts at the start of the game, you can do several things. Trash that game and start another, making sure you actually selected career and not science. The science game is the same as 0.23.5, where there\u0027s only science, no money or contracts. If you\u0027re sure you\u0027ve got a full career game, then you can time warp briefly at the main KSC screen and then check Mission Control again. Usually the initial 4 contracts will have appeared by then (sometimes it takes them a bit to get going).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also hear a lack of contracts is sometimes a problem with 1 or more of the non-Windows operating systems, but there seems to be a workaround for that. I\u0027m just not familiar with it because I have Windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T12:12:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a problem with no contracts apearing to, but that got fixed after I updated my mods.
