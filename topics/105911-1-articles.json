I have about 250 hours in KSP says my counter here, and all I flew through was the \u0022soup\u0022 Squad did as the \u0022air-model\u0022. Yeah, pretty much flying like a dragon ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) But now, well I made it to the mun and into kerbol-orbit and back, but it just doesn\u0027t feel right to me. It\u0027s as if I lost half of my tail or something (....)\n\n Who else is with me and has to learn half of the game a second time? The new airmodel is great, but it is currently very challenging in a bad way(at least for me).

I played near 1000 hours since 2013 I think. First flights on KSP 1.0 were quite messy but even if I used Mechjeb to define maneuvers a lot until now, I\u0027m so used to maneuvers and procedures that I was able to get to Mun and back without patching conic (took quite a few tries because of delta V reading missing but since I played sandbox for so long, it was quite satisfying to get tihngs right without any assistance). It\u0027s true it feels like learning a lot again but it feels more natural than previous air model too. For now I\u0027m getting to mun and back in career mode and the difficulty don\u0027t bother me (at least there IS a risk something may turn ugly) : getting smart solutions (or dumb ones) to technical problems is, for me, KSP\u0027s most fun part."},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T07:35:42Z","Content":"I never tried FAR.

It really doesn\u0027t help that early career mode basically forces you to build long thin rockets without access to wings or fins. No matter if I went into the gravity turn steep or shallow I would always flip out at basically the same elapsed time. Then it clicked that I was going transonic at that time, and it all totally made sense. It still wasn\u0027t easy to re-learn everything, but from then on it was so cool to know that it really is more realistic. Since then I have flown some basic career path planes, which are now such a dream to fly. Previously I always hated planes, but I think I might be a convert with the new atmosphere. Overall, after some rough times, I think this is going to be great and really wish I had tried FAR earlier."},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T09:09:15Z","Content":"Oh yeah, I struggled with this, you have to let go of your preconceptions, as an example, I was struggling to get to orbit, as I was thinking \u0022well I\u0027m practically horizontal at 25k - 30k this is never going to reach orbit\u0022 and reverting my flights, but actually it works. \n\nThe other thing is learning to not take off with any more than 1.5 twr, and figuring out the point where it\u0027s OK to open up the throttle (not quite there yet, I\u0027m getting 3700-4000 dv to orbit, so I know I can do better)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T09:19:57Z","Content":"I switched over to NEAR in .90.
