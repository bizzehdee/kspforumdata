Putting together the commsat formations is both challenging and enjoyable. One thing kinda bugged me, though, and that was that even in the event that I managed to put a satellite in an -absolutely perfect- orbit, if I ever needed to \u0022fly\u0022 the vessel to re-point a dish, for example, the orbit would shift and lead to (eventual) gaps in communication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am obsessive-compulsive by nature, and this needs attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, OrbitSnap was born. The (imagined) design of OrbitSnap is that once you get a vessel into a \u0022close enough\u0022 orbit to one of a set of previously defined orbits, the addon will \u0022snap\u0022 the orbit to the defined orbit, and therefore eliminate any (tiny) perturbations that may have been inflicted as you adjusted your antennas. Depending on the strength of the \u0022snap\u0022, the addon could also be used to correct orbits upon placement, instead of requiring one to spend time at 1% thrust making minute corrections (even the RemoteTech tutorial suggests save editing as an alternative to these micro-adjustments).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t made a binary build, as the code is currently quite rudimentary. There is currently only one defined orbit (the suggested orbit in the RemoteTech tutorial), and it\u0027s defined in code as opposed to a config file or (ideally) a GUI. Also, the \u0022strength\u0022 of the snap is not configurable currently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m perfectly capable of doing much of this on my own (writing C# code is my day job), I am not at all experienced with Unity or KSP modding. I am putting this out there for others that might be interested in contributing and asking for help on some aspects, chiefly the GUI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe code is hosted on GitHub, at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/godefroi/OrbitSnap\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/godefroi/OrbitSnap\u003C/a\u003E.
