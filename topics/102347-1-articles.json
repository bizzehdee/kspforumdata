Putting together the commsat formations is both challenging and enjoyable. One thing kinda bugged me, though, and that was that even in the event that I managed to put a satellite in an -absolutely perfect- orbit, if I ever needed to \u0022fly\u0022 the vessel to re-point a dish, for example, the orbit would shift and lead to (eventual) gaps in communication.\n\nI am obsessive-compulsive by nature, and this needs attention.\n\nTherefore, OrbitSnap was born. The (imagined) design of OrbitSnap is that once you get a vessel into a \u0022close enough\u0022 orbit to one of a set of previously defined orbits, the addon will \u0022snap\u0022 the orbit to the defined orbit, and therefore eliminate any (tiny) perturbations that may have been inflicted as you adjusted your antennas. Depending on the strength of the \u0022snap\u0022, the addon could also be used to correct orbits upon placement, instead of requiring one to spend time at 1% thrust making minute corrections (even the RemoteTech tutorial suggests save editing as an alternative to these micro-adjustments).\n\nI haven\u0027t made a binary build, as the code is currently quite rudimentary. There is currently only one defined orbit (the suggested orbit in the RemoteTech tutorial), and it\u0027s defined in code as opposed to a config file or (ideally) a GUI. Also, the \u0022strength\u0022 of the snap is not configurable currently.\n\nWhile I\u0027m perfectly capable of doing much of this on my own (writing C# code is my day job), I am not at all experienced with Unity or KSP modding. I am putting this out there for others that might be interested in contributing and asking for help on some aspects, chiefly the GUI.\n\nThe code is hosted on GitHub, at [https://github.com/godefroi/OrbitSnap](https://github.com/godefroi/OrbitSnap). I\u0027m also very open to suggestions, if there are any."},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T23:47:19Z","Content":"Very interesting...This problem has also bugged me for a long time...Not to the point where I get loss of comms or holes in the network, but it has peaked my OCD when, if after an hour of fiddling, I DO get a perfect orbit, it never lasts long, whether I simply rotate the craft, or even just leave it alone for several (Kerbin) days...\n\nIf you DO make a mod of this, it wont be RemoteTech dependent, I assume?....I would really like something I could use on a 12-24 Kerbal GPS (Figaro) constellation as well..."},{"CreatedByName":"BrutalRIP","CreatedById":59065,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T01:42:00Z","Content":"This was the only reason i stopped using remote tech.This would get me using it again!"},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T02:35:49Z","Content":"No, there\u0027s nothing RemoteTech specific about it.

That means, if you only want to snap the semi-major axis (which defines orbital period), you can do that. The mod doesn\u0027t help you with the math, though, you have to specify the semi-major axis.\n\nThere\u0027s also a bugfix in that it doesn\u0027t re-snap all snapped vessels every time it processes them (which is about once every two seconds). No real problem with that, but it\u0027s unnecessary work.\n\nFurther, you now get a message when it snaps an orbit, so you know it actually worked."},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T17:56:11Z","Content":"So, any life left in this mod?  \n\nAny news whether it works OK in 1.0.5?  \n\nHow about at least posting a test release that can be downloaded?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-12T17:59:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2016 05:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue**"}]}
