Using the Stock revert to launch doesn\u0027t reset KCT\u0027s simulation mode stuff because there\u0027s no simple way for it to know you\u0027ve reverted to launch. I believe somewhere it even says you must use the KCT revert for orbital simulations, and if it doesn\u0027t say that somewhere then I\u0027m saying it here. In order for orbital simulations to revert properly, and in order for the timer to reset correctly, you have to use KCT\u0027s reverts. Using the stock revert won\u0027t work for those two things, but shouldn\u0027t break anything else. Using the stock revert to editor is fine since KCT can recognize the scene chang, turn off all the simulation locks, and load the backup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: You\u0027ve got errors in your contracts system and R\u0026amp;D system that are triggering the message.

As for R\u0026amp;D and Contracts being messed up, it\u0027s hard to say since the log doesn\u0027t say what caused the error. There are some errors nearby in the log with Custom Asteroids and CactEye, so it\u0027s possible one of them is causing those errors.

Glad you\u0026#39;re enjoying it so far :) Editing already built vessels is more locked down than normal VAB operation. Generally all you have to do is select the edit option which takes you to the VAB/SPH, then add whatever parts you want and you should see some noticeable changes in the KCT window and an estimate of how long those changes will take to apply. Then select the \u0022Save Edits\u0022 button which will save your changes and eject you back to the space center. The now-edited ships should be in the construction queue (depending on how many changes you make, it should already have some progress completed). You launch them the same way as other KCT vessels: wait for them to finish, roll them out, then launch.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe inventory is a mechanic to promote the creation of reusable craft by reducing build times for parts that are in the inventory. Here\u0026#39;s the basic rundown of how it works: when you recover a craft all the parts are added to the inventory, when building a new craft with those parts they only add about 1/10 of their normal amount to the total time, when you build that new craft the parts are removed from the inventory. The actual mechanics are a bit more complicated, but it boils down to the fact that a craft built entirely out of parts from the inventory takes 1/10 as long to build as a brand new one. Having parts not from the inventory on the craft as well can make that amount jump up a lot since they\u0026#39;re weighted much higher. If you\u0026#39;re interested in the details let me know. I think there\u0026#39;s a few examples buried somewhere in this thread.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you have any other questions I\u0026#39;d love to answer them!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barklight","CreatedById":57723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T03:07:31Z","Content":"\nAwesome, thanks for the intel!
