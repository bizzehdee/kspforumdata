As you only have friction and no trust after shooting this makes sense,\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou could use an gun who only shoot straight up who would be easier to install, downside was that you could only use smart shells with good manoeuverability and it would not work for direct fire so they went for normal guns.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n----\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRam accelerators is something else, its an simple ramjet launched in an tube filled with and oxidizer / fuel mix and the ramjet burn the mixture while flying down the tube.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot an weapon system as I see it, rate of firs would be low, worse you would need time to fill the tube then you had to shoot or vent as the gasses separates, if the tube get to hot you risk that the mix ignite.
