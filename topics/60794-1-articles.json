Do I think it should be as hard as Deadly re-entry, No. Without deadly re-entry I sometimes do what i call screaming re-entrys, this is where I return from another planet with maybe 5000m/s or more speed into a periapsis of 10k. This lands fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith deadly re-entry you always need to think about heat shielding everything on a craft and it gets very ugly sometimes. Now I realise it is a mod and I am not criticizing it, it is very good and I commend the writer but at the moment it is an option not a forced change. With any re-entry being added to stock it needs to be VERY forgiving for the new players. It needs to be almost impossible to burn up when re-entering from Kerbin orbit but still inform the player that, were they to have been going much faster more would have needed to be done. Heat Shielding might also need to work across every object attached to the craft, at least until better aerodynamics are implemented and possibly even then so things like goo containers on the sloped side of a capsule don\u0027t burn up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say add a third poll option of \u0022Yes but make it simple to use and very forgiving\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T10:39:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDeadly Reentry isn\u0027t that hard honestly.

New players sometimes expect orbits to happen once they go above 60k without them adding any sideways motion.

If you have a competently designed ship with shielding in all the proper places anyone can figure out how to land it in 3 tries or so. The problem lies in designing that ship. You need something aerodynamically stable with a large drag to weight ratio and with everything tucked away behind the shield. Designing around these restrictions while still getting everything you want to the ground in 1 piece is the hard part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T13:24:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA better measurement on reentry is the G factor when aerobraking. Faster braking generates more heat. If those forces are over 10G, you are probably coming in at too steep an reentry angle. Such G forces are usually fatal.

I don\u0027t agree with some of the posts that it should be \u0022dumbed down\u0022 or an option. That would be like asking the devs to reduce Kerbin\u0027s gravity so it\u0027s easier for new players to get to the Mun. But the biggest part of KSP is how fun, challenging, and rewarding it was to finally accomplish what you set out to do. KSP has done very well incorporating the core risk factors of space travel and it needs to stay that way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, if the devs added re-entry physics, it would be yet another challenge for the players and something we would all eventually learn to do and it would become second nature. And for interstellar space travel, the only planets you have to worry about are the few with an atmosphere. Upon return, it\u0027s likely that Squad would incorporate the heat shield as a freebie to every command module and all you had to worry about was \u0022pointing the big side retrograde\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it all boils back down to DESIGN.
