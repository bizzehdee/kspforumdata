Personally, I\u0027ve used parachutes on Duna and Laythe landings, as both have atmospheres.. Also, for parachutes to work, they have to be manually activated, typically by pressing space to activate the stage they\u0027re currently in. Are you making sure that the stage of your planetary parachute is somewhere it won\u0027t cause problems?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Companion","CreatedById":46415,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T15:12:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efixed, thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
