I didn\u0027t get to binding it to action groups but I did it in the right click menu and it didn\u0027t do anything. In the video that the KAX Dev made about it, he used action groups to treat his hover mode as the collective and the throttle as main engine throttle. Now I\u0027ll admit I don\u0027t know helicopters well, but I do know that he throttled up and lifted high off the ground then turned on hover mode and it leveled off and gave control of the altitude, but mine doesn\u0027t, it\u0027s still completely controlled by throttle. D:\n\nI\u0027ll try action groups and let you know how it goes.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n-Slab\n\nEDIT: Ok, I added action groups for toggle hover, and decrease/increase hover altitude and it had no effect at all. I looked at the Right-click menu and the buttons are changing the hover height number, but it\u0027s not having any effect. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T21:55:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 09:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SlabGizor117**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T16:20:31Z","Content":"If you are looking for help with a particular mod the best place to ask is in that mod\u0027s thread.\n\n[KAX is here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76668-0-90-Kerbal-Aircraft-Expansion-%28KAX%29-v2-3-4)"},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T19:36:07Z","Content":"Thank you, I already did, I figured I\u0027d try other places as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Jesusthebird","CreatedById":176735,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-15T04:52:49Z","Content":"Spoiler\n\nBump.
