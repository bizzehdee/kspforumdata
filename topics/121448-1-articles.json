The shuttle is propelled by a Rockomax brand \u0022Mainsail\u0022 engine and has four backup LVT-45 \u0022Swivel Engines\u0022. Two fuel cell clusters are use to power the ship\u0027s electronics. With enough space to fit four Kerbals on a magical journey, you can launch small satellites to building large scale space stations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload Shuttle Mk 5 V3 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/945t3vm8n557jn6/Shuttle%20Mk%205%20V3.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHERE\u003C/a\u003E!

Once you hit 10 kilometers, SLOWLY turn over to a forty five degree angle and keep that pitch until you run out of fuel in the first booster stage. Once you separate you will have to pitch downward as the engines equalize in force. Once here you will want to burn towards you desired altitude. You \u003Cstrong\u003EMUST\u003C/strong\u003E, I repeat \u003Cstrong\u003EMUST\u003C/strong\u003E ditch you second booster here as the shuttle will not be balanced (hopefully not in the future). Don\u0027t worry though, the shuttle has enough fuel to take you places. After you make a burn into LKO, you can switch back to second booster stage and use its reaming fuel to land in with parachutes in the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOfficial names for the shuttle are based off exploration ships (like the real shuttles):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdventure\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEagle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEndurance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResolution\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENova\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVote in the poll for the best name!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, send suggestions for missions for the shuttle because I\u0027m too lazy to make any. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T00:49:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice!
