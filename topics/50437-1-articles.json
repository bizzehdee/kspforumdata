I\u0027ve never been to Duna (except an ion probe before career mode) and I\u0027m interested in any mistakes or oversights I might have made. This will be an expensive mission risking the lives of 3 kerbals and take longer then the rest of my program combined, so I want to get it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplete plan\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53159-Science-leads-to-wonderful-things?p=727072\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post727072\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53159-Science-leads-to-wonderful-things?p=727072\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post727072\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust the plan slides\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/wxQeU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/wxQeU\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thought is whether I am going too far with the command pod swapping between landers. While the command pod(s) will need to be seperated and returned anyway it might be safer if both landers have their own pod. It would provide a rescue option if something goes wrong on Ike (use the Duna lander as a rescue vehicle) and further my attempts to ensure that science is preserved at each step (the Ike surface samples would be preserved even if the Duna lander crashed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother risk is if the fuel stack on the ship (or the lander on each end) is too unstable - I only have regular sized docking ports and while I think they should be fine during the ejection burn (I can burn at 50% or 25% thrust to reduce G forces) the aerobrake at Duna seems like it might stress the craft too much. An alternative is too pack enough fuel for a thrust only capture at Duna (I know I can do it even at low thrust because I\u0027ve done a thrust only capture with an ion engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a note about tech tree - I don\u0027t want any tech tree spoilers about where specific parts are. I have researched everything up until the column where nuclear engines are. It\u0027s basically a straight line, everything on the left is researched, everything on the right (nuclear engines and beyond) is not researched. I will be making at least 600 science before the Duna mission window to unlock nuclear engines and that tech in the same column that gives you seismic sensors and the last antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kulebron","CreatedById":80231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T20:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need 2000-2100 m/s for the lander, because apart from getting back into orbit you\u0027ll need to rendezvous, and before that to deorbit, soft land (can easily cost 200 m/s even with parachutes) and break to save parachutes too.

The Duna landing is the biggest unknown with the least margin for error in this mission - if the parachutes or engines aren\u0027t enough, or something breaks, the kerbal will fall to his death. I could do a completely unmanned mission first, but that would take almost half a year from my program. Since parachutes can be repacked in space and carrying the fuel one way in my nuclear cargo ship is relatively cheap I figured I wasn\u0027t losing much to greatly improve safety.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T21:22:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a very ambitious plan you have going there; I hope you can pull it off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the only thing I\u0027ll caution you about is to make sure your transfer stage has plenty of juice.
