Pressurized tanks aren\u0027t actually that heavy compared to the alternative, which is a solid-fuel motor casing designed to withstand chamber pressures of 100 bars or higher with a very high safety margin. Plus, the vehicle will undergo very high accelerations compared to a launch vehicle, and experience very high aerodynamic loading, which means that the structure is heavy anyway.

The main issue is that tankage for gaseous fuels is very heavy and takes up a lot of space. I doubt a GOX design would ever be used for a flyable vehicle. More likely oxidizers are nitrous oxide, which is relatively easy to work with and is used for most amateur hybrid rockets, or LOX if someone really needs the extra isp. Another potential oxidizer is hydrogen peroxide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor fuels, I know ethanol and methanol are common.
