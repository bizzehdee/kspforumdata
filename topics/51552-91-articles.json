Did a quick skim/search through the thread and didn\u0027t find a similar problem... First off, I have Kethane, KAS, Station Science, Karzmit Life Support, ScanSat, MechJeb 2, and finally remotetech 2. After launching a satellite into proper orbit, and getting everything settle, when I go back to the VAB, I\u0027m unable to click anything. the background is still in motion, the different pods look clickable(though they\u0027re not), I\u0027m not able to exit the VAB, start a new rocket, or load one... Has anyone had this issue before? I\u0027ve tried troubleshooting myself by removing some of the mods and see if they reacted different, however remotetech is the only one that seems to cause the issue...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI appreciate the answer in advance, and apologize if this has indeed already been covered.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darkshot117","CreatedById":62792,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T09:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, I\u0027m curious if there is any features planned for the flight computer with regards to scheduling action commands like activating antennas? I\u0027ve run into the issue where I\u0027d like to send a probe to Eve, and it would be awesome to be able to use an aerocapture operation. Unfortunately, even behind a heat shield, my antennas get torn up by the atmosphere. I\u0027m forced to keep the antenna open at all times or else I\u0027ll lose contact with the probe, so if I had a way to tell the probe to close its antennas for a certain length of time, that could be a really useful feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could also be applied generically to action groups such as temporarily disabling solar panels and things like that. So this way you could put your probe into a mode where it simply runs on batteries for a time (such as during reentry or aerobraking), until the program tells it to reopen its solar panels. Of course you run the risk of running out of battery before the timer comes up, but that just means you need to plan ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys, love the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lyndonguitar","CreatedById":61194,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T12:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022QF5690\u0022 data-cite=\u0022QF5690\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi!\u003Cp\u003EToday I installed Remote Tech 2 last version (v1.3.3) and started deploying my satellite network.

(Example, for 4 satellites : the satellite carrier system orbital period would be of 4h30 with a 2868km apoapsis) when you near the apoapsis, release the first satellite, switch to it and circularise your geosynchronous orbit with it. Then, when the \u0027carrier\u0027 has made another orbit, release the second satellite, and circularise with it - then repeat the previous step for the remaining two satellites. - basically, this system allows to release the satellites with a proper spacing between your satellites.
