But it\u0027s too heavy for the chutes you used, not for reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built an exact replica (from the pic you uploaded), had it in a circular orbit at 88.5 Km from Kerbin. It is even heavier because I let all fuel with those tanks (while the pic shows your being at half fuel). Then performed the reentry this way:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- burned retrograde to aim at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, periapsis 50Km (yes, that high);\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- turned attitude to normal (yes, it seems contrary to experience, however works). Reason it works, it exposes more on the ship surface to drag, so depleting more kinetic energy (lowers the ballistic coefficient).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- kept the ship rolling to distribute the heat on all sides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- turned attitude to retrograde when components on the ship sides started to raise temperature too high (that was at 50 Km altitude, speed was decreasing but still about 2300 m/s).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- started burning retrograde at full throttle when lower than 40 Km (probably unnneded to decrease speed, but intent was to land without fuel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- opened those drogue chutes when turned white, and then the Mk16 chute (had to modify the staging to have that sequence).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven with all chutes opened, and the engine at full throttle, final speed still was 16 m/s.
