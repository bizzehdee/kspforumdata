Anyone concerned with privacy should probably not use Gmail or Hotmail and run their own email server, oh and don\u0027t use any google/andoid programs or use Facebook etc etc etc.... Or better yet, if you\u0027re that concerned, just never connect your computer to the internet, problem solved as that\u0027s the only way to ensure 100% privacy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrivers for my graphics card and everything work perfectly and I love having Cortana on my PC because it\u0027s been very handy to have on my phone. I for one won\u0027t be going back to previous versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for DVD playing, I\u0027ve always used VLC because it loads fast, it\u0027s lightweight and free. Then again, I can\u0027t remember the last time I watched a DVD even though I own hundreds. My PC build has a bluray drive but I never bothered to plug it in. Between Netflix and other digital media, there no need for discs anymore. In fact, I\u0027m going to be hooking up an HDMI input to start capturing the movies I bought through my cable provider too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
