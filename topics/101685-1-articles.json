Reentry is working because the parts take and orange glow just no flames. I\u0027m using deadly renetry and things explode.\n\nI did a search on this and I saw that the issue is most likely associated with using -force-opengl. There were 2 suggestions to fix this. -force-d3d9 and -force-d3d11. I\u0027ve tried both and neither work. I have deleted and reinstalled the game but the effecst haven\u0027t come back.\n\nHow would I disable -force-opengl and return to the normal launch setting?\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"GreenWolf","CreatedById":65798,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T17:06:48Z","Content":"Check your graphics settings.
