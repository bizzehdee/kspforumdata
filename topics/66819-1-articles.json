I first started off when my friend bought the game on version 1.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E |______________________| (this arrow is getting pretty messy) and stuck to that version because he forgot his password/account (ultra facepalm). At first, I was having trouble with getting into orbit. I remember my first Mun mission: waiting for the Mun to get above KSC and launching straight for it (it failed). I then made some satelites at 60 km orbits (I thought that 60km is the minimum) and was very prud of them. Then I actually got bored of the game because I didn\u0027t know how to do anything. I started watcing videos. I somehow managed to land on the Mun but forgot to put parachutes, so I sent a rescue craft. But they had a 90 eccentricity and I had no idea how to fix that. So I crashed both spacecraft. Then I stopped playing and focused on watching videos. This went on for some months and when I finally came back to the game, the first mission I did was Apollo style (2 kerbals landing and one orbiting; docking part was tricky and when I got back to Kerbin I decided to keep the lander and landed it with the orbiter capsule still attached to it via docking port). And then Christmas came, my mother gave me her credit card and I bought KSP. On career mode I landed on the Mun on my 4th mission (at most 4 hours in). I have now landed on Duna, Ike, Eve\u0027s moon, the moon with the kraken on (I am terrible with names) and returned from all of them. I also have a rover on Eve. I have a space station up in orbit (it\u0027s ugly, like REALLY ugly, but it has parts docked and it has solar panels and a lab, so it\u0027s a space station) and I have made 3 succcessful SSTOs (the first one crashed very close to KSC because I forgot to pump fuel to the centre tanks to shift the center of mass), with one of them successfully docked on the station and returned. I have some very simple mods: procedural faerings (which I don\u0027t use anymore), the camera mod (I don\u0027t use this one either) and Kethane ( which I never got around to using). I think the only kerbal I lost was in the SSTO accident. But I have stopped playing KSP for now because of the upcoming patch. I don\u0027t want to mess with my save files and I don\u0027t want to do something epic just yet, so I\u0027ll get a new save file when the next version comes out (One thing I noticed: youtubers progress REALLY slowly through the tech tree, I found myself getting through 10 episodes worth of science gathering and tech tree advancement with just one sitting).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E P.S.

And youtubers progress through the tech tree slowly because of all the editing they have to do. If you hadn\u0027t noticed those videos are at most about 20mins long, your first flight (If you can call sitting a pod on the launchpad a flight) is maybe 5 minutes tops (If you explore KSC and then head for the shore) and that gets you the first couple of tiers. I\u0027ve done 5 missions and I\u0027m already up to the 300 point tier (Tier 7 according to the Wiki) and I\u0027ve only unlocked the next tier after completely unlocking the previous one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaelath","CreatedById":106084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T12:06:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi!
