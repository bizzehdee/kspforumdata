First off, I am not a total noob to the science of rocketry,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will say, that I am rather bad it deep space flights, and rocket design. I typically just have the classic taper rockets, with a lander inside a fairing at the top. Some of these suckers get MASSIVE. But as a result of my inability to design rockets, I actually have yet to send a manned spacecraft (or any for that matter) to do anything in far out planets, such as Jool. The closest I have gotten is Jool orbit. Does anybody have some suggestions on how I could improve my rocket design skills?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T23:52:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCryova,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A02 threads:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128838-how-to-build-a-rocket-ship-for-a-mission/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/122722-how-to-mathematically-design-stages/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you \u0022smell what the Rock is cookin\u0027\u0022 in these two threads, you should be able to design highly- efficient missions with no problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest,\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Slashy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T23:52:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhotos and/or craft files would help. :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T00:02:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime spent on the forum looking at other people\u0027s designs and tutorials ^^\u00A0is always good, watching youtubes can help too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure what your views on mods are, but having something like MechJeb or Kerbal Engineer to crunch the numbers and then compare them \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eto the deltaV map\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0is a good way of making sure that (at least on paper) your craft has enough oomph (technical term) to make the transfer and the lander has enough to land/return to orbit etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the interplanetary transfers these two tools;\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0are great for helping you get the right transfer window so you don\u0027t need an absolute monster to get places. \u00A0It\u0027s also strangely rewarding, and good transfer practice, to experiment with just how far you can go with very small light-weight craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodari","CreatedById":157578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T00:03:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 Watch Scott Manley or some of the other people on Youtube and see how they design theirs.\u00A0 Don\u0027t need to copy them exactly, but at least see how they approach the different problems and get some ideas from that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 Start from the end of your mission and figure out what you need for that, then work your way backwards through each stage from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0 If you haven\u0027t already done so, learn to dock.\u00A0 There\u0027s only so much you can carry up in one launch, but being able to dock or refuel will let you do a lot more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.\u00A0 There\u0027s two ways you can make your rockets bigger, building up or building out.\u00A0 Experiment with both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.\u00A0 If your first attempt doesn\u0027t work, at least figure out WHY and learn from that.\u00A0 Use what you learned to make your next one better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for more specific suggestions, post what you\u0027ve tried so far and whatever specific problems you\u0027re running into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T00:17:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, in addition...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The above tutorials teach you how to design efficient rockets and the stages that comprise them, but there is another technique that helps you even more than that: Orbital assembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Nobody says that you *have* to launch your entire Jool mission in one go.
