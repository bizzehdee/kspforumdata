Why? In real life, escaping gas, imperfect vacuum in the vicinity of a planet, tidal effects, and a number of other things can exert an off-center force on a vehicle. But I don\\\u0027t believe KSP simulates any of those things, so what\\\u0027s causing it in the game? For that matter, how come these objects always seem to spin gradually? Shouldn\\\u0027t the rotation be either speeding up or entirely absent? There\\\u0027s the reaction, but where\\\u0027s the force? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Oops!

Any other rotation is, yes, a bug caused by some other things. The ones Cykyrios describes, I believe, are the effect of the ASAS module affecting other ships in the vicinity as well as your own.

While practicing rendezvous I used ASAS (which it seems may be a factor?) to stabilize one ship, and it stayed that way for a while, then I hopped to the other.
