It seems fairly obvious to me. We want to have our cake and eat it! It\u0027s all about compromise and fitting the included features/challenges etc to the game. I could certainly suggest an excellent ground based telescope setup, where you have kerbals looking across the system through a mini-game style telescope, and performing analysis on planets to determine the values for diameter, gravity, atmosphere, escape velocity etc, but such an addition would not fit in with the feel of the game IMO, and so an alternate suggestion of using a probe - something that is already available in game, and fits in with the launching rockets theme of KSP - whilst not entirely realistic does meet a compromise between realism and game theme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt honestly doesn\u0027t really matter to me whether this specific feature is included but KSP needs more to do and this is certainly a simple addition that would fit that criteria!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T20:16:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Atoning Unifex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Atoning Unifex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve looked back at your comments and see nothing that really refers to bad game design.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost #6 in this thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LethalDose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LethalDose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf the gravity parameters are identical between games, the OP\u0027s proposed system only serves to obscure information from players, which is not good game play/design.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought I had stated this more times, but /shrug.
