When did you have problems with them, during reentry or launch? Or both?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022damerell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022damerell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOK. This is a Mk I \u002B chute re-entering from an 80km orbit by lowering periapsis to 20km, as you suggested. MechJeb is flying it surface retrograde; the chute is as well protected by the capsule as possible. The chute is specced for the maximum vessel mass RealChute will allow in this size; it weighs 200kg with a skin thermal mass of 20kg, about 1/3-1/4 that of the capsule.\u003Cp\u003EAt 60km, the skin temperature of the chute is 693K. Its overall temperature is 363K. Conductive: -1.1. Convective: 61.62. Radiative: -574. Int: 377. The capsule\u0027s skin temperature is circa 295K, internal 290K.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 50km the capsule is at 328K skin, 313K internal. The chute has risen to 988K skin temperature, 555K internal. Flux: -3.6, 193, -2428, 479.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E40km: capsule, 407K, 371K. Chute: 1239K, 757K. Chute flux: -5.7, 531, -6535, 537.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 32km the chute explodes. The capsule is now at 493K skin, 435 internal. Ablation has begun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe capsule\u0027s skin temperature does not exceed 577K during the rest of the descent, with 75% Ablative Shielding left at impact. Everything worked as expected, except that as far as I can make out the chute suffers massive skin heating from the airstream it isn\u0027t in, and that destroys it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just read the scored-out text in steve\u0027s post above. I\u0027ll manually install the most recent FAR, DRE, FlightIntegrator and report back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect the issue is caused by FAR. Most likely it\u0027s affecting stock occlusion of parts. DRE changes how convective heating affects parts but it doesn\u0027t change when convection occurs. It relies on the stock code to tell it that something is or is not experiencing convective heating. That part\u0027s not under my control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ll have to look at enhancing its survivability, but that has to be done carefully so it doesn\u0027t become impervious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frimi_2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Frimi_2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOkay so far so good. Forget that thing with the decimal places. It\u0027s just the teperature mod that doesn\u0027t round up the numbers....\u003Cp\u003EBesides shielding from raiation does make sense after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint 1: Exploding Jebs, the casings have a thermal mass of 0. I wasn\u0027t able to confirm that is the reason it explodes every time because I can\u0027t find the value to edit but I think this might be it. If I understand your coding correctly you calculate the thermal mass as a factor in the overheating limit. Then it makes perfecly sense that it explode instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s unlikely to have thermal mass of 0 unless it had mass 0. It\u0027s probably just so low that it\u0027s not registering in whatever you\u0027re using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts (skin) thermal mass is probably something like (back of envelope calculation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.0008 (based on its part mass of 10 grams. Yes, that\u0027s right. The case weighs 10 grams). I\u0027ll try giving it a skinThermalMassMultiplier of 100. That should effectively give it the thermal mass of a 1 kilogram object. We\u0027ll see if that helps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint 2: Exploding parts in the upper atmosphere fairing independed explosions. Here also helped turn off the radiation. If turned on after gaining some distance to kerben they survive strangely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe explodings parts (illuminator, landing struts, solar panels have a thermal mass of 0.12 maybe it would make sense to tweak this value a little?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably. Their base thermal mass is actually 10x higher but it\u0027s their skinThermalMass that\u0027s low. Given that these are flat thin plates, it doesn\u0027t make sense that they get the same treatment as more voluminous objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut it is kinda odd wy no further explosions happens after gaining some distance. Does Kerben emmit radiation heating?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it does and a substantial amount of it too. IRL, the heat emanating from the Earth has to be accounted for as well, when considering thermal management. Mission planning for future craft utilizing cryogenic fuels have to take that into account as it affects the amount of thermal energy you have to deal with when refrigerating your tanks (for zero-boiloff schemes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Olsson\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Olsson\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere seems to be alot of discussion going on here. \u003Cp\u003EDoes this work well with 1.02 and the stock aerodynamics?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike earlier versions of Deadly Re-entry is the capsule mass offset slightly to create up or downlift if you spin it facing up or down?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most recent edition was designed around the stock aerothermodynamics.
