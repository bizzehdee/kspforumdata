I could imagine for example cosmic rays that slowed as they moved through increasingly variant comovong space relative to their origin, start interacting with gas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-05T01:45:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2015 01:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T02:01:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://sciencetrib.com/2015/12/see-magnified-image-of-the-faintest-galaxy-from-the-early-universe/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sciencetrib.com/2015/12/see-magnified-image-of-the-faintest-galaxy-from-the-early-universe/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother early galaxy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
