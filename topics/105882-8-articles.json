By 20k you should have more than enough convection to cool off. I had Rapiers burning past 38k (see the album posted above) although admittedly, this was on the verge of air-hogging.\n\nAlternatively, you should already be seeing near maximum ISP for your NERVA\u0027s by 30k.

The plane I made yesterday can longer even get on step. So no matter that I should have a 2:1 TWR. The engine never gets there. No now I need 4:1 just to have 1.5:1 at take off.

Sure enough, I did eventually learn how to reach LKO, but sometimes I kept reverting back to what I know about ascents in Orbiter.
