you wouldn\u0027t be using them without knowing about it.\u00A0 But you can always check a copy of the craft in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to make sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a problem like this a long time ago, and it ended up being because I had parts clipped into each other too far, so it set off the game\u0027s collision detection.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mention this has happened before - was it always with mining ships?\u00A0 If so, could be something about the drills.\u00A0 E.g., if they don\u0027t have enough ground clearance they can push your ship off the ground.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne other thing to try - go into the alt-f12 menu and try the various protective cheats, like unbreakable parts and no overheating.\u00A0 If one of these stops the ship from blowing up, that\u0027s a good lead on pinpointing the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you

which version of the game are you running now? The \u0022explode on load\u0022 thing was prevalent in previous versions, but a lot of work has been done on it -- and it really should be mostly fixed now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt mostly happens because you change the \u0022quality\u0022 of the terrain settings between sessions. Changing those terrain settings changes the altitude of the terrain -- the game tries to compensate for the fact that the ground is now at a different altitude, but it doesn\u0027t always succeed. Additionally, landing legs and wheels are a factor. The suspensions/springs on those parts cause issues. If you use other parts instead of landing legs (I like to use structural wing segments), the problem also mostly disappears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
