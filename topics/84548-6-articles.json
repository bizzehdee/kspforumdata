Nitrogen is needed to make amide bonds. So every amino acid needs a nitrogen that\u0027s been liberated from that triple bond. Nitrogen is also needed to make nucleotides. It\u0027s a very very biologically necessary material and its very plentiful, but life can\u0027t use most of it. If the blight organism had an enzyme that could make its own ammonia, nitrate, etc from N2 in the air efficiently it would be a big deal and could have a huge survival bonus. Likely we would want to study this organism and turn it to our own purposes to make fertilizer cheaply. Fungi and bacteria do this for us in the soil and fertilizes plants but slowly and at a huge energy cost usually requiring \u0022free\u0022 sugars from the plant, as the plant cannot do this themselves. What they can\u0027t do we add through fertilizers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the blight organism crowded those fungi and bacteria out out or killed them and kept the liberated nitrogen for themselves and didn\u0027t pass it on or in a form that the plants could use that would be a huge, huge problem. You would see crop failures of many species because of it. Yes, we could still use fertilizers though. Ammonium Nitrate in particular. But, if the blight organism used up all of that or otherwise made it un-available for plants as well again huge problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe organisms in Interstellar probably wouldn\u0027t be using the nitrogen to fuel themselves, such as through respiration, but build as they\u0027d be putting a ton of energy in to breaking that bond. This wouldn\u0027t be the piece of their metabolism that caused the blight, it would be something else maybe related to the fact they could make biologically useful nitrogen compounds on their own. Possibly creating some sort of novel anti-fungal. antibiotic, or herbicide using that part of their metabolism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that isn\u0027t really that absurd as some life on Earth already has a metabolism that can take atmospheric nitrogen and use it, and it\u0027s essential for life but it\u0027s done in a symbiotic way rather than a parasitic or cancerous(?) way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit to add: it\u0027s generally a bad idea to wall off things life can do with chemistry.
