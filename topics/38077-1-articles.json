I always run out of gas in orbit. This is not to say i\u0027ve not made it to the moon, because i\u0027ve made it to the moon and back safely one time. Yes only one time. This one time i made it there and back was because i followed a tutorial word for word on how to get there and back. I have since decided that the next time i make it to the moon and back would be without a step by step tutorial. I just cant do it. Maybe its because i send most of the time playing the game trying to break the physics or build ridiculous planes but eventually i would like to be able to get to the moon and back with out needing to have someone walk me through it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso if anyone has any tips that are not complete walk thrus please post them.

Now that that\u0027s done...do you have any pictures or craft files of your Muncraft? It would help us diagnose problems a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you\u0027re using a rocket (not a spaceplane), the trick is to have sufficient delta-V for the journey. A roundtrip Munshot with landing takes just shy of 8000 m/s of delta-V in aggregate (that\u0027s with a good amount of fudge factor built in), with 4500 of that dedicated solely to getting off of Kerbin. For an eight tonne lander, I find a cluster of seven rockets (6 LV-T30s outboard with a centerline LV-T45) gets me up to orbit with gas to spare. Each engine one has two FL-T800 stacks above it. Put the outboard engines on radial decouplers and run fuel lines from their tanks to the central stack; jettison the outboard engines when their tanks run dry. For the launch, go vertical for the first 10 kilometers (10,000 m), then put your rocket on course 090 at 45 degrees. Adjust that down to about 20 degrees when your altitude reaches 25,000, and then switch over to the map view. When the apoapsis hits 100,000m, kill your engines. Setup a maneuver node at apoapsis to put yourself in an orbit somewhere around 100x100 (doesn\u0027t have to be perfect), aim in the direction indicated by the node (should be around 090 along the horizon - 0 degrees elevation), and fire when the time comes for the amount of time indicated. That\u0027ll get you into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point, target Mun and angle your camera so it\u0027s about 3:30 or so (100 degrees, with zero degrees at the top of the screen). Put a maneuver node at the 6:00 position and add prograde until you get a Mun intercept. You want your Mun periapsis low; preferably around 20,000. Fiddle with it until you get it where you want it. Then once again aim and burn when the time comes. Chances are your lifter stage will still have enough juice in it that you won\u0027t have to jettison it prior to making this burn. If so, use it. If not, use your lander\u0027s gas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027ll should get you to Mun. Only other advice I can give you is that if you go for a landing, quicksave first (F5). You \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill \u003C/strong\u003Emuck it up the first few times you try to land.
