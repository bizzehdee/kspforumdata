Currently it is using Infernal Robotics (and will be updated to their new release this eve ready for a fully functional release woot!) and Firespitter for the EVA activation (this is probably redundant as IR cannot be activated in EVA).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is that I have one animation for the platform game item and then a separate one to cover extending the rail \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 these unpack it. They have to be separate because IR seems to need two separate game objects to work (one to act as an anchor and one as the actuator) and so I have two FSAnimateGenerics (although I will go back to the stock animator). I did try a lot of different hierarchies but to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to get both of these animations to trigger with the same GUI button?

I was really hoping that there would be syntax to allow it in the Config (Not FS specific). I tried tricking it by setting the GUI text the same but just got two buttons with the same text :-/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T03:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, I don\u0027t think you can control multiple Firespitter animations from the same GUI button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may wish to retitle your thread \u0022Triggering multiple animations from the .cfg file \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewith one GUI button\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022, to avoid confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
