This is just the structural materials which make it up though, and likely ignores interior machinery, etc.\n\nAs rocket parts in KSP are roughly 64% of their real-world counterparts, let\u0027s assume that the mass is as well. 210\\*.64 is 134 kilotonnes, or in KSP terms, about **1000 Mainsails** at full throttle. (minus the weight of their fuel)\n\nI still use Mainsails as KSP units of measurements, rather than the new SLS parts.\n\nHowever, in game it is affixed to Kerbin, which is locked into its orbit, meaning that moving it is impossible."}]}
