I didn\u0027t want to mess with the HUD controls, so it was a fortunate accident. See the Start() method in MovieTime.cs and OnRenderImage() in MovieTimeFilter.cs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you would like a bloom that is be object-specific (ie, say an engine exhaust)... It is the reason why I haven\u0027t figured out how to do a thermal camera. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, my latest idea has been to alter each part\u0027s texture to reflect the part\u0027s temperature (using a solid-color texture and color ramp), and then use a shader to blur the rendered image. However, I can\u0027t figure out how to override a part\u0027s texture without overriding all instances of that part (which is what I think TextureReplacer and Firesplitter do). I thought part highlighting might work (ala DangIt), but the highlighting is semi-transparent, too much of the part\u0027s original texture bled through.
