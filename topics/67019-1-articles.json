After I observed my goo containers, I just was bored and starting rotating in the water. For some reason, every time the goo hit the water, a note would play. It sounded like a metal xylophone, and the rotation speed seemed to have something to do with the pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone tell me I am not going crazy here. Build yourself a little ship to get you to the shore with some goo containers, and start spinning. Maybe it is just my sound glitching up, I don\u0027t know. But it seems like too nice of a sound to be a glitch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T08:05:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had similar experiences with boats. I found rotating the camera around that it only happens from certain angles in global space, leading me to think it\u0027s an artifact of the sound engine trying to overlay too many splashes on one another, causing destructive interference on all but a few frequencies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T08:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat high pitch crunchy sound like scratching glass?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI heard that a couple of times but never figured out where it came from.
