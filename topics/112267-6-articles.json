What I am getting at is that IMHO you cannot compare the likes of Arianespace (or ULA for that matter) to companies like SpaceX. Whereas the latter companies are moving into opportunities the market presents, Arianespace and other like them are seemingly virtual appendices to the space agencies, driven by national politics, who tell them where to create value by procurement and production. This was pointed out for instance in the article I quote in an earlier post, where politics dictated that tanks made out of carbon fibres where to be built by a German company, which clearly was not skilled in this kind of carbon fibre product (this kind of production seem to be a strong point of some Italian company). That\u0027s what I am getting at: who gets to build what is not governed by expertise, but rather by lobbyism.
