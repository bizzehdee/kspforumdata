Yes, I\u0027m using control surfaces and gimbal\u0027d engines.\n\n2) Rockets with radial attachment stages suffer from flexibility issues and like to wobble like mad. I don\u0027t have strut connectors yet. Are girder segments actually useful?\n\n3) Is there an optimal number of control surfaces? The AV-R8 greatly increased my stability, but I\u0027m unclear if it\u0027s best to use them in sets of 2, 3, 4, 6 or more.\n\n4) Solid rockets are useful.... when? I have ended up using almost entirely LFO engines. I don\u0027t want to exceed 250-300m/s before ~10km, so I need thrust control; and for higher maneuvers I want the throttle control for orbital maneuvers. My use of SRBs has been limited to stages after 10km but before orbit, or attempts to use them for heavy lifting, but my heavy rockets are highly unstable.\n\n5) How the hell do I get to Mun and back using only LV-T30, LV-T45, and the first three SRBs? \n\n6) I have a bunch of possible contracts for \u0022go to this place on Kerbin and fly below X km\u0022.

Then you can strap a booster like a HybridRocketBooster (provided with SETI thanks to LordAurelius) to the early plane to get to those high altitudes. The HRB is a booster which can be shut off and restarted.\n\nThere are several other biomes around around KSC.

Also its tedious as hell.\n\nYou can sometimes reduce wobble by sliding the gimbal range down to 20% or so.

It\u0027s a *very* radical overhaul. You should not need any mods to play KSP, and I say that as a mod addict ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) They are fun additions when you want them to be, but there are many players who stick to stock and have fun too. As a new player, definitely get to know the game first. You can\u0027t appreciate the changes or options mods offer unless you know what\u0027s there by default, after all.\n\nRegarding your question #4: You can actually throttle SRBs as well. Only in the VAB, before going to the launchpad, so it\u0027s a bit more difficult, but it works. Rightclick the SRBs after attaching and set the thrust limiter.\n\nAlso, don\u0027t be afraid of breaking the sound barrier under 10km. There\u0027s nothing inherently problematic with it - most rockets can go a lot faster at that altitude without increasing your drag losses much. The one thing to watch is whether or not your gravity turn still works out, because rockets with large fins tend to fly straight instead of turning if you go very fast low in the atmosphere. In that case you can try tipping over sooner after launch and more aggressively, or try to steer the turn manually... or use fewer/smaller fins.\n\nThe minimum number of fins you need for universal stability (roll and both lateral axes) is 3, by the way.

I think there are around 15-20 biomes there (it\u0027s even ridiculous).\n\nEarly on, there is several ways to do it. The easlier is the \u0022roller\u0022. Put 2 command pods, batteries, reactions wheel, and science. You can roll sideways until you run out of power. Target science which gets you solar power, so you can go everywhere on KSC.\n\nAnother way to do it is to create a plane core and wheels. Use the Weesley to move. You could even do a double weesley (front and rear) to avoid beeing stuck.\n\nWith all experiments, I think I got around 1000 science for KSC only (maybe more, I don\u0027t remember).\n\nThen for quick and easy science : Build a mini space station wit half an orange tank of fuel and send it to Minmus with a light lander (try getting 1300m/s on the lander to do hops) and a return vehicle. Then alnd in every biome of minmus, do some hops if you can and refuel to the space station. \n\nNext, do the same with Mun. the lander has only to have a bit more fuel to do hops (mine had 2000m/s, capable to visite 3 sites). On that expedition, favor a polar orbit for you space station and pack a full orange tank of fuel.\n\nDon\u0027t be afraid to mess : it\u0027s very easy to send new landers (or upgraded with new science expermients) and more fuel.
