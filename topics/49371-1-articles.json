This drastically lowers the value of lander based missions, and favors direct ascent mission profiles. Is this an intended feature of am I not getting something. I would like to run a legitimate Apollo or ZOND science mission Profile but it seems thats seems useless now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tassyr","CreatedById":42397,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T06:42:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea if this is intentional or not, but it\u0027s effectively crippled my munar\u002B programs as well, as I run Apollo Style. Also as it\u0027s very difficult for me to USE direct ascent ships at this point!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pantlessman","CreatedById":23701,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T07:27:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just did some more futzing around, and I think the intended effect is as follows. By landing more X Kerbals you have X samples taken at any given time. By having 1\u002BX Kerbals in a craft transmitting data, you may increase the total data sent in a transmission period. I will test this tomorrow as I have yet to get a 2 man lander on the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T07:40:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHehe looks like we may need report/sample transmission between pods like we have fuel transmission between tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only remedy for now: transmit, transmit, transmit. I mean, many times while you\u0027re still down there and can acquire these samples repeatedly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
