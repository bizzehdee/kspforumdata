Starting today, everytime I tried to fly my Saturn V. This happens. The camera doesn\u0027t follow the command pod like it used to after ~6000m. \n\n![sl1HUkn.png](http://i.imgur.com/sl1HUkn.png)\n\n![zaT4qdP.png](http://i.imgur.com/zaT4qdP.png)\n\nPlease!

I think all the recent examples of this have been triggered by add-ons. This is the unmodded support section, so I\u0027m going to slide this over for now, and hopefully it\u0027ll get faster attention.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Doughy","CreatedById":147090,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T04:19:59Z","Content":"this is triggered by certain parachutes such as vens stock revamp or that tiny little chute from i think tantares, the side mounted white/beige rectangle thing."},{"CreatedByName":"Tynrael","CreatedById":144990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T12:30:15Z","Content":"This type of effect was also seen in an older version of Kopernicus (fixed now) where the craft would hit an invisible ceiling that disconnected the camera from the craft at a certain height while only displaying a minor speedbump for the craft. Does this happen at the exact same height every time?"}]}
