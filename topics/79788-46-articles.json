There were also errors for some addon that adds clouds, \u0022KSPScienceLibrary\u0022, and RealChutes.\u003Cp\u003ENull reference errors are bad news and can cause the game to behave in extremely unpredictable ways. You have dozens of them here, so it\u0027s no wonder your game eventually slogged down. I would report them to the mods that generated them.

It isn\u0027t a default state, or a \u0022zero\u0022 state, it means the absence of anything at all. When KSP complains about a \u0022null reference\u0022 it means that the game tried to manipulate or read something that does not actually exist. That isn\u0027t really possible, so once the game realizes this thing does not exist, it aborts whatever it was doing at the time, so that it doesn\u0027t try to use the thing again. These aborts can cause jumps in logic that do all sorts of fun and exciting things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe logs for null references are actually Unity (the underlying engine of KSP) complaining, not usually the game itself. Though sometimes, if an addon is coded well, it might intercept null references before they happen and deal with them in some way, to prevent Unity from freaking out. Fine Print does this, and if it does \u0022deal with\u0022 a null reference, it throws a warning with a signature that I made easy to find so I could skim logs quickly.

Since my asteroid catcher wasn\u0027t equipped with a docking port for refueling and I had an expent interplanetary stage somewhere, I\u0027ve RV it with the catcher/asteroid, undocked the claw, used the claw from the asteroid catcher to grab the expent interplanetary stage turned into a tanker, refuel and turn back to grab the asteroid... which now I can\u0027t do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i60.tinypic.com/2z6in15.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222z6in15.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the log\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://mega.co.nz/#!4V9TzLLY!gLpSule_7ts5a4Zh7mJ4UY3P2gsR8pToDOwsAA8X68c\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://mega.co.nz/#!4V9TzLLY!gLpSule_7ts5a4Zh7mJ4UY3P2gsR8pToDOwsAA8X68c\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
