I\u0027m also a big player of FSX (but again, not at full res with tons of add ons) if that helps to define the kind of power I need. I\u0027m of course looking for a durable computer that won\u0027t crash and burn in a year or two. It will be my day to day computer, allowing me to switch between Internet browsing, movie watching, FSX and KSP.
