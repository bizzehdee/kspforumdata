Maybe Kasper or one of the admins can comment.\n\nOver the past month (30 April - 28 May), the average daily user activity (unique user visits) has been 4338 per day. You could multiply that to get the monthly number, but that would include visits on different days by the same users. Over that same time period, 2878 accounts have been registered, an average of 99 per day. There have been 97026 new posts (3346/day average) and 5079 new threads (175/day average).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E AFAIK all our users are human. Except Rainbowtrout, he\u0027s a mudkip. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nThat\u0027s Technicality correct.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Modkip, when I joined, the CG limit was 3. Has it changed to reflect the new users?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) The CG limit was originally 5. It was temporarily changed to 3 just to alleviate possible headache for users who had to make a new account on the forums following the forum crash and subsequent data loss that happened a while back, but it was returned to its original value after that. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think it was increased to provide additional defence against spammers, but I\u0027m not sure.\n\nI just checked and it\u0027s still three posts. Incidentally, there\u0027s approximately 70000 Curious George accounts, and 74000 Trusted accounts (i.e. regular users).\n\nEDIT:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So, I have a couple of questions:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1. When a post is reported, is it looked at right away, or do you wait for posts to be reported multiple times before you look at it?\n\u003E 2. How many reports do you get a day?\n\u003E 3. Of those, how many do not require action and/or are people just reporting posts to be rude?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for your time. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n1. When a post is reported, an email is sent to every moderator. We generally discuss with each other what the appropriate response is, but that is definitely not contingent on getting multiple reports.\n2. Over the last forty-five days, there has been an average of 9 reports per day.\n3. That\u0027s a little harder to get the stats on, but abuse of the report system has been overall not a big issue we\u0027ve had to deal with. The overwhelming majority of reports have been in good faith. Reports that warrant no action do come in more often than malicious ones, but a lot less often than actionable ones.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T22:20:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Supernovy**\n  \nResponding to Mad Rocket Scientist"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T22:25:56Z","Content":"You guys are great, thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T23:39:20Z","Content":"I\u0027ve wondered how decisions to keep open threads that have a lot of rule skirting in their creation works.

Trying to prevent all conflict is just going to annoy people and likely enough aggravate users against the staff in general, which will make our jobs harder, not easier."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T00:02:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E *I\u0027ve wondered how decisions to keep open threads that have a lot of rule skirting in their creation works.
