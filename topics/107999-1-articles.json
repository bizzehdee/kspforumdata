It actually handles really well. It has a slight upwards pitch on its own and it rolls smoothly as well. Yaw is a little bit weak on its own though. It\u0027s actually fairly easy to land if you line up well on the approach, as it can\u0027t really perform any major last second course corrections due to it\u0027s size. Any comments about it or suggestions on how to improve the design are welcome. Also if you want to take it and post pictures I\u0027m fine with that too.\n\nThe main reason I even built this is because I always like recreating the X-15 program and that needs a B-52. And it\u0027s good at carrying air launched rockets because of the cargo bay\u0027s size.\n\nAction Groups\n\n1:Cockpit Lights\n\n2:Cargo Bay Doors\n\n3:Engine Group 1 (Far Left)\n\n4:Engine Group 2 (Middle Left)\n\n5:Engine Group 3 (Middle Right)\n\n6:Engine Group 4 (Far Right)\n\n7:Flaps (These essentially keep the plane from pitching up and enable near level flight without SAS. They do cause an extremely insignificant downward pitch.) \n\n8:Ladder\n\nI have the engines bound to action groups instead of staging so in case of failure or destruction of one group I can switch off the other side to compensate. I\u0027ve actually tested the destruction of an outer engine group and part of the forward wing on one side and after the thrust is balanced out the aircraft is still capable of landing without too much added difficulty.\n\nDownload\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/generalmiller/KSP-B-52](http://kerbalx.com/generalmiller/KSP-B-52)\n\n![Mt8f8gC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Mt8f8gC.jpg)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
