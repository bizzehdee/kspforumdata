Expect that number to go up up UP! Specially since Scott Manley also gave him a \u0022HULLO!\u0022 ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAnd the video is suitably EPIC. The design of the new ship and fighters is amazing. \n\nSpeaking of epic - THAT LAUNCH!! I\u0027ve seen him do that before - but I thought for sure with the new atmospherics and all that he\u0027d have to assemble in orbit! \n\nNOPE!! Once again Macey lobs thousands of tons of CAPITAL SHIP up into stable orbit in ONE FREAKING LAUNCH!!! No MechJeb to help stabilize, doing it all by the seat of his pants \u0022old-school\u0022. \n\nHOW??? Just... HOW!?!?!?! ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif)\n\nThe dude is freaking epic. \n\nHe seemed a bit chagrined at himself that he verbally went \u0022over the top\u0022 with his narration at that point. But considering the accomplishment of getting the Laniakea into orbit, I think there\u0027s NOTHING over-the-top about narration that includes the phrase \u0022...on rocket-fueled wings of fire!\u0022 ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
