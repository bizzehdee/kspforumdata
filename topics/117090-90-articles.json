This -really- sounds like a memory related crash (which there is nothing I can do about).  If you are launching the game with it using more than ~2.6gb, it -will- crash within a few scene changes; that is just KSP being memory limited and the stock memory leaks having fits.\n\nAn easy way to test this -- setup a just stock\u002BSSTU (and dependencies) install, and see if it -still- crashes.  Or, you could post the screenshots while using GCMonitor as blowfish had asked.  Either method should give enough information to tell if it is a memory problem or other.  I\u0027m betting it is a memory problem though; SSTU is a *-large-* mod-pack, and will nearly overload a stock DX9 install all by itself (fine with openGL).\n\nEdit/further info:\n\nFrom your player.log file:\n\n[ ALLOC\\_PROFILER ] used: 110664B | peak: 0B | reserved: 4194304B  \n\nCould not allocate memory: System out of memory!  \n\nTrying to allocate: 2539968B with 16 alignment.

Don\u0027t expect more than that.  Also the fact that I don\u0027t *use* RO means that I am -**not**- the best person to write the patches; I have no personal interest or investment in it, and the work is going to be rough at best.  Additionally the mod is *in active development* -- Things change / break so often that there is no realistic way to keep the patches up to date (unless I had a full-time personal assistant who did nothing but update RO patches).  Perhaps after the mod becomes more stable this might change; but don\u0027t expect that until a while after 1.1 is released and the mod fully updated.\n\nIn short -- don\u0027t expect *-any-* RO support from me.
