I believe (not 100% sure) that it is due to Kerbin and/or its water. Whenever I\u0027m in space I\u0027m fine but during launch I get so much lag. Granted, I don\u0027t have the best PC best there must be a way to conquer it!\n\nHere are my specs: \n\n![Specs.png](http://s11.postimg.org/gpxkqvo9v/Specs.png)\n\nAnd this is my current in-game graphic set-up:\n\n![KSP_setup.png](http://s11.postimg.org/qbr576ffn/KSP_setup.png)\n\nI hope I can get this solved!\n\nThanks,\n\nRex3921\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T14:04:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rex3921**"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:10:53Z","Content":"I can deduce from your specs that you\u0027re running the game on a laptop correct?\n\nThe graphics-card, I guess, seems to be the bottle-neck of your computer because the rest of the specs seem up to snuf.\n\nYou could try to reduce the Anti-Aliasing further. AA is known to take a lot of resources.\n\nIf you get it running better, then you could bump something else up again.\n\nEdit: Oh it may also help to set the resolution to the native resolution of your screen.\n\nIt may seem counter intuitive, but running at a (slightly) lower res than native can actually be slower because the GPU has to re-calculate where which pixel should be drawn.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T13:15:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 01:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by T-Bouw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rex3921","CreatedById":69610,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:16:08Z","Content":"Thanks for the advice T-Bouw.

Because, yeah, in that case: turn off anti-aliasing completely. \n\nFurthermore: let\u0027s differentiate between lag and low frame rate. Which of the two do you have? If it\u0027s the second: try turning off ground scatter completely."},{"CreatedByName":"Rex3921","CreatedById":69610,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:47:59Z","Content":"I\u0027m not 100% but I believe that I have integrated graphics. Turning off AA helped a lot but it\u0027s still a little choppy. It is most likely low frame rate as well. When you say turn off ground scatter is that Scatter Density or Terrain Scatters?"},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:54:28Z","Content":"If you have an integrated graphics card then anything you can do to reduce the load will help significantly. When I play on my laptop (which also has an integrated card) I basically put everything to the minimum and will still get lag with craft that have a moderate amount of parts. That said, turning off AA and Terrain Scatters will probably give you the biggest boost (Scatter Density I believe is only used to determine how much terrain scatter is on the ground). Reducing Shadow Cascades and Render Quality also typically give me a noticeable boost."},{"CreatedByName":"Rex3921","CreatedById":69610,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:03:57Z","Content":"Thank you all so much! I\u0027ve found a good balance of good graphics and frame rate. Hitting 30FPS during launch and 50\u002B FPS in space. Can now play Kerbal once again! I can safely turn this question into answered"}]}
