When I play on my laptop (which also has an integrated card) I basically put everything to the minimum and will still get lag with craft that have a moderate amount of parts. That said, turning off AA and Terrain Scatters will probably give you the biggest boost (Scatter Density I believe is only used to determine how much terrain scatter is on the ground). Reducing Shadow Cascades and Render Quality also typically give me a noticeable boost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rex3921","CreatedById":69610,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:03:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you all so much!
