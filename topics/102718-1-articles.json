It doesn\u0027t carry many crew either. It\u0027s just a great plane to fly in atmosphere like you\u0027d fly a regular large jet. I love flight sims, and flying this thing is a lot of fun if you like to fly planes that handle like modern commercial jets ranging to fighters. What makes this plane special is that it is one of the most balanced planes I\u0027ve ever constructed. By that, I mean that it is incredibly stable when you let it hold its course, and at the same time, it responds to pitch like nothing I\u0027ve ever built. She will pitch up 30 degrees or more from prograde without much effort, right up to about mach-1, but isn\u0027t squirrely or unpredictable in the least. I\u0027d recommend great caution when adjusting pitch with keyboard controls, and for best experience, use an analogue stick. runway landings are a dream. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1SKbpHT.png\u0022 alt=\u00221SKbpHT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Prof. Endwalker","CreatedById":83020,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T12:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks great! I like the arch above the engines.
