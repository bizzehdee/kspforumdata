Making a multi-tank launcher look good is hard.. The core stage is easy its the second stage and fairing that is tricky. I have got a good balance between scale and looks now though I think. It\u0027s hard to keep the lines clean though. I am concerned by its lifting capabilities.. The two landers are very heavy and I have only tested the core stage with boosters. I am using a direct copy of the booster cluster on my Ares 1 and I don\u0027t really want to have to redesign the boosters..\n\n The scale is ace though, it fits perfectly with the aeroshells and MTV parts in the fairing. The only thing that is out of scale is the propulsion stage and the lander aeroshells. I am not too bothered by that though as I didn\u0027t want the landers to be too small. Looking at the real proposed landers they where HUGE! And it\u0027s just not practical to scale everything else from those.\n\n I\u0027m not sure if anyone who follows this thread remembers but I mentioned before I made three sets of aeroshells for the two landers. One from the stock procedural fairings and two from radiators. During intial testing the stock procedural fairings are far far too slippery to slow you down during aerobraking at Duna so you end up having to add chutes or air brakes to it which is crappy.. Luckily using the radiators provides plenty of drag and they can be properly areobraked.\n\n The first one I made is complex with at least three parts to it but it\u0027s wide. It fits perfectly with the Ares V I am making though but is out of scale with the propulsion stage. I made another radiator fairing that is narrower (*you have no idea how much work was involved..*) So it fitted better with the propulsion stage but even still it was slightly out of scale as my two landers are so big. They where also much simpler, read, less cool, ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022), So I am happy to be using the larger more complex aero shells. I just have to make sure I have my latest version of the landers inside them! It\u0027s hard to keep track of all the craft variations. I am also going to release the lander skeletons as they are fantastic and can be used (repacked, re-purposed) for many other missions and cargos. I think I might just release the whole save file with all craft variations and subassemblies so you guys can reall get your hands dirty pulling everything apart. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n Next part is flight tests of the Ares V and then my first orbital construction of the MTV.
