I think that Squad should definetely make this part of the vanilla game. Not only that, I think they should also introduce procedural structural parts. This way if you want to make a big strut, instead of having to place strut upon strut. you can just have one part. This will also ofcourse decrease the part count and increase preformance. Not to mention that you can finally make that one piece to fit together you\u0027re space station perfectly instead of having to pick away at several static parts that all don\u0027t quite fit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I think you should be able to have procedural parts in more unorthodox shapes. Maybe someone wants an octaginal shaped booster, or a square fuel tank. Or maybe you need a very thing long wing with lots of control surfaces like on the U2 spyplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would truely propell KSP towards being a game with endless posibility and borderless design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T12:38:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a fairly long discussion on this a short while back...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51390-Procedural-Parts-%28The-best-way-to-improve-the-game-experience-%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51390-Procedural-Parts-%28The-best-way-to-improve-the-game-experience-%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has its benefits, and its detriments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xrayfishx","CreatedById":76147,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T14:27:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot ninja\u0027d.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T14:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor now I would like to see more proceduraly generated features for the terrain to sorta give more to look at when you get to a planet/moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
