May the sunlight always be upon you!\n\nThis small mod adds a couple new scientific instruments (such as the one pictured here) which do science specifically around the most wondrous body in the Kerbol system. Both of these instruments are based upon instruments currently aboard the [SOHO](http://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/home.html) and [STEREO](http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/) spacecraft. It also adds a few new flags.\n\nTo install\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\n\nLike most other mods, simply download the linked file, unzip it, and\n\ndrop the folder it gives you into Kerbal Space Program\u003EGameData.\n\nNotes:\n\n- **Don\u0027t expect massive things from this mod.** I\u0027m only a high school student with about a couple years of modeling experience as of this time, so I\u0027m not exactly the most proficient. The code is simple, and the textures may leave something to be desired. That said...\n\n- **This project is up for adoption.** I\u0027ve spent too much time working on this and wish to do other things. If there\u0027s anybody out there who feels this project has promise, I will gladly provide all related files, including models, Unity files, Photoshop documents, etc.\n\n- **One of the flags in here may cause some players to become violently angry.** They may also claim that \u0022this mod ruined Kerbal Space Program for them.\u0022 If you have your worries, go into GameData\u003ESolar Science\u003EFlags and delete \u0022Celestia.png.\u0022 It\u0027s merely a flag of the My Little Pony Character, Celestia, raising the sun. There is nothing inherently offensive or illicit about it, but some folks have adverse reactions to My Little Pony.\n\n- **The Source Code, models, and textures are provided.** These are provided in .cs, .fbx, and .png formats, respectively. By the license, you can do anything you please with them as long as you don\u0027t profit and you give credit to me. Preferably, this would amount to mention of \u0022Snoopy 20111.\u0022\n\n- **Remember to Praise the Sun!**\n\n**\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9**\n\n[Download it here](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/611/Solar%20Science)\n\n[![88x31.png](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)\n\nThis work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)\n\nThe source code is provided under Solar Science\u003EPlugins as *SolarExperiment.cs*\n\nThe models and textures for each instrument are also provided under their appropriate folders in FBX and PNG format respectively under Solar Science\u003EParts\u003EScience\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T13:48:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 01:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snoopy 20111**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T00:39:35Z","Content":"Sweet, good job.

The mod adds two instruments (lower and higher tiers of the same basic function) which only function while in orbit over the Sun and within 10,000,000 kilometers of it. The two parts are modeled after the Heliospheric Magnetic Imager and SECCHI Scientific Suite respectively.
