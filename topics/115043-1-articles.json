Call this View 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EView 1 is normally the rear view of your craft and view 2 is normally the side view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom either view you can move the craft up and down and left and right from that viewpoint. It will also seem to move in and out a little for each view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPick a viewpoint and using left-shift/click, click anywhere on the craft to grab it and move it toward the centre of the room Use the shadow of the craft to give you an indication of it\u0027s true position in the room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMove from one viewpoint to the other then move the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor vertical movement, it is better to position the camera at roughly the same height as the craft. Again use view 1 or view 2 to change the height. Again keep an eye on the shadow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing back and fourth between viewpoints you should be able to centre the craft in about 4 moves\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do not use view 1 or view 2 but instead use an angled viewpoint, then your craft will move horizontally according to your viewpoint. Which is why it is better to only use the initial entry window as view 1 and a viewpoint at 90 degrees to it as view 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you use the initial view (View 1) to move the craft left and right and up and down and the SIde view (View 2) to move the craft back and fourth and up and down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T17:42:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple options, which I think have been covered above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERhomphaia has a good idea, since the offset tool only drags one axis at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you grab the whole plane and drag it around, also know that the plane on which the craft moves is affected by the camera orientation. So if you want to move it back, then you have to fiddle with the camera to get it looking perpendicular to how you want the craft to move. This can be tricky when the craft gets way off to the side. Often, the best bet is to orient the camera so it\u0027s \u0022square\u0022 with the walls of the VAB/SPH and move the craft back to the center one axis at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf those don\u0027t work out for you, and you are up for a .craft file edit (as you said), then here\u0027s another way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep a backup copy of your craft, in case of any problems.

I probably gave it far too much fuel, but, with enough air, four J-33 \u0022Wheesley\u0022 engines give it plausible speed, maxing out at 285m/s with the first signs of transsonic drag. Bigger engines and intakes can get a bit crazy.
