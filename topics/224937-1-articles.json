The TLDR is that yes, an existing mod allows you to use specific music for different \u0022scenes\u0022 in KSP and I have used it to import and play the music from KSP2. I absolutely adore it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe post goes into more detail, but the mod does allow for tracks to play based on the celestial body and a craft\u0027s altitude relative to that body to create a somewhat \u0022dynamic\u0022 music experience. tbh I\u0027ve been too busy playing to do this for each planet, but I would be happy to share my playlist file and KSP2 track files with anyone interested in pursuing that further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mod does have a few bugs too - primarily choppy music during loading screens (which may be fixable with some tweaking) and sometimes not playing tracks (only experienced in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and can be fixed by going in/out of the building). The dynamic, layered elements will never be perfect with this mod but you can get close. I\u0027m no modder so I really can\u0027t take this idea any further than the mod allows, but I think we can get 90% there with it and that is good enough for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
