It took Boeing $32 billion and 10 years to develop the 787, which is just an airliner with fairly mature and well-understood technology, except for the carbon-fiber body.

(This is initial launch costs while amortising purchase.) That means each vehicle has to absorb 20 launches individually to pay for itself, when the launcher is expected to last at least 200 launches, likely expandable to 500 after the first vehicles are retired and can be destructively examined for lifetime estimate. With a mere 40 vehicles, that\u0027s only 800 launches - so even if this was only over the next ten years, they would only have to take 80/yr, less than current launch rates at less than half the cost of the cheapest launch vehicle we have, the Pegasus, capable of a mere 450 kg to LEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry using real numbers and you find they have a hell of a good business case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T18:18:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Iskierka\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Iskierka\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETry using real numbers and you find they have a hell of a good business case.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne might suggest that you do the same...
