Maybe this was taking too long and we will see 9 more versions in beta as 91 92 to 1.00 etc. is there a funding problem for the devolopment lately or squad has devoloped most of what it was planned for the game so we are making a huge jump. is there an official explanation for this becouse game obviously could use a bit more. if not ALOT MORE. You might argue that there are lots of mods that expand gameplay and suplements, and squad might be depending on this side for justifiyng a full price release sale at the end of the day but, i dont think a devolopment should work that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for answers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T18:35:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E0.90.0 is representative of the game moving out of alpha and into beta.
