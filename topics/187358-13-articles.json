But Scott Manely will just beat us all and make a video of how easy it was .... muuhahahaha\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have thought about multiplayer and my solution is sort of complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst you need to think of the nature of the different participants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe geek who is on this forum wishing .... ofcourse he is willing to setip a server, But where to find friends to play with. So he find some friends and urge them to play KSP. Well you see how this will end. One player willing to play many hours a week and his friends who might play once a week and then they fail and wreck all rockets, VERY funny? Not for the geek.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSO the multiplayer have to accomodate for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my plan is the geek set up the server and is now the server adminitrator. He can take over ANY flights at ANY time done by his ... eh ... friends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell the geek is willing to play many hours so he needs to be able to play AHEAD of the others. Therfore when you grab a ship and start controling it you create a time bubble. Say you steer correctly to Duna and you have an intercept you can now set a time alarm and leave that ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou grab another ship and enter another time buble ...... in this time bubble you can see the trajectory of the other Duna ship and can plan an intecept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese bubbles are necesseary for the geek to play way ahead of his not so enthusiastic friends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAND\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs administrator he can take over their ship and play as much as he likes to advance those missions so that he can play his missions further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is very complex so Kerbal Alarm Clock version 200 000 will need to be in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI came up with this ,,, since I play Farmin Simulator .... and I tried it online and it is a MESS. There is a wannabe EMPEROR who setup the server. Then people with no good intensions join. And it all ends up in a mess with tractors in the river, Farming simulator is a game where you can not kill people and people can not kill themselves out of stupidity. In KSP stupidity will get you killed .... so at least in KSP multiplayer it sort of works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nANYWAYS .... to get multiplayer working smothly takes a lot of thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOR\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou can just make some computers connect together and then just claim it is multiplayer...... no on can drag you to court,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut is the SIMPLEST form of multiplayer really functioning multiplayer ...... look at Farming Simulator. IT DOESN\u0027T WORK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also played a lot of CounterStrike .... But in CounterStrike players die and or the game is ended so it starts over and over again. So There is no much problems if bad players join the server. Also on many server the players can \u0022VoteBan\u0022 if an amazing person joins the server,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMultiplayer in KSP will be much longer stretching maybe months or even years,\u00A0 The administrator need to be able to kick people off the server ,,,, invite new ones in and after own judgement be able to \u0022give\u0022 ships/missions to the newly arrived to play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe after awhile finally the server will have a group of true friends that can play together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNEXT step is to get rid of the dependency of a host, Which means the files will be synched with a cloud. You got player A B C. They might not be able to play all the same day. And it would be bad if they all are dependent on that player A\u0027s computer is up and running. Would be nice if player B can load the files from the cloud and start the sesssion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there is a billion things that can go wrong with multiplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOR you can always do it like Farming Simulator did it .... make a simple connection .... and the claim multiplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow is multiplayer going to work in KSP?

I.e. it lets each KSP client simulate physics separately, only sharing general information about e.g. where a craft is located and what trajectory it is on between clients, then letting each separate client run its own simulation. Someone correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but my understanding is that that\u0027s really the main limitation of Luna \u2014 and probably an unavoidable one given what its developers have to work with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had fun with Luna as well, and even ran a server for a short while with a couple of friends, but at the end of the day it was, sadly,\u00A0just too glitchy. Spectating another player \u2014 especially if they did any time warping at all \u2014 was just asking for trouble (at least in part, I think, due to the above limitation \u2014 more than once, the craft being spectated ended up looking all squished and messed up by physics forces from the perspective of one client, while still seeming perfectly fine from the perspective of another, and then the craft\u0027s final fate ended up being determined entirely by who stopped viewing it first...) and we frequently had problems with Kerbals getting listed as M.I.A. even when they were recovered safely, when that recovery was somehow not synced properly between clients... Docking different players\u0027 craft together, which I always thought should be a pretty big part of KSP multiplayer, was always kind of a crapshoot. Anyway, it was cool to be able to play KSP multiplayer at all, and Luna\u0027s devs deserve congratulations and gratitude for accomplishing that much! But we ended up spending more time worrying about how to keep the game working than about how to stage successful space missions. Regardless of the exact form multiplayer takes in KSP2, as long as it\u0027s stable and coded into the game from the get-go I think I\u0027ll be pretty happy to see it! \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Multivac","CreatedById":201225,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-13T07:01:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a separate note: The main thing I, personally, would want to see in KSP2 multiplayer is the ability for each player to run their own separate space agency, with their own funds, science, reputation, and crew roster. These different agencies could compete for achieving \u0022firsts,\u0022\u00A0compete for contracts from a common pool (and if a given agency fails a contract, not only could they be penalized, but their competitors could be given a shot at the contract instead!)\u00A0or, on the other hand, could cooperate to achieve bigger objectives together, say with each player/agency contributing a module to a giant space station, or contributing something to a multi-stage interplanetary mission.\u00A0If the larger mission succeeds, each player could then earn a reward commensurate with their contribution!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother, related, idea might be giving players the ability\u00A0to create contracts for each other! Say you launch a satellite, but can\u0027t quite put it in the right orbit before it runs out of delta-\u003Cem\u003Ev\u003C/em\u003E; or say you\u00A0land on the Mun, but your rocket tips over and your crew is stranded. Instead of sending a rescue mission yourself, you could create a contract for another agency to rescue your crew / refuel or reposition your satellite for you, and offer them funds, science, or reputation from your own budget\u00A0in compensation! You would still benefit by getting your crew back (the whole Kerbonauts-join-their-rescuer\u0027s-crew mechanic would probably best be disabled for inter-player contracts) or by getting a satellite in the right orbit (potentially achieving the objective for your \u003Cem\u003Eown\u003C/em\u003E contract, and thus getting your own reward), and your rescuer would not only get the reward you\u0027d put up for them, but would also gain the satisfaction of knowing they helped another human being (as opposed to\u00A0merely completing a computer-generated contract for a fictional agency run by a random number generator).\u00A0There\u0027d even be an incentive for players to specialize; one player might become the server\u0027s expert on planetary landings, for example,\u00A0while another might run an orbital tug, becoming an expert in rendezvousing with other players\u0027 craft and refuelling them or efficiently putting them on new orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotably, this is something that multiplayer mods for KSP1 cannot currently do \u2014 currently, the only form of multiplayer available, even through modding,\u00A0seems to be everyone sharing a common funds/science/reputation/Kerbonaut pool. I think everyone running their own separate agency would be a good way for a more competitive, yet still constructive, style of play to work in KSP2, and I think it\u0027d add a lot to the game experience!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(One potential problem that would need to be overcome here is that a more nuanced set of rules might be needed for who \u0022controls\u0022 a craft. If player-run space agencies are competing with each other, you don\u0027t want another player to be able to just take control of your ships from the tracking station, after all; at the same time, some of the most interesting potential interaction between players might still take the form of craft docking together and interacting with each other. Some sort of \u0022permission\u0022 system would need to be created, where you would, for example, be able to grant another player permission\u00A0to dock with\u00A0your craft \u2014 say, to refuel it \u2014 without giving them control of your craft\u0027s thrusters, and without the game getting confused as to who owns which craft once they separate\u00A0again. At the same time, there might be situations where you do want to give another player the temporary ability to pilot one of your craft, without permanently losing ownership of that craft yourself; that way you could, say, hire a player to perform a landing for you. They could get a fee from you for their piloting services, while you yourself would still retain ownership of your lander, and all the benefits that would come from having it successfully land on another world, including the ability to recover science, earn any contract rewards, etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-13T07:14:37Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2020 07:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Multivac\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sesshaku","CreatedById":207041,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-13T15:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223851433\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221599665726\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022196943\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceFace545\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/9/2020 at 12:35 PM, SpaceFace545 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would just be stupidly boring so probably not you could probably take control of any kerbal on Eva though\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like that option.

It could provide someone assisting you with data when making complex maneuvres, etc. I also think the collaboration system would work better if the coop flight was 100% IVA first person.

MP supporters always claim that \u003Cem\u003Eit\u0027s the easiest aspect of multi-player to solve\u003C/em\u003E, followed by five different solutions, each completely incompatible with any of the other ones.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGriefing seems to be a common theme in multi-player sandbox games. \u003Cem\u003EAstroneer\u003C/em\u003E seems to suffer from it really badly. Someone will have developed a game (solo) for weeks, invites someone over to join their world and sees it destroyed in a matter of minutes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time, I can look at the MS Flightsim community where multi-player has been a source of unbridled creativity in ways Microsoft probably never imagined but enabled by keeping the interface open. Navigation and flight management software would use the multi-player interface to exchange data with the game, traffic controllers could manage multiple simmers, and I\u0027ve always enjoyed the round-the-world relay races between the various large flightsim websites. I\u0027m sure the KSP community can come up with some creative ways to use an open multi-player interface!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you should look at this a little more like minecraft. You could invite someone to your world, and if they destroy everything, its your fault for inviting an untrustworthy friend. also, I think that multiplayer should work differently than most have suggested. I think all players should get different \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s and be able to pause and revert freely. If you pause, your plane/rocket will stay midair and will be indestructable, other player\u0027s things will just pass through, and If you revert, you will just teleport to where you are reverting to, unless the area you are reverting to is obstructed. Also, a chat feature would be nice. maybe they could also add a menu when creating your server on \u0022wether some\u00A0people\u0027s crafts can damadge other people\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s\u0022 and \u0022wether some people\u0027s crafts can damadge other people\u0027s crafts\u0022 to prevent or allow, in a nutshell, griefing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nboom. thread revived\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plomie","CreatedById":209252,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-07T09:48:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope there will be multiplayer in the game. So you can build space stations together or do an mission where you launch it and youre friends. I also like the new parts and the new kerbal skin. And the fact that you can build bases stock. Its like that the mks mod but stock. beter physics and more planets and other sysmtems. I hope ksp 2 will be good.
