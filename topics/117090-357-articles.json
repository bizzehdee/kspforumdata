Includes several bug-fixes for issues reported on the tracker (thanks [@blowfish](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119688-blowfish/) and others!).  Largest change is the removal of the separate PBR extension folder -- everything uses PBR shaders by default (with very few exceptions).  A few of the experimental PBR texture sets were removed, but may return in the future after being finished.\n\n**WARNING** - Might not be fully backwards compatible with previous saves.  Many texture-set related changes, so cannot guarantee anything.  **Make sure to completely remove your existing SSTU and SSTU-PBR folders before installing this update.**\n\nSee the link above for full (but brief) patch notes, and download links."},{"CreatedByName":"Sudragon","CreatedById":53192,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-18T22:57:54Z","Content":"Woot!"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-19T15:17:52Z","Content":"So far, so good.

Before I go the full delete and reinstall route I\u0027ll ask here first.\n\nSo downloaded and installed your mod last night... And I get this at start up.\n\n[![ksp.jpg](http://i978.photobucket.com/albums/ae267/TeamGoldfarbMiracle/ksp.jpg)](http://s978.photobucket.com/user/TeamGoldfarbMiracle/media/ksp.jpg.html)\n\nAnd a few parts... Mostly ISS parts are untextured. Only mod I\u0027ve added in the last week is the SSTU mod last night. Before that I didn\u0027t get the pop up above. \n\nWhat I\u0027ve tried so far is to remove \u0022000\\_TexturesUnlimited\u0022 folder then fired up KSP. That fixed the pop up but caused more than 3/4\u0027s of the SSTU mod to not load. No pop up warnings when loading up KSP... Just a bunch of blank spots where the parts should be. Can even click on those spots and KSP acts like I\u0027ve picked up a part and click it on to another part in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and all, but no part there. And a few other parts of the SSTU mod are untextured when they were not effected before I removed the Textures Unlimited.\n\nSo next I reinstall the TU folder and fired KSP back up then shut it down and took out the SSTU folder and fired up KSP again to see what would happen. The above pop up was back... \n\nNow I spent the last 40 or so mins going through each folder that was touched by the SSTU mod... Everything looks right. But removing any of them would break a bunch of other mods. And that\u0027s another thing, The SSTU mods is the only mod effected by all of this. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve chosen to post here and not in a more open sub forum.\n\nI wanted to post a long file but I think because I run KSP just out of the unzipped zip folder and don\u0027t have it installed... The \u0022 %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Squad\\Kerbal Space Program\\\u0022 address line stops at username for me. I have no \u0022AppData\u0022 folder. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)\n\nIs there anything you guys and gals can think of I\u0027ve missed? Like I said above this just started last night after installing the SSTU mod... I\u0027m stumped to the point were only other thing I can think of is to do a fresh install. \n\nAny help is as always appreciated of course. And Thanks for your time. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-20T01:54:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2018 01:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by SouthPhilly**"},{"CreatedByName":"SouthPhilly","CreatedById":62599,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-20T01:52:11Z","Content":"Just tried Installing the SSTU mod into a fleshly downloaded copy of KSP with no other mods installed...

Downloaded a new zip folder from the KSP site and unzipped it to my desktop then fired it up to make sure everything stock was working. All went as expected... KSP loaded up and was good to go. So I closed it down went to the [github link above](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.9.44.156) and downloaded a fresh copy of the SSTU mod, Unzipped it and moved all of the folders and files in the zip folder to the GameData folder And fired up KSP again.\n\nThis is where it gets weird... Instead of loading up in the minimized window KSP does when you do a fresh install... It loaded up in window mode but was stretched to fix the whole screen, but the texturing was really bad and the click region for the mouse was all messed up. As in i had to put the mouse pointer a couple of inches above what I wanted to click. \n\nSo ya...

KSP, by default, starts in DX9 mode -- therefore, in order to get the full functionality out of TexturesUnlimited (and SSTU), you need to launch KSP in OpenGL or DX11 mode.  See the TexturesUnlimited thread for instructions on how to do that if the pop up was not clear.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 50 minutes ago, SouthPhilly said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I wanted to post a long file but I think because I run KSP just out of the unzipped zip folder and don\u0027t have it installed...
