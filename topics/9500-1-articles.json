I\\\u0027m promoting myself as a professional (thus the suit, black and white theme and the symbols/figures). Indie games go unappreciated by the majority of gamers and many of them like KSP have fantastic content, ideas and concepts and they really involve you in their development on a personal level. I love Indie developed games over mainstream gaming simply because of the creatively, personal touch and how unique some of them can be. So my goal is 2 things; 1 explore the many fantastic games of the indie/young company/community developed world and 2 provide some level of promotion for them to encourage people to play them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#666666;\u0022\u003EEnough said, show us some KSP\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEpisode 1: First launch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stuffed up the video\\\u0027s sound.

Episodes 1-7 really I could say have been learning stages for me. I really appreciated all the input you guys have given me. So I\\\u0027m actually going to stop uploading for the moment to take everything on board and try and improve the quality of my videos. I\\\u0027m looking into an upgrade for my internet so I can upload better quality rather than this 320p. It might be a while before I get back to my regular once a day posting schedule so for those watching I apologize now and ask for a little patience. Better internet means the possibility of HD videos (720p), higher quality sound and longer videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I wont be starting afresh (unless you want me to) so we can pick up where we left off trying to launch that space station. A little bit of a teaser I\\\u0027m going to implement a new \\\u0027concept\\\u0027 or \\\u0027idea\\\u0027 which we can use to get our space station into space \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.
