Altitude, Orbital angle from the equatorial, Kerbin\u0027s Rotation, Ship mass. All of these things are factors in returning from orbit. ship mass only matters in an atmosphere deorbit. I find that about 500 km orbit is easier to gauge than a 70-75 km orbit. Perhaps practice from that height first. If you go too high the rotation become too strong of a factor, and if you have a low orbit the angle into the Atmosphere gets harder to judge. Just my thought any way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T00:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELower your Pe to ~30 Km over the large peninsula to the east of KSC.

A plane (unless it is a glider or out of fuel) can be quite sloppy as it should be able to fly a considerable distance once in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use Kerbal Engineer (or something else that gives a deltaV readout) then you can set up a de-orbit burn node using an appropriate amount of deltaV and then move it on the orbit until it comes down a bit past your target. You have to account for both the slow down in the atmosphere making you drop short and the rotation of the planet (also making you drop short for the usual eastward orbit but making you go long for an opposite orbit). You can (if your ship design allows and you don\u0027t mind exploiting the lack of re-entry simulation) also keep a reasonable amount of deltaV in reserve so that you can kill off your residual horizontal speed if you overshoot the target (after the atmosphere has done most of the braking for you) or compensate if it looks like you are falling short. Just have a quicksave ready and if you miss by further than you can compensate for then reload and move your deorbit burn a bit and try again. After a number of goes you should be able to judge how far you need to overshoot to only require minimal correction. If you don\u0027t have KER then you have to be more approximate with your deorbit burn but the principle is the same, aim to overshoot by enough to compensate for the drag slowing you down and the rotation of the planet. The rotation of the planet should be the same as it should always take (very nearly) the same time to cover the vertical distance to the ground but the drag will depend on how steep your re-entry is. A steep entry will be affected less than a shallow one so the more you burn the less you need to overshoot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Doh! Multi-ninja\u0027d.
