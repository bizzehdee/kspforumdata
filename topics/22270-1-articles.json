My Kerbonauts either grab and then bounce off the ladder violently, or clip badly into the base structure while climbing. I think the problem is I don\u0027t know what the part trigger box/collision box should look like in Unity (I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ve got the up and facing orientations correct). Does anyone have a reference for the width and depth of the collision box, and how it should/shouldn\u0027t clip into the base model? I\u0027ve got airlocks working fine so it seems like I\u0027m mostly there.

I got it to work! So I saw somewhere that adjusting the Collider geometry controls could cause problems, so I set the Box Collider center to (0,0,0) and Size to (1,1,1), then used the Transform controls at the the top of the page to make a box that is more like yours, with just a little clipping.

Hmm, my Kerbal did explode coming out of the airlock, but a little more clipping and he usually catches the ladder now.
