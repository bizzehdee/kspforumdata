I currently have a full-time job (40 hrs per week) and I\u0027m doing work for a University society which involves design work, team management, speaking at conferences and other events and communicating with outside companies (another 40-50 hrs a week). The job organizes itself since everything is automatically put on Outlook, but not the other stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current method of organizing myself is writing stuff down in a little agenda. This hasn\u0027t been working very well, however. I find that there isn\u0027t any room for simultaneously allocating time, listing tasks with required hours and putting down meetings quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs well, there is also the problem of being motivated enough to use it all the time. If its in my bag downstairs and I\u0027m on my computer upstairs, I\u0027ll be too lazy to go get it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have anything that has worked really well for them?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T19:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy high school (in 1993) gave every student a pocket agenda/calendar. We were trained to use them. Forced to use them. You kind of needed to since we had a weird \u0022Mod\u0022 modular scheduling system where classes could be of arbitrary lengths and start at arbitrary times. Imagine every kid in your high school carrying around an identical little black book (though in our case it was burgandy). It became a discipline supported by peer pressure. A ritual. A religion. Your calendar was never far from your reach. You probably even slept with the thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was a smart move, as it developed our discipline for scheduling and tracking at an early young-adult age. These days I just use the calendar on my phone and have stopped carrying the agenda, which somehow diminishes it. But still that discipline is there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your spot I\u0027d do two things: Go out and buy another little pocket calendar. One small enough to carry with you. A blank slate. Then buy a really nice ink pen, one that is also small, but won\u0027t leak and can stand up to the rigors of a busy life. Like a space pen or a bullet pen. The pen needs to be something cool to use. A reward. An incentive to write down things in your calendar. A psychological trick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, you could just use the calendar app on a smartphone, but I\u0027m not sure how to incentivize something like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key is to make it a habit. A good habit that has tangible rewards. Not a chore. It\u0027s a hard thing to start doing from scratch, and it\u0027ll take time to become a habit, but when you\u0027re crazy-busy it\u0027s a great way to stay sane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil1993","CreatedById":92469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T19:49:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the suggestion! I have already kinds done that. I have a nice silver pen that had been given to me for my graduation from high school and one of those Moleskine agendas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were to elaborate on the problem a little, the Moleskine agenda has seven slots for each day of the week on one page, and a lined page for notes adjacent. I\u0027ve found that this doesn\u0027t provide the detail I require. Furthermore, The university society insists on doing everything through google calendars, which is great for meetings and events, but dismally bad for task management (unless there\u0027s an app out there that patches that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also dislike using my phone for scheduling, since it is also a google device with the google calendar. As well, it just doesn\u0027t feel as good as having a physical agenda. I know that a phone can back up my schedule in the cloud in case it\u0027s lost, but this is more of a personal preference kind of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T20:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never really been a fan of the current Google calendar offerings, but that\u0027s another discussion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou sound like you\u0027re on the right track, just need a few refinements. You might try one of the other agenda formats, such as one which drops the blank notes page and gives you more room for each day. (Lined pages are important.) If that\u0027s not a high enough level of detail you might look into the DayTimer month-by-month calendars that give each day its own page with an overview for the week. We lived by those at work in the pre-Outlook days, though they\u0027re a bit on the large size and make planning a bit more cumbersome for future months. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe had a checkbox/priority system that I\u0027ve long forgotten the exact details of, but before each line we\u0027d either have a square or a circle. One had a higher priority than the other, and there may have been triangles involved too. When the task was complete we\u0027d cross out or fill in the box/circle. That\u0027s something I still use on notes - Circles for tasks, Boxes for questions that need answers. Dashes for comments or reminders. Alternatively you could use different shapes to identify different entities related to the entry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil1993","CreatedById":92469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T20:11:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething like that sounds like it would be more my style.
