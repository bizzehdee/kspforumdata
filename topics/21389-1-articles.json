You CAN just edit the .craft files to accomplish it, as they\u0027re just text, but it\u0027s a bit of a pain. You have to edit the parts you don\u0027t want to use out of it (Like the command pod!), and make sure to also get the link references to the missing parts on all the remaining parts. Sometimes it\u0027ll tolerate a link to a part that no longer exists, but sometimes it blows up and displays \u0027loaded ship missing parts\u0027 instead of the craft\u0027s name, which also has the side effect of locking the game up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"atokz","CreatedById":76871,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T06:54:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebumpity bump bump\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CptShaky","CreatedById":76896,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T07:07:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s this nice little addon called SubAssembly Manager, I thinks it does exactly what you want \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/subassembly-manager/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/subassembly-manager/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorks like a charm with 0.21 ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T07:31:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022atokz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022atokz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebumpity bump bump\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this your question, or are you just trolling?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smunisto","CreatedById":57789,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T07:34:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse the Subassembly Loader mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"atokz","CreatedById":76871,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T07:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edoes it work with 0.21?????\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T08:18:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022atokz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022atokz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebumpity bump bump\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDude, this thread is almost 10 months old.
