It was real easy to get it working before, and I don\u0027t have all the \u0022know-how\u0022 as many others do with flying spacecraft and doing mathematical equations and everything else, so I kind of need MechJeb, to get me landed on wherever it is I want to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell anyone reading this, if you\u0027d like to reply back with step by step instructions on how to get MechJeb properly put on my system so that it will work with KSP, that\u0027d be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T04:56:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI may be able to help....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, first off, what is the first file/folder in the zip?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T05:42:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you know about the easier mod system yet?

The first folder in that zip is MechJeb. Inside that folder is Parts, Plugins and Ships. I copied over the Parts and Plugins folder to their respective locations. Didn\u0027t copy over Ships, as that is a craft file, meaning, its a small, and already built ship with MechJeb parts on it. Anyway, after I put the other 2 folders in KSP folder, MechJeb menu\u0027s would come up in game, but not all of them were working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then downloaded MechJeb2-2.0.9.0.zip as I saw on Google, that was the most recent MechJeb. The first folder in that zip is MechJeb2. Inside that folder is Parts and Plugins. In the Parts folder is only 1 folder labeled, MechJeb2_AR202, and inside of that folder are 3 files, model.mu, model000.mbm and part.cfg. Inside the plugins folder is Mechjeb2.dll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I had uploads_2013_03_MechJeb_1.9.8.zip extracted to the Parts folder under KSP folder, there were 10 folders in the Parts folder. In MechJeb2-2.0.9.0.zip I don\u0027t see any MechJeb parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know how to extract files from folders to their proper locations, my problem is that, I did that with the 1.9.8 MechJeb zip, and the MechJeb menu\u0027s weren\u0027t working correctly, like some of them would come up, but many others wouldn\u0027t, and I don\u0027t think MechJeb 1.9.8 was even working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I took a look at the contents of the MechJeb 2.0.9 zip file, I didn\u0027t see any MechJeb parts in that zip file.

(To check, go into GameData, go into MechJeb2 and there should be several different folders there - parts, plugins, ships and maybe sounds. First off, go into the parts folder. If there is only two other folders in there, then it is fine - if there is more, some sort of problems going on (possibly the actual parts themselves aren\u0027t made right). Secondly, go into the plugins folder, and there should be one plugin in there. (well, I say should be.....)If there isn\u0027t, well there\u0027s another problem.)
