This makes sense as you\u0027re almost always aiming to tweak your intercept on the next orbit when placing a manoeuvre node on top of an your intercept point. There is a bit of a buffer zone ahead of the intercept point on the orbit too, which is why you\u0027re seeing the information change in the video without the manoeuvre node being right on top of the intercept point. If you were to move the node back far enough though you would see the information switch back to the current orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T15:13:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022yongedevil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022yongedevil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you were to move the node back far enough though you would see the information switch back to the current orbit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is \u0022back far enough\u0022 would end up being behind you, so that\u0027s no good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Intersect 1\u0022 point should really be the earliest possible intersect solution, always, even if a maneuver node is placed 1 second in time before it occurs.
