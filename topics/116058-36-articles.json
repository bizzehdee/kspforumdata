If so, my distance from the star is probably higher than the 32-bit memory limit. Could that be an issue?

In my experience, only 1 in 1000 people that use your mod, actualy gives any usefull feedback at all (if your lucky). Player often do not understand that feedback is the fuel that keeps modders spend time creating new content/ fixing problems. You might have hoped that many players to jump on the opertunity to play  grand tours though your expanded universe, but the cold truth is that only a very small fraction of all KSP players ever get futher than Jool, let alone travel to extraterestial solar systems.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-18T11:16:25Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2016 11:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-23T10:08:36Z","Content":"Damn, wish I had found this thread a lot earlier . . .\n\nADDIT: so reading through the first 15 pages or so of this thread, it seems the way it works is: you install this mod \\_along with\\_ planet packs, and the mod assigns the planet packs it can recognize to specific star systems. Sounds simple!\n\n. . . . off to break my install!\n\nThis summer I\u0027ve played a lot with a bloated mod-list, and have finally, reluctantly decided to archive the career save that I\u0027ve been playing with that mod set (year 3, Kerbal Space Station setup, first missions outside Kerbal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E underway) because of performance issues.\n\nSo I\u0027m hoping to setup a more reasonable mod set, and now that I\u0027ve found GN, it would seem that replacing my existing couple \u0022extrasolar\u0022 planet packs with this mod would be wise. How would this mod work with something like this:\n\n![2l1en.jpg](http://tw.greywool.com/i/2l1en.jpg)\n\nHere is the previous version\n\n![2XgVI.gif](http://tw.greywool.com/i/2XgVI.gif)\n\nCourse the number of sub-directories can be a bit misleading, but it looks like I\u0027ve reduced from the 110 ballpark to the 80 ballpark. I think some of the ones I had installed might have been outdated/redundant with other mods and/or unnecessary, so hopefully I\u0027ll see better performance.\n\nSo two specific questions:\n\n1. What sort of expectations should I have if I install GN into the shorter set (the one not in a spoiler)\n\n2. Should I uninstall Valentine System and Kumar\u0027s Dwarfs? (I think those might be included in GN, but have not explored the documentation yet)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-23T12:21:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2016 12:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Diche Bach**\n  \nwrong pic"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-23T12:26:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7/12/2016 at 4:02 AM, Sigma88 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Honestly I would not advise playing with ksp 1.1.3 and GN\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The orbit bug is just to painful to deal with from a player perspective, you may end up ruining your save\n\u003E \n\nSo is this still the status?\n\nIf so, it sounds like NOT installing GN at this time and just playing with the couple extrasolar mods I have installed (Valentine system and Kumar\u0027s Dwarfs) is in fact the smart way to go for now?\n\nOf course reverting to 1.12 might also be an option.
