These bugs are not easily identifiable, and crash logs are pretty obscure for normal people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my idea: a script/mod inside or outside KSP that you run after each crash. It grabs the latest crash log and records it and the mods installed to database.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt records the log file (and maybe even the crash exception error message), and correlates it with mods installed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt sends the record of to the aggregation server.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOn the aggregation server, we can use filtering to figure out which mod is causing what kind of crash, and log output of those crashes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI obviously haven\u0027t fleshed this out, but I\u0027m wondering if there is community interest to talk about a project like this one and have a discussion about whether such a system can be technically feasible at all. Obviously, parsing KSP\u0027s log is kinda prohibitive and I\u0027m not sure if it even logs the error when the application crashes, and from what i see, the Unity error msgs to the Mac OSX console is not saying much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Xrave\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven frequency of crash can be a indicator (say you don\u0027t install A, and you crash after ~90 minutes, and after installing A your crash frequency went up to once per 30 minutes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough, for me personally, i think i might just be running out of memory. *hmm*\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T22:03:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 10:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xrave\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T11:50:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECrashes to desktop are 99.999999% of the time from running out of memory. It\u0027s not that mod A or mod B or C or D is a problem, but just the fact that you have A and B and C and D installed and you\u0027re using up all your RAM. The more mods you have installed, the quicker you\u0027ll run out of memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a mod has a bug, it normally only takes out itself, or does something ridiculous (ship explodes, planet disappears, instantly accelerated to speed of light, etc).

You remove them and next time goes the next one.
