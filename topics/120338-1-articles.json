Sometimes the ship develops a pattern of dark stripes; sometimes the whole ship is totally dark even when in full sunlight. (Strangely, fairings do not seem to be affected; nor do regions lit by spotlights.) The dark stripes seem to move around as I rotate the view around, and from some angles the planet surface below me also develops dark stripes and/or pixelly patches of full darkness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen this happens, it continues to happen when I switch to a different ship (or even back to the space center), and generally seems to be a sure sign that the game is going to freeze up shortly thereafter, requiring a force-quit. When I start it up again, everything\u0027s back to normal.
