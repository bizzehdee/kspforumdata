I am interested by that part.\n\u003E \n\nYep.  If the tank segments are labeled A,B,C,D,E, etc, you\u0027ll be able to create a config for a new model definition, and specify that you want segments A,D,B,D,D,A,E, or any other combination.  When the model definition is parsed/loaded, it will locate those meshes, clone them, merge them all into a single model/game-object, and will then use that merged model whenever that model-definition is specified in a modular part.  The only caveat with the merged meshes/models is that they all must use the same materials/textures -- if they require separate textures/materials (e.g. for different AO sheets), you need to use non-merged SUBMODELs (but a single model-definition can specify both merged and non-merged sections...and the texture set system can already properly handle multiple material assignments within a single texture-set).\n\nAll of that functionality already exists in the current releases, minus the model/mesh merging bits.  You can already use the SUBMODEL setup within model-definitions to create new compound model types; I don\u0027t use it very much, but it certainly exists and works well.\n\nHopefully I\u0027ll be wrapping up the modeling bits in the next few days.

E.G. there is no in game \u0027editing\u0027 of the models.  For each slot (module) in the part, you select from a list of pre-built models via the slider/buttons.  Only there are now 2 more \u0027slots\u0027 for models; so instead of a 3-slot part, you get 5 slots (\u002B2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u002B1 solar).  Also the built in scale-chaining is a bit of a change, allowing for a single model definition to be used at different scales depending on what slot/module it is below it in the hierarchy (with the middle/core slot being the root).  It is this scale-chaining that will allow for conical models to be usable, and potentially other setups that I haven\u0027t quite narrowed down yet.\n\nWith the two additional model slots \u002B good use of the SUBMODEL and merged-model setups, it should be quite a bit easier to design new tank types and entirely new part concepts.  At least from a modeling perspective -- there will be additional config work needed, but being able to re-use the existing models should result in a net gain in productivity.\n\nThe other new feature of the modular parts is \u0027adapter validation\u0027 code -- ensures that only adapters that can actually fit onto the parent slot can be selected.  So, for example, you can\u0027t select an \u0027empty\u0027 adapter for a tank end-cap, as the tank itself lacks any end-cap mesh (it will only allow for selecting adapters with meshes that will properly close the end of the tank).  This feature basically just allows for lots of different adapter/model types to all be used in the same part without requiring tons of additional setup code in the part config (rather, the validation data is specified in the model definitions).  No longer will there be a need for a new part just for spherical tanks -- the validation code will enforce proper use of the body/adapter combos (same goes for other \u0027special\u0027 fuel tank setups); of course, it is still an option and does make sense for specific part configurations (e.g. lander fuel tanks)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-21T21:08:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 32 minutes ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E FH?\n\u003E \n\nFalcon Heavy."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-21T21:12:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Falcon Heavy.\n\u003E \n\nAh yeah obviously.

Of course, I seldom actually LAND the stages myself, electing instead to let Stage Recovery deal with it, making the legs are superfluous, though sometimes I do manage to intercept it before it\u0027s destroyed and try to land it myself.\n\nThough there\u0027s an unfortunate problem in that Stage Recovery can\u0027t really deal with SSTU\u0027s cluster engines and treats them as having the thrust of a single engine since it operates at a time when the part and its part module don\u0027t exist. I\u0027ve actually tried hacking SR\u0027s code to deal with the problem but snapshot parts and partmodules are apparently highly resistant to reflection. Very frustrating and a solution may not be possible ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)"}]}
