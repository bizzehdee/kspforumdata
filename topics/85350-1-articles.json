I would encourage people to read the report (I linked to it above) and form their own opinions. The report\u0027s authors focused specifically on MSL\u0027s first extended mission plan (EM1). They did not focus on the primary mission. They felt that more scientific activities should have been planned for the current phase of the mission. They were also critical of the way in which the science was/is being done.
