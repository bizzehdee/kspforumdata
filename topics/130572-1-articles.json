It makes sense since docking ports have clamps that can not lock in arbitrary position, but can turn the ship into correct position while locking. You just need to hit reasonably close to correct angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-30T13:28:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2016 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Psycho_zs\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemeko","CreatedById":154318,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T18:45:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsomething like this ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/123402-tutorial-soft-docking-docking-ports/\u0026amp;page=1\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/123402-tutorial-soft-docking-docking-ports/\u0026amp;page=1\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T21:34:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a feeling that this would be as good as the claw when it comes to invoking the kraken.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
