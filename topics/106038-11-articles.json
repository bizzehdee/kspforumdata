Presuming the mod staff does not actively try to shield them from this (which I don\u0027t believe our mod staff is petty enough to do), they\u0027ll catch on. ALso, they might not publicly admit to their forum community that they screwed up. It doesn\u0027t change the fact that they\u0027re aware of it and the proof will be in both the 1.0.3 fix and the 1.1 patch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirstly, the testing and QA people are \u003Cem\u003Enot \u003C/em\u003Eprofessionals. They are volunteers. Since you\u0027re not paying them, the least you could do is show them a little gratitude and courtesy for their \u003Cstrong\u003Evolunteered \u003C/strong\u003Eefforts. Secondly, they are human beings, and they will have emotional reactions to what is said to and about them. The question for you is, will you say, \u0022They should be able to handle this, therefore I\u0027m going to continue to express myself in a counter-productive way,\u0022 or will you say, \u0022I will be polite because it has a better chance of getting me what I want\u0022?

Generally speaking, of all of us displeased with how 1.0 was handled, the vast majority of us are not assigning blame to the Q\u0026amp;A teams. We\u0027re assigning blame on the lack of a proper beta cycle due to rushed release schedule. the Q\u0026amp;A \u0026amp; Experimentals teams were the only groups who GOT a beta cycle, so blame falling on them is due to this small group not understanding the facts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe discussion has shifted towards the frustration over the development cycle because THAT is the root cause of the problem Kasper is addressing in the OP.
