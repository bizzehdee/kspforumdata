Next, after a few years (7), all 3 begin setting up small colonies. However, tensions begin between China and Russia, due to an accident where a Chinese comm sat was deorbited into a Russian moon base, though none died (just a lot of money). Russia deorbits a sat into their base, killing one, and so, 2 years later (2029), China and it\u0027s allies (Kazakhstan, North Korea, other small eastern Asian countries) declare war on Russia. The UN, mainly US and EU forces, retaliates. This is World War 3, and lasts 9 years, killing 60-70 million. This war saw the first use of orbital bombardment (think CoD: Ghosts). First man landed on Mars in 2045 by EU. In 2068, the first efforts to terraform Mars begin. 2072, and a form of exotic matter is found, which can only form under extremely high gravitational environments, which would make the Alcubierre drive possible. 2103, and this is first utilized to set up bases on Mars, reaching Mars in only 70 minutes. By only 2116, Mars is colonized almost completely by humans using bubble domes. 2117, and the Higgs Boson is utilized to create artificial gravity on spacecraft. 2138, and Martian colonies began to rebel, gaining independence in 2143 after a huge and devastating war involving nuclear weapons, reaches as far as mining bases in the asteroid belt, and even a terrorist attack on a commercial moon hotel. By 2205, most of the solar system is colonized, and LS travel is refined enough for trip to Proxima Centauri to take only 5 years. By 2340, several star system have been reached, and the Alpha Centauri system is being colonized. 2370s, and several exoplanets are colonised and/or terraformed. by 2400, almost all superpowers (including countries, as earth and planets haven\u0027t been united into one planetary government) have large space navies, capable of mass interplanetary battles. 2450s, and most planets have moved away from being colonies and becoming independent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats all I got for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-08T18:58:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2014 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by xXIndestructibleEVAXx\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T01:11:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETechnology:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enanomachines first see widespread use in the early 2030s, being used to cut costs in construction, and soon were used in the medical, performing delicate procedures during surgery, fighting diseases, and even removing tumors.

Also, money. That\u0027s very important too, and the Alcubierre drives are expensive, and it still takes a lot of time to get from one star to another, meaning most LS travel is confined to moving in between planets. Similar thing with artificial gravity, its very expensive so civilians have to use alternatives.
