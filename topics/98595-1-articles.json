I have never had to skip a transfer window into the system. Once you have your encounter on your trajectory, place a node about half way to Jool, and adjust it a couple of dV with radial and pro/retrograde burns and you can miss the moons. I do this routinely. Also Focus View on Jool to see what the result of your dV change is.

That said, you may be able to get the \u0027Analyse Data\u0027 science from there; not sure.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, remember that the SAR scanner for hi-resolution altimetry and the multispectral scanner for biomes and anomalies have different altitude requirements, so if you want both you may need to plan two satellites per body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vahal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vahal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think scanning Jool itself would worth the effort, so you can save mass and funds.\u003Cp\u003EOne advise, don\u0027t forget RTG!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know about jool but I thought maybe in the future they will add some feature and then I\u0027ll have the satellite already there, plus this way I can store inside the fairings a square of 2x2 satellites with another 2x2 on top which makes it easier to design. Also I can always make the excuse that kerbals don\u0027t really know the biome scanner won\u0027t work on jool \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven better it gives me a third Comunication device around jool which could be useful if a moon is between a scansat and the relaysat to kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the altitude requirements I plan to keep just 1 sat with both radars active at the best compromise altitude, and when one of the 2 radars is done I shift the orbit to match the optimal of the other\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding RTG, I\u0027ll use one from near future electrics wich has 7 years lifetime, cause I don\u0027t really like the infinite RTG (still I\u0027m never going to play 7 years ingame so I guess that\u0027s the same thing, but it feels less cheaty \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest worry at this moment is being able to go from a polar orbit around jool to a polar around a moon.
