In pre-1.0, the jet engines would heat up rapidly to a specific temperature but then stabilize. Post 1.0, jet engines very, very slowly heat up. The engines don\u0027t even glow anymore until you fly around for twenty minutes, and they keep bleeding their heat into connected parts all the while. I had landing gears that were nearly as hot as the engine exhaust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:43:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) that\u0027s in Kelvin.
