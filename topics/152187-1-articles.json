And as thankful as I am for the wonderful variety of mods out there, slapping on a bunch of mods is no guarantee of playing a career game that has a good \u003Cstrong\u003Eprogression and flow\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question to the community is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat options are out there for the player that wants a more satisfying, complete career game that they can be confident will really \u0022work\u0022 for them as they sink in tens or hundreds of hours?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course there are many forms this could take:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nA career game that sticks very closely to the stock parts and systems, perhaps just modifying the tech tree and maybe contracts\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA career game that both tech tree/contracts\u00A0and some additional hand-selected parts mods that \u0022flesh out\u0022 the career flow they are going for\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA career game that seeks to pull in the widest possible variety of parts and systems mods while still providing a well-considered flow of play\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m interested in all three! To me the important thing is knowing going in that somebody has \u003Cstrong\u003Econsidered a complete career game as a top priority\u003C/strong\u003E. Perhaps the goal is to create a compelling career that parallels the real development of NASA. Perhaps they want a game that is maximized for fun and feels satisfying taking\u00A0a player out beyond current technology. I just want to play something more than the stock career which just feels like a sequence of tech nodes and contracts that \u0022work\u0022, but that\u0027s about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, any thoughts? Are there mod packs designed for this kind of thing (SETI comes to mind -- are there others?), or have any of you put together your own collections of mods that you\u0027ve played through and thought worked elegantly together? What aspects of the career made it compelling to you?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-17T19:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d start with CTT - Community Tech Tree - and work out from there.\u00A0 MOLE is interesting and fun for some early-career stuff, and for mid-late game I\u0027d pull in MKS.\u00A0 Also consider if you want a life support mod; \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS will give you plenty to think about and work with for tens or hundreds of hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMOLE adds some science, but more importantly it adds some intermediate parts between the 1.25 and 2.5 parts, allowing your career to grow a bit more smoothly.\u00A0 MKS adds in quite a few parts for base and station building, as well as adding some new mechanics, which you\u0027ll start to get into near the end of the tech tree - giving you something you can have as a goal once you complete the tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding in Extraplanetary Launchpads will give you some better goals and paths than \u0027build everything at Kerbin and launch it out\u0027, especially combined with MKS the idea of launching a starter settlement and using that to bootstrap to a full colony is easily a full end-game in itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sherkaner","CreatedById":130303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-17T22:30:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222854307\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152187\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221479410770\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022155685\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DStaal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, DStaal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d start with CTT - Community Tech Tree - and work out from there.\u00A0 MOLE is interesting and fun for some early-career stuff, and for mid-late game I\u0027d pull in MKS.\u00A0 Also consider if you want a life support mod; \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS will give you plenty to think about and work with for tens or hundreds of hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMOLE adds some science, but more importantly it adds some intermediate parts between the 1.25 and 2.5 parts, allowing your career to grow a bit more smoothly.\u00A0 MKS adds in quite a few parts for base and station building, as well as adding some new mechanics, which you\u0027ll start to get into near the end of the tech tree - giving you something you can have as a goal once you complete the tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding in Extraplanetary Launchpads will give you some better goals and paths than \u0027build everything at Kerbin and launch it out\u0027, especially combined with MKS the idea of launching a starter settlement and using that to bootstrap to a full colony is easily a full end-game in itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCool, good recommendations! \u00A0Are there any contract mods that work especially well with CTT (and maybe other parts sets)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
