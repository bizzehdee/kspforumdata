Just a quick go and then I could go and finish off doing some decorating. I have a monitor on a swingarm over my bed so I can play when I am having a bad day due to my dodgy legs... Sooooo I think Just an hour wouldn\u0027t be too bad.\n\nI just looked at the clock AND IT\u0027S NOW NEARLY 10pm!!! ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) Not eaten anything all day... only thing I have drunk is Doc Pepper and Lucozade sharing bottles. The game just mesmerised me with the old \u0022Just one more launch... got to get those science points (I\u0027m chickening out of the full career atm because I keep running out of money - just need to work out a good strategy). Time seems to fly when you are blowing up stuff heh.\n\nWhoever claimed that this new KSP release is crap obviously knows less than Jeb does about safety in space. LOL. I love this freakin\u0027 game but OMG I wish I wouldn\u0027t bend our brains and make us lose time. I swear that the people who think they have lost time due to being taken by aliens were probably playing KSP at the time heh.\n\nSo Squad... GOOD JOB DUDES... This release is awesome in my eyes. Too damned awesome as I am hooked yet again... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) (Except for it stealing my entire day that I was going to use to finish the decorating lol)."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:07:27Z","Content":"Yeah, I pretty much agree. 1.0.2 is pretty much awesome IMO."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:09:12Z","Content":"Don\u0027t start playing KSP any later than about 9:00pm, or you will stay up until 5:00am. ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:30:11Z","Content":"Yeah. 1.0.2 is great."},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:32:42Z","Content":"Uh, Jeb does know about this \u0022safety in space\u0022 thing, but he ignores it."},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:42:36Z","Content":"I know what you are talking about ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Yesterday i was determined to farm science from the Mun until i get enough for fairings and 3-seater pods.
