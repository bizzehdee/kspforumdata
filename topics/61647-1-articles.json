It\u0027s usually a better idea to put Kethane and SCANsat on separate probes. For several reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The SCANsat stuff needs a polar orbit but scanning for Kethane in a polar orbit is a waste of time. Seriously, you\u0027re never going to use any Kethane that\u0027s more than 20-30^ off the equator, if even that much, due to the amount of fuel you have to waste on the inclination changes both getting there and coming back. So put the Kethane probe in an orbit inclined about 30^, so it only needs to scan about 30^ of the surface area, which takes only 1/3 the time as doing the whole planet from a polar orbit. And while you\u0027re focused on this happening, your SCANsat probe in polar orbit can be mapping in the background without you having to watch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Everything works best at a different altitude. With SCANsat, the Multispectral biome/anomaly thing needs to be between 240-270km while the hi-res color altimetry scanner needs to be 740-760km. Meanwhile, the Kethane scanner needs to be as low as possible where you can still warp 100x. This is because the Kethane scanner only scans 1 hex wide regardless of altitude, so to maximize hexes scanned per minute, you have to maximize orbital velocity. It actually takes the least GAMEtime if it\u0027s so low you can only warp 50x, but that takes too much REALtime so compromise where you can do 100x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The Kethane scanner only needs 4 RTGs but can only tolerate 100x warp before coverage gets too spotty to be effective. The SCANsat stuff, however, with 4x Gigantor solar panels, can scan perfectly well at 10,000x warp, even in the background. Thus, Kethane probes can be small and light but SCANsat probes have to be bigger (at least if you\u0027ve got multiple ships flying around and warp at high speed a lot). Thus, effective SCANsat probes are often too big to bundle easily, whereas you can easily bundle Kethane probes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Huntarr","CreatedById":102284,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T19:17:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love this community!
