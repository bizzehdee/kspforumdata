I get a little sad because I stumble upon a game that reminds me how amazing my relationship with my computer can be. Unfortunately it seldom is that good. KSP granted me such a little moment. I bought it a few years ago because the concept appealed to me, but never really got into it. Until yesterday morning. \n\nKSP is really really great, but I am even more excited with the potential. I can already picture a \u0022survival-game-on-an-uknown-planet-with-flesh-eating-plants-mod\u0022 for example. And I haven\u0027t even tried any mods yet. \n\nMost of all though, I find amazing how much the game makes me want to learn. It makes me want to learn about Space, the Universe, Stephen Hawkin etc. It pushes me to resign from my job tomorrow and enroll in a Astrophysics university course the day after tomorrow. With a space mission about to reach Pluto for the first time next month, this game is relevant.\n\nIt would be amazing if the earthlings could follow the example of the Kerbals, forget their territorial disputes over countries, borders and so on, unite and focus their attention towards science and towards the stars.\n\n**F\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ABanor**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T13:06:20Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!\n\nThat is certainly a great way to look at it. KSP has taught me oodles of stuff as well, and now I can wow people at my school with my big fancy orbital mechanics ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Maybe one day, in a millennium or so, we can all forget the problems and work together for once. Also, a flesh-eating plant mod sounds terrifying as [REDACTED].\n\nHave fun!"},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T13:30:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Most of all though, I find amazing how much the game makes me want to learn.

KSP was the first game with so much scientific depth built in that it inspired me to start a YouTube channel. It was only a year and a half ago?!\n\nThe Science! in KSP is top notch, and learning about it and sharing our discoveries together is what makes this game so great. Also - Create and Play games are always awesome, where you have a goal (that you choose) and have to create and operate something to achieve that goal."}]}
