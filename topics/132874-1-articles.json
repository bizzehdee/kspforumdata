Expelling radioactive propellant into the atmosphere, even if it is nearly harmless, isn\u0027t something people are happy about. For interplanetary transfers, or for landing on other worlds, people won\u0027t care as much about the use of nuclear engines. The average layperson wouldn\u0027t have the first clue about the difference between an NTR and an RTG.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, launches from Earth wouldn\u0027t be very common. This is, after all, a long-term, extended-persistence interplanetary transfer vehicle capable of supporting a large crew for a long time. The initial launch would be followed by a series of missions to other worlds, returning to low Earth orbit to refuel and take on more supplies, but \u0022dry dock\u0022\u00A0on earth wouldn\u0027t happen very often. Much easier to treat the ship like an orbiting space station and simply ferry up and down using capsules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would definitely be more economical to refuel, even using inefficient chemical rockets, because this contains its own engines, tankage, and\u00A0hab. This ship would be able to support a large crew for a long time, drop them on another planet, and then come back. Hard to beat that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option (not pictured) would be to attach a cluster of ion engines with their own fuel tanks, either passing through the open center of the ship or in a toroidal ring mated underneath. The ion engines would run off the nuclear reactors, which would continuously expel small amounts of coolant in order to keep from overheating. The internal fuel tanks would still end up partially depleted by the end of the burn, since the reactors\u00A0would\u00A0be using propellant as their\u00A0coolant, but you could develop an extremely high delta\u00A0V. \u00A0This eliminates\u00A0some of the major problems with using ion engines for interplanetary transfer (the high power requirements of ion engines typically result in either extremely low thrust, extremely large solar panels, or extremely large radiators and coolant loops with nuclear-thermal designs). Plus, you arrive with enough propellant to still use your engines the normal way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn theory, this ship could mate to any number of additional cargo containers, pods, or fuel reserves. Big, overpowered engines are a large initial investment, but they pay great dividends. Especially because a moon shot ends\u00A0up being as simple as flying to the moon, landing, taking off, and coming back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-25T05:15:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222428183\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132874\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456350235\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re going to build an actual spaceship -- a craft you can take to another planet as easily as a pirate could sail across the Mediterranean -- there are a few things to keep in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EGravity.\u00A0\u003C/b\u003EYou\u0027re going to need artificial gravity if you want to be able to manage long trips, so you\u0027ll need to either have a spinning hab, or you\u0027ll need to spin the whole ship.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPower.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EYou need high-thrust engines to get on and off of planets, high-impulse engines to make your transfer burns propellant-efficient, and energy\u00A0to run your ship in transit.

There are lot of variables that depend heavily on the mission profile, and if you want to build an extended-persistence\u00A0reusable spaceship, it needs to be\u00A0capable of accommodating a wide range of mission profiles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless you have a fully operating orbital spaceport at every possible destination\u00A0(which won\u0027t happen for a LONG time, if ever), then you will need to bring along a lander. Perhaps you can expect that certain destinations, like Mars, will eventually be able to provide launch services to return a crew capsule to orbit; if this is the case, then you can get away with bringing along nothing more than an aerobraking descent capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut aerobraking is only useful on Mars, Earth, and Titan, so a mission to\u00A0any other world will need to bring along its own descent engine and fuel supply. The lander will probably need enough fuel for ascent as well, since you can\u0027t really expect to have refueling capacity on most worlds. This means your mothership needs additional fuel to tow the lander, plus heavier engines to compensate for the increased mass. If the lander is going to stay down for any appreciable period of time, it also needs its own separate hab and life support, which means more dead weight, more fuel, and even bigger engines on your mothership. Since resupply would primarily be via Earth launch, this has a tendency to make your costs skyrocket, since the landers and their engines and their fuel PLUS the added fuel for the transfer vehicle all have to be orbited before each mission. To save immediate launch costs, you\u0027ll design each lander for each specific mission, which means they might as well be expendable, which means more down time and fewer overall missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt rapidly becomes apparent that for the case of something like a mission to Ceres or the Moon, you\u0027re really going to come out a lot better if you use just slightly larger engines and simply land the whole ship. Do that, and you no longer have to worry about the lander with its separate engine, separate fuel supply,\u00A0separate life support system and hab, and separate structure. Resupply is simply a matter of orbiting fuel and supplies, standardizing and streamlining the resupply process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is good, because larger engines are also important if you have even the slightest inclination of ever doing extended missions. One major\u00A0point of an interplanetary spaceship with artificial gravity is to allow missions beyond the asteroid belt; this means it will need to carry more supplies and more fuel (all probably mated externally), all requiring more thrust if you want to get moving with any sort of haste.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut here\u0027s where designing for mission flexibility starts to drive you toward something like my design. If your mission profile for a lunar landing requires you to land and take off, then you really need enough takeoff thrust to be able to\u00A0make the trip all the way back to LEO. With your \u0022high-gear\u0022 specific impulse of 520 seconds, getting the 4.8 km/s of dV for the LLO-LEO transfer will require a propellant mass fraction of 61%. Getting from the lunar surface to LLO with your low-gear\u00A0specific impulse of 478 s, then, requires a propellant mass fraction of 29%. Since the dimensions of the vehicle are set by the need for artificial gravity, and these generally dictate dry mass, getting off Luna with a standard gee of acceleration\u00A0will require a liftoff thrust of 49.3 MN.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince it turns out that 49.3 MN is more than enough for a powered takeoff from the Martian surface into LMO, it only makes sense to give it an aerodynamic shell and aerobraking capacity, even if that wouldn\u0027t be the typical mission profile. And a craft with an aerodynamic shell and aerobraking capacity which can SSTO\u00A0from Mars can most certainly manage an empty-tank propulsive landing on Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-25T22:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m fine with flying saucers, but I think the mothership philosophy works best, here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is if we can have separate landers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically make this an entirely vacuum ship, except for maybe aero braking...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T07:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222429710\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132874\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456438136\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127797\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Bill Phil said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m fine with flying saucers, but I think the mothership philosophy works best, here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is if we can have separate landers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically make this an entirely vacuum ship, except for maybe aero braking...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mothership can certainly tow along any number of other vehicles.

Of course we could launch it from Earth, if we design it right. But the great thing about space is that you can have huge mass ratios. The aero shell limits your geometry, and if you want to take full advantage of a vacuum, you can design your ship to survive a few gs,\u00A0and only put a fraction of a g on it at any time.
