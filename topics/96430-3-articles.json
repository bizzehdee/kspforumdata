The Mayfly is nose heavy, and the tri-wing on the front gives it good pitch authority at the low speeds it glides around at. That helps a lot with the landing, since that parachute is barely adequate and you need to pull the craft vertical to make sure it comes down on its tail. The eight tail wings keep the Mayfly upright on the launchpad, and help cushion the landing. It loses about half the tail when it hits the ground. You don\u0027t want to know what happens if it comes down in the water. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tri-wing has the added bonus of turning the Mayfly into an \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Infinite_glider\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInfiniglider\u003C/a\u003E, giving me some quality time with my flightstick. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think the Mayfly is a kludge job, just wait. . .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022You want to use the casing on the probe core as a structural member?\u0022 \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Sure, it\u0027ll hold.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to rip a Stayputnik in half?

Mathematically, at each velocity point, there was a specific pitch setting for the wings that would allow the vehicle to fly straight. But the velocity came up so quickly that there was simply no time to react. Worse, even the smallest adjustment of the control stick was more correction than the vehicle needed, resulting in a deadly oscillation where the operator couldn\u0027t help but over correct.

A prospector\u0027s hat. A ceramic nesting doll. A toy compass. Kinsey picked up the doll, its fixed eyes staring back at her, accusing. Why can\u0027t you make the rocket work? She lifted the lid off, pulled another kerbal out from inside it. And another, and another. And another.

She picked up one of the figurines, empty now, removed the lid. She turned the lower half of the doll over, looked inside it, stared at it for a long moment before picking up the lighthouse with her other hand. She turned it base up and, very carefully, lowered it down into the doll. She held it out, a long, slow smile, the lighthouse staying upright. She rocked it back and forth, the smile getting bigger as the heavy curio stayed put.

There was a bit of light next to the large kinosaur skull that dominated the display, a little shiny something, wedged into the stonework. One of the kinosaur\u0027s teeth maybe?

The janitor secured the rusting bolt lock on the floor hatch, sank down onto the little cot, bleary eyes staring through a paneless window at the rising sun.

The janitor found the motion soothing, her very own railcar in the sky. She could see kerbals down by the water, out along the beach. There were more of them there every day, ever since the pipeline collapse. Kerbals did not need to eat, could survive on sunlight and little else if it came right down to it. And so when times were hard they went to the beach, and many of them ended up staying there. The janitor looked down at her hands, the ink stains now replaced with blisters and calluses, dirt and worse crusted under her nails.
