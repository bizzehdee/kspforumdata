If you are using a Saturn 5 style rocket built from the Nova Punch mods, those big pieces are notorious for wobble. Even the Captain Morgan design is hard to fly to Mun. With proper bracing most designs will fly without the wobble and drifting associated with the forces from flight. This early example flew well with proper bracing;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ndTgbgv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ndTgbgv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was a nightmare to get to fly without the excessive wobble that made it impossible to steer into low orbit;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/93MW7Ty.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002293MW7Ty.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I got the bracing correct, this one was easily flown and landed (crashed because it came down too fast but didn\u0027t blow up,) on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rdESYGU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rdESYGU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spudman2","CreatedById":84199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T00:40:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow...
