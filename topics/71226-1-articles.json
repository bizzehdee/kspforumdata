This will ultimately para-drop 12 kerbals onto the surface of either Duna or Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I came about 200 m/s short of landing on Duna last time I tried (although that was my error, I would have had enough had I taken the time to correct my trajectory early enough). But to further optimize fuel use I removed some unused monoprop, added some more Liquid fuel (which I ran out of first), and added a touch more oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking of adding Kethane to be able to land and perhaps make it back to Kerbin, but the to do list right now is simply landing the Kerbal popcorn on the surface. It will drop them out of the cargo bay essentially like bombs (except my spaceplane has to be upside-down \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E ). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using S2W parts from B9 as well as some other various mods like p-Wings.

Infernal robotics parts do a decent job lifting 5-7 tons without too much flexing (depending on how many extensions are in there) but any more and you have to start using counterweights or locking pins (ie quantum struts) to balance the weight and flex against other parts. I\u0027ve also been experimenting using small \u0022hover lifters\u0022 VTOL probes that have a KAS winch on the bottom to grab things, but my piloting skills are terrible and I havent had much success even using mechjeb to control my hovering lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck, that plane looks great!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
