I posted a small semi-rant about how your craft was not suitable for the challenge, how I thought it was a bit ugly, but yet very functional and creative. That is not so with this craft. This craft looks beautiful in my eyes. I share Xeldrak\u0027s sentiments in that it reminds me of the Harrier jet which looks really cool IMO. The down angled main wing, mixed with the small canards, small control surfaces, and low weight make for a nice little plane that is fun to fly with. You have earned my vote dude.

I did realized where the yaw comes from, I just wondered why you would hide the controll-sufaces in such a way. A simple, vertical stabiler would have looked much better (in my opinion) and would have been simpler. Also the ladders were a detail I looked up at every plane, I wanted the pilot to be able to climb out, walk a few meters and get back into the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@FallingIntoBlack:\u003C/strong\u003E About the size of your plane: While size was not one of the design goals, simplicity was. And your plane is just very big, when it doesn\u0027t need to be - so I think it\u0027s not exactly a good example. Actually, simplicity was the reason I removed the landing chute from my plane and didn\u0027t include a escape mechanism.

I do like the To Aeris Kerbal 3a but the no controllable rudder is a big negative for me. The only Yaw control is with the reaction wheel so pinpoint landings are kind of hard. I did manage to fly everything but for some craft all I got in was a take off and a quick spin around KSC before a landing attempt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I started out testing I was thinking of a few things are good for a trainer considering that most new players probably are not using a joy stick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. A dead stick take off should be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. One engines preferred over two for a trainer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Good yaw control via a proportional rudder for precision landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Stable flight at cruise altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Limited maneuverability without being jerky or twitchy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I did some flights I modified that list some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Dead stick takeoff preferred but if the chance of a tail strike is minimal then slight pitch up is ok to get a nice take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Twin engines ok if a flat spin is fairly easy to recover from. That means you need a good sized rudder. For example the Mayfly recovered very quickly from a flat Spin because of the good rudder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I would accept more maneuverability then I thought because of the combination of fine controls and then SAS off or on. Those combos gives you more options if a plane is too quick to roll or pitch. My plane the Bullfrot for example needs more pitch and slightly more roll control. I should have left the small control surfaces for ailerons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short I am still thinking and I am open to blatant lobby attempts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much time do I have left to vote?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FallingIntoBlack","CreatedById":63836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T13:29:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@\u003Cstrong\u003EXeldrak:\u003C/strong\u003E You make an excellent point.
