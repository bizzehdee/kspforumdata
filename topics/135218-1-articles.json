Now mining is generally repetitive and somewhat dull, crafting on the other hand is where we get to be creative and stretch our imaginations. Some players for this very reason choose to play in \u0022creative\u0022 mode where resources are unlimited, there is no danger, and you can craft as you please. For me personally this is ignoring half the game, and anything constructed in \u0022creative\u0022 or \u0022sandbox\u0022 mode feels somehow hollow and devoid of any hard work or accomplishment. I\u0027m not impressed at all if you built a tower that\u0027s 10,000 blocks tall on creative because you didn\u0027t actually have to mine up any of those materials. Likewise, turning KSP on and having access to all of the best parts/level 3 buildings immediately feels cheap to me. It\u0027s not that it actually is cheap or cheating...just that it robs you of the experiences you might have had by being more limited, if you\u0027ve ever designed something that clearly needed a ladder without a ladder because you didn\u0027t have ladders yet, you know what I\u0027m talking about.\u00A0I guess this just boils down to personal character, some people just want to have free form fun, others want a goal to strive for. To use another example World of Warcraft, I have plenty of friends who \u0022bought\u0022 level 60,70,80,a million or whatever max level is nowadays, but personally I couldn\u0027t enjoy a character I didn\u0027t grind all the way up from level 1.\u00A0Maybe it\u0027s an old-school mentality, I got my first NES at 4 years old...to me a game needs to be able to be \u0022beaten\u0022 via clearly defined win parameters or it\u0027s not a game, maybe were just gluttons for punishment?

An old memory of mine that sticks in my head was a gym class in elementary school where I was stuck playing a game with some kids who thought it most fun to simply smash a ball as hard as they could and the majority of time was spent going after the ball.
