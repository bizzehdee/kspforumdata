Tnen you can set a Maneuver Node (click on your orbital track, select \u0022Set Maneuver\u0022) at either the Ascending or Descending Node shown on the map. Pull the thrust arms out and play around with them until the nodes show \u00220\u0022 or \u0022NaN\u0022 for degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -- Steve\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-12T21:06:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2013 09:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Anton P.

I believe the symbols are a purple triangle/ square (the shapes may not be correct, but I know its purple). you will also want to burn slightly retrograde or you will be adding velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T21:08:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb will tell you using its maneuver node planner.
