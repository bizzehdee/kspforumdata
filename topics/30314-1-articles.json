This should be an equatorial prograde orbit. From the pad, you want to turn along the 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 line (the \u0022D\u0022 direction) only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2) Get your departure timing (called \u0027phase angle\u0027) right. Check \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. You\u0027ll find that you should leave Kerbin when Duna is roughly 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ahead of Kerbin in their paths around the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3) Get your ejection timing (called \u0027ejection angle\u0027) right. Zoom out so you can see Kerbin\u0027s orbit. Find the direction of Kerbin\u0027s travel around the sun. That\u0027s the direction you want to leave Kerbin orbit in. Place a manuver node about 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 opposite that direction on your ship\u0027s orbit around Kerbin, and pull the prograde handle until your projected trajectory escapes Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what the second picture on that web page is showing you, that you want your manuver node to be where the \u0022ship\u0022 icon is in the picture, more or less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 4) It\u0027s more efficient to make corrections earlier in your path than later. You should probably be able to get a Duna encounter from your Kerbin Ejection maneuver node, but if you can\u0027t that\u0027s ok. Time your burns right and make your orbit around the sun get as close to Duna\u0027s as you can. You should only need to adjust them prograde/retrograde at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 5) After you have a trajectory that takes you very close to Duna\u0027s orbit, set Duna as a target and the game will show you where the plane of your orbit crosses the plane of Duna\u0027s orbit with a little green tag. Put a maneuver node there and adjust your orbit normal/antinormal (the pink handles) until that little green tag reads 0.0. This will align your orbital plane with Duna\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 6) Now you should be approaching Duna\u0027s orbital distance from the sun, in the same plane as her orbit, and your trajectory should touch her orbit just about when she\u0027ll be there. If you don\u0027t have an encounter yet, make a new maneuver and adjust your orbit in or out, up or down (blue and green handles) until you find one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 6 and Step 5 can happen interchangeably, it\u0027s better to do large corrections earlier, but it\u0027s more efficient to do your plane correction at the crossing node.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-30T21:33:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2013 09:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Anglave\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GalaxiesFinestToday","CreatedById":60035,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T21:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh ok I see\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
