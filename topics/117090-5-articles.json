Have a few plugin changes to do testing on, then just packaging things up.

Also the solar panels on the SM don\u0027t charge the Orion. At least fix that.\n\nAs [**VenomousRequiem**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/140882-VenomousRequiem) had stated, I\u0027ve taken a time investment vs reward/usability stance on the BPC particle effects; could take hours to figure out/get working, for a part that is used for a whole two minutes during ascent with the effects for only ~2 seconds of that. Having said that, I had already opened up a \u0027known issues\u0027 ticket regarding it a few days ago; so it is on the to-do list and will get done eventually, but do not expect it anytime soon.\n\nAs to the solar panels not charging -- I cannot say as I had seen that problem last I checked. Is it that it is not adding EC to the vessel at all, or that it does not transmit power to the CM? (Have fuel crossflow disabled on the CM, but I don\u0027t think it should effect EC). Will look into this when I have time (hopefully this evening after work). Any more information you can offer would be appreciated.\n\nBTW -- Github issue tickets will get a faster and more reliable response for bug reports. I do not check the forums often, and its notification features are... hit and miss. However, GitHub reliably notifies me whenever a new issue is opened or updated, and I generally respond to/investigate those as soon as I see them.\n\nIn the future, please check the known issues list (such as for the BPC particle effects) before submitting issue reports; and please submit any bug reports through the GitHub issues system -- I cannot guarantee that I will ever see (or remember) issues that are posted here in the thread.\n\nRegards,\n\nShadowmage"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T18:54:52Z","Content":"It happened (not charging) when I tried to simulate the next Orion mission unmanned.
