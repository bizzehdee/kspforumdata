I have seen it as high as 5000 m/s. The ~3000 figure is best case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bigger ship is not always the answer. I modified my own Explorer II class probe, adding 4 radially mounted tanks, with fuel lines to the centre tank. This gave me ~4500 m/s on the probe alone, plus whatever bonus I had in the trans-Moho injection stage. And it wasn\u0027t a \u0022bigger\u0022 ship in the way I was thinking before.
