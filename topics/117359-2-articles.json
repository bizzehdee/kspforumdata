What is missing is diversity, we assume that the lessons of our little corner of the universe would suffice as a template for potential experience and problem solving elsewhere. Black swan theory applies. Humans under recombination evolution, its why we are more complex than bacteria. Recombination offers unanticipated solutions for future problems.\n\nLets give an example, sociobiologist try to understand how humans learn, we then feed the paradigm into a computer algorithm and give it roughly our senses (so for instance we give the computer the ability to see colors, semi-panoramic vision, stereoscopic sound, etc), sense hot and cold, sense smells. And then we give it roughly our facilities. We could also give other abilities, to see infrared, more smells, ultrasound, ultraviolet, gamma, cosmic, neutrinos, etc. Then we set it off on its little way into the great void and it disappears. All the while we find the standard model is complete, and we find the dark energy and dark matter wave and other things. We cannot see these things, but if they are important to see we can build machines that can sense them. The old machine traveling in the void in space is not going to get the richness of experiences, it may have other experiences. So if the ship were human and resources, you could send the humans the instruction to build the new sensors and they could be added. In addition humans will evolve, and our senses will evolve to suit whatever new worlds we make it to (not likely but . . . ).

Von Neumann machines are are based on handwaving, wishful thinking, and science fiction stories. Nobody in the world has any idea how they could be built, or whether they are possible at all. Sapient AI, on the other hand, could feasibly result from incremental development. We already know that sapient machines are possible. We should also have enough computing power to build non-biological ones. All that remains is \u0022mostly engineering\u0022.\n\nThe first sign of real AI will probably be years of confused debate. Experts start to suspect that some systems they have built could be sentient. There will be debate about what that really means, how it could be tested, and how one could actually communicate with an AI. People will debate about ethics, whether AIs should be covered by animal rights laws, whether AI research should be regulated, and whether AIs are really dangerous. The first AIs would not be the omnipotent entities from science fiction. More likely, they would be heaps of research-quality code, full of bugs and beginner mistakes. The AIs would crash often, and the code wouldn\u0027t even compile half the time.\n\nThis could be reality in a few years, or it could take decades or even centuries.

With the advent of CNC manufacturing and, more recently, 3D printing, product complexity has sky-rocketed, while machine complexity is at the same level for each part.\n\n3d printing just increases the complexity of everything. Instead of producing things on-site with simple tools, or mass-producing them at a central facility, we will start using a huge bunch of complex tools for on-site production. While 3d printing can make the on-site production of simple things cost-effective, it won\u0027t change the fact that different tools are good at different tasks, while being completely hopeless at others."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T16:03:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 3d printing just increases the complexity of everything.\n\nYou will need to explain that, because I would argue the opposite is true.

To woodwork a spoon or cabinet on traditional machines, you need a properly filled workshop. With modern CNC equipment, you could do with one machine if you wanted. Yes, it is a more complex machine, but like I said, also much more versatile.\n\nThere is a reason digital manufacturing and printing has taken the industrial world by storm: you can produce much, much more products at a somewhat reduced (but not unusable slow) production speed. Only true mass products are still manufactured in \u0027dumb\u0027 production lines, everything else (including books, bridges and bikeframes) is done in more flexible digital production.
