And then we give it roughly our facilities. We could also give other abilities, to see infrared, more smells, ultrasound, ultraviolet, gamma, cosmic, neutrinos, etc. Then we set it off on its little way into the great void and it disappears. All the while we find the standard model is complete, and we find the dark energy and dark matter wave and other things. We cannot see these things, but if they are important to see we can build machines that can sense them. The old machine traveling in the void in space is not going to get the richness of experiences, it may have other experiences. So if the ship were human and resources, you could send the humans the instruction to build the new sensors and they could be added.

Von Neumann machines are are based on handwaving, wishful thinking, and science fiction stories. Nobody in the world has any idea how they could be built, or whether they are possible at all. Sapient AI, on the other hand, could feasibly result from incremental development. We already know that sapient machines are possible.

Experts start to suspect that some systems they have built could be sentient. There will be debate about what that really means, how it could be tested, and how one could actually communicate with an AI. People will debate about ethics, whether AIs should be covered by animal rights laws, whether AI research should be regulated, and whether AIs are really dangerous. The first AIs would not be the omnipotent entities from science fiction. More likely, they would be heaps of research-quality code, full of bugs and beginner mistakes. The AIs would crash often, and the code wouldn\u0027t even compile half the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be reality in a few years, or it could take decades or even centuries.
