We talked to a lot of people, existing CSS members as well as new ones. At the Ministry of Science we had the LES capsule and the original TM65 Tordenskjold engine on display, and at the Danish Society of Engineers we had HEAT 2X, it\u0027s engine and the front 2.5 meters of HEAT 1600 on display in addition to posters and screens showing videos. It really was a nice little booth and lots of visitors at both exhibitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Saturday, the day after, we assembled VTC3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe large test stand is not designed for HEAT 2X, but rather for handling our wildest dreams. Thus, it is more than capable to keep a TM260 safely within it\u0027s confines during a test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe program for it use is clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst large test in VTC3 will be a full duration burn of HEAT 2X. It\u0027s scheduled for the last day of 2013. Although, there\u0027s still a lot to do on VTC3 before it\u0027s ready for the first test this looks likely to happen. Building the water cooling and flame deflector are huge tasks, nothing in CS is small scale in the CS \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cheavy rocket\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImage text: It requires physical strength to get the heavy concrete blocks in place. The ones on top of the steel frame weighs in at 22.5 metric ton. It almost seems unnecessary to bolt them to the rest of the structure. Photo: Jev Olsen /CS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the flames from the test of HEAT 2X have been extinguished, we will disassemble it and install the first HEAT 1600 air frame with engine in the test stand. It\u0027s been assigned a serial number \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 SM001 and naturally we hope it\u0027ll survive to be flown later. SM001 is designated as the test frame for the the turbine edition of Tordenskjold. With this setup CS will learn how to get turbo pumps to work, no as isolated test subjects, but as integral parts of a running rocket engine and a system of tanks to deliver fuel at the highest rate yet to be seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything concerning the HEAT 1600 rocket is serious work. This rocket is potentially slightly more powerful than a V2 rocket but has a better mass to fuel ratio. This means that not only can it deliver the 800 kilogram CS capsule out of the Earth\u0027s atmosphere \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and far into space \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 but potentially, it\u0027s the building stone for a lot of other projects. Adding a suitable upper stage it would be able to put a considerable amount of mass into orbit, and with a couple of upper stages it could send a small probe to the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s OK to snicker. Alternatively, use a pocket calculator to figure out what happens if you apply the rocket equation to a multi stage rocket where almost 92% of the starting mass is fuel, where the ISP for the first stage is 220 s and for the next stages 250 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 270 s. This provides a lot of delta V. It\u0027s all about applying the math \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 here the rocket equation \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 which builds upon the laws of Sir Isac Newton. That is, if we can get it to work, which is exactly the purpose of the 160 metric ton steel and concrete we\u0027ve built at Refshale\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B8en. Rockets designed to orbit satellites at 7.8 km/s, i.e. LEO, would typically need a delta V around 9 km/s. The remaining 1200 m/s are spent lifting the construction to 200 km above the surface of the earth as well as the wind resistance encountered on the way up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best and absolutely necessary aspect of this is that we can split the project into smaller parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst test of the HEAT 1600 SM001 will be a power pack test where the two turbine pumps are brought up to speed to pump water \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 just like the initial little test where the water cooling tanks of VTC1 was employed to act as the rocket\u0027s system of tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we\u0027ve repeated the tests on the turbine pump sufficiently to debug the system we\u0027ll perform a shot hot test using real fuel. I have chosen to limit the fuel capacity of VTC3 to 1200 kg, which is the amount used for 2X. This provides for 60 seconds burns for HEAT 1600 and the small TM65 engine, and 25 seconds burns for the bigger TM260 engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the tests the skyline of Refshale\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B8en will be adorned by the slim white and black airframe of SM001. The whole stack comprising flame deflector, steel frame and air frame will stand 20 meters high and I can\u0027t wait to see it illuminated some time in 2014 on count down night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn CS I\u0027ve often experienced the most amazing intrinsic feature that if I take one step backwards, ten people step up. What I mean is, that if I for some reason need to take a breather then others will step in, take over and ensure the continued progress of the project. One might fear that CS is a machine managed from the top where everybody are dependent upon a single person, but it\u0027s not like at all. CS people dig in and create good stuff, even when I\u0027m not around acting like a project manager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImage text: Pulling the strings is a minor role. The best part is to be involved yourself. Photo: Jev Olsen /CS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s really is about making sure that I\u0027m to be there to enjoy it all \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 otherwise they\u0027ll just carry on without me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a sign of a healthy organisation. Last week I was moaning about plates for the HEAT 1600, which were cut out wrong. I quickly send a mail to our internal mailing list to the effect that you\u0027re not allowed to touch anything without me being present. These things must not happen. But even before I had pressed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csend\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 the problem had been solved by Andreas and Carsten. They had assembled the rear dome for HEAT 1600 using the plates I thought Ditte had cut out wrong so that it couldn\u0027t be assembled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese kind of things happens frequently and I bit my tongue when I don\u0027t have the courage to trust people. Thank god they are so self-propelled that they are indifferent to the Madsen control freak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach year CS launches one rocket only. It may not seem much but because they\u0027re all different development models it\u0027s a rather tall task. Imagine ESA launching a new type of rocket every year. Not a new version of Ariane 5, but a Ariane 3 one year, then an Ariane 4 next year, an Ariane 5 the next and Ariane 6 the year after... It would likely require a lot of overtime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mode of working for CS ends with HEAT 1600. This is our work horse and it\u0027s so well proportioned that it\u0027d take serious interruption before the format becomes insufficient. e.g. HEAT 2X is too small for pumps, but this will never be an issue for HEAT 1600. We might therefore see the rate of launches increase in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImage text: CS Heavy Goods have finalized this stage of VTC3.

Well, we are working towards it; developing and simplifying the technology to suit the Danish conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do this as amateurs is special. It takes a heavy toll on our full time people, but they like it. It\u0027s a curious fact that there a place in Denmark exists, which you can go to if you need to play with space suits or parachutes, submarines, construction equipment, cranes and violent rocket engines \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 or dabble in ultra high end radio or boil something seriously highly concentrated inorganic chemistry. But we have such a place in this country.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s called Copenhagen Suborbitals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T17:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh my...you guys started with a goal of suborbital flight.
