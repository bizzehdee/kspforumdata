Re-built it because of the new swept wings and small landing gear (great job btw PorkJet). I set the inside control surfaces to deployed for flaps on takeoff. When I launch however, they are not deployed (I had to use the action group I set up to deploy them). This is a very minor annoyance/lowest concern, but they should maintain their state from the SPH to the runway."}]}
