This is a simple heavy lifter family which is also reliable. Unfortunately, it has not yet been rated to carry anything more than 200 tons of cargo, but I have no doubts that it can carry much more.

I have provided you with a simple example cargo, but it can be removed so you can turn the main rocket into a subassembly. Don\u0027t forget to strut tall cargo as well as adjust fairings as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this version is not specifically designed to be deorbited. I am still refining the design to correct certain deficiancies. However, it is highly suggested that you jettison your main lifting stage while still suborbital and use the smaller stage after that to circularize and perform any orbital maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T00:01:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 12:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sampa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leptoon","CreatedById":71789,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T09:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using your lifter to launch an unmanned 240 tonne upper stage including a \u0027Honeybadger\u0027 rover and enough fuel to get to Minmus.

I moved the booster tanks a bit lower and reconfigured them for a modified parallel staging method (a.k.a. asparagus) to add a few hundred extra \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv. I also added two sepetrons to each booster tank and a lot of radiator panels to the main engine. Update: I had to move the sepetrons down to the bottom of the booster tanks and put uliage thrusters on top to safely push the tanks away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2dfOik6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222dfOik6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, the FAR enabled KW fairings that this vehicle uses are no longer included with KW Rocketry, so I had to manually edit the craft file to remove them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate - It\u0027s still not enough to get into LKO...
