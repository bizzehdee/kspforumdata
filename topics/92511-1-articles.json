However, I now think it is not the solar panels which are exploding, but the octagonal struts they are connected to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo elaborate, there have been several instances where I start a maneuver, hear an explosion, inspect the craft, and find one or more solar panels missing. In every case, the panels have been attached to octagonal struts, which also go missing. Once or twice, I\u0027ve spotted the panels, unharmed, receding into the distance. This is why I now think the octagonal struts are exploding, and not the panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn one craft, I attached four octagonal struts radially to a hitchhiker storage container, and another four radially to a mobile processing lab, then attached solar panels to all eight of the struts. The four struts attached to the hitchhiker storage container all exploded at one point or another during the mission. The four attached to the lab all survived. Therefore, I think the problem has something to do with the part the octagonal strut is connected to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not satisfied with the way some attachments look. For instance, when I attach a part radially to the hitchhiker storage container or the mobile processing lab, the attached part seems to be embedded partially beneath the surface. That\u0027s why I use octagonal struts to attach my solar panels -- I prefer to have my panels raised above the surface of the craft, rather than embedded within it. I use Editor Extensions and the offset tool to make everything look as clean as possible. I has occurred to me that, while my placement may look clean, it may actually violate KSP\u0027s laws of physics, and that\u0027s why the struts are exploding. But even if that is the explanation, I\u0027m not sure what to do about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-TC\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T15:17:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESame happened to me again connected panels to struts.....only was I can fix is to put in a fairing....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyster","CreatedById":147672,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T02:18:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you check to see if it is a an overheating issue?
