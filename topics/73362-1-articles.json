In my case I was attached to a container with about 300 tons of metal. even with the line streched taunt I ended up surgeing forward and springing back once I turned on the gas. if you are very very gentle on throttling up you might avoid that. The other problem is you still need to care about the COM of what your towing. if you are not flying strait away from the COM you\u0027ll swing tward it. if you were prety close it wont be much and you might stabalize although possibly off vector. If your further off alignment you\u0027ll swing like a pendulum and may not regain controll without crashing. your better off with a ridged connection to the object you want to move.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-25T19:19:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis question about how to play the game has been moved to the gameplay questions sub-forum.
