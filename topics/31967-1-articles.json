First off, I want to say I am NOT complaining, I just want to know why KSP now takes aprox. 10 minutes to load with a few mods? Now, before you yell at me saying \u0022Ohhh the Devs aren\u0027t responsible for you using mods to lag your game!\u0022 I am simply asking why it now takes longer, and if this can/will be fixed in 0.20.

More importantly, how many GB is your GameData folder? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the mods that still use the old folder structure take longer to load, so that might be a factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty much down to how fast your machine can load data from your hard drive, faster harddrives and faster memory help. I have about 1.8GB in GameData and about 400mb in the old parts folder, but I have it installed on a Raptor Harddrive (10,000rpm), it loads in just a couple of mins.
