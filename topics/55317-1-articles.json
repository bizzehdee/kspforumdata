I first started with this idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/REjxcQG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022REjxcQG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the VAB editor seems to hate it, and whenever i try to move anything or whatever, parts get sticked to my cursor, and all the buttons stop working. I have to alt\u002BF4 or task manager out of KSP. When i reload, i get the same problem again and again. Sometimes i somehow manage to stick a subassembly rocket and hit the Launch button, but it bugs the hell out in the launch pad too. Sometimes it starts horizontally, missing all the arms altogether. And it always starts with missing parts, which are either fixed floating at some point close to the rocket, or laying on the ground nearby. The thing has 560 parts, and im pretty certain i\u0027ve built and launched things with more parts with no problems (problems with bugs i mean lol).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen i tried to simplify it a bit, and built this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iOLLiD2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iOLLiD2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd i get exactly the same problems. I tried rebuilding it from scartch many times, I even tried enabling part clipping in the cheat menu, but it was all useless. I\u0027m wondering, what the hell im i doing wrong here? Does the editor hate this type of building or does it simply hate me? Is it the parts clipping, or is it too big, or... i don\u0027t know! I\u0027m pretty sure i\u0027ve seen similar things in videos and so on, not to mention Whackjob\u0027s work here in the forums... Don\u0027t know, im pretty lost here guys...
