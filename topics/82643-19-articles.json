It didn\u0027t actually significantly affect my design constraints, it just increased my build time. The way I design, I eliminate torque from thrust if at all possible. The reason I include reaction wheel modules (and I do still use the boxsat reaction wheel module sometimes) is to have an agile craft that is easy to reorient. So what I so when building with boxsat is to simply place other parts on the craft in places to as precisely counteract the mass imbalance as possible. This means that the only real effect of the stack node offset is to add 20 or 30 seconds to the time to place one or two parts on my satellite, and make me re-do that any time I change my satellite design.\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, it\u0027s annoying instead of interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave to agree with what this guy is saying.

CKAN is a horrible platform as it doesn\u0027t get all of the files needed most of the time.
