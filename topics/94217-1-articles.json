Your decoupler is aligned in such a way as to stay attached to the engine, fairing and all. I can tell because of the way the red triangle is pointing. If you haven\u0027t researched stack separators yet, then you can create a makeshift one by putting two decouplers in series with the red triangles pointing away from each other.

Decouplers essentially decouple whatever is below them. The red triangle should point towards whatever part is becoming active. The flat part shows what part it stays attached to. That\u0027s why when you decouple it detaches the docking port. You can flip it over or in the future you can use a separator, which detaches on both sides.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T07:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eexplosive decoupling.
