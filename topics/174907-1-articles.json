When you auto strut to root or heaviest it can do weird things as the struts try to attache themselves, especially when you dock something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your case though I\u00A0think you can get away with either one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-13T20:31:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, when do we use rigid attachment?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-13T20:52:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRigid attachment is usually more for things like multi-compound airplane wings.
