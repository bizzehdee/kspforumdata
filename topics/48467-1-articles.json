Because I didn\u0027t find an existing part, I decide to try make my own one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow hard can modding be anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start, I copy the Mk2-R Radial-Mount Parachute and change the values in the part.cfg. I thought for a first step this should be ok, after that I could change texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I realised the chute opens at a high of 2500 m as configurated, but seems to have drag like a normal Mk2-R. I googled a bit and found that (at the moment?) the drag of a parachute is calculated \u0027mass x drag coefficent\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first question is how to modify the drag coefficent to get a behaviour like a drogue chute?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly after the update I want to play with Ferram Aerospace Research (again).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat should I consider that FAR calculates my chute correctly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerodynamics of FAR are really great, are there any plans to integrate this in the vanilla game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreetings Voidi\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T14:49:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess that you are using ModuleParachut?
