Though some oddities/bugs have shown up that I\u0027m trying to address: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s a bit part-heavy, coming in at around 180 parts. But I\u0027ve certainly seen worse. Nevertheless it does mean that putting more than one of these out on the field is going to make things start to get laggy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The system that I used to get a Kerbal in and out of the tank no longer seems to work right. I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s a fault of the craft or of the specific set of mods I have running. Currently you can use Crew Manifest to get a Kerbal OUT of the Mako, but you can\u0027t get them back IN. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When I made the Mako back in .25, the root part was a Rovemax module (buried deep inside the center of the frame) but I mounted it sideways. This caused no issues back then, but in 1.04, if you use the improved chase cam mod, it thinks the left side of the tank is the front and the right side is the rear. In all other respects though, it is unaffected. Mechjeb for example will navigate properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut these are minor issues and I think I can fix them (particularly that last one - since I can now make the root part the cockpit pod instead of the Rovemax module.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it a fun craft to work with, and I hope anyone else using it will like it as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used a LOT of mods to create this, I hope this is the full list, but if you load it and find something missing, let me know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod parts required: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 Aerospace (Cameras. some struts and the headlights)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAviation Lights (the \u0022brake lights\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELackluster Labs (LLL) Most of the body pieces\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Fairings (the sides of the \u0022nose\u0022) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Foundries Wheels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBD Armory (Guns and Countermeasures) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealchutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot needed but HIGHLY recommended: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb and the mod that allows mechjeb to be used with all pods. Mainly for help with the dynamic stability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVessel Viewer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaster Prop Moniter (with this, you can actually see OUT of the Mako from the cockpit through the cameras placed around the hull - if you don\u0027t want to bother with that, then remove the cameras, it\u0027ll reduce the part count) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew Manifest (almost required to move Kerbals in and out (but see above for problems with that) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how does this version of the Mako handle? Pretty damn nice I must say. The KW Wheels really do a nice job of recreating the whole \u0022Stable yet bouncy\u0022 feel of the original from Mass Effect. You can go up to 20-21 MPS on level ground and the wheels will handle at least as much as 30-40 on a down-slope. You can get the wheels off the ground in a tight turn and even tip it over, but you have to be REALLY TRYING HARD to do so! These pics here with the lifted tires were done when I was pulling the Mako HARD over at a full 20 Meters per second! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(There is ONE oddity you\u0027ll have to address when you load it up. For some reason the left-right steering is reversed and I can\u0027t adjust it in the SPH. When you load it on the runway, right click on each wheel and click \u0022invert steering\u0022 on each wheel individually. Then it\u0027ll drive correctly.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fe2jD2Q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fe2jD2Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iMpEr2E.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iMpEr2E.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - the scale of the Mako is more correct than others I\u0027ve seen. This is more like a standard sized rover and will easily pass through the underpass in the research section of the launch site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hbFmsTG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hbFmsTG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe brake lights work and the Mako if stopped HARD from 20 MPS will nose dive but will NOT scrape the nose on the ground (unless you\u0027re on a steep incline or hard terrain). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Vnjn2qT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Vnjn2qT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe headlights are BRIGHT and will illuminate everything you need to see. And there\u0027s four of them, so you can afford to lose a couple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L7ZLc0c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022L7ZLc0c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe turrent works and spins a full 360 degrees. The main gun is the BD Armory Howitzer. The main drawback is that it only has 20 shots. So make them count! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wJ2I1FS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wJ2I1FS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe coaxial guns are Hidden Vulcans. And they have enough ammo to deal with minor ground targets. Only drawback is that they don\u0027t traverse up and down. But they\u0027ll point wherever the turret is pointing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nh7QF9r.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nh7QF9r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem with this version of the Mako in terms of taking it into an actual fight is that it\u0027s really not armored. I figure you\u0027d need to get by with speed and maneuverability - dodging around the shots of slower vehicles and finding an opening for a shot. And any missile hit would wreck it instantly. So I gave the Mako countermeasures against missiles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ptTiOgT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ptTiOgT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does the Mako climb?

Enough so that I think this version of the Mako earns it\u0027s place on the \u0022Mountain Climbing\u0022 team. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pU6nZ0I.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pU6nZ0I.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly - this version of the Mako has Monoprop Engines, but they aren\u0027t enough to actually lift it. Or even really cushion a fall fully in full Kerbin gravity. I\u0027m looking into the possibility of a version that uses Bajamoto\u0027s \u0022Pop out\u0022 engines. But for now, this Mako CAN be airdropped with a combination of Parachutes and the Monoprop Engines! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6UWUaDT.png\u0022 alt=\u00226UWUaDT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bd8m9KY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bd8m9KY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FMrrh74.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FMrrh74.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sewbDS9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sewbDS9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you have it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the download link for the craft file.
