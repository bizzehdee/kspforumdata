And often we find ourselves in unfamiliar territory and dealing with things which there are actions which are required but we do not take any pleasure in doing. For the last few posts there have been some statements of a speculative nature made which others are ***assigning*** meaning to which, to be quite honest, is not helpful and is actually harmful to the forum community. With this in mind, I would like to bring the following to mind: \n\n1. Every moderator sings a non-disclosure agreement (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E). They are on file with Squad and it\u0027s parent company, Take-Two.\n2. When we say that we cannot talk about certain moderation issues, we **mean we cannot do it because of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E we signed.** And as with any contract, there are consequences that happen if we break the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E. We enjoy what we do because it allows us to give back to the KSP community. So, please respect our efforts and accept it when we tell you we can\u0027t discuss certain things.\n3. Do not badger the moderation team or fuel random speculation based on when we have to tell you *sorry, we cannot comment on \\_\\_\\_\\_ at this time*. Doing so only adds to tensions about certain aspects of moderation, forum management, and moderator-forum user relations. While **Forum Guideline 3** does offer general guidance. Particularly,\n\n- **3.3 Open discussion of staff decisions:** *Do not openly discuss action (or inaction) taken by the staff (bans, warnings etc.). If you have concerns about a moderator action, see 3.4 below.*\n- **3** **.4 Contesting moderation action:**  *All of the moderators are active community members who try to set a good example and apply the rules as appropriately as possible, but they are only human and can make mistakes from time to time. If you disagree with something they have done, please contact them or a senior moderator privately, and the issue will be re-examined.*\n\nThat\u0027s it. If you disagree with a moderator\u0027s action, the rules are clear. Don\u0027t openly discuss it in the open on any thread. Do it in a private message. We will be more than happy to discuss an individual moderating issue which you are a party to in a private message. Please do not think of this as a personal invitation to talk about *any* moderation action you are interested in. If it does not involve you directly then we **cannot and will not discuss it with you**.  \n\nSo, please, after this post, no further speculation on moderator actions involving banning forum members, banning forum members who happen to be moderators, speculation about such moderation actions, promoting such speculation as fact, or pressuring moderators to provide you answers which run afoul of our non-disclosure agreement (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E) can and probably will be met with an official warning under Forum Rule 3.3 and/or Forum Rule 3.4.\n\nThank you for your cooperation and help in keeping our forum operating smoothly and inviting to fans of Kerbal Space Program and Kerbal Space Program 2 of all ages!"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-13T17:21:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Fraston said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Not like it matters, but does it take up a name change slot?\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, 5thHorseman said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Does that use up their one and only name change?\n\u003E \n\nNo, it doesn\u0027t.

The original KSP is very mod-able, it\u0027s pretty stable now, and you can virtually play it any way you want to play a game about space exploration - largely thanks to the modding community and the excellent support and attention given to the community by [@SQUAD](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/66485-squad/). It\u0027s a combination which rarely happens in the computer gaming industry. There are always going to be really great and long-played \u0022cult pc games\u0022 out there; KSP is one of them.
