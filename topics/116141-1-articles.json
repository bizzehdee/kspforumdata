I researched fuel lines, added them to a few ships, etc. Then I come back more recently, and fuel lines are no longer available in the VAB or SPH, and my ships with them are listed as invalid. When I look in the R\u0026amp;D Lab, I can see that they\u0027ve been researched and the parts purchased. I\u0027m guessing that something borked when the game was saved at some point.
