I need the full zip file as we uninstalled the entire game (saved his save file). Does server migration really take this long? I can download the 1.05 MAC version, and the windows installer, but the full 1.05 for windows wont download and has been on server migration for a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI followed Reds advice and flushed the DNS Cache, but to no avail.
