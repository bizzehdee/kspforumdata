It was introduced during the latter half of WWII for the RAF, and I believe it was their first Jet Fighter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis reproduction roughly resembles it, and has similar performance under 4500 metres: Subsonic to Transonic speeds, similar G-forces during hard maneuvers, similar take-off and landing speeds, etc. The major difference with this model is it\u0027s speed over 5000 metres to 8100 metres: It\u0027s supersonic, achieving Mach 1.4 reliably without any additions to the current plane. Acceleration to that speed isn\u0027t great, but it will do it. Anything from a standstill to 300 m/s it\u0027s fairly quick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s powered by two J-33 Weasley engines, on two dual cooler assemblies, with a round intake at the front. Each Engine assembly is mounted midway on the main wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding gear is a simple Tricycle setup. It\u0027s simple, reliable, and tough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane has a easy predictable manner to it, but sensitive enough for quick maneuvers. It has a honest 490 km range, but it will go 510 km (or 45 minutes) until the tanks go dry. It can pretty much cover nearly 1/2 of Kerbin directly adjacent to KSC. Trips to the North Pole take 19 minutes, and you\u0027ll have enough room for a safe return trip. Trips to KSC2 it will do in 23 minutes, but you will be gliding to KSC for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a good plane to get used to flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e216/Max_Payne_0001/screenshot43_2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot43_2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e216/Max_Payne_0001/screenshot44_2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot44_2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e216/Max_Payne_0001/screenshot45_1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot45_1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e216/Max_Payne_0001/screenshot46_1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot46_1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e216/Max_Payne_0001/screenshot47_2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot47_2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T00:54:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 12:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GDJ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScriptKitt3h","CreatedById":82780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T21:48:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPictures?
