Red Kerman\u0027s father managed to wipe out hostile forces across the outer system by driving them away with force, and the final fortress of the Kerbol Empire is Moho. Red Kerman decided to stop wars. Red Kerman boarded an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E built using a DIY kit sold by Yippee Kerman and headed for Moho. To show his love for peace instead of war, he brought no soldiers -- only himself. The emperor of Kerbol Empire though that this was a good chance to revive his power. When Red Kerman arrived, he imprisoned Red Kerman while also treating him as an emperor. Red Kerman was given first-class servants and maids, as well as delicacies that were baked by Kerbol\u0027s glows on Moho. Red Kerman\u0027s sister, Reddish Kerman, was informed of her brother\u0027s being in prison and issued an ultimatum to the Kerbol Empire. \u0022Release Red Kerman, or Moho, as well as your empire, will cease to exist.\u0022 Reddish Kerman was temporarily acting for her brother\u0027s position, but the Kerbol Empire took it seriously because they feared the armed forces of the Kerbal Empire. So they decided that Red Kerman would be released 6 hours later, on 00:00 of Day c, Month b, Year a, UTC. The final meal for Red Kerman in Kerbol Empire was a feast. This time the food is prepared in Kerbin conditions, by the best chefs in the Kerbol Empire who used cutting-edge technology to create a complete Kerbalized ecosystem on Moho. Red Kerman was very happy and ate a lot. In fact, he ate too much. Then he was sent to space on his own \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Howver, at this time Red Kerman was too heavy and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E had poor maneuverability. While trying to dock to Kerbol Empire\u0027s Moho Orbital Space Station, Red Kerman used up all his monopropellant on the way and unluckily spun out of control, because his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters went flame-out when the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E was turning. Red Kerman realized the the DIY kit did not include reaction wheels. So Red Kerman could not stop his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E from spinning. Without fuel, he could not remain in the dark side of Moho. Soon Red Kerman witnessed the last sunrise of his life. Kerbol\u0027s glaze melted his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and all that other Kerbals could find, was a dust of plastic and destroyed organics orbiting Moho from that day on. Twelve days later, the angry troops of Kerbal Empire wiped out the last hostile forces in the Kerbol system by driving them away with force.
