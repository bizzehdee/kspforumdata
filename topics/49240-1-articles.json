My thought is, you can make a large sciency rocket and then when you re-enter you could decouple the science section with chutes and land your capsule with another chute, that way you don\u0027t over power the standard chute.

If you let a package go from orbit and don\u0027t follow it (you stay with the ship in orbit) the parachute won\u0027t work, there will be no atmospheric friction and it will be completely destroyed (deleted) by the game when it decides it has hit the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe correct way is to follow the package all the way down by switching focus to it ([ and ] keys).

I\u0027ve also turned my ship upside down - this is just a safety precaution since as soon as the chute opens the module will slow down.
