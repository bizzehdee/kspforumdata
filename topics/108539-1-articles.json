Considering we have the huge Mark3 monoprop tank we use for shuttles, this may make the Mark-55 more useful an engine.\n\nYou can base the ISP stats on the OT-10 Puff engine, but I feel it should provide the same amount of thrust using Monoprop, or maybe slightly less. \n\nThank you in advance for your time and effort to make this mod."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T08:35:01Z","Content":"Dropbox: [Thudmod.cfg](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tu3qb028gniahew/Thudmod.cfg?dl=0)\n\nThe Mk. 68 \u0022Chunk\u0022 Multi-Modal Engine produces 100 thrust in Monoprop mode at the same ISP as the OT-10 Puff, which is 20 less than it provides in LOX mode which was unchanged from the original."},{"CreatedByName":"Haze-Zero","CreatedById":71279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T04:52:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Dropbox: [Thudmod.cfg](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tu3qb028gniahew/Thudmod.cfg?dl=0)\n\u003E The Mk. 68 \u0022Chunk\u0022 Multi-Modal Engine produces 100 thrust in Monoprop mode at the same ISP as the OT-10 Puff, which is 20 less than it provides in LOX mode which was unchanged from the original.\n\nAwesomes, thank you so much."}]}
