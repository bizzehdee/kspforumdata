All of my saved games were there and I had all the new parts, but when I went to create a network it wont show up. I\u0027ve got a satellite in orbit with the RA-15 relay antenna and the Communotron HG-55, it has full batteries and is directly over the ksp center so it should have a connection. But nothing is showing up, there isn\u0027t even anything to say that the network isn\u0027t there. It literally doesn\u0027t exist. I\u0027ve tried creating a new game and it works there, but in all my previous games (pre update) it doesn\u0027t work. I\u0027d appreciate any help in trying to fix this. I\u0027m pretty new to ksp and don\u0027t want to have to start all over from the beginning.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T18:15:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170275-rubikx/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022170275\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170275-rubikx/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@rubikx\u003C/a\u003E, please make sure the commnet is enabled, you can do this for old saves in the mini menu, while at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E just click Pause Menu or press Escape, then click Settings, Difficulty Options, you\u0027ll find it in there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
