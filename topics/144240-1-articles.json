With the addition of a stock communication mechanic, I assume it will be necessary to make similar networks. Maybe once a satellite has been moved into the desired position it can be \u0027locked\u0027 into that position relative to the other sats in the network? It would skimp on realism of the orbital mechanics, but essentially what it would do is once a satellite\u00A0is in a similar orbit (as precisely as the game currently defines orbits for \u0022put a ship in this orbit\u0022 contracts, with a little leeway) to another satellite in that network*, it would automatically be teleported into a perfectly synchronized orbit with that satellite. It would be a bit harder than a normal \u0022Put a sat in this orbit\u0022 contract, because the comms sats would have to be placed into a specific place in the orbit** (for the first sat this wouldn\u0027t matter). All sat locations would be shown in the map view and predefined based on the first sat in the network. If the first sat was placed in an eccentric orbit, the spots for the other sats would be shown moving in the map view/tracking station moving along their orbits as the sat would making a flower shape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*The player would create a network with a button in the probe core/command pod\u0027s right-click menu, such as: [Add to Network]. Clicking on it would open a box where you could a) name a new network to put the satellite in and define how many satellites will be in that network\u00A0or b) select a network from a list of networks previously created via method (a). Additional mechanics could be implemented so that more complex networks like synchronized Kolniya orbits or highly inclined orbits would be possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n**That spot could be selectable as a target so that one could use a maneuver node to find an encounter with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the above points would be very useful to implement in 1.2, considering that it will be necessary to build working, long-lasting communication networks in the stock game, and it\u0027s no use having a stock feature that needs a mod like MechJeb or Hyperedit to work correctly. If a mechanic to make timewarp-safe comms networks is already in progress at Squad, please let me know and this might become a discussion thread on that mechanic instead of the one I am proposing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-21T01:37:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2016 01:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by cubinator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T02:28:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222684933\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144240\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469064858\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150330\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cubinator\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n52 minutes ago, cubinator said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the addition of a stock communication mechanic, I assume it will be necessary to make similar networks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ll need \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105198\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RoverDude\u003C/a\u003E to confirm this but I\u0027m pretty sure you will NOT need to make similar networks, or at the very least not as EXTENSIVE of networks.
