This proposed replacement mission does pretty much the same thing, except there would be an asteroid there for the astronauts to examine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main extra cost of the mission is the big solar electric propulsion (SEP) stage that goes to the asteroid and brings it back.

That would be an intermediate mission with less delta-v and less duration than a trip to Mars orbit, and no lander needed. And it would test out a deep-space habitat that could be identical to the one used for Mars missions, and also mission operations with significant light-speed delay. After that a mission to Phobos or Deimos would be the next harder step. A robotic sample-return mission to Mars would test entry, descent, and landing of heavy payloads, an ascent vehicle, and maybe In-Situ Resource Utilization. Then we would have all the ingredients for a crewed Mars landing. A lunar outpost might help test a surface habitat, but the gravity and surface environment on Mars is very different than the one on the Moon so it wouldn\u0027t have much value. A lunar outpost would also be very costly since so much delta-v is needed to land stuff on the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
