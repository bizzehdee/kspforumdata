The reason being that if you don\u0027t have a fuel supply on the ground then your lander needs to land with all the fuel for the return trip on board. The landing phase is the least efficient part of the trip, you\u0027re going slow and burning straight down, so the heavier the ship is on landing the more fuel you\u0027re going to waste on the round-trip even if on paper the delta-v is the same. That is the only difference, but it is a big one in terms of return per trip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T17:40:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mover between the surface and orbit wants the absolute minimum equipment on board since every gram hurts the bottom line. No refineries, no drills, no ore containers, just fuel, engines, and landing legs. Assuming you have KAS or some other way to transfer resources on the ground it\u0027s much better to leave the refining equipment stationary. The trip down to join the drill for example should contain enough fuel for the trip down but not back up. Refuel on the ground and bring it to the orbital depot. Offload all fuel except enough to go down again. This way you don\u0027t need ore storage and fuel storage on the mover (heavy), just fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe argument against this is if you need something other than fuel bi propellant, say liquid fuel only for a nuclear engine. Then your mover might need LF/OX while your cargo is just LF or something else as ore eventually might serve a different purpose. You might want LF/OX making capability on the ground still (carrying round trip fuel is expensive) but perhaps you need a separate cargo and mover fuel container.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shallowest gravity well is best for both the mover\u0027s consideration and the benefit of refueling craft headed for points beyond which is why Minmus is much more appealing than Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
