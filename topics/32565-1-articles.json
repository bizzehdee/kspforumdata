Bought the game on Steam a few days ago and I gotta say I\u0027m loving it so far. It\u0027s a good mixture of realism and fun and why I might not be able to understand how to a lot of things such as building Space Stations, docking with another ship in orbit, keeping my Kerbles alive, etc, I\u0027m still enjoying the game. It indeed keeps me busy while I\u0027m bored at work on my laptop so it\u0027s done rather well on that point. I\u0027ve been watching some of the vids that Scott Manley has done and that\u0027s helped out a lot. It\u0027s actually helped me get into Orbit several times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I downloaded a few addo-ns such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EH.O.M.E 1.0.3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKosmos sspp R43\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENova Punch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand haven\u0027t the slightest clue how to use them! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E So there\u0027s that... but it\u0027s still awesome and I have so many Ideas that the base game could include. it would be cool if the Base game could absorb some of these mods into itself so you wouldn\u0027t have to DL them separately or just perhaps being able to DL them through the KSP Client itself. If anyone has any tips for improving my Game play experience please do tell! Tips on Anything! Anything to say! I dun care what it is!
