Most of the surface-attachable parts I\u0027ve made have either used their origin as the actual attachment point, or they were oriented to match being placed on the side of a rocket or something like that. I\u0027ve never had any problems with it before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now I\u0027m trying to make an engine with a surface attachment point that matches it\u0027s top stack node. If you put it on the side of a fuel tank, this means that without any additional rotation, it would stick out to the sides, but that\u0027s OK. The problem I\u0027m having is that the VAB is not honoring the location of the attachment node I\u0027m giving it, but instead is attaching by the part\u0027s origin, down in the middle of the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\tnode_stack_top = 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3\u003Cbr\u003E\tnode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -3.05, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 3\u003Cbr\u003E\tnode_stack_attach = 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis results in the engine\u0027s top end sinking a full meter into the parent object, because it\u0027s acting as though I gave it \u00220,0,0\u0022 instead of \u00220,1,0\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T14:36:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo ideas?
