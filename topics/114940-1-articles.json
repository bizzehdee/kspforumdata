I deployed my chutes too early and was heading for certain doom into the ocean. At around 100 meters from the surface my ship suddenly shattered to pieces and the cockpit hit near light speed as it soared into deep space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the thing....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t play the game anymore due to this. Even when I started a brand new game I would be in the same predicament. When I went back to the base the screen would have the lower bar but the scene would be of space. I was forced to reinstall the game to correct it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose I\u0027ll wait a few more months before picking the game up again. Seems you guys still have some major bugs to work out. Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was on the 32 bit version and had absolutely no mods installed (I wouldn\u0027t have bothered to report this if I had mods installed.) I\u0027ll check this thread tomorrow if you have any questions.

The second restart was from Steam, meaning I had exited the game entirely. Both times I had the same glitch. I didn\u0027t think to preserve the save file.. Sorry. I honestly didn\u0027t even think to post this until I reinstalled the game. I was understandably peeved from the game being unplayable so wasn\u0027t thinking clearly. I was using cheats when this occurred. Infinite fuel, unbreakable joints, no crash damage, ignore max temperature and infinite RCS in sandbox (I just wanted so see what Eve looked like with my new PC.) This may have played a part in the ship disintegrating. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecs: Copied from Speccy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 8.1 64-Bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntel Core i7 4790 @ 3.60GHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 800MHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMotherboard: Alienware 0PGRP5 Socket 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENvidia Geforce GTX 760-Ti 2GB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps a little and sorry again for not having the save..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
