Well rather establishing a permanent presence there since at best there will be a dozen kerbals there. One around Eve waiting for a Kerbin return window. A munbase, two space stations in Kerbin space and a kethane base on duna which waits for a lander, tanker and surface rover. Those three are still waiting for a transfer window. There\u0027s also a probe to Eeloo which will definitely not get into orbit around it as I forgot to adjust the delta-v for the highly unusual orbit of Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"way2smrt","CreatedById":62502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T15:57:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E30 missions in progress, mostly because my ships don\u0027t come back \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T16:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOver 20, I have a lot of abandoned ships (Mun Base, Space Station, etc...) and like 10 Flags.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Storm1","CreatedById":66069,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T22:32:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had over 50...
