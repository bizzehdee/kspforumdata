I posted this, and I liked the idea so much I thought I\u0027d expand upon it. Here\u0027s my original post:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI personally dislike having a wide variety of scientific tools that simply collect their own unique data. It means that after I unlock them, I have to build a new spacecraft to visit all of the places I\u0027ve already been to, in order to collect science with all of them. I\u0027d prefer if we could instead have data collection materials early on, and later get various science modules and effects that allow us to do things that can increase our science output. Best of all, they should be able to work remotely. Example: new temperature processing computer, must scan temperatures in each biome over an extended period of time but can just transmit the data from already existing thermometers on-site to KSC where the computer is. Portable computers could be brought along on missions to collect and store the temperature data, if you prefer to return home rather than set up a communications network.\u003Cp\u003ESo basically you don\u0027t have to send a new mission all the way out to Duna to get new temp readings, instead you hop in your existing Duna settlement and send some missions out to various biomes with thermometers (because you already have them on Duna) to collect new readings. There is still work to be done after you research new tech, but you don\u0027t necessarily have to bring tools all the way from home every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there could still be a few data gathering tools you unlock later, high tech stuff that doesn\u0027t make sense to be available at the start. But with a wide variety of data collection tools available to begin with, you can immediately work toward setting up permanent bases with tools on-site, which can be used later (and transported short distances) to collect and analyze more science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETO BE CLEAR: you still have work to do after you unlock new science, you just don\u0027t have to ship tools all the way from home\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis goes along with an earlier idea I had in which you would start with a wider variety of parts, but you could have lower-tech, scrappier versions of the parts. This way there is still much value in unlocking new parts, but there would be a wider range of options available to you if you know how to build.

Later, when you unlock better technology, you can rescue your kerbals and even have them fly their own crappy lander back home. You can also use said docking port to attach batteries, solar panels, or other things to existing structures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDecoupler:\u003C/span\u003E no ejection force, just something that\u0027ll detatch basic rocket parts.

Your kerbals aren\u0027t very experienced with these tools at the start, and the scientists back home don\u0027t know very much about what they are looking for. This means that a lot of the data is collected in a poor fashion and does not make use of the tools\u0027 full potential. There would be tools and methods you unlock which would improve the data collection methods, then you must re-collect your data. If you have a craft near a site, you can make a short trip to go collect data again. If you have a craft right in the biome, you can merely switch to it and perform new science right away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that would unlock new gameplay without forcing re-play would be labs that process data over an extended period of time. For instance, the Mobile Processing Lab could be made to work primarily for goo and materials studies, and soil samples. It could have a limited amount of storage space (a pretty large amount) which you could fill up with soil samples and used goo canisters and materials labs for post-processing. Say the goo canister and science jr become unusable after data collection, not just data transfer, but if you transmit data back home about them, they maintain their state and can still be brought home as-is for further analysis. Or you can consolidate all of them to one spot and bring a MPL there to study them over an extended period of time and ultimately clean them off, for less than full gain but very good gain nonetheless.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-21T02:54:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2013 02:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T02:22:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThermometer and barometer:\u003C/strong\u003E 100% science gain on return or transmission, can store (several/unlimited) readings inside any command capsule that has a datapad inside.

A later unlock grants Advanced Materials Processing technology which increases the max gain from processing materials by 100% but the gain from transmissions and MPL processing by just 50%. Thus the Science Jr. module will list your transmission gain as 15% and your return to Kerbin gain as 60%, while processing in the MPL now yields 37.5%. Also, the AMP technology allows you to perform an Advanced Analysis in the MPL which takes a long time but yields 75% instead of 37.5%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETo summarize:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E If you leave your early Science Jrs on-site and process them later in the MPL with AMP tech, you get more total science than if you had brought them back home before this research.
