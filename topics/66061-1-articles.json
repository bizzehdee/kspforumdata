If your TWR local to the body you are trying to launch from is lower than 1, you will have to burn off reaction mass to lighten your ship before it lifts off. You have lost that available delta-v because you were not able to use that reaction mass to either increase or decrease your rocket\u0027s velocity. If your TWR is above 1 but still very low, you will incur excess gravity losses during your ascent. If your TWR is too high and you are launching from a body with an atmosphere, you will incur excess drag losses. In either case, you will incur both gravity and drag losses, the key is to minimize their sum. That occurs at terminal velocity. So to reduce the amount of delta-v lost during ascent, you need to match your TWR to a value that allows you to fly as close to terminal velocity as possible. This is at least important early in the launch, it is generally too cost prohibitive to maintain terminal velocity in the later stages of your launch when you are traveling through the thin upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T16:45:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERule of thumb: boosters for insufficient TWR, upper stages for insufficient dV.
