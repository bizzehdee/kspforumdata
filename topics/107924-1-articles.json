Is anyone else running into this as well? I\u0027ve made my best attempt to keep the fairings fairly bullet shaped, but no luck so far. In my last 45t payload launch, it cost me nearly 700dV extra to get into LKO.\n\nWorking on getting some pictures from my PC at home now, so I\u0027ll add those when I can, but figured I\u0027d see about getting some input in until then."},{"CreatedByName":"Turner","CreatedById":68042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:03:22Z","Content":"Just asked in another post...
