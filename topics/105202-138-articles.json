Why can\u0027t we just find something that works and stick with it?\n\u003E \n\nFirst, as someone probably already noted, you need recyclers as well.  This is nothing new, been that way for a while.  The only thing that got reverted was the wear mechanic (more to keep things a bit simpler for now).\n\nSecond... yeah, you\u0027re being a bit salty.  The stats are all there.. that didn\u0027t change (here are even more stats shown now than in prior versions).  Life support works just fine... heck, if anything, stuff tends to have much longer durations these days (i.e. I eased up on some of the constraints).  You\u0027re also on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS thread not the MKS one, so I don\u0027t have all of the context of why you\u0027re having an issue.. I would bet a cookie though it\u0027s something trivial.  But saying you are not being salty... then dumping a heap of salt on us... does tend to make folks a bit less enthusiastic about support.\n\nAlso, obligatory reminder.  Neither you, nor anyone else who plays KSP, are the \u0027audience\u0027 for the stuff I make.  I make things for me.  People see them, and ask to have them.  I, being a nice guy, share.  It\u0027s a good social contract... I share stuff, people help test things, toss in pull requests to help out, etc. - and everyone wins.  So when I change something, I change it because I probably saw something when I was doing my own play through that I wanted to adjust a bit... so I do so.  Simple as that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-02T13:30:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2016 01:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RoverDude**"},{"CreatedByName":"dboi88","CreatedById":150676,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T12:52:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Rabada said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sure!

I don\u0027t like all of the changes made either.  There\u0027s always the option to create \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E configs for your own use which change the balance, or occasionally someone else will make a mod that piggybacks on other mods.  (I did that once for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS) And TAC-LS is still around and maintained if you want an alternative.  \n\nThis isn\u0027t meant to single anyone out, but as a user of RoverDude\u0027s mods, it\u0027s very frustrating to me that he has to take time out to address a lot of questions that are either answered in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E, have been asked one or more times in the most recent 3 pages of the thread, or are worded in a way that is pretty much guaranteed to make someone take offense.  Sometimes, there are more meta-posts dealing with the results of one comment that the real content of the thread gets lost in the shuffle for several pages. (especially when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E comes up)  My rambling point is, if you\u0027re going to post to a friend, there\u0027s a few good guidelines:\n\n1. Read the last 3-5 pages of the thread to see if your question has been asked or answered  \n\n2. Be polite  \n\n3. Have empathy - this is all done for free by people who may have other commitments  \n\n4. Remember that no one owes you anything  \n\n5. Act like you\u0027re a guest in someone else\u0027s house, because that\u0027s what someone else\u0027s thread is like.\n\nApologies to all in the thread for contributing to the Noise end of Noise vs. Signal - thanks for \u0022listening\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T20:23:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, dboi88 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbals don\u0027t need supplies while on the home planet so they will never expire.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027ve been meaning to ask about this.

I was actually just did the math to figure out to balance the life support for a station I am designing so I\u0027ll copy what I figured out here. This station is intended to support up to 3 Kerbals at a time. If anyone notices any errors please correct me.\n\u003E \n\nThank you so much! This is exactly what I was looking for.

This is nothing new, been that way for a while.  The only thing that got reverted was the wear mechanic (more to keep things a bit simpler for now).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Second... yeah, you\u0027re being a bit salty.  The stats are all there.. that didn\u0027t change (here are even more stats shown now than in prior versions).  Life support works just fine... heck, if anything, stuff tends to have much longer durations these days (i.e. I eased up on some of the constraints).  You\u0027re also on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS thread not the MKS one, so I don\u0027t have all of the context of why you\u0027re having an issue.. I would bet a cookie though it\u0027s something trivial.  But saying you are not being salty... then dumping a heap of salt on us... does tend to make folks a bit less enthusiastic about support.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, obligatory reminder.  Neither you, nor anyone else who plays KSP, are the \u0027audience\u0027 for the stuff I make.  I make things for me.  People see them, and ask to have them.  I, being a nice guy, share.  It\u0027s a good social contract... I share stuff, people help test things, toss in pull requests to help out, etc. - and everyone wins.  So when I change something, I change it because I probably saw something when I was doing my own play through that I wanted to adjust a bit... so I do so.  Simple as that.\n\u003E \n\nI apologize, you\u0027re right, I probably should have thought that over a bit more before I posted it. It was late and I was frustrated and it\u0027s easy to say mean things on the internet. I really do appreciate all the work you do and your generous attitude towards the community. I\u0027m definitely going to give these mods another chance and try to learn how they work this time.
