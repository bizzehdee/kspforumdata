Unmodded install, never had mods. But when I warp along my orbit to fine-tune my orbit, I\u0027m being thrown off sometimes dozens, sometimes hundreds of meters from my planned orbit. This is incredibly frustrating considering I am trying to deploy keostationary satellites in 120 deg phase, so precision is my objective. What could be causing this? I\u0027ve already confirmed in the main menu that orbital drift compensation is still on. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is off..\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-07T00:35:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2020 12:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Overheal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-07T03:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESome \u003C/em\u003Echanging of the orbital parameters is normal, each time you change from time-warp to the full physics simulation,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbecause the 6 numbers that define your 3D position and 3D velocity are converted to the 5 orbital parameters and your position along that orbit.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is some round-off error each time you convert and convert back.\u00A0 I\u0027ve read here that Unity (KSP\u0027s underlying game engine) simulates physics with IEEE single-precision math, which carries just six\u00A0decimal places (for the 3D position and 3D velocity).\u00A0 That six-decimal-place precision can explain some of the effect you describe, but I have convinced myself that there are cases where KSP lets larger errors creep in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually, though, the loss of precision doesn\u0027t stop us from setting up orbits as we want.\u00A0 \u00A0If you want to give a particular example, of what \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and such you are trying to get and what the change is, maybe some of us here will recognize if you have found a case that behaves worst than usual, and maybe if we\u0027re really lucky have some helpful suggestions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd welcome to the forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
