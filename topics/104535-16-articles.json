This seems optional from the description, but I think someone in this thread had problems that were solved by using the extension.\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks !\n\nThe parts in this mod are mainly intended as examples for other modders to use to create their own versions. As such there are a few issues with them which aren\u0027t possible to update (e.g the hinge has broken symmetry). The rework adds in a bunch of new and replacement parts so is recommended to get the most out of IR, but certainly not required. Eventually the current IR parts will be retired in favour of the rework, but there\u0027s not ETA on this."},{"CreatedByName":"TauPhraim","CreatedById":146808,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T17:19:39Z","Content":"Thanks for the clarification.
