It had two solar panels and two small radial batteries. It was an effective probe, but even in hibernation mode, it would still die during the night. So I started wishing I could turn a few things off to reduce power further when I came up with this new radical idea-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing able to turn UI elements (like the altitude display, vertical speed indicator, staging UI, navball, G-force meter, throttle, heading, speed, etc) on and off. With them drawing a portion of the power probes already draw (manned capsules would not be impacted as they don\u0027t continuously burn battery to function like probes). Each instrument would be responsible for the total percentage of power used by the probe. \u003Cstrong\u003ENote, this shouldn\u0027t \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eincrease\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E power drain, just consist of part of the existing power draw\u003C/strong\u003E. So turning off the altimeter (or setting it to update only so often, like every 5, 10, 30, or 60 seconds) should reduce the power drawn, same for the vertical UI indicator or the navball or any other UI element.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s reasonable to assume that even in hibernation that the probe is drawing a lot of power if it\u0027s constantly tracking it\u0027s altitude, vertical speed, navball position, speed, and so on. So it should be reasonable that the easiest way to reduce power usage is to turn off aspects of the instrumentation that you may or may not need. Such as altitude or vertical speed which really doesn\u0027t matter when you\u0027re orbiting behind the moon out of power from the sun and trying to run science experiments or any other multitude of situations a player could think of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what are your thoughts? Am I crazy and this is silly, or am I onto something?

I can give you a real life example, which is the Voyager probes. Their RTGs supply a steadily decreasing amount of power (not an exact analogy, but bear with me). In order to maintain the probes active with decreasing power, NASA/JPL devised a plan as you suggested to turn off things to save power.
