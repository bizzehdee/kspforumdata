I saw the mission. \u0022Go to Eve, do this, return these people, blah blah blah.\u0022\n\nIt all happened so fast. \u0022I\u0027ve been to Eve before, I\u0027ve even returned a Kerbal! It seems like a challenge! I\u0027ll do it!\u0022\n\nI hit \u0022accept.\u0022\n\nOf course I did not consider that returning four Kerbals from the surface of Eve is exponentially harder than one - and the one I returned was about the hardest thing I\u0027ve ever done in KSP.\n\nI\u0027ll keep you posted. I hope you have a strong stomach. This is not going to be pretty."},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T06:34:43Z","Content":"You don\u0027t have to take them all there at once.

I\u0027m not familliar with the \u0022atmospheric flight\u0022 contracts, but it seems that you could satisfy that during aerocapture.

I haven\u0027t had much success getting 1 kerbal back yet.\n\nhere\u0027s an idea that I think may help:\n\nput an asteroid and refueling station in Eve\u0027s orbit first, so you can refuel your escape vessel.\n\nEve has an atmosphere, it may not be air, but in theory, attaching wings should give you extra lift - I haven\u0027t tested this yet, but an SRB powered plane might give you enough altitude to launch the escape rocket."},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T08:18:17Z","Content":"A detailed mission report with a load of pictures would be epic...
