It works great, but it always feels a bit of an easy way out to use the already unrealistic reaction wheels in such an unrealistic way. I would rather find another solution, but until then, reaction wheels it is. The same goes for vtol control - I would rather use bleed air or varied engine thrust to orient them, but that\u0027s so hard to do in stock KSP I end up using reaction wheels and not feeling as happy with the craft as I would otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering, does anyone else feel the same way about using reaction wheels or other features of KSP, or is it just me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDISCLAIMER TYPE THING: By \u0022cheating\u0022 I don\u0027t really mean \u0022cheating\u0022, a better way to word it would have been \u0022do you prefer to find another solution to problems with craft than reaction wheels\u0022 or something like that. I get that \u0022cheating\u0022 was a really dumb way to put it. The main reason for this thread was that I had made some rovers using reaction wheels for stability and I was wondering if people would care that they used reaction wheels, thinking they might prefer a more \u0022realistic\u0022 (again, I realise that\u0027s a dumb word to use for something in a game about near indestructable green rocket scientists in an imaginary solar system) solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T16:19:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 04:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BlueCanary\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T16:38:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont feel cheaty about any feature the game offers.
