Having said that I\u0027d like to offer some feedback about the 1.0 release. \n\nMy feelings on this matter are mixed. In general, I think the game is much harder now. For a long time Kerbal fan this is OK (maybe even desirable), but think about if you were just coming into the game as a new player. KSP has lost its fun sandbox-style appeal, and become more of a hardcore simulator. You should almost change the happy-go-lucky little Kerbal portraits with grim, sterm faces. Because Kerbal is serious business now! Kerbal 1.0 is absolutely an entirely different game that previous versions. Would you recommend the game to a friend now? Does the game now appeal to the average video game player? I\u0027m not sure, to be honest. It certainly appeals to the hardcore space sim crew, but maybe not so much to the average person anymore. And that makes me a little sad.\n\nNew Aero model:\n\nHonestly, I think the old aero/heat model should be the default in the game. And the new one should be a \u0027realism\u0027 setting that you enable. The average person or someone new to Kerbal is just going to say \u0022This is hard\u0022, and go play something else. Their spacecraft is going to blow up due to overheating and they won\u0027t ever be able to figure out why. And so they will quit the game. (You can only monitor thermal information by turning it on in Dev mode, which is horrible). \n\nCareer mode:\n\nCareer mode is excruciating now. My other save games broke with weird issues so I decided to start a new game. The early tasks are extremely difficult and you only get a pittance of science from the contracts. The contracts are ridiculously hard even for an experienced KSP player, and often flat out impossible in the early game. Test a jet engine before I have air intakes? Activate an SRB at 90,000 meters? Ferry around tourists on Kerbin before I have jet engines? They also seem to want you to sacrifice your craft sometimes. (i.e. Fly by the Mun or be on an escape trajectory while activating a ridiculous part that will make craft recovery impossible). \n\nTrying to get to the Mun (with no intercept information btw) I went to do something simple like transfer fuel in orbit and I couldn\u0027t because I apparently need 475,000 to upgrade the R\u0026D building before I can transfer resources. And I cant solve the problem with fuel hoses and external tanks because I dont have fuel hose tech yet. \n\nBases and Construction\n\nStill no construction in space? NASA certainly wouldn\u0027t be where we are today if that were true. The only way to build on space stations is to use docking ports, which often seems like a kluge. Why should I have to deliver a new girder attachment with solar panels and attach it with a docking port. It just seems weird.\n\nI also have trouble comprehending how something so basic as landing pads couldn\u0027t be offered in a 1.0 release. If you build an outpost on another planet or moon, you would have a landing pad. Some place for transports or passenger craft to arrive and debark. The only way to refuel or service craft is to try to use docking ports. This is very unwieldy on the ground. Why do we not have the ability to make landing pads with resource transfer capability?? Or runways?? Want to explore another planet with an airplane? Maybe fly a rocket plane on Eve or even a jet on Laythe? You really can\u0027t because there is no way to refuel it. That is unless you try to dock your plane with some custom tanker design you have on the ground using a docking port, which is ridiculously unwieldy. Give us some damn landing pads with resource transfer!\n\nBugs\n\nObviously there are some huge issues with fairings, heat shields, parachutes, and temperature models. Plenty of other threads on those so I won\u0027t discuss.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading."},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T13:02:01Z","Content":"I can understand your frustration, but I would give yourself some time to re-learn how to play the game with the new systems.
