I usually bury the antenna inside the ship with part clipping, so it\u0027s more difficult to manually activate them in flight. If part clipping actually occluded the antenna and stopped them from getting ripped off by aero forces, this wouldn\u0027t be a problem and the antenna could stay activated. I\u0027d rather be able to toggle the antenna on/off with AGE at any time, without worrying about connection status and without having to turn the bypass option on every time I\u0027m coming out of an aerobrake or landing on a foreign body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause AGE already has a bypass remote tech option, I thought the easiest solution to this issue would be just to have that as a toggleable option that remains active/inactive through scene changes (currently requires re-activation every time I want to reactivate antenna with the action groups set to do so).The only problem with this option is that it would make ALL action groups ignore remote tech connection requirements rather than just antenna. I\u0027m not sure a more elegant solution falls under the purview of your mod though, I\u0027ll probably have to ask the XF config guys if they can make their config allow antenna activation/deactivation through action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eproblem: action groups can\u0027t be activated unless the temporary bypass remote tech option is enabled (with or without XF config)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epossible solution: make the bypass remote tech option a toggle that remains on until disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T04:09:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 04:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Baythan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T13:49:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I see now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two issues here, activating the antenna and targeting the antenna.

There is one .cfg file created every time KSP saves. There is a clean-up routine that runs to deleted unused ones on game start, but that leaves one .cfg file per .sfs save file. Do you have a mod making automatic save file backups and making many .sfs files in your save directory? (KAC does this.)

In my original modded game, the fault showed up for both Actions 1 \u0026amp; 2 and 11 \u0026amp; 12. As well, the VAB editor started getting confused about its mode (Parts/Actions/Crew) and screwed up the display (mostly the left parts/actions panel), although that could be an independent bug (s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then used a minimal modded environment, just MM 2.6.6 and AGExt 1.33 in an otherwise stock sandbox. Here I set up actions 1, 2, 11, \u0026amp; 12 as before, 1 of a pair of Presmat experiments. I went to launch and discovered the AGExt action groups were all correct, just activating a single Presmat. I then reverted to VAB and reloaded the save craft. All 4 action groups again showed activating both Presmat experiements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it appears to be something about the saving and/or loading that makes the actions as if Symmetry were on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a workaround, I can use the power of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38768\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEditor Extensions\u003C/a\u003E and place some symmetrical parts as individual parts in symmetrical locations (using its horizontal and vertical snap functions). I may also look into a mod to break apart symmetrical parts into single parts without moving them (I think there was one that did that).
