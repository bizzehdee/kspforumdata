The balance thing kinda bothers me but since I have been using mechjeb to land so it isn\\\u0027t too hard. Any plans on making the full exterior of the craft with functioning RCS, Chutes, and a detachable heatshield or will you just make a fairing and be done with it.? Things of that nature have been done before so it is only a matter of skill, which I lack. I have been using a decoupler on top of the crane with a RCS fuel tank \u002B 3 chutes radially to slow down, I detach just after I hit 150 m/s. If you do happen to make the full set, mind trying to put a camera facing straight down to see where you are headed similar to how curiosity finds its LZ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was working on a space travel capsule with an detachable heatshield, space engine and possiblity to add parachutes for atmospheric entry.
