Still though how heavy is this thing that it requires the SLS, Cassini was launched with a Titan IV.\n\nThe options were a multi-flyby mission with a heavy EELV (Atlas V 551 or Delta IVH) or direct transfer with SLS. The multi-flyby trajectory would require the spacecraft to operate within Venus orbit and last about twice as long in transit in general, neither of which would be cheap.\n\nEDIT: Also that\u0027s for the base mission without a lander; building spacecraft and instruments that can survive these conditions is not cheap. Estimates for a lander from JPL itself are $700 million-$1 billion extra, and you can probably double that for real costs. If Shelby gets his wish and a lander does get funded, this will have no real prospect of actually flying.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T14:43:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 02:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kryten**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonboy","CreatedById":134111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T16:16:12Z","Content":"While I share OP\u0027s enthusiasm for a Europa mission ... yikes.

It depends how much patience you have to wait for gravity assists. Here\u0027s an actual study I found: a NASA concept for an Enceladus orbiter. They calculated a very low delta-v trajectory, with the tradeoff that it\u0027d take *12 years* from launch to Enceladus orbit.\n\n[http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/ssbsite/documents/webpage/ssb_059320.pdf](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/ssbsite/documents/webpage/ssb_059320.pdf)\n\n(the chapter \u0022Concepts of Operation and Mission Design\u0022)\n\nIn their solution, the launch vehicle would lift to C\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E = 11.7 km^2^/s\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9^2^, and the orbiter would use 2880.6 m/s of its own propulsion. That\u0027s roughly the same as **6.6 km/s from LEO to low Enceladus orbit**. (If you\u0027re in LEO, it takes 3.72 km/s to reach C\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E = 11.7 km^2^/s\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9^2^).\n\nThe low-C\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E launch is for a gravity-assist tour to Saturn (Venus-Earth-Venus-Earth-Saturn). This would take 8.5 years, plus one 350 m/s deep-space maneuver to set up a flyby.\n\nSaturn orbit insertion costs 960 m/s (eccentric orbit, low periapsis \u0026 high apoapsis).\n\nTransfer to Enceladus orbit is just 1041 m/s, but it uses 52 gravity assists from Saturn moons, taking 3.5 years.\n\nRemaining 484.3 m/s is \u0022statistical\u0022.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T18:47:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 06:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cryogen**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T18:55:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ![Europa%2Blander%2Bdelta-v.jpg](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rwnUaIMfLxk/VOC1LbnO9NI/AAAAAAAAAVA/eh_uzepMgCY/s1600/Europa%2Blander%2Bdelta-v.jpg)\n\nGGA === Good Game All?\nHrm... roughly 6.5km/s for the LV to make up, plus 4km/s available on arrival, this spacecraft is going to be pretty damn small.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Thus, if we instead choose an indirect gravity-assisted route like Galileo, it is not unreasonable for us to assume that we can get 2715kg in system resulting in a maximum dry payload of 820kg once we have arrived at Europa.\n\nEh, they can probably get the job done with that."},{"CreatedByName":"cryogen","CreatedById":134454,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T18:59:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E GGA === Good Game All?\n\nProbably \u0022Ganymede Gravity Assist\u0022."}]}
