Nothing out of the ordinary really, it happens from time to time. But when i loaded up the game this time and hit resume saved, it showed no save files. I went into the save folder and all my saves were still there but they wouldn\u0027t show up in game. I tried restarting the game multiple times, restarting my computer, and I backed up my files on steam and uninstalled the game, then reinstalled it. I tried restoring a previous version of KSP through steam, although I probably did it incorrectly, and i saved my files in another folder on my computer in case something would happen to them. i tried copy pasting them back into the save folder in KSP as shown below but again, nothing. How can i fix this?\u00A0\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/0amw1n5w73c3cty/Screenshot%202016-07-10%2023.56.38.png?dl=0\u0022 alt=\u0022Screenshot%202016-07-10%2023.56.38.png?d\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-11T04:02:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2016 04:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kyky617\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T13:51:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/166432-kyky617/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022166432\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/166432-kyky617/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Kyky617\u003C/a\u003E, is your ships folder still there?\u00A0 If it is make sure it still contains the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003Esph\u003C/abbr\u003E folders, as if any of these are missing KSP won\u0027t load the save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they are fine then the issue is likely with your persistent.sfs, you can back it up (rename it) then use the last backup save from the backups folder in your save folder, or your quicksave if it\u0027s more recent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll need to copy the quicksave or the backup save and rename the copy to persistent.sfs, and it will load, though you will have lost a few minutes of play you will at least have recovered your game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis may seem a bit convoluted, as the backup saves was a debugging feature left in for everyone\u0027s benefit, as it can be a windfall in these situations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kyky617","CreatedById":166432,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T15:53:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/16426-sal_vager/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002216426\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/16426-sal_vager/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@sal_vager\u003C/a\u003E do you mean my ship files in the save folder? \u00A0Because I don\u0027t see one there I only see the one in the ksp folder. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T16:18:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour pictures show all of the save files are not inside a named save folder.
