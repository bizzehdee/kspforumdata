Mods are just \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, Docking Port and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I had this problem before I installed them though. I get to a dangerous part of a mission, alt F5 to save, and then when I crash my ship and want to reload, there are no choices for games to load because one in the list is corrupt, which means you can\u0027t even choose the good saves that aren\u0027t corrupt. One workaround is to change the name of the quicksave you want to persistent.sfs, but that gets overwritten quickly so you lose that one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s hard to tell, but I think the problem happens when you crash your ship, and try to load a game before the actual crash report comes up. I think it saves the game there and if you press load it aborts corrupting the file. That\u0027s a wild guess!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole system shouldn\u0027t fail just because one save is corrupt.

When you mean a save is corrupted, do you mean you can\u0027t load it anymore? When you say that you can still load the quicksave before it gets renamed to persistent, do you mean your quicksave is not corrupted and gets so as soon as you load it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-21T15:36:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what happens.
