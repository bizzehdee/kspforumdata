It\u0027s natural.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering why I could rotate some fuselage parts about their axis before (when I wanted to move a side-attached Mk1 fuselage so its intake was below, for example). I forget too easily sometimes--they were attacked nodally to another part (e.g., fuel tank) that was side surf-attached to the root. So when I rotated the fuselage, it rotated about its axis, because that was where its joint was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I wasn\u0027t too aware of this, having to concentrate usually on one plane of rotation at a time. And the times I had to manipulate multiple planes in a given run, it was a part whose joint is within/at the center of the part: the single-port RCS thruster (since it sinks into the part it attaches to). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, Dman.
