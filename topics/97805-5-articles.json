It *NEVER* will be, no matter how many parts are made procedural (*cough* I still want stock procedural fuel tanks for memory-usage and historical-recreation reasons...) or how many shiny new futuristic techs (like the RAPIER, or someday maybe ISRU?) are added. The fact is, as a partial simulation game (HarvestR described KSP as \u0022part simulation, and part sandbox\u0022 back when he was first describing the game to some other forum communities), you will ALWAYS be subject to real-world physics. How much so is determined by how far the devs lean towards realism (please NEVER use the phrase \u0022realism vs. gameplay\u0022 with me- I STRONGLY believe realism ENHANCES gameplay 95% of the time...), but the limits of the Rocket Equation, gravity, orbital mechanics and such are always present...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the devs make the new aerodynamics system even a touch realistic, you guys will be BEGGING for procedural fairings.

For that matter, that\u0027s also PRECISELY one of the reasons why I want to see procedural fuel tanks, or procedural nosecones at the very least- so that for rockets WITHOUT fairings on the top, I can still determine how sharp vs. lightweight I want my rocket\u0027s nose to be (sharper noses are longer/heavier, but they GREATLY reduce aerodynamic drag...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-27T17:38:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2015 05:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tuareg","CreatedById":84241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T18:08:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eim getting fed up with these guys thinking they have a right to restrict others because they have more right to have fun then others on their failed self-restrictive way... is this going to anywhere? if ppl would enjoy restrictive gameplay minecraft wouldnt be so successful. it is because you can do generally anything in it. also the big mods for ksp wouldnt have hundreds of thousands of downloads. proc fairing, if they will happen are the first ever really good choice of squad\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-27T18:15:32Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2015 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tuareg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T18:16:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Let\u0027s gonna remove 2.5 and 3.75 mt parts!

No one in this thread is going to restrict your gameplay. Saying things like \u0022oh, I guess we should all play the way cpast thinks is good\u0022 or \u0022people think they have a right to restrict others\u0022 is not useful, because no one here is saying anything other than \u0022Here\u0027s ways why procedural fairings can be better\u0022 or \u0022here\u0027s ways fixed-size fairings can be better.\u0022 \u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, I actually *do* think procedural fairings make a lot of sense, and are probably, on balance, a better solution.

If ppl could come up with some realistic reasons or, as you try to say, would just post things as \u0022it fits MY gamestyle more\u0022, it would be ok, but you try to sell it as global truth and, sry for that, but it makes me annoyed... and i guess, as long as i dont start to give you names i have every right to give voice to this. would you disagree?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T18:42:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf the devs make the new aerodynamics system even a touch realistic, you guys will be BEGGING for procedural fairings. They allow you to do a LOT more than just have precisely the \u0022right\u0022 fairing for the payload- they also allow you to easily do things like create an extra-long fairing with a more gradual taper (that is, more like a needle than a shallow cone) to reduce aerodynamic drag, determining for yourself *precisely* how sharp the nose of your rocket ought to be.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing with FAR for a while, but I\u0027m still not sure whether fairings are useful at all, or am I just using them as a questionable aesthetic choice. There\u0027s so much variation in the delta-v requirements of reaching orbit that, even after hundreds of launches, I have no real idea how much delta-v the fairings save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s the question about how the changes in delta-v requirements affect rocket size and cost. The fairings are quite heavy, so I\u0027ll need a bigger rocket with them for the same payload. In many cases, unless I want to use gigantic fairings, the fairing base must be located within the payload, forcing me to carry it along for another 5-6 km/s. I\u0027m not sure whether that\u0027s really worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have the impression that real payload fairings exist mainly to protect the payload, while reduced drag is just a nice bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T18:44:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cpast\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cpast\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe realism thing I readily concede - I think p-fairings should scale cost/mass with diameter in a nonlinear way (it\u0027s hard to *build* stable fairings that are mushroom-shaped), but making it not work is the job of the aero system. For restriction, the point is that a *fixed* size imposes different constraints than \u0022be realistic\u0022. Being realistic doesn\u0027t require you to redesign to get that extra .1 (or, for that matter, .5) meters off the width.
