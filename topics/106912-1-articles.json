Turning on the debug menu shows that they are 20 degrees warmer than the parts around them (~340K vs ~320K, ambient temp ~300K).\n\nIf I turn on rails warp the temperature of these parts drops to near ambient, but when I come out of rails warp it returns to ~340K\u002B.\n\nI don\u0027t think these parts should take so long to return to ambient temperature, nor do I think that a temperature 40K above ambient should cause those parts to glow red. This may not be a \u0022bug\u0022 exactly, it could be the intended behaviour, but it doesn\u0027t really make a lot of sense and it sort of spoils the aesthetic of craft if they glow \u0022by part\u0022 for so long. \n\nIn any case, I\u0027m pretty sure the temperature going back \\*up\\* when coming out of rails warp is a bug.\n\nQuality is poor but should demonstrate what I\u0027m describing:\n\n[http://gfycat.com/ClearcutBothAngwantibo](http://gfycat.com/ClearcutBothAngwantibo)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:21:04Z","Content":"Shoot, I wish I\u0027d seen your post.
