Turning on the debug menu shows that they are 20 degrees warmer than the parts around them (~340K vs ~320K, ambient temp ~300K).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I turn on rails warp the temperature of these parts drops to near ambient, but when I come out of rails warp it returns to ~340K\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think these parts should take so long to return to ambient temperature, nor do I think that a temperature 40K above ambient should cause those parts to glow red. This may not be a \u0022bug\u0022 exactly, it could be the intended behaviour, but it doesn\u0027t really make a lot of sense and it sort of spoils the aesthetic of craft if they glow \u0022by part\u0022 for so long. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, I\u0027m pretty sure the temperature going back *up* when coming out of rails warp is a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuality is poor but should demonstrate what I\u0027m describing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://gfycat.com/ClearcutBothAngwantibo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://gfycat.com/ClearcutBothAngwantibo\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:21:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShoot, I wish I\u0027d seen your post.
