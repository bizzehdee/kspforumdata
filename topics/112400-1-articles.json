Personally those are not the hardest satellite contracts. The absolute worst for me are sat orbits that are too close to another body, usually the Mun. Getting the orbit without getting collected by Mun\u0027s SOI seems to require both timing and patience, and those things are sometimes in short supply with me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, for anyone struggleing with Kerbin system sats, here is a powerfull yet cheap solution.
