If Bungie (and Jason Jones in particular) have any sense, they might realize that the Marathon crowd are very particular and will be a hard group to please. Making a Marathon which excels the original in terms of story, gameplay and that feeling of \u0022awe\u0022 will be a major challenge; especially so since many of that same crowd still use Macs and will expect a new Marathon to be inclusive of their platform of choice upon initial release. Recall that Halo was first announced by Steve Jobs at MacWorld NY 1999, but due to the M$ stuff, it came last to the Mac as a port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome may find this interesting:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1iTqgnsAj3Y?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esegaprophet: you reminded me of good fun indeed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrZjPX1j0_g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T19:18:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThree words ( five words? ) On Disk DLC. ...
