The wheels are working fine and I can drive around and stuff, but there does not appear to be any documentation on how to get the linkages working using the fxmodule. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean I have the linkages named susp1-1 susp1-2 and set up the module in the CFG, just like the suspension traverse, is there anything more I need to do? It\u0027s definitely doing something because if I include the module my linkages start to point the wrong way... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurely someone knows how this works?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-08T18:55:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2013 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by zitronen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GregoryOwen","CreatedById":63197,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T06:21:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecan you link to whatever information you already have?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zitronen","CreatedById":11842,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T11:11:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell everything I know about wheels is in this picture: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XHZoV2G.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/XHZoV2G.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zitronen","CreatedById":11842,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T19:08:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK I figured it out.
