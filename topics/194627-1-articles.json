Logical, right? Except there\u0027s a big chunk of the UI, more than 50% opaque, covering the leftmost area of the map display. On a widescreen monitor, this isn\u0027t a problem, and it only looks a little off:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002242-trackingstation-a.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022http://vidthekid.info/imghost/2020/42-trackingstation-a.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might look a little better if the focused object were centered in the \u003Cem\u003Eunobstructed\u003C/em\u003E area of the screen. But you\u0027re probably thinking this is a minor nitpick that\u0027s not worth anybody\u0027s time. Well, it\u0027s a little bit more annoying on a square-ish monitor:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002242-trackingstation-b.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002280.04\u0022 height=\u0022429\u0022 width=\u0022536\u0022 src=\u0022http://vidthekid.info/imghost/2020/42-trackingstation-b.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there\u0027s an object in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E over on the left, I can\u0027t click on it without swinging the camera all the way around the planet. Or zooming out a bit, which may cause other difficulties if there\u0027s a lot of objects in a small area. That\u0027s rather annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002242-trackingstation-c.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002280.04\u0022 height=\u0022429\u0022 width=\u0022536\u0022 src=\u0022http://vidthekid.info/imghost/2020/42-trackingstation-c.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a quick mockup I did of how I think it \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E look. And I believe it can be done with just a little bit of math to estimate how much of the 3D view is usable taking the UI into account, and then setting up the camera vectors so it\u0027s slightly skewed to the left accordingly. And I don\u0027t think this would upset players using widescreen monitors, because the adjustment would be a smaller fraction of the viewing angle and therefore less obvious, and nothing else in the Tracking Station is screen-centered anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
