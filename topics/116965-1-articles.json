I noticed recently that the Radiators can be extended and will try this next but not sure what is working for others. Do smaller craft tend to heat less? Should I use a different fuselage? I need some ideas to make this project a success. The Craft is called Space Tech Model: Sat-9 and is capable of deploying 9 Satellites from it\u0027s tail end into orbit and return to base BUT the return to base is where I am needing help.\n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=]()\n\nWhat worked for me was the idea from DCWarHound\n\n\u0022You don\u0027t need radiators or airbrakes. Circularize your orbit at around 72km and then bring your Per down to 50km.tilt the plane up for maximum drag so most of the planes belly is facing toward the direction that you\u0027re heading towards.\u0022\n\nNot saying others ideas won\u0027t work, this is the technique I decided to try and it answered my question, Thank again DCWarHound!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T03:55:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 03:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by castille7**\n  \nQuestion Answered"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T11:18:46Z","Content":"Radiators won\u0027t help with re-entry.
