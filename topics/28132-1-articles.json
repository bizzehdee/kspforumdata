The rest will stay in orbit for science stuff and then I plan to get them all back home. I have 4 nuc engines on my mother ship and am currently doing a 20 min burn real time to get into duna orbit. My question is .... Is it better to burn 2 nuc engines for 20 mins or all 4 engines for 10 mins to get the best fuel efficiency or does it make no difference what so ever...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13 mins left....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T20:36:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have the engines there with you, then for sure using all 4 is going to be more efficient. The further you are from the optimal point for a burn, the more fuel is wasted. I\u0027m unsure at what point it becomes really noticeable, I just know the math works out that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you really want to get into the math, you would want to look at the wasted fuel from a slower rate of acceleration using two engines versus the delta v lost to the additional weight of using 4. Without looking at the numbers, the heavier the rest of the ship, the less difference an extra engine or two makes. A very small ship with a bank of engines resembling the back of Tantive IV (ship Darth Vader is chasing at the start of Star Wars), the weight of the engines is wasteful. If you have a veritable star destroyer and a single engine on the back, that\u0027s a problem too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-22T20:38:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2013 08:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Randox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"W3asel","CreatedById":58428,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T20:36:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince you have them all, use them all. It would be more efficient not to be moving around the extra engine mass by only having one or two engines, but unless you\u0027re inclined to try some controlled colisions to remove them that\u0027s probably not an option at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RawChicken","CreatedById":57199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T21:34:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Euse all of them, if not they are just dead mass to pull. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the 20min burn, try burning while you are in kerbin escape velocity, it is much faster and much efficient. Make a maneuvering node and see when and how you have to burn. If you cant burn while in kerbin escape velocity, burning at apoapsis or periapsis is the best o lower or increase your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claytsuk","CreatedById":59247,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T21:54:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replies guys. This story does not end too well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to burn my engines and enter Duna orbit but used a lot of fuel... I managed to land on Duna and lift back off again using my lander craft but didn\u0027t have enough fuel to dock in ordbit with my mother ship, which also now does not have enough fuel to get back to Kerbin....
