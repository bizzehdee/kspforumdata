The docs/examples do not use any additional colliders for the wheels and rely on the wheel collider for collision detection and keeping the main body object off/out of the ground. It -looks- like they are supposed to be a plug and play affair. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Testing in the unity editor, this is indeed the case. Create a rigidbody, add some wheel colliders to empties setup around the geometry appropriately, create a plane/surface for it to collide into. Elevate your rigidbody a bit above the plane to start, and hit the \u0027play\u0027 button. The rigidbody will fall down and rest -on the wheel colliders-.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, what I\u0027m seeing in KSP is that wheel colliders just fall completely through the terrain?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am asking because I\u0027m working on writing a custom multi-suspension point landing leg module, but cannot get the wheel colliders to... well.. collide with anything. Rather, I can see the wheel collider has positioned itself just above the terrain, but the ship/part is being held up by the other box colliders in the model... if I remove those box colliders, the entire thing falls through the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre wheel colliders supposed to actually collide with terrain/objects and stop falling movement, or am I supposed to be using other colliders for this purpose and manually lining them up with the wheel collider bounds? (seems counterproductive, and might as well write my own wheel collider at that point)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose the actual question is; how do I get wheel colliders to actually -collide- with things and use their suspension values to properly push back/push up on the parent object?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots to show the problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity setup:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bJlLOCQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bJlLOCQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity behavior (comes to rest on the wheel colliders):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z91qlAQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022z91qlAQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Start:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K1qdYLw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022K1qdYLw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP behavior (wheel colliders fall through the ground):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lzDfDkq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lzDfDkq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T23:40:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 11:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T23:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGoogle-fu led me to:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28214-wheel-problem\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28214-wheel-problem\u003C/a\u003E where someone stated that wheel colliders are disabled by default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so.. apparently... wheel colliders are -disabled by default- in KSP.
