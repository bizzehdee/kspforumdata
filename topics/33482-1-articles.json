Trying to land on poll is like trying to land on \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Epol\u003C/span\u003Elen; this is where it gets its name. It is a good place to visit if you like a good view of the Joolian system. Bop is good as it has a low gravity, but is roughly as mis-shaped as gilly, another asteroid. This makes it difficult to land on as you often thrust to much and just miss the ground. Vall and Tylo have too high a gravity for this kind of mission, but if you want to try them, they have some anomalies which are waiting to be found. They are also quite mountainous though so i suggest if you try one of these two, you land in a large crater in which you can have fun exploring. And then there is Laythe, an ocean mun. It has an atmosphere, so its good for the parachutes, but you will have to get a perfect trajectory as you obviously can\u0027t drive on water (unless you are Kesus). If you want to have some fun with the game physics, and your rover has parachutes, just throw it into Jool, it has a 50/50 chance it will land safely, even though there is no \u0027terrain\u0027. You will still be able to rove it. I hope you enjoy your time in Jool, and i\u0027m sorry for the awfully long post.
