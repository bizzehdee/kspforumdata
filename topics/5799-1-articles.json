Also, from my experience the struts don\\\u0027t work well with symmetry quite yet. Hopefully in a future update this will get fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI opted to use RCS thrusters instead of winglets because they greatly aid craft stabilization when trying to land on the Mun. Generally I point the craft\\\u0027s nose directly upward and use the IJKL keys to reduce any lateral motion, which allows landings like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FdjVz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FdjVz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there you can easily launch back up again and return home safely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
