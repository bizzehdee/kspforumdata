The origin story of the Duna SSTV signal does involve a planet in the outskirts of the Kerbol system, far beyond anything that was added in KSP.\u00A0If the\u00A0teaser in KSP2 video really is a planet beyond Eeloo, it could, indeed, be inspired by\u00A0that story, whether that planet\u0027s actually in KSP2 or if it\u0027s just an Easter egg. Of course, it could also be entirely coincidental or might not hint at a planet at all, but just a general idea of exploring beyond Kerbol system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I think it\u0027d be great to see the idea of\u00A0scavenger hunt sort of adventure to find a lost planet be realized in KSP2, but assembling necessary info from things like SSTV transmissions might be a bit much for average player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperspace Industries","CreatedById":212417,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-07T10:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps that diagram shows that the kerbol system is in fact a binary, with a smaller star orbiting very far away, sort of like Valentine in extrasolar.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
