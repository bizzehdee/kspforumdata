A procedural tank ( as an example ) could either - or all of - snap it\u0027s size to whatever it\u0027s attached to, be dragged to an arbitrary diameter at one or both ends, or be given a pre-set size from a VAB/SPH menu. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECore code to support procedural items would be a huge step forward, I think.

A single Stretchy Tank (KI-1000) is 2.5 times the cost of a regular TL800. Until you\u0027re using 2.5x the fuel capacity of a TL800, the KI1000 costs quite a bit more. The end-all option, the KI-9000, which can be stretched in both radial and length dimensions, has a cost of 10,000. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, we don\u0027t pay attention to this because we have absolutely no limits on part availability or budget constraints. The entire Kerbal race exists to service the space program, and the entire net global product of Kerbin is dedicated to it. Budget tracking and limited part availability is what would make procedural tanks work with the standard mass produced parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal thought on the Stretchy Tanks is they should cost even more than they do now (even though it\u0027s not doing anything). A TL-800 holds 800 units of propellant and costs 1600 Kr. (Kredits? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) An \u0022un-stretched\u0022 KI-1000 holds 300 and costs 4000.

For example, if I expanded the KI-1000 to 800 units (which would put it at a 1:5 propellant to Kr. ratio currently, two and a half times that of the TL-800) I think it should cost about 10,667Kr (the same 1:~13.333, units:Kr.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn economy system would make you choose what you built with a lot more carefully.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T16:07:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, like some of you said, Engines and pods seems to be the parts that not allow procedural mechanics.
