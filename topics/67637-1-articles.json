Makes me wonder how many asteroids there actually are in the game. Seems to be quite a few though. Certainly the aheer amount of them makes it rather disorientating when you show them on the tracking view, perhaps being able to get rid of the orbit lines temporarily might make things a bit easier to understand?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing is - there is no warning as to which of these are large asteroids and which are actually going to hit the planet. I mean NASA will surely have markers on all the large Earth orbit crossing asteroids (the ones that would survive it through the atmosphere). This is the kind of thing we need here, perhaps shaded lines to show the asteroids sizes first, and then perhaps a different colour for large asteroids that will actually hit the planet - red or something. And then I would also love to see a warning that comes up on the screen whenever one of these is detected so I can mount a mission to get rid of it. Maybe this might be the kind of thing coming with the astronomy part of the game I dont know?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I would say that, considering the amount of asteroids that are obviously in the game, its a bit labourious to have to manually track all of them. I would hope that this could be automated at some point. Otherwise you could spend all of your time in the tracking view!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill any of these asteroids be able to destroy your buildings in the future I wonder or perhaps even end the game if a truly massive one hits the planet? - although what you could do about one of those if you saw one heading your way, I dont know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway certainly this update changes the game somewhat, cheers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T13:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t track that many. If you don\u0027t track them, they won\u0027t exist. They continually populate, so if you try to track every one, you\u0027ll eventually crash your game. Pick about 10 that look interesting and stick to that. And until you get good at rendezvousing with asteroids (a slightly different prospect than other types of encounters), I would stick with only 2 or 3 at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spikeyhat09","CreatedById":39217,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T13:40:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. it does tell you the size. just click on an unidentified object and it will say class A (tiny), class B (small), class C (medium), class D (large), or class E (huge)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. you can already tell when an aseroid will impact. track it, and look for the kerbin intercept. if there is no periapsis, that object is on a collision course\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
