Got some kethane and refuelled the thing. So as I was saying, hopped to investigate an \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanomaly my scansat detected near the North Pole crater, everything was going really nice and easy (I mean the thing was already tested on the Mun and flew missions without problems... unless you count Patble and Luner who were little careless about their fuel... damn those were some good Kerbals), when all of a sudden an engine stops running just when I was in the middle of my second landing. Well, there were four LV-909 engines, so naturaly the thing went chaotically out of control.It also took me a while to figure out it was an engine issue. So I panicked as I don\u0027t like quickloads, I shut down another engine to balance the thing, but which wasn\u0027t quite possible, because, besides the standard symmetry problem, the thing wasn\u0027t symetrical to begin with, but had a customized thrust to balance it. So my TWR goes down 50 percent and the thing is really hard to control. Barelly made it to the ground in on piece, ended on a slope... Checked the odd engine, it says \u0027active\u0027 (I tried reactivating it during the problematic flight, but it wouldn\u0027t start), checked weather it has fuel-it does... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what the heck?! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA genuine engine failure?

I have this superstitious idea that my engine stopped when I flew over it. Also I don\u0027t know weather it works now, as I\u0027m afraid to take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Control, please advise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uui8457","CreatedById":96312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T07:32:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe few reasons I can think of are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-a bug with a mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-thrust limiter at 0 or very low\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey aren\u0027t good reasons but that is what I can think of, it really seems like a kraken situation\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimmy Jazz","CreatedById":102211,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T07:45:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMod was doing just fine up until now, I\u0027ve had some bugs with engines producing flames without them being turned on and without thrust, justthe effect, don\u0027t know if it\u0027s related though.

I was converting the kethane that I got at the same time that I was using up fuel - this would get rid of the extra weight, and make my flight more efficient - and it did, but, apparently for some reason that engine stopped working the minute that all of the kethane was converted.
