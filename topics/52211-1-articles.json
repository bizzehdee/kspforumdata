You will be surprised at how quickly it can go up as the SRB fuel nears exhaustion. For radically mounted boosters, it is the sheer and twisting forces causing failure. Proper bracing will fix that failure issue. For large powerful boosters under the core stage, compression failure can occur. The stats will tell you what happens. Vertical bracing can protect what is above from high G compression that can occur near the burnout of the booster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T14:37:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdding heavier decouplers and/or few struts usually solves the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phunk","CreatedById":77377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T15:02:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022700NitroXpress\u0022 data-cite=\u0022700NitroXpress\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis also happens at high altitude because there is less air resistance keeping the boosters in place. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as the fuel in the boosters burns off, their TWR increases significantly.

Beefing up may well make the problem worse if you mean adding more thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think your ship is actually going too fast. (below 14km i use 200m/s as the speedlimit, any faster is counterproductive due to drag)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the issues is your altitude, you are still in thick air and being pushed well over terminal velocity by the srbs. Besides being wasteful of thrusting power it stresses the ship like mad. Perhaps seperate those big rockomaxes into seperate stages, take a longer time to make your ascent. Alternately increase the weight of the next stage slightly (i.e. carry more liquid fuel up on those srbs) to reduce the Gs on your first ascent stage.
