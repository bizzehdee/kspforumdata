As you ascend slowly turn the craft so at around 10km you should be at 45 degrees. Keep turning slowly till your craft is 10 degrees above the horizon. It may seem as though you are wasting fuel, but in fact you are raising your periapsis at the same time as slowly raising your apoapsis which means the final circularization burn will only be a few seconds. It takes some practice and every rocket has a tendency to be different as to how fast you turn, but you will get it. Finally, don\u0027t go overboard on your thrust. The faster you are going the more force the air puts on your craft and that makes it harder to turn. A TWR between 1.25 and 1.5 is ideal and you can throttle back as you ascend to save fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T19:09:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 07:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T21:51:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a how-to kind of a question, and so it has been moved to the how-to subforum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
