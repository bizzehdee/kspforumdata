Im not entirely sure if the game decodes the OGG files to temporary wav but other than that, i dont see a limitation. Audio Files are alot easier to handle with ram than graphic files as far as I could see"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Myk","CreatedById":137014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T01:18:34Z","Content":"Does this make sounds for hull contraction/expansion due to changing ambient pressure?\n\nTo me the OP says yes at one point then no at another.\n\nIf it doesn\u0027t would you be willing to add that?"},{"CreatedByName":"ensou04","CreatedById":140256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T01:21:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Does this make sounds for hull contraction/expansion due to changing ambient pressure?\n\u003E To me the OP says yes at one point then no at another.\n\u003E \n\u003E If it doesn\u0027t would you be willing to add that?\n\nIt only makes sounds at thrust and gravitational forces. none with ambient pressure. but we could add that as well but I\u0027ll have to make new assets for it first. probably might do it while I work on to figure out how to make joint/connection stresses make sounds\n\nEDIT:\n\nLol for some reason it wont work for others, if you have already downloaded 0.1.3 and it didnt work for you, just rename the folder \u0022ShipEffects\u0022 to \u0022shipEffects\u0022 its a silly mistake it should work now\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-04T02:19:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2015 02:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ensou04**"},{"CreatedByName":"BigFatStupidHead","CreatedById":44217,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T07:44:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ... just rename the folder \u0022ShipEffects\u0022 to \u0022shipEffects\u0022 its a silly mistake it should work now\n\nThis sounds like a very typical Linux problem; Linux is very picky about its capitalization. \n\nAlso, this mod sounds great and I am looking forward to trying it."},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T11:58:19Z","Content":"I made some new sounds.\n\n[Small stresses](https://www63.zippyshare.com/v/fBzDh8Mi/file.html)\n\n[Rattles](https://www63.zippyshare.com/v/QNUukJz8/file.html)\n\n[Big Stresses](https://www63.zippyshare.com/v/NFSeCnKV/file.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"ensou04","CreatedById":140256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T12:13:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This sounds like a very typical Linux problem; Linux is very picky about its capitalization. \n\u003E Also, this mod sounds great and I am looking forward to trying it.\n\ngo ahead and have fun when you have time for it~\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I made some new sounds.\n\u003E [Small stresses](https://www63.zippyshare.com/v/fBzDh8Mi/file.html)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Rattles](https://www63.zippyshare.com/v/QNUukJz8/file.html)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Big Stresses](https://www63.zippyshare.com/v/NFSeCnKV/file.html)\n\nTHOSE ARE SOME AWESOME SOUNDS! are you planning to complete the pack? \n\n-\n\nIm thinking of a new feature, drag forces! so far right now I played with this with an aircraft with NEAR installed and sure it was feeling great, I could totally know when Im pulling lots of Gs in hard turns.

Also could you add a sound for the heat shield ablative doing it\u0027s thing and other hear related sounds like pressurized air leaking and another for adjusting the throttle?\n\nIt can lag the game but so far it wasnt really that bad, I tried this with 10\u002B other mods with ASE, kerbquake and other part mods. I\u0027m guessing the lag could be caused by the fileformat and its bitrate \u0022too highquality for it\u0022. Even though this is a small mod, this really can affect your ram. Adjusting the throttle was originally a feature, i disabled it for now because it spams NullExceptions whenever it is paired with \u0022in my case\u0022: Procedural tanks, Hotrockets and coolrockts etc \u0022i cant pin point which of them exactly is causing it\u0022 but whenever I get rid of the stages that has those mods, it stops spamming.

In the stock game, this doesn\u0027t happen ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif). There\u0027s a mod that does this already, but it\u0027s freaking ancient and probably doesn\u0027t work. Again, in reality, if you\u0027re ascending then the air will get thinner and high frequency sounds are muffled and then muted, so you just get the bassy rumble of the rocket. Is this possible to do?
