I have decided that my favorite activity is building and then destroying anything I can think of. But while disintigrating ships and debries upon impact is fun it\u0027s not the most realistic. I would like to see my caft get scratched scored dented bent punctured cracked split and ruptured not just disappear in a puff. Parts could have fracture points coded in where they can split into smaller pieces that create clouds of debries that can shred other craft too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs craft get damaged they would become ineffecient or even stop responding. Batteries would weaken and die and rcs thrusters may be broken or even stuck on! Tanks could be punctured and even capsules could be breached killing those onboard. This would create a more lifelike and exciting destruction dynamic that would calyx late damage based on debris velocity, mass, and composition. And the composition and structure of what is hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComment what you think and until next time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperiri non ad mortem!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Try not to die!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T06:12:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that a more realistic damage engine like this would probably be a good addition, but I don\u0027t think the devs would add this into the game until later versions, but it could be released soon as some sort of plugin I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T06:44:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fairly certain that they\u0027ve already got some plans in mind for damage and such.

If it was humanly possible to exactly duplicate your own inputs with ultimate precision, then you\u0027d get the exact same flight results each time you re-attempt the same flight the same way from the same starting circumstances. (in other words the only variation should come from the fact that it\u0027s not humanly possible to exactly duplicate your circumstances . The only sort of thing similar to randomness that\u0027s allowed is the sort of near-randomness that can come from a deterministic yet chaotic mathematical system. i.e. when you roll a die, it\u0027s technically deterministic rather than random but it only seems random because there\u0027s too many sensitive variables for you to humanly track or control.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Morrigi","CreatedById":25077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T20:45:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight not have to be on BeamNG\u0027s level, but I would like to see a system that doesn\u0027t involve things ceasing to exist when they get wrecked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
