The pilot has a more immediate problem, he has about half the 02 he might have standing on the top of mt Everest. How do you get the water to boil, you burner flames out. The other problem that he will find before that limit, the pH20 relatively increases versus p02, so a few thousand feet before reaching hat limit his moisture in the lung is creating a positive pressure preventing inhalation of O2, so in reality not to much higher than Everest you are reaching the suffocation limit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLife as it turns out is not that flexible, might explain why little booblings are not popping up in for group photos in our mars expeditions.
