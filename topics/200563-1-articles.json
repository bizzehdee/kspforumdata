something... if you want to get traction, it\u0027s important to understand \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhy they\u0027re doing things the way they are\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (i.e. their \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereasons\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E for not doing what you want).\u00A0 Because they care about \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etheir\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E reasons, not yours-- so if you don\u0027t address those reasons, you won\u0027t get anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m hardly an expert on console development or the various business logic that goes into all of this, so take this with a grain of salt.\u00A0 However, my (possibly imperfect) understanding is that the reason console manufacturers tend to have a fairly rigid, cumbersome certification process is that \u003Cstrong\u003Ethey are protecting the brand of their \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Econsole\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 They know that if there are a bunch of titles on their consoles that don\u0027t work, then the market (i.e. their console-buying customers) will tend to blame the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eplatform\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, not all the individual game developers.\u00A0 \u0022Ew, don\u0027t buy Console A, their games are all broken.\u00A0 Buy Console B instead!\u0022\u00A0 I think that\u0027s what they\u0027re primarily worried about.\u00A0 They put that rigorous certification in place to prevent brand-destroying lemons from slipping through.\u00A0 \u0022How fast do things get updated with new features\u0022 is not really something they care about as much, since that\u0027s not what drives their revenue stream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it imposes some inconvenience.\u00A0 And yes, that inconvenience gets \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eespecially\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E exacerbated for little indie games like KSP that tend to update frequently.\u00A0 But remember, they primarily care about where their dollars are-- and my impression is that the overwhelming majority of the market for console games is comprised of a fairly small number of really hugely popular titles.\u00A0 If you\u0027re a console manufacturer, and the dozen most-popular games on your console account for 90%\u002B of the dollars from game sales, then \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethat\u0027s\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E what you\u0027re protecting.\u00A0 So if your certification process does a good job of working with \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethose\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E games\u0027 release model, then you\u0027re likely going to be less concerned that it causes problems for some teeny tiny niche product like KSP that\u0027s much less than 1% of game sales for your platform.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, like I said, I\u0027m no expert here and I could be wrong about aspects of what I\u0027ve just said-- would love to hear input from someone more knowledgeable in this area.\u00A0 And I also don\u0027t mean to belittle \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eat all\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the frustration that KSP console players regularly experience-- it\u0027s vexing in the extreme and yeah, that really sucks, and I totally understand why people would

The whole certification process is not to... wait, right, you don\u0027t seem to know why that procedure exists in the first place.
