Hubble inconsistenceies could be from light reflection contamination from other objects. I found this type of science speculative. What they are saying is that the composite light from closeup and Hubble changed, i supoose if you had a snowstorm or vapor of any kind the light would depolarize and you could detect this no matter how bad the focus was, but that may not also include other light sources. For example the light from stars in intergalactic space that are to small to be seen by hubble. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was just having this conversation this PM about a clinical science issue, with statistics you can have a p-value of 10E-50 and thats great, but then you have to resample and study in different ways to figure out what it means. Problem is that New Horizon has well passed and what they are needing would be a satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
