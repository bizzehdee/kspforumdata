It has to do with the precomputation system that used to be outside of the game and in a separate tool, let\u0027s say that before configs were only able to be rescaled at will in game by breaking physical correctness which causes a lot janky issues and edge cases and things looking \u0022off\u0022, now you can rescale them but the correct way because the atmo generation is in-game.\n\nThere\u0027s not an easy way but you don\u0027t have to restart from square one. There\u0027s no automatic retro-compatibility because the atmo model changed enough that you can\u0027t get 100% the same result (although now you can get better results).\n\nLook up your old atmosphere Rt value (from the config) and multiply it by experimentalAtmoScale, then in-game in the atmosphere tab look up the calculated atmosphere height (which says auto), divide the old Rt \\* atmoScale by the new height, and use that value in the rescale atmo box in the same tab, that will get you 70% of the way there, at least height wise, save the config (if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E patch you have to save the values manually), the rest adjust to taste.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 hours ago, Kerb Your Enthusiasm said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Apologies if this has already been addressed, but is there a fix yet for Scatterer causing Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere to extend out massively 5 times it\u0027s normal height yet?
