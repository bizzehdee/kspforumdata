The upside of this and living in Florida was that I got to visit Disney World often. Like me, my parents grew up visiting the parks as well so with their knowledge and experiences in hand, I had learned fantastic shortcuts to various destinations and saw things change as time went on. Strangely I only visited the other major theme parks (Sea World, Universal and KSCVC (Kennedy Space Center Visitor Center)) once as a kid. However as of recently my visits to Disney have gotten fewer but I have started to try and make more frequent trips to the KSCVC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis thread is simply a compilation of all my thoughts, experiences, as well as my advice to those visiting and such. I\u0027ll also answer questions as best as I can (noting I have never worked for Disney albeit I have one relative who does but never have I spoken to them about the subject) so bare that in mind. The last thing I\u0027ll provide is some secrets about the park and what rumors and stories I have heard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said; I\u0027ll just dive into the subject.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHistory:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWalt Disney World\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Csup\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(I\u0027m writing this little history segment by memory so it\u0027s why I\u0027m avoiding dates and other precise information since this is the history I\u0027ve learned growing up.

The park was bought by Walt Disney in the 40s by using smaller corporations to buy the land. He planned to open a new theme park after the success of his California based theme park (DisneyLand). His main reasons to was the separate guests from the city whereas DisneyLand was surrounded by urban sprawl. One of the first works built was Cinderella\u0027s castle as the center piece of the Magic Kingdom. From there he rereleased various rides and attractions from the original park, such as the Haunted Mansion, Carousal of Progress and Pirates of the Caribbean (one of his later concepts which he did not sadly life to see completed).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nOne of the two large scope projects Walt had envisioned was creating an advanced community for modelling independent operations and development and a redesigned government concept. This was known as the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (anyone familiar with the era will know everything was \u003Cem\u003Eof tomorrow\u003C/em\u003E or names of the like), or EPCOT. Now visitors today will known EPCOT was one of the 4 parks that make up Disney World despite it originally not having anything to do with theme parks. This change was made after Walt\u0027s death as the company didn\u0027t want to risk attempting such a large scale endeavor. As such, they converted the idea into the theme park we know today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nLater on, the two new parks came about. One being the Animal Kingdom, a park based around Animal exhibits and Disney\u0027s more animal-esque films (Bug\u0027s Life, Lion King, and so forth). The other being MGM Studios (now known as Hollywood Studios). Hollywood Studios being a home to the more film based properties and worlds Disney wanted to expand upon. In the 90s, this is where the Star Wars ride was based along with a Muppets 3D attraction and \u0022The Great Movie Ride\u0022 showing off replicated sets from films ranging from \u003Cem\u003EWizard of Oz, Alien, Indiana Jones\u003C/em\u003E (despite having an attraction of it\u0027s own), and \u003Cem\u003EFantasia\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nWalt\u0027s other great project was to create more advanced moving puppets that he later named Audio-Animatronics... and I\u0027ll tell you first hand these things are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efreaky\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Eand even with a lifetime of getting used to them and learning about them in my free time, they are still no less freaky. Audio-Animatronics (also known as animatronics) is a form of machinery that is built to replicate a person or character and moves using pistons, actuators, strings or other such devices to create movement. These movements either occur repeatedly or could be preprogrammed as was best seen on Walt\u0027s groundbreaking attraction, \u003Cem\u003ECarousal of Progress\u003C/em\u003E. There riders could watch as multiple animatronics would move and talk as things happened around them. This was later improved on as seen in the \u003Cem\u003EHall of Presidents\u003C/em\u003E where Abraham Lincoln can be seen standing up from his chair at one point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nThese machines continue to be used throughout various amusement parks across the world in various forms and continue to be updated and improved upon as to improve the lifeliness and realism of the machines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThoughts and Opinions On Current Events:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAttractions come and go often, however the reason they do and what to expect is based on current activities throughout the various other branches of Disney (film making and TV shows and such). Sometimes attractions and rides are unsuccessful and need to be replaced, or it\u0027s unreliable and too complex requiring more downtime (repairs, and maintenance) than it does remain open, maybe it\u0027s old or maybe there\u0027s a new ride concept that needs a home, so an existing one is given the boot. Despite having hundreds of miles of land in the Disney World property, Disney still attempts to reuse it\u0027s existing areas as much as possible rather than expanding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor those who don\u0027t know, Disney has just acquired LucasArts and all that entails (mostly Star Wars and Indiana Jones). Disney is also updating, remaking and replacing various rides throughout it\u0027s theme parks. \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGranted which rides will be replaced (and with what) is purely speculation based on rumors and personal experiences\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E. One news report that upset me to hear was that the \u003Cem\u003EMaelstorm\u003C/em\u003E ride at Epcot had been replaced by a Frozen style ride which despite being obviously a likely candidate for being made into a ride, was a poor substitute. Maelstorm mentioned the colorful background and history of Norway. The ride also featured animatronics and a post ride film where riders could learn and view more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother likely candidate for replacement is the Muppet Vision3D ride in Hollywood Studios as it\u0027s popularity has declined as the attractions style has been replicated and the hype from the shows has also. The likelyhood increases as one notices that with the acquisition of LucasArts Disney is likely to expand it\u0027s Star Wars themed area and the Muppet studio area is close by. Candidate number 3 is Michael Jackson\u0027s Captain Eo. Like Muppet Vision3D, the hype has dwindled and the rides return was mostly in response to the death of Michael Jackson and with the decrease of interest it is on the possible cut list. Possible number 4 has been rumored (less support despite a lot of internet discussion elsewhere) that it could be Walt\u0027s Carousal of Progress because the scenes (especially the future section) has become significantly outdated as has the animatronics and the machinery of the attraction. However it has a chance as the ride has become a staple of the park\u0027s history, and more importantly, Walt\u0027s Legacy. There is a possibility of there being changes in the future though (again, unsupported inference).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EExperiences:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I\u0027ve said, I grew up alongside the parks my entire life (and despite being only ~two decades old, there are still large parts of it I can easily forget or look over. However thankfully I have two mindful parents who can remind of those times I cannot remember.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the earliest memories I personally have is when I was visiting Epcot with only my mother. I must have been 3 or barely 4 at the time, so my memory is a bit faulty and weak here. But what I do remember is getting lost and separated from my mother. We were in Epcot\u0027s Mexico area at the time. I thought (being a kid) that she must have gotten on the ride (Gran Fiesta) without me. From there my memory says that I got onto and then back out of the ride before finally my memory gives out. However thankfully I can retell the story from my mother\u0027s perspective now. According to her, I was told to stand by a toy stand as she looked at some merchandise. But being a child with ADHD, I got easily distracted and wondered off. From there, it took her about two minutes to notice I was lost. Thankfully it seems I may have attempted to get on the ride but rather approached a Cast Member (Disney Employee) and informed them I had lost my mother. At which point they followed very strict protocol. Meanwhile with my mother had contacted another Cast Member, so they got another employee who asked her what I looked like and it wasn\u0027t long before they brought me near here. However the Cast Member had my hand and had me personally identify her as my mother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother common experience as a kid was simply screaming my head off during rides with animatronics. For some reason, they scare the crap out of me (and are still unnaturally disturbing). So my parents commonly had to drag me out of various rides at random times because I saw something that would upset me and force us to leave... in retrospect I do kind of guilty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there was a time when me and my mother went on the Bug\u0027s Life attraction (located in the Animal Kingdom centerpiece, the Tree). We had never really been interested in it until I was about 8 years old. At which point we finally decided to ride it but the various effects and most importantly the falling of bugs effect just freaked both myself and my mother out to the point we had to ditch. That is a time I do not blame myself for unlike the previous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if they still do this, but the parks used to let kids ride with the drivers of the monorails and I was lucky enough to be one to do so on multiple occasions! Also for those who don\u0027t know, the monorail is a \u0022subway\u0022 style transport system built above the parks and various areas to transport visitors to different destinations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was also a band kid. At least for all three years of middle school (also known as Junior High or Secondary school elsewhere). The upside of it is that at the end of the year was a performance at Disney. Because of it we could go get int through secret entry ways and also provided it\u0027s own series of stories. The biggest being the first time I performed there in 6th grade. All was going well as we began our first song (and the only one where I was playing snare drum) when the Florida wind snagged my music sheet and tossed it someplace I never found. So for the rest of the song I was left without any means of knowing what to do. As such I could only stare forward and hold my firmest poker face. Thankfully all ended well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother story is my personal experience with the Animal Kingdom ride, Expedition: Everest, or the lack therefore. It should be noted that despite frequently visiting Disney World the least visited park was the Animal Kingdom as it was the personal disdain from my father who found it the most boring and with the least content. That said, whenever we would visit the ride, it would always be closed for various reasons. The common reason being some technical issue. Granted it should also be noted that the ride does include a massive animatronic which could easily encountered issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I\u0027m discussing the Animal Kingdom, it should be noted that those who suffer from multiple back injuries should avoid the twisty dinosaur ride. As it destroyed my father\u0027s back. Caused no injury itself but agitated his existing one. That said, those who visit theme parks should treat the warnings and advise seriously. They are important and ignoring them can cause injury or worse and I would hope that your intention isn\u0027t to get hurt on your family vacation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last two stories I have are both romantic ones. The first being that in the alley to the left of the Hall of Presidents (near the musical stage) is where my father proposed to my mother. Spoiler, she said yes. The second story being my own in that on the Spaceship Earth ride. This was also during my 6th grade year and after my dramatic musical incident. Just after the massive decline to the exit of the ride, I had my first kiss with a girl from my grade. That is all I\u0027m going to say about that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFAQs:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Do they really have cameras everywhere?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Just about. This is more for property and ride care than security. The cameras being mostly located at major traffic points, entry/exit-ways, behind the rides and on the rides themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Why does rides stop so often?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: A common cause is that someone with a handicap (wheelchair or crutches) is boarding the ride and to prevent a backup, they simply pause the entire ride (granted only on select rides). Another reason could be that there is a technical malfunction or failure of some sort... granted it\u0027s very possible you\u0027d know it if that was the case. The most likely and the second most common reason is because someone isn\u0027t following the ride instructions or has triggered an alert on the ride. Ride\u0027s commonly stop when riders are detected out of their seat or standing in an area their not intended to be. So following instructions is key for yourself and others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: What is a common reason for animatronics to break down?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: A common reason for them breaking down is the wear and tear on various joints and points on them from every day use. Another (for the more complex animatronics) reason is that their hydraulic fluid may become empty or their pistons to become stuck (in a few Youtube videos you can see a Munchkin from the Great Movie Ride and a pirate from the Pirates of the Caribbean \u0022twitching\u0022 or rapidly moving back and forth. This is likely because their pistons are not moving smoothly but are rather getting stuck on each ends of the piston before finally shooting to the opposite end causing this erratic \u0022twitching\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: What was my worst experience at Disney?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Probably the day I got stuck on Test Track in the \u0022freezer\u0022 room for about 30 minutes. Despite it only being a brisk 40f, I was borderline experiencing hypothermia by the time I got out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Are the shows worth it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Yes. They are worth seeing. However personally myself, I\u0027ve seen them several dozen times as a kid and now it\u0027s more of a matter of getting from A to B the fastest and during the parades and floats I take advantage of the reduced ride wait times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: FastPasses; what are they and are they worth it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: FastPasses are a way of getting onto a ride faster than just showing up. Visitors can claim a time early in the day while their being distributed and through that get on the ride with little wait time. They can be worth it. Some rides will have only a 5 minute wait time, however others (such as \u003Cem\u003ESoarin\u0027\u003C/em\u003E) can have several hour wait times which makes it far more useful. I\u0027ll discuss Soarin down below in better detail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETrivia and Points of Interest:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be noted that the Epcot ball is itself it\u0027s own ride. Some overlook it thinking it\u0027s not, but it is the ride \u003Cem\u003ESpaceship Earth\u003C/em\u003E and is amazing. It should be a place to visit every time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEpcot is home to Mission to Mars. A spacey ride which can allow riders to experience launch forces inside a giant centrifuge simulator. The actual ride is filled with a spacecraft interior in very much the style of a Space Shuttle/Apollo vehicle. Again, a must for visitors to Epcot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile at Epcot, it should be noted that in every nation of the park, those who work there (whether running merchandise stores, selling ethnic foods or running the rides) are always from the nation they work in. So those who work in Mexico, are generally Mexican. When in Japan, the employees are generally Japanese. When in the UK, the employees are generally English and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt about 10:30 every night, there is a fireworks show at Epcot and the Magic Kingdom (possible Animal Kingdom too, but I am uncertain). At Epcot, it is \u003Cem\u003EIlluminations of Earth\u003C/em\u003E. So if you visit, you should definitely stay for it as it\u0027s amazing. It takes place in the central lake of the park so it\u0027s easy to find and see. Not too long ago I could hear the fireworks show from home... which is a long way despite being in the same state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOften a lot of the animatronics that used to be part of a shutdown attraction, get moved to a new location. When Carousal of Progress was shutdown and replaced by America Sings, that replacement was later shut down and the animatronics from that got moved to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride or, (as I\u0027ve heard) had several of the animatronics \u0022deskinned\u0022 (ick, creepy) and their heads removed and replaced to create the G2 droids seen as you walked through the attraction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAdvice:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDo what the Cast Members say.

A lot of the time when a ride is stopped the reason is because the ride has detected that someone has performed an unsafe action (possibly standing, or moving). As such the ride aborts and waits alerting the ride operator of \u0022trouble\u0022. This requires a Cast Member to check various areas (generally entrances and exits) before continuing the ride.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESummer vs Winter Planning\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you visit the parks during the summer then you need to plan for rapid weather changes, long duration storms and mid day (2-3pm) storms. These occur reliably starting in June. May is the driest month of the year for us, so if your planning a summer trip, then is the best time. If your visiting during the winter, the best time is October or early November. Any later and you start to get what we call \u0022snow birds\u0022 or northern Americans who frequent down here during the winter to escape their own winter. Because of them, the parks get very crowded very quickly so planning is key to avoid this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERoutes and Transport Matters\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlways have a plan for how your going to get places and when you reach them, what transport you\u0027ll need. Some parking lots can be a mile or more deep from the far side. However depending on location, there may be trams that occasionally pass by to carrying visitors. Also, you don\u0027t need to park in the park you want to go to in order to get there. They may be better parking options. Keep that in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBe ready to stand and walk a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne advise my family always gives to new visitors to the parks is that you will be walking and standing a lot.

But we were not so well off growing up, so we only got to go every couple of years or so, so it was a real treat for us. Funny, I always remember the mundane things, like the Hundred-Acre Parking Lot, and sitting in the endless traffic jam that always happened when you waited to closing time to leave. My mom and dad would always make sure that my brother and I were in our pajamas before we got settled in the back seat so we could sleep on the ride home and go straight to bed when we got there, but we would never get to sleep until we were out of the parking lot because Dad would spend the entire time loudly growling about this idiot doing that or that moron doing this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I was in high school I remember going with our church youth group, and me and my two friends Tony and Victor just had the time of our lives. On Pirates we wanted to see if we could really tip the nose of the boat into the air on the drop (which was an urban legend we had heard about). So we managed to get into the very back seats of an empty boat, and then just as it crested the top of the drop we jumped up out of our seats and sat on the very fantail of the boat. \u0026lt;WHUMP!\u0026gt; The ride operator caught it and put the brakes on the boat. Over the PA system, in his best monotone drone, he said, \u0022Please remain seated with your hands, arms, legs, and feet inside the vehicle at all times.\u0022 We were laughing, and Tony yelled, \u0022PARTY POOPER!\u0022 Over the PA system in the same monotone, \u0022I heard that.\u0022 We bought bags of the sour balls and were throwing them at each other on Haunted Mansion and the Skyway. Right before closing time we were trying to see how many times we could ride Space Mountain. There was no line to speak of, but they still had the chains up outside, so we were running out of the exit and jumping all the chains to get back to the entrance. At one point I misjudged my jump and my foot caught on the chain. \u0026lt;WHAM!\u0026gt; Face-plant. But, ding-dang-it, I was going to ride Space Mountain. I got up and kept going. We got on like six or seven times before they closed it. Next day my knee was all swelled up, so mom took me to the doctor. I had a hairline fracture of my kneecap. (But this was all 35 years ago, when the security was much more lax than it is now. These days we would have totally been kicked out.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGrad Night was funny. My girlfriend went with her ex. He had bought them tickets back in January, before they had broke up and she had started dating me. But he still wanted to go with her, and she was too polite to turn him down. I wasn\u0027t happy about it, but she was all, \u0022We\u0027re not getting back together, we\u0027re just going to Grad Night.\u0022 One of her friends had no date because her boyfriend had shipped out for the Marines, so I wound up going with her. It was all cool, until it wasn\u0027t.
