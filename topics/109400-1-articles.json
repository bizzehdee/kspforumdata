However, some people will use the IRSU to fuel their lander, because the logistics are easier that way. If your IRSU is in orbit, you have to give the lander enough fuel to land, return to orbit, and dock. Having the IRSU also makes it so that you can have smaller fuel tanks on the lander, since you can create fuel on the spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T20:40:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 08:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reddeyfish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monthar","CreatedById":117764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T20:39:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll you have to do is land near the refinery and have a ground vehicle that can transport the fuel between the refinery and ship that needs fuel.
