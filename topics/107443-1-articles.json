And now for a more helpful answer: Yes. When you deploy the fairings your vessel\u0027s weight will go down.

It depends on what my payload looks like, if there is some pointing things in there sticking out. eg. accidentally deployed solar panels, I wait until closer to 60km. This is subject to change if it\u0027s still in my main booster stage or the ascent stage. If it\u0027s the former, I don\u0027t bother too much, if it\u0027s the latter, I dump that fairing as soon as I feel brave enough."},{"CreatedByName":"Juicy","CreatedById":142505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T15:49:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Which leads to another question... at what height do the fairings stop helping?

Logically, it\u0027s also safer not to jettison farings while accellerating, since you might fly into the debris."}]}
