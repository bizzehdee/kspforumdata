It had been dropped and the hinge that let the screen rotate up was pretty much destroyed, I could only use it plugged in to an external monitor with a USB keyboard/mouse and the battery wouldn\u0027t hold a charge anymore so it had to plugged in at all times, the cord was finicky and if someone so much as even glanced at it the wrong way it would come unconnected and the computer would shut off immediately.\u00A0I mean it was just terrible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI couldn\u0027t even dock with the space station I launched because the frame rate would drop into the single digits whenever I got within physics range of it, except for the times when it spontaneously exploded instead forcing me to reload, lol.

I know it can be discouraging sometimes, especially when you see some Youtuber playing it at 3000fps on max settings in 4k on 3 different monitors. Your achievements mean more than his though, because you had to struggle harder for them, be proud of playing KSP at 15 fps, it shows you are a true fan of the game.
