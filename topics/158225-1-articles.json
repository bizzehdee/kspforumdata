essentially rounding to \u0022not working\u0022. \u00A0(determined by being able to time warp while running the engine) \u00A0I was hoping to get something as genuinely useless as the numbers coming out of the Eagleworks papers as a demonstration of how low the numbers are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I was hoping someone knew if/what the minimum values would be for thrust/acceleration before they get rounded to zero by the game. \u00A0Then I can just scale the size and power consumption until I hit the
