You\u0027ll notice that it shows about 180m/s when you\u0027re sitting on the launch pad. If you launch straight up (and ignore the air, which is also spinning at 180m/s near the ground), as you get higher and higher, the circumference of the orbit at that point also gets larger and larger, which means that 180m/s won\u0027t let you keep up with the spot on the ground that you left. If you fell straight back down, you\u0027d hit to the west of your starting location because the planet would spin underneath you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tipsyMJT","CreatedById":25743,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T17:16:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you.

I think in a vacuum, you\u0027d land pretty much where you started at the timescales we\u0027re talking about, i.e. where the curvature of the planet does not come into consideration. The whole circumference increasing argument is moot because you\u0027re not moving at orbital velocities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if the world was really small or had very low gravity, so the fall took an appreciable fraction of the world\u0027s revolution time, then I think you\u0027d actually land to the east of your starting point because your velocity vector perpendicular to the ascent would always be, say, 180m/s, but the velocity vector of the launch pad stays the same total magnitude, but changes direction as the planet rotates, meaning its component perpendicular to your ascent becomes smaller and smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe should test this on, say, Gilly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
