If you build a craft and later remove a part from the installation that the craft is using, attempting to load it will prompt you with a message and tell you which part your missing and fail to load the craft. This is expected and a nice feature, but after this occurs, your stuck. You can\u0027t load any other craft, you can\u0027t leave the VAB/SPH (the exit button does nothing). You can\u0027t exit the game. Your only option is to forcibly kill the program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is using Windows 32-bit version.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-08T19:15:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2014 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T19:15:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFixed in 0.25\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
