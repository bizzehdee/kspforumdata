The project was ultimately cancelled in 1994 but not before producing some beautiful airframes that are way ahead of their time. Specifications drafted by the Polish Defence Ministry called for a STOL jet with a top speed of Mach 0.85, making it something like a high speed version of an [OV-10 Bronco](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125522-Powered-by-KAX-Rockwell-North-American-OV-10-Bronco-Counter-Insurgency-Aircraft), or a smaller but much faster counterpart to the famous A-10.\n\nThere is some talk that this aircraft could have been one of the most efficient ground attack jets of modern times but in 1994, defence spending was not the top priority for Poland. Nevertheless, this \u0022plane that never flew\u0022 deserves remembrance for its radical approach to achieving its design objectives - the PZL-230F Skorpion wouldn\u0027t look out of place in a sci-fi movie and resembles a compact YF-23 or SR-71 from certain angles. \n\nFrom observing the basic design, it would appear the designers wished to maximize center-body lift and provide a large lower surface area for payload carriage. The outer wings act as huge all-flying control surfaces but this is not reflected in our Kerbal replica due to parts limitation issues. This is compensated by using active canards that provide a huge control moment up front for superb low speed, low altitude maneuverability crucial for an attack fighter\u0027s performance.\n\n![wYoBgT7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wYoBgT7.jpg)\n\n**Aircraft Role in KSP:** \n\nWhile a low altitude [ISR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence,_surveillance,_target_acquisition,_and_reconnaissance#ISR_.28Intelligence.2C_surveillance_and_reconnaissance.29) platform could be of limited use in ensuring security around the Space Center\u0027s vast maritime and terrestrial sphere of responsibility, no real purpose for military aircraft exists today. \n\nHowever, the PZL-230F\u0027s ability to haul large centerline payloads allows it to serve as a short range, low cost scientific survey aircraft. It is also constructed exclusively from Level 1 parts obtainable from the basic Research Center, and is perfectly comfortable operating in rough field conditions. Pilots can also gain experience operating high performance jet aircraft using the Skorpion; it\u0027s low level top speed in excess of 1,000 kph and ability to pull significantly more G\u0027s than the average pilot can accomodate, is not to be trifled with. \n\nIn summary, this design is worthy of consideration as a high performance training aircraft to develop pilot competencies. It can also be used to deploy dropsondes for scientific survey purposes. \n\nFurthermore, the KSP replica has a larger wing area than the original design and with 160kN worth of static thrust from its twin engines, significantly more powerful than the real-world example, allowing a potentially far greater payload capacity. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
