I\u0027d start by moving the nacelle and main wings forward if you can do so without compromising the stability of your craft - you want to start by trying to smooth out the green curve there between the end of the cockpit and the leading edge of the wing. If that makes your craft unstable, I might suggest losing the Cessna Starship wingtips; it looks like you\u0027ve got plenty of tail as is. You might also try adding a bit of strake from behind the cockpit up to the leading edge of the wing, something that will give you a bit of cranked arrow. Finally, since you\u0027re using B9, I\u0027ll ask what you\u0027re doing with the wing thickness. If you\u0027ve left it as default, I might suggest leaving it thicker at the root but thinning it out towards the tip (you\u0027d have to adjust the control surfaces to match as closely as possible).
