I\u0027d start by moving the nacelle and main wings forward if you can do so without compromising the stability of your craft - you want to start by trying to smooth out the green curve there between the end of the cockpit and the leading edge of the wing. If that makes your craft unstable, I might suggest losing the Cessna Starship wingtips; it looks like you\u0027ve got plenty of tail as is. You might also try adding a bit of strake from behind the cockpit up to the leading edge of the wing, something that will give you a bit of cranked arrow. Finally, since you\u0027re using B9, I\u0027ll ask what you\u0027re doing with the wing thickness. If you\u0027ve left it as default, I might suggest leaving it thicker at the root but thinning it out towards the tip (you\u0027d have to adjust the control surfaces to match as closely as possible). You\u0027d be amazed at how much just doing that will reduce your wave drag area.\n\nBest of luck."},{"CreatedByName":"gary85","CreatedById":131308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T13:37:42Z","Content":"ye it did work but it burned all the fuel like normal engine .

I remember that it was quite possible to build an SSTO without RAPIERS and Sabres and with almost any shape whatsoever.\n\n Nowadays with area ruling being a component of FAR, it seems a lot harder and more satisfying to actually create an SSTO, however limited the part choice in B9 is when it comes to making something without the aforementioned dual-mode engines. \n\nBack to my actual craft: In the multiple versions of it I produced, I moved and elongated the side-engine nacelles, offset the canards back, attached the wings to the main body, elongated them and swept them back a bit, thinned them to be 0.120 at the root and 0.40 at the tip, removed the trailing edges where ailerons/elevons are present and conformed these and all other changes with the Stability graphs. \n\nNow I am able to consistently reach between Mach 2.4 and Mach 3 at 15-20 km, however at this point all my designs start losing yaw stability and shortly after this, as speed and height increase, the craft rapidly veers off the prograde vector and stalls. Some of them tend to roll left ever since I launch, some of them start to exhibit this around 15km and \u003E Mach 2.5. I wonder if I need more \u0022wing\u0022, more engine \u0022oomph\u0022, or some sort of anti-roll wing strakes.\n\nI did experiment with strakes under the tail, but they raised the wave drag area too much and I gave up on the concept.\n\nPlease, do provide more suggestions when I post screens of the craft(s) in question."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T15:14:11Z","Content":"Loss of yaw stability is generally a sign that you need more tail, but I\u0027ll defer offering that up as advice until I see the revised design; I seem to recall saying something about \u0022having enough tail\u0022 in just my last post...which, since you\u0027re now having yaw issues, is kinda embarrassing.\n\nStability analysis then - do a set of graphs and derivatives for Mach 2.5 at 17.5 k.
