I\u0027ve seen lots of over-engineered Duna missions, so I decided to try one in a more minimalist style. No nukes, no on-orbit assembly. It has a surface habitat, an RTG-powered rover, and a habitat for the orbiter. I believe that it is 100% stock, although I\u0027ve been using KSPX for so long it may be there are some KSPX parts in there and I just don\u0027t notice them anymore. Anyway, hope you enjoy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/gKuN6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I always loved how adventurous and kind of emotional they are, and it makes me think \u0027These guys might not return. Damn\u0027 It adds a thrill to KSP, and that is definitely what KSP needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
