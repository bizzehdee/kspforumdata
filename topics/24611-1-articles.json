First post here. Been playing KSP for a few weeks and browsing the forums for equal time. You sound like a great community and I\u0027d love to pitch in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I\u0027ve been spending days trying to get stuff into orbit (and successfully landing a HOME habitat on Duna!) but now I want to expand that base with a rover and other fun stuff. I spotted an anomaly on the map and want to go there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI try to think of how I\u0027m gonna land the rover most efficiently without getting too massive. I try to build frames around the payload that decouple when I\u0027ve landed, but it just becomes a big block and I think I could improve on that. Should I launch the rover vertically? Or maybe in parts? What are your designs for getting those vehicles out there?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T03:05:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you post a screenshot of your rover?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ringer","CreatedById":47747,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T03:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake the rover bisymmetrical and have it hang from your lander stage. Then you can just decouple it and it\u0027ll drop a meter or two onto the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover itself should really go light. Use a probe; command pods are heavy. Have some wheels, a little battery storage, and solar panels; the little flat ones are good, because they\u0027re less likely to get ripped off if it tilts over. A light or two won\u0027t hurt, but wheels take up enough electricity that you might want to just keep it to daytime driving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure to land CLOSE to where you want. It\u0027s disappointing how slowly rovers move, but KSP is granting us a lot more than real life; Curiosity probably isn\u0027t capable of more than 1m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristavius","CreatedById":60879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T05:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI prefer large manned rovers where possibly, often weighing quite a few tons, so deployment has always been a big issue. In the image below is one of my smaller rovers I landed last night (top 4 wheels) but pulling a rescue pod behind it, off to get some guys who\u0027ve been stranded on Duna for years. It\u0027s still slightly shorter than my full length one but you get the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always deploy them upright... for moons I usually use 3 engines (120 degree angles) which makes it very easy to tip in the direction I want to. Due to instability entering the atmosphere of Duna last time I tried something like this I used a 4 engine design last night and it was flawlessly stable with more than enough power. As it was, I was landing on hill, so all I had to do is a last minute rotation to point the wheels downslope so the frame fell forwards correctly. If you\u0027re on a flat, simply disable 2 of the engines on the side you want to fall to and use the others to topple over. On moons the frame doesn\u0027t take any damage but on Duna the tanks and engines fell off but that doesn\u0027t matter, it\u0027s just scrap metal anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce tipped over simply release the rover... I always give myself a choice of just decoupling it\u0027s rear docking port or ejecting it with a decoupler so I can choose the most appropriate. I was worried that on Duna the fall many damage the rover but it didn\u0027t do it any harm at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen much more eloquent methods to land them on their wheels etc, but for ease of landing large rovers, and not having to worry about symmetry, an upright deploy works excellently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LZCb2ml.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LZCb2ml.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristavius","CreatedById":60879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T05:52:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso: the above was a total over design in the end... it landed with 2/3rds fuel, even having done most of it\u0027s own orbital maneuvers after leaving the carrier ship.
