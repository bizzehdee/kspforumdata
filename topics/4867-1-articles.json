This may not help much if it moves the rocket off the side and make it fall over. There are plans for other launchpads and I would think one will be designed for mega-ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-26T13:38:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve nrever felt the need to move the tower, since any of my ships wide enough to do that explode violently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a touch game, but half the fun is learning how to stop your ropckets exploding.
