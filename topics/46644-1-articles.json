You can go around once at most without orbital corrections. It\u0027s fine for brief maneuvers, but you don\u0027t want to stay there more than an hour maybe unless you switch to another ship (which it won\u0027t let you do). So here\u0027s my idea for increasing the realism of KSP in a way that would not clash with current game mechanics, and would add another level of depth to gameplay:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(I use USA commas and decimal points)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1.) Basically, just increase the cutoff height of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere from ~70km to ~120km. Based on the scale height of 5000m (from KSP wiki), this means the cutoff air pressure would be reduced from ~84 millipascals to ~0.0038 millipascals, or divided by 22,105.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2.) Incorporate a special physics warp that checks only the mass and overall drag of a ship, treating it as a single solid object, and make all ships within current sphere of influence that are in atmosphere use this physics warp at low warp settings - perhaps something that can be toggled in the menu. I don\u0027t think this will blow up computers but I can\u0027t say I know for sure. This physics warp would take over the normal time warp options where applicable, and would only apply to bodies in atmosphere, the rest would stay on rails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3.) Allow 5x and 10x partial physics warp at 50km, and 50x at 70km. Also allow saving and ship-swapping in 70-120km atmosphere. (different values would apply to different worlds based on atmosphere thicknesses) Also the space music should still play at 70km like before. When outside the atmosphere, your ship would go on rails for time warp but the other ships still in atmosphere would stay on the partial physics warp up to, say 1000x or 10,000x warp. It would be even easier to do this time warp if the physics engine would do fewer drag recalculations for ships in higher atmosphere, say, 1 check per game hour for ships at 70-80km, 1 check per 3 hours for ships at 80-90km, as long as they are still in that altitude range. Ships orbiting that high really won\u0027t experience quick changes in atmosphere thickness unless they are on a highly eccentric orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would allow you to put a station in LKO that you could leave alone for a few days, weeks, or even months depending on its altitude, but you\u0027d have to adjust its orbit every now and then. If this change were implemented, most people should feel like there hasn\u0027t been a significant change--the music still plays at 70km and they can still time warp at 50x. The atmospheric drag even at 80km would be very low and almost unnoticeable over only a few hours.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-27T00:39:41Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2013 12:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T02:27:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t understand what is the benefit of changing this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T02:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe benefit is realism.

I\u0027d like to clarify a few things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Many of you dislike tedium. That\u0027s fine. Things that increase tedium like maintaining orbits and managing supplies are things you can train your kerbals to do when you\u0027re not around, as mentioned by one of the developers at some point about kerbals managing minor tasks. You would then only be required to make adequate arrangements before launch. For maintaining a LKO in atmosphere, this would entail leaving fuel on-board with a thrust mechanism so that your Kerbals could maintain the orbit for you. This would also be even easier to implement because you could actually have the craft on rails during time warp as long as there was fuel left, and the fuel would deplete at a regular, unchanging rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) There would in fact be an excuse not to raise the atmosphere height above 120km. It may take months for you to descend 10km at a 100km orbit, well it will take years at 110km, and decades at 120km. Most of you don\u0027t realize this because you don\u0027t fully understand how scale height works. With a scale height of 5km, every time you increase your altitude by 5km, the air thickness decreases by a factor of e (2.71828). A 25km change decreases the pressure to 2/3rds of one percent of what it was. At 120km, the air is about at the thinness where in real life the air will be blown away by the solar wind, so it would be unrealistic to extend it to 150km. But even if it did go to 150km, it wouldn\u0027t matter since most people don\u0027t run a space program long enough to lose an orbit in the 120-150km range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Ships disappearing suddenly at high time warp or game grinding to a halt when they start falling back in -- There are several ways to handle this. I had two ideas I liked:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - the easy method: put ships on rails at higher time warps, similar to how they can currently swing down to 30km in time warp and not fall in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - the \u0022alarm clock\u0022 method: put an altitude limit on high time warp levels (only for active ships, not debris), and when a ship descends too far and slows your time warp, you\u0027d get a warning about a ship about to be lost, and you\u0027d have the option to either ignore it (and risk losing the craft) or go to it and fix the issue before jumping back to where you were.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course anyone wanting to avoid this tedium has two simple options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a. put ships in orbit greater than 100km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E b. leave fuel on board and train your kerbals to fix the altitude while you\u0027re away\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) programming difficulties implementing this: I understand that the current game setup doesn\u0027t lend to allowing objects beyond 2.2km to run in physics warp. I know this could require some extra programming and I don\u0027t know how much. Maybe it\u0027s actually really easy, maybe it\u0027s super hard. I\u0027m just brainstorming ideas to help the developers understand what we want.

As the poll has showed, most people on KSP forums are young teenagers. Logarithmic distribution is not something people naturally take for granted or understand, not even when you draw it.

Depending on the height of the station, boosting might be needed every 3 months, 6 months, and research satellites might stay there for decades. It all depends on the height and the surface of the object.
