Not to worry though, as the fantastic engineers that built the shuttle knew it was going to be flown by Kerbals, and the emergency landing systems were activated. The crew survived, but the shuttle did not. No problem though. The tracking station will send out recovery crews. Unfortunately the recovery teams got a little overzelous apparently, and successfully recovered the space station, WHILE IN ORBIT!!! I didn\u0027t think that was possible! So, long story short, i wasted 3 hours on that space station, and now it has vanished. At least it was a recovered ship and not a lost crew.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bangstry","CreatedById":144309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T05:22:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReached Ike\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yMSfTfF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yMSfTfF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/33negB6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002233negB6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso reached Gilly at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PCt7uQ1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PCt7uQ1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally got round to building an ore miner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PPHeohF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PPHeohF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T10:48:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking in Tight Places \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JpIPo8A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JpIPo8A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aIThscc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aIThscc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes they all fit with inches to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sewerbird","CreatedById":62540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T11:08:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did my first manned mission to the Mun in my new save with Kerbal Construction Time.
