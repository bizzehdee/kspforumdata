He/she was just drinking the fresh milk right from the cow.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis skill was giving him/her a significant benefit in health and survivability of this person and its descendants.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs a result, most of Northern Europeans, such as Slavs and Germans, happily drink fresh milk all their life, while Southern people more often can\u0027t do that and either drink sour milk or eat cheese.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the cats living in the Northern Eurasia were strongly depending\u00A0on the human food stock, so their winter diet was consisting of mice and what they can steal in a peasant\u0027s barn.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the most common thing to be stolen or gifted was obviously a pot of milk, so the cats, having similar mutation and able to digest lactose in adulthood, had a\u00A0life-essential advantage over other cats who didn\u0027t,\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, fresh milk is a traditional food of North Eurasian cats, and they don\u0027t know that some people think that\u0027s not so\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Like our local Siamese who was doing it for all her 18 years).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-31T07:12:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2021 07:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-31T16:30:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think our cat has ever drank milk.
