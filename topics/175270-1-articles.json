Engine gimbal is fine if your throttle position is constant, but it\u0027s easy to spin out of control if you need to throttle up just as you touch down... and if you do end up facing upside down (like Rizzo mentions), you definitely can\u0027t use the engine gimbal to right yourself without accelerating right into the ground.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEngine gimbal can therefore put you quickly in a position that you can\u0027t get out of quickly without using the engine... but where using the engine would be suicidal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-30T16:53:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA good reaction wheel will also help a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally though, you\u0027re taking the path of maximum resistance.\u00A0 It\u0027s not unreasonable for a top heavy lander to be unstable.\u00A0 Building wider, or just smaller in general, will make it more stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-30T16:54:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2018 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Corona688\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NewtSoup","CreatedById":178829,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-30T19:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re really not alone in this - Here\u0027s my Duna Lander.\u00A0 \u00A0You\u0027ll notice that the legs are out on girders to spread them wide.\u00A0 This is because I found on testing even a shallow slope was tipping the centre of mass outside the circle of the landing legs.\u00A0 The capsule up top and the fuel tank being that shape and on top of the lighter science package meant it was an upside down pendulumn.\u00A0 Of course the girders meant\u00A0more drag at launch so fairings were the tool for the job.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ahSXSMo.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022713\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/ahSXSMo.png\u0022 width=\u0022972\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rauko","CreatedById":188489,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-31T20:42:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice design.
