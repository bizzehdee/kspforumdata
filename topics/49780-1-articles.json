I have recently decided to building a mining base on the Mun (I am using the Kethane mod, hens the mining). I have landed a tube which will be used as a corridor type thing on the base. However the problem i am having is when i land the \u0027transfer tube\u0027 lets call it i need to move it to where my base will be (seen in picture) so i built a rover to drive it over, but when i try to dock the tube to the rover it doesn\u0027t work, the docking nodes are touching but the two parts aren\u0027t docking, or even locking for that matter. The transfer tube has a docking node on the bottom and the rover has a docking node on the top so it should work, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried dropping the tube by raising the landing struts but the nodes don\u0027t attach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone can help me out that would be awesome, i have attached some pictures showing ( from top to bottom) \u0027The docking nodes not docking\u0027 \u0027Close up of image one\u0027 \u0027The two different parts (rover and transfer tube)\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s743.photobucket.com/user/jamesmcandrew1/media/2013-10-21_00001_zps9053f210.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i743.photobucket.com/albums/xx73/jamesmcandrew1/2013-10-21_00001_zps9053f210.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-10-21_00001_zps9053f210.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s743.photobucket.com/user/jamesmcandrew1/media/2013-10-21_00003_zps189af12f.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i743.photobucket.com/albums/xx73/jamesmcandrew1/2013-10-21_00003_zps189af12f.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-10-21_00003_zps189af12f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s743.photobucket.com/user/jamesmcandrew1/media/2013-10-21_00002_zps087d4d64.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i743.photobucket.com/albums/xx73/jamesmcandrew1/2013-10-21_00002_zps087d4d64.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-10-21_00002_zps087d4d64.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help that you may post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Valley","CreatedById":73883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T01:58:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking is a problem on the Mun. What works on Kerbin will not work on the Mun or other planets. A few people have been able to solve it - sadly not me. I used KAS mod, but that would require you to redesign almost everything in your fleet and rovers to use that system. People have solved it, without mods, by using landing gear and legs on their rovers, folding and unfolding, trying to get the two parts to wiggle together. Which is what you just did, to my understanding. You may have to test different designs - which means redesigning everything anyway. You may wish to wait for a few more replies before doing anything. Some people may be more helpful.

It\u0027s actually quite reliable, presumably because the rover\u0027s free to swing around on the cables, and thus the magnets have a chance to correct any misalignment without having to fight friction between the rover and the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goobest","CreatedById":89319,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T02:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould aligning them like in your first picture, and then retracting the gears on the tube work?

On the Mun, you won\u0027t have as much gravity pulling your big rig down on the little guy so they won\u0027t quite reach the same as on Kerbin. All of the parts each exert their own stresses and twists on the parts below them so it becomes a complex dynamic quickly if you have many parts or a not-so-simple suspension base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way I have solved this without mods is to use vertical docking ports as much as possible. This does in fact change the design characteristics of many ships in my fleets, but it does allow you to use the same suspension \u0022base\u0022 for many parts as a subsystem. This way each of them are almost guaranteed to sit the same height when you need them to and you can also utilize landing gear or hills to help yourself a lot more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, I have one system where I have a smaller \u0022command\u0022 pod that has just landing gear and tiny wheels. When they are engaged, they lift the pod up to the larger wheeled pod needing to be connected like a train. Also doing this, try to keep in mind how your steering works and you probably have to turn most of them off and/or reverse the front/rear if you use that type of building for rovers or power/kethane/living pods. I like a smaller pod that I sandwich between larger pods so I get the most torque and best control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty fun once you accomplish your \u0022docking town\u0022 on other planets. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T03:43:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible you just have to move the docking port around a little, also try retracting the landing legs.
