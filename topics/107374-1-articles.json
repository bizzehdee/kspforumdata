They have to. There\u0027s no way they can be unaware both from gameplay and our incessant complaining, not as attentive a dev team as they are. The LV-N is meant for high efficiency burns and its low thrust means low TWR and long burn times. If the engine is to be usable, it cannot explode after some time burning (the exact time is HEAVILY dependent on craft construction thus seemingly random). They know this, they have to. To not know this would require them to be so far out of touch with their playerbase its not even funny.
