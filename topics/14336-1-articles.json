But first, let me tell you something about myself. I am an excellent rocket builder, and my first attempts end up completing mission goals easily and with plenty of margin for error. I can also fly rockets very well, and have completed a rendezvous nose-to-nose without the \u0026lt;100km targeting reticule (turned it off in the settings ;P). I have a very keen sense for thrust to weight ratios, and can easily point out a ship\\\u0027s center of gravity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there\\\u0027s space planes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI absolutely SUCK at everything to do with the vehicles. I can\\\u0027t build one worth a crap, they usually end up not taking off, and I cant fly them worth a crap as well. So my plea to the community is for a space plane .craft file or tips on how to make such a plane that follows these prerequisites:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[list type=decimal]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]Must take off easily[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]Must maneuver extremely well and smoothly[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]Must land easily, and...[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]Must be an overall easy plane to fly[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI aspire to be as good with space planes as I am with rockets, but it wont help me much if I cant fly them ;P.

It also has pretty good glide characteristics. Due to the nature of landing gear/runway interactions in 0.15 however, it doesn\\\u0027t take off until the drop at the end of the runway. Once in the air, though it hadle\\\u0027s pretty well. I don\\\u0027t have much trouble and I\\\u0027m not all that good at piloting with a keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that works for you.
