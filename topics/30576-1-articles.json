But I still don\u0027t have an idea on what else I need to do. Do I need to be outside of Kerbin\u0027s orbit? How does the engine I\u0027m using factor into this? I\u0027m using a modded nuclear engine, a \u0022Fatman\u0022 engine with 830 isp and around 90 thrust. Fairly nice. I also use MechJeb2, maybe you can tell me what to keep an eye on in that.

Start from low Kerbin orbit, set target for destination planet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Create a maneuver, add delta-V in the prograde direction until your projected orbit escapes Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence. You\u0027ll need around 1000 m/s for Eve or Duna, around 1500 m/s for Dres, around 2000 m/s for Jool, and anywhere from 2000-3000 m/s for Moho or Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Click and drag your maneuver around until your escape direction is in the retrograde (for inner planets) or prograde (for outer planets) direction of Kerbin\u0027s orbit around the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Adjust your maneuver delta-V to cross the orbit of your destination planet until a closest approach indicator appears, reduce the closest approach distance as low as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. For inclined targets, you can either adjust the inclination along with your ejection burn, or wait until you escape Kerbin and add a correction maneuver. Simplest place for correction maneuvers is usually either the ascending node or descending node. If you will cross both before you get to your destination, then pick whichever node is further from the sun to do your correction maneuver at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have low thrust-to-weight ratio, your initial ejection burn may take a long time, so keep that in mind. You can split up the burn into \u0022periapsis kicks\u0022 if you want to maximize efficiency, but at the cost of more complicated timing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb2\u0027s maneuver planner will set up interplanetary transfers for you if you want.

However, there are a couple of advantages to doing the inclination change as part of your ejection maneuver. First, combining two maneuvers into one requires less delta-v in the same way that traveling diagonally is a shorter path than traveling horizontally then vertically to get to the same point. Second, the closer you are to a planet when you perform a maneuver the more you benefit from the Oberth effect. The hard part is figuring out how much inclination you need on your ejection maneuver in order to hit your target. That\u0027s one reason I made my launch window calculator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uberick","CreatedById":65954,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T02:59:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you\u0027re using a low thrust engine that has long burn times, and you know your ejection angle, you can start doing a series of small burns to slowly build up to almost escape velocity over several orbits of Kerbin.

Fortunately, it is likely that you won\u0027t be too far off (unless you\u0027re trying for Eeloo, of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, all you have to do is burn prograde at the angle specified by the above website. This is independant of planet positions, it merely takes into account the amount of burn you will have to do. It specifies an angle that, after burning up the required delta-v, will put you on a prograde trajectory around the sun. Of course, if you don\u0027t want to mess around with fancy orbit angles, you could put down a maneuver node and adjust its position and amount of burn required until it shows an escape trajectory that is either facing the direction of Kerbin\u0027s orbit, or the opposite direction, depending on whether you want to visit an exterior/interior planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, another option is to simply burn at any point in the orbit until you get an escape trajectory, but stop as soon as you do, and then coast out into an interplanetary orbit that is essentially the same size as Kerbin\u0027s orbit. Then, you can treat it as trying to get from Kerbin to the Mun, and burn prograde/retrograde when you\u0027re in the right position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, another suggestion to get yourself familiar about interplanetary burns, try sending a small probe to orbit the Mun and try to get from there to Minmus.
