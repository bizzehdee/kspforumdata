Note that the above computation assumes that the specific impulse is based on the total mass flow (air \u002B fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe specific impulse of jet engines when computed using total mass flow rate are lower than rocket engines. They must be lower because they operate at lower pressures, lower temperatures, and expel gases with a higher average molecular weight. The specific impulse for a jet engine might be about 100-200 seconds (depending on operating conditions) versus about 250-350 seconds for a rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe specific impulses for jet engines are so high because they are calculated based on the fuel mass only (i.e. the part that\u0027s carried aboard the aircraft). The air that comes from the atmosphere is not included when computing jet engine specific impulse. With this in mind, the fuel flow rate in the preceding example should be the entire 5.7359 l/s. The air flow rate would be 15 times this amount, or 86.0385 l/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing these corrected flow rates, the specific impulse of the Turbojet engine works out to be 800 s when based on fuel flow only, but only 50 s when based on total mass flow. This 50 s number seems unrealistically low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend that the specific impulses for the jet engines be increased to somewhere in the 1600 to 3200 s range, which would result in total mass flow specific impulses of 100 to 200 s. Of course the fuel flow rates would have to be correctly computed. If, for example, the Turbojet specific impulse were changed to 2000 seconds, then fuel flow rate would be,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel mass flow rate = 225000 / (2000 * 9.80665) = 11.4718 kg/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel volumetric flow rate = 11.4718 / 5 = 2.2944 l/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you take this recommendation under advisement and modify KSP accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T19:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBumping this thread in the hope that Squad addresses this issue before the release of version 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T01:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent job finding it, but it\u0027s a long-term known issue. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I couldn\u0027t find any reference on the bugtracker, but I\u0027ve seen it in plenty of spaceplane threads..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T02:30:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, this is a known issue.
