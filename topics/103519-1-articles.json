I entered the time warp on a different vessel so I could warp faster. When I came back to my vessel of interest the engines were on and when the loading finished the engines were suddenly off. At that moment part of the payload exploded (the wings on some attached gliders) and an explosion happened in space where there wasn\u0027t even any vessel or (known/expected) object to explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I go back to the pre-time warp quick save, the exact same thing happens.

There\u0027s obviously more to ships exploding out of time warp than what is contained within the save.
