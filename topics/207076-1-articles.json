Here you are crossing eve orbit instead of touching it, so the cost is going to be much higher. you can get an orbit for 400 m/s if you do this properly. For the same reason that two cars touching each other laterally are taking a lot less damage than in a frontal collision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the way to do it is to burn at apoapsis to raise periapsis until it touches eve\u0027s orbit. Make your periapsis the point of intercept. Of course, you won\u0027t find Eve at your next periapsis, but it\u0027s not a problem; at periapsis, you can make a small burn to change your orbital time and ensure that you meet Eve the next orbit - or in 2, or 3 orbits. You shoud be able to get into Eve orbit for less than 800 m/s total, instead of your current 1700.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only problem with all this is that it\u0027s a lot slower, it will require multiple Eve orbits. Your trajectory is the fastest one - among those with reasonable cost. So, if you only care for speed, go for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. if your problem is the eve lander, you can mine fuel on Gilly, it\u0027s very convenient, and unlike asteroids it doesn\u0027t run out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.P.S. if your ship has 6 nervs and requires 45 minutes for a 1600 m/s burn, then your ship must be around 500 tons of weight. And you have 2300 m/s, you must have about 120 tons of fuel. That you can use to feed your eve lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.P.S. A 45 minute capture burn is going to be horribly inefficient; you\u0027re going to need at least 20% more than that to actually perform the manuever\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.P.P.S. Last I knew, asteroids are indestructible by heat, so you may actually aerobrake the asteroid. Of course, it\u0027s unlikely your ship would survive, but aerobraking the ship alone is going to save fuel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TanDeeJay","CreatedById":188578,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-03T10:04:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship has a 460ton asteroid attached to its nose.\u00A0 \u00A0Thats why it is on such an inefficient intercept orbit.\u00A0 \u00A0My previous version of this ship latched onto a 1300t Class E asteroid and I found it didn\u0027t have enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E so I did the kerbal thing and hopefully made it big enough that no Class E asteroid could defeat it.
