However, in the spirit of being helpful, I\u0027d like to note that you shouldn\u0027t really be using up your RCS on launch in the first place, and I don\u0027t think there is ever a drawback to massless ElectricCharge being drawn from all its sources at once, so it\u0027s rarely a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need launch stability on takeoff, consider investing in some Vernor engines. They use regular fuel and oxidizer, have the same efficiency as RCS thrusters, and more thrust - so you can use action groups to toggle your regular RCS thrusters on and off, so that they don\u0027t fire and waste monopropellant while the stages with Vernors are still attached. If you just need it for the early stages of takeoff, winglets and other aerodynamic control surfaces can serve you much better than RCS as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"giddonah","CreatedById":75291,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T19:23:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, If you\u0027re staging batteries, you want the first stages to drain first, so you don\u0027t eject charged batteries keeping half-charged batteries on your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T19:31:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile KSP uses RCS and Electricity evenly, it does not pull the equivalent amount from each tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample for clarity:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Numbers chosen to make math easy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a ship with 100 units of Monopropellant distributed between 4 tanks such that each tank has 25 monopropellant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI perform a docking maneuver (Or some other RCS operation) and use 25 monopropellant.
