Will see what I can do about adding in a few more decorative paint-schemes based on a few of those (after I get the parts finished/working!).\n\nAnd yes, I believe the white on the Soyuz is ice/frost on the tanks (you can see the fogginess of it in higher-quality versions of that photo...probably even that one if you zoom in).\n\nRegarding upper stages/engine configs... have a few ideas in the works that I need to investigate a bit more, but chances are that I will be writing a custom plugin to handle the upper stages; so you -can- swap in different engine variants/etc, or swap tank configs, based upon your specific needs for the mission. They will likely -not- be \u0027one size fits all\u0027 deals like the current ICPS/HUS, but more of a modular/configurable part(s). It may well be that I end up creating some strange engine-config-swapping plugin to handle the differences in engine specs.... we\u0027ll see. Still a ways out on those, so its good to post up your ideas / feedback / suggestions. Even if I don\u0027t use them exactly, they will likely influence the final design / part setups.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What I\u0027ve seen so far of this is truely amazing! There are even some super cool and useful functions that I haven\u0027t seen in other parts, such as being able to dynamically change between visual and functional models in the VAB.\n\u003E I want to ask if anybody has worked on configs for some of the parts for RO / RealFuels? I still need to read through all 30 pages of comments, so I may end up answering my own question.\n\u003E \n\u003E Some of the parts have obvious and direct analogs in reality, so I may either be able to directly copy some of the RO configs I had developed for some of the Chaka Monkey exploration pack. In particular, I worked on the Ares and SLS upper and lower stage parts. If the ICPS and HUS engines were also capable of retracting, this would be hands down perfect.\n\nThanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Be sure to check back in a few weeks to see the upcoming developments (going to be interesting!), lots more fun stuff to come.\n\nThere are currently no RO/RSS configs, and it would still be a -bit- early to start working on them anyhow, as so much of the mod is still in flux. However I\u0027m pretty sure they -will- be developed in time, even if not directly by me. You are more than welcome to help contribute when the time comes (... could start on them now, but might have to rebalance / update stuff as the mod progresses).\n\nEdit -- Two more quick questions before I dive back into dev stuff:\n\nThoughts on the upper/lower stringers on the orange tank texture? I\u0027m a bit torn... they break up the monotony of such a large texture, but they also seem a bit out of place for the orange tanks.\n\nAny desire for a Delta-IV specific orange texture, with the white inter-tank (as opposed to the yellow/orange on the Shuttle ET)? Would mean more textures / larger download / bigger memory footprint (not as relevant with 64-bit, but VRAM is still limited). Perhaps I should offer most of the variants in a separate texture pack(s)?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T00:08:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 12:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T01:48:00Z","Content":"meh, slap a few RS-25 under that tank, and change the nose cone for a extension and a fairing, and voila, you have what\u0027s been missing ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nEDIT: btw, have you noticed that the game still considers all tanks to be at max height? if you open the info tab in the lower corner and get a 5m tank, even if you\u0027re using a 5m tank it will say you have a 40m long one\n\nmight give some people a headache in career mode before unlocking all VAB and pad upgrades\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T01:50:54Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 01:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JoseEduardo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T02:03:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E meh, slap a few RS-25 under that tank, and change the nose cone for a extension and a fairing, and voila, you have what\u0027s been missing ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E EDIT: btw, have you noticed that the game still considers all tanks to be at max height? if you open the info tab in the lower corner and get a 5m tank, even if you\u0027re using a 5m tank it will say you have a 40m long one\n\u003E \n\u003E might give some people a headache in career mode before unlocking all VAB and pad upgrades\n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI actually -just- noticed and fixed that bug while I was working through the editor-icon size stuff (which should also be fixed here shortly).

Still a bit undecided as to how I want to do it (stock fairing w/ custom texture \u002B geometry, custom fairings... ??)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Shadowmage, one thing that came to my mind:\n\u003E Will your mesh switch plugin account for texture switching as well? For example you have several versions of tanks that use orange texture. Later on you want to add a black texture version that could be switched in editor. So apart from switching meshes you could also switch texture that they use.\n\nSo far the texture-switch module is separate from the mesh switch/custom fuel tank modules, and they can work completely independently (and is the only way they work currently). However I do have the texture switch setup in such a way that it will accept input from external modules, so in the future I could specify a per-fuel(resource)-texture; similar to MKS/Kontainers texture switching. Or really, you could trigger the switch off whatever; it just accepts a single input parameter -- the String name of the texture set to enable.\n\nTexture sets are defined outside of the part.cfg, in separate files (GameData/SSTU/Data/TextureSet-XXX), and can be added/removed fairly freely (and have parts added to/removed from them). If a texture set is not available that is specified in the part, nothing bad happens (you get to click the button an extra time to skip past it).\n\nSo yes, you can certainly add in more texture variants... now... later... both... whichever. Should have no effect on stability / existing save games.\n\nThings are looking good so far on the release. Had a last minute scaling issue that I had to clean up, but it looks like all the fuel-tank stuff is in and working, at least well enough for its initial setup (a few adapters are not included where they could be). Going through and doing a bit of internal testing on all that stuff, and then I have a couple other small issues to tackle (SC-B-SM lower fairing clipping with solar panels), but I can\u0027t forsee any problems with those. So.. hopefully here in a few hours I\u0027ll have the updated release ready.\n\n**Advanced Warning** -- **This update is going to break any craft (saved or in-flight) using the previous versions of the configurable fuel-tanks.**  \n\nI\u0027ll post more warnings with the release post, and on the download page. I would apologize for breaking things... but such is the nature of development and progress (and why these are test releases, in the test/dev thread, with a big disclaimer at the top stating things will often break between releases). But I will thank you all for helping to test things and provide feedback, and generally guide the evolution of the mod.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T20:28:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 08:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T20:53:55Z","Content":"Hit a last minute issue with the editor-part-size detection stuff.

I had noticed model duplication and texture-set inconsistencies, but only when symmetry was used with surface attached tanks. For now you can work around it by setting up a single tank fully to your preference, and -then- using symmetry to attach it. Or just setup to tanks without symmetry, whatever works.\n\nTexture bloat in the main release will likely be dealt with soon through texture size reduction for some parts, and moving the alternate texture sets off into a separate optional download.\n\nAs usual, please let me know if you run across any problems or issues, or have suggestions regarding improvements or balance. \n\nYou can find the issue tracker at: [https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues), please check it before reporting issues.

It does that from time to time.\n\n5m fairings are on the \u0027todo\u0027 list. Likely a 5m straight, and 5m expanded (starts at 5m, tapers outwards a bit) fairing, using the stock fairing module with some custom base geometry. If you\u0027ve seen the KW rocketry ones, they will likely be very similar.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is it really worth having two engine modules on the service module? They seem rather redundant.\n\nNope, not at all (worth it). However, when I modeled those parts I was going for \u0027realism\u0027 (and had intended on originally using proper scaled values for mass/isp/etc), and as such designed the engines and RCS as they are (or close to) the real article. However, if/when I rework the model I will either be removing the secondary engines or repurposing them as high-thrust RCS ports. Currently all the 2nd engine does is mess up MechJeb when you have the engine disabled (it thinks you have higher TWR than you do, and doesn\u0027t start burns early enough).\n\nSo, yes, that is a problem that will be looked into as time permits, but it is likely months out before I start re-doing any of the older parts (probably sometime after KSP 1.1); have tons of stuff to finish and a few new concepts that I would like to develop. Redoing a few of those parts is on the extended todo list (want to rework the ICPS/HUS as well a bit)\n\nFeeling a bit burned out at the moment, so will likely be taking things a bit slow this week. Will likely concentrate on bugfixes, balance, and a bit more texture work for this weekends update/release. I\u0027m currently thinking through options for a customizable-engine module, and might start doing a bit of engine geometry for various engines, though none of it would likely be finished/usable for the next release (engines generally take me a bit). Will probably post up the preliminary design/draft/specs on the engine stuff later for feedback -- if I can get the initial specs figured out."},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T15:45:40Z","Content":"If you\u0027ll be reworking textures, you should take a look at the CM/SM/BPC textures.

Need to model a bunch of engines before I can do what I want with them (or... at least 2 to get the basics working). The plan so far is for a semi-procedural engine part (like the fuel tanks) that allows for easy clustering of engines and gives a choice of mounting options (really just shrouded or skeletal). Ideally I will find a way to set these up to work for both lifters and upper stages (seems doable, mostly dependent on engine choice and mount size). Still in the very early concept stages though, haven\u0027t even started on the coding yet (starting on the models this time, as I figure I wanted a bunch of engine models whether the plugin works out or not).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So what are you doing with the F-1 then?\n\u003E Also the Pyrios is a booster with 2 F1B engines that have nice-looking mounts.\n\nSo... if I can pull the plugin off, you will be able to cluster the 2 F1\u0027s that you need, and already have variable sized fuel tanks (which is far more useful together than a single LFB model that would only be usable for one case/purpose)."}]}
