However I do have the texture switch setup in such a way that it will accept input from external modules, so in the future I could specify a per-fuel(resource)-texture; similar to MKS/Kontainers texture switching.

However, when I modeled those parts I was going for \u0027realism\u0027 (and had intended on originally using proper scaled values for mass/isp/etc), and as such designed the engines and RCS as they are (or close to) the real article. However, if/when I rework the model I will either be removing the secondary engines or repurposing them as high-thrust RCS ports. Currently all the 2nd engine does is mess up MechJeb when you have the engine disabled (it thinks you have higher TWR than you do, and doesn\u0027t start burns early enough).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yes, that is a problem that will be looked into as time permits, but it is likely months out before I start re-doing any of the older parts (probably sometime after KSP 1.1); have tons of stuff to finish and a few new concepts that I would like to develop.
