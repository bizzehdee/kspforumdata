My first couple of test flights were really fun pinwheels and I could see that turning the thrusters/atomic motor on-off manually would never work. Hmmm, I then moved the thrusters to just inside the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cmeatball\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 of the center of gravity (CG) on the display during assembly. I also added a pair of Vernor engines to the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbottom\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 at each end and a pair of RCS thrusters on the sides of the capsule, to use the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfree\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 monopropellant in the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then again searched the forums and figured out how to use groups to toggle the thursters and atomic motor on/off. Hooked the atomic motor toggle to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cabort\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 key and thrusters to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbrakes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 key. Oops, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbrakes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 only toggle when you hold key down, try again. After grouping the thrusters to toggle on the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Clights\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 key (U), I tested again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow, it worked! Staged Atomic motor and Landing thrusters both on (with throttle at zero) then toggled landing thrusters off. Slowed and descended on the Atomic motor as usually. Thrust low, need to start de-cel early (another crash). But, it has enough thrust to make a controlled decent to Mun, so will work better on Ike, etc. at about 1000\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 AGL, slow to stop, toggle off Atomic motor, toggle on the Landing thrusters, pitch over until it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s horizontal with the thrusters pointing down and hurrah!, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding no problem, very wide span of landing legs and low CG make it really stable (landed on a slope, no tipping at all. Note, if you rotate to point Atomic motor the right way, a quick toggle on/off can kill any sideway velocity really easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, remember to put capsule door on side, so Jeb can jump up to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake off was Kool. Toggle on Landing thrusters, inch up throttle, lift slowly up, hover and raise landing legs, up thrust a little, tip up a bit and toggle on the Atomic motor. Then hit Z and toggle off landing thrusters and away we go\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow need to move decoupler to keep Sci-Jr\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s for recovery.

Also, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to add side mounted drop tanks ie.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C asparagus\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 staged tanks (400\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s) to up the Eagle\u0027s dV from 4K to 6K m/s on atomic rocket power.

Note, the vidoe didn\u0027t show a lander with Atomic rocket main engine. I know people have built all kinds of them, but I wanted to do a sideways landing, the landing legs on side of fuel tank and atomic rocket pointed out the back. This design could also be used as a \u0022hopper\u0022 to move about on surface. Eagle itself, without boosters for Kerbal launch, cost $25k. I made this lander with Ike in mind. For small moons,Bop and Pol, only two RM24-77 landing thrusters would be needed. For Gilly, you could probabily just use the Vernor Engines. The $25K does not include the solid/liquid boosters to get the 9.3 ton Eagle into low Kerbal orbit. It\u0027s 13.9 ton with two FL-T400 drop tanks to give Eagle a 6,770 m/s dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic thought was to have a lander that used an Atomic rocket for all of the orbital transfers with \u0022drop tanks\u0022 so that it has enought main tank fuel on landing to make it home, thus able to return to Kerbin with no docking (I really need to learn how to do that.). The chemical rockets are only for Kerbal orbital boost. Using a dV budget of 4,800 m/s plus a 10% reserve gives a needed dV of 5,300 m/s. So I should be able to do with a round trip lander costing $28k with two \u0022drop tanks\u0022.
