Although I figured it was not likely they would meet up exactly anytime soon, I did think it would be cool to try to land it again. (I had very little fuel left). So my guess was that it may have lined up and then crashed while I was playing? But didn\u0027t know if that was possible or that I may have even noticed if it did? I suppose it could have even crossed close to another planet and been thrown off it\u0027s orbit? As the orbit did seem to stretch across the paths of other planets.
