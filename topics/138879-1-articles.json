But this could easily be misleading as people who are satisfied will normally just spend their time playing, not commenting on the forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should know, i\u0027m telling myself i have to post this for a few day now, but was too busy playing lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayin 1.0.5 (my brother\u0027s install), i seldom ever saw any CTD or bugs at all. So, when 1.1 came out, with promise of even better stability and performance, i bought it on steam (\u00E0 day or two before actual release). I really was not soooo happy, as the game was now randomly crashing \u00E0 lot. Then came 1.1.1, the first update in my KSP owner life. I did not knew how to prevent it from hapenning, so broken mods lead to broken saves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, as i was heavily modded, i took it on the chin without complaining, i was mostly responsible for it. Let a few day pass, come back to see we already are at 1.1.2.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayed all of last night, and got a single CTD, and i think i \u0022prompted\u0022 it by erasing too many part too quickly in VAB.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGawd am I happy. I took off the tier1 runway, and Landed the plane in the desert, worked fine. We have to be more careful than before, but 1.1.2 made it possible to fly planes again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat really impressed me is the update performance.
