But making the larger versions is left as exercise to the reader, they are fairly trivial too.\n\nAnyway, the craft makes rather heavy use of clipping to hide its nuke and keep the wheels level. And I gave up on landing, the parachute is enough to bring it safely to the surface, just don\u0027t splash down and add one more parachute to a bigger version.\n\nAnyway, here it is: [MSSTO](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/MSSTO.craft)\n\n![2015-07-07_00020.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-07_00020.jpg)\n\n![2015-07-07_00017.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-07_00017.jpg)\n\n![2015-07-07_00014.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-07_00014.jpg)\n\n![2015-07-07_00012.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-07_00012.jpg)\n\nFlight profile:\n\nTake off at 100m/s, hide the wheels, climb nearly vertically to 10,000, level down to some 20-30 degrees and keep going until your speed stops rising. Then fire the nuke and level down to some 10 degrees. Keep burning until you get the desired apoapsis, it takes a long while and even then needs some corrective burns before you escape the atmosphere.\n\nOn descent keep your nose 20-30 degrees up and engines off, there\u0027s no other philosophy to it. Parachute below 250m/s, over a relatively level terrain.\n\nAnd here\u0027s the aforementioned big brother.\n\n![2015-07-07_00007.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-07_00007.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T20:08:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 08:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T01:30:10Z","Content":"Clever design!
