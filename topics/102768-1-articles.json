So I\u0027m trying to get an idea of what all to expect.\n\nObviously its going to be like my first moments in KSP all over again trying to get into orbit for the first time (because I\u0027m purposely trying to ignore the required delta V), but what else? I\u0027m used to realism mods like Remote Tech, DR, etc but I\u0027ve never played with Real Fuels and the like."},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T09:18:36Z","Content":"You need to go really, really fast - never underestimate this."},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T10:13:42Z","Content":"Liquid engines.

I didn\u0027t realize how much of my piloting skill was dependent on deep throttling.\n\nThrust scaling with Isp is an adjustment, too. A few of my early rockets sat on the pad burning away because I failed to take that into account.\n\nAside from that, it\u0027s a great challenge and learning experience. First time in a long time that I\u0027ve felt so much satisfaction just from achieving orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T14:59:04Z","Content":"How I can get real fuels to work? I installed everything in RO and have options to put many fuels in tanks but engines do not work with anything except stock fuels.\n\nYou have to take care of ascent profile. It is better to overshoot few tens of kilometers and get more time to accelerate to orbital velocity."},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T15:17:11Z","Content":"If your engines refuse to work with anything except the stock fuels, I\u0027d suspect a bad RO install.

Pay attention to orbital inclinations, and launch a satellite into an orbit that matches that of the Moon so you can launch directly into a transfer orbit and bring the inclination difference to the lowest degree you can. Inclination change in LEO requires a *lot* of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC V. Learn the engines and get KER. RealFuels can be a pain at times, but it allows you to do a lot more than stock engines."},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T19:12:23Z","Content":"Get MechJeb. While I consider it cheating in stock, RO is a pain without it. Remote Tech, if you use it, isn\u0027t very good at handling crafts without reaction wheels yet (before I forget: reaction wheels are nerfed in RO, and only present in dedicated parts), wasting a lot of thruster fuel, so consider using MechJeb instead of the RT flight computer (but don\u0027t cheat yourself by circumventing signal delay that way, and keep in mind that MechJeb will only work if there is a radio connection, while the flight computer will only need a radio connection to transmit commands, not to execute them).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also note that you no longer launch at the equator, but about 20 degrees above it.\n\nActually you can choose your launch site in the tracking station. KSC is great, as it allows you to launch directly in an orbit parallel to the ecliptic (use Mechjebs rendevouz info to find the correct time of day). If you want to launch at the equator, go for [Kourou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kourou)."}]}
