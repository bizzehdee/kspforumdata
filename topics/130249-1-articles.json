I think there is a link in this very forum, on the thread about RP1/H2O2 engines, were you can actually read it free (IIRC, it\u0027s out of print). TONS of wonderful, funny discussions about rocket fuel, the why and why nots, and how they were chosen, etc. The subject of rocket fuels is much more complicated than it seems. Good storability, but price? Freezing and boiling points? Hypergolicity? The list goes on...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRune.
