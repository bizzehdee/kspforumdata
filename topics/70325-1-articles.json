It sounds like the stage you\u0027ve got firing has insufficient TWR. This is not uncommon for upper stages, I find the Skipper engine often needs to be augmented slightly with radial engines to get the TWR up high enough. A mod such as Kerbal Engineer or Mechjeb is needed to display the TWR of your stages while still in the VAB (or you could do it by pen and paper...).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T08:48:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf by \u0022falling\u0022 you mean that the nose goes down and you can\u0027t bring it back up, you may have dropped engines that had thrust vectoring (Gimbaling) and now have engines with none, and you can\u0027t control your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FREEFALL1984","CreatedById":104993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T09:06:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah your T/W is too low, after starting the gravity turn you should be able to slowly \u0022follow\u0022 the prograde marker down the navball towards the horizon and the prograde marker should \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Enever\u003C/span\u003E drop below the horizon during launch, if you find you\u0027re having to burn towards the sky to keep the prograde marker above the horizon while still in the atmosphere then you\u0027re asking too much of your lifter and you might find that removing the fuel from the payload before launch helps a little although whether you are left with enough fuel to transfer any excess from your lifter to your payload once in orbit is a different matter. it\u0027s often a useful technique with big lifters and interplanetary tugs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the issue is that the rockets orientation is flipping and then suddenly aiming groundwards then you may have too much drag on the payload, the only way I can think to fix this is to never point too far from the prograde marker in order to keep the center of thrust behind the center of drag so start the gravity turn early, (about 5000m) and turn very slowly\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-24T09:13:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2014 09:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FREEFALL1984\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
