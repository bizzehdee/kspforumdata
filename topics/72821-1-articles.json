Its gravity is about the same as that of Venus, and the atmosphere could be accessed with spaceplanes, which would dip down to mine hydrogen and helium, then fly off into space. Making a balloon aerostat like on Venus is impossible, because in a hydrogen/helium atmosphere there are no lighter gases that would be bouyant. The only problem is the extreme cold, which coupled with the thick atmosphere could disable spaceplanes entering it, though it wouldn\u0027t be more dangerous than the atmosphere of Titan. Flying machines flying with, instead of against the winds, would experience no dynamic pressure and relative wind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T21:53:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022szputnyik\u0022 data-cite=\u0022szputnyik\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...Making a balloon aerostat like on Venus is impossible, because in a hydrogen/helium atmosphere there are no lighter gases that would be bouyant...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou use HOT hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T21:58:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerpenWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DerpenWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAfter hearing about the possibility of KSP\u0027s third gas giant having an actual large solid surface I started to think about its real world analog Uranus.

This is why they are referred to as ice giants, as opposed to gas giants, which are mostly hydrogen and helium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: in the context of planetary composition, \u0022ice\u0022 refers to carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen compounds (including water, ammonia, and methane). It does NOT have to actually be in a solid phase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Neptune is 29% denser than Uranus, which seems to imply that it has the larger core. Uranus\u0027s primordial impactor is believed to be about the size of Earth, so I would expect a roughly Pluto-like composition, about 50% rock and 50% ice. This would significantly increase the mass of Uranus\u0027s rocky core. However, it\u0027s possible that not all of the impactor\u0027s mass was absorbed by Uranus. There\u0027s also a theory that Uranus actually suffered TWO giant impacts: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/uranus-axial-tilt-obliquity/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.scientificamerican.com/article/uranus-axial-tilt-obliquity/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, the impacts would have occurred before Uranus\u0027s moons had formed. Also, we can\u0027t really say whether Uranus\u0027s moons are unusually small because we have no other example of an ice giant\u0027s moon system to compare it to (Neptune\u0027s regular satellites were all either destroyed or ejected from the system by interactions with Triton).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a possibility that the impactor could have dissipated a lot of Uranus\u0027s original heat, leading to the blandness of its atmosphere. However, the Uranian atmosphere hasn\u0027t been studied in detail over a full year yet, and its weather has become a lot more interesting as it approaches an equinox. It seems that Voyager 2 didn\u0027t catch it at a good time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T22:34:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENeptune has a much more violent atmosphere because it\u0027s colder. There\u0027s less friction, so once something starts, it\u0027s difficult to stop it. Most of the energy for such processes of our ice giants comes from the interior. Neptune is more massive than Uranus so the core is hotter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s difficult to wrap your head around these things because we don\u0027t know much about them. One thing is sure - there is no solid surface there. Uranus and Neptune are mostly hydrogen and helium, but they have a higher ratio of \u003Cem\u003Eices\u003C/em\u003E (water, ammonia, methane) than Jupiter and Saturn, so we call them ice giants. Pressures and temperatures inside them are climbing at such rate that you pass from gas to supercritical fluid which gradually gets more degenerate. In case of Jupiter and Saturn, hydrogen supercritical fluid gradually starts conducting electricity, and in the case of Uranus and Neptune ices play that role, except the conditions are much less extreme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is really no concieveable way to navigate the upper atmosphere for the reasons already described by others.
