Just adds steady or flashing leds that can be placed anywhere. I would love to be able to select colors and flash mode with single item, but minimum 4 types should exist - bright white steady, flashing white, steady bright red, and flashing red. White could probably be replaced with green, especially if below suggestion is also implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy? Simple really. Makes it easier to see rest of ship in darkness without big lights on rocket itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso \u0022small lights\u0022 that is omnidirectional should also be possible. Much less bright than current lights, quite a bit brighter than led lights above but advantage is that it could be seen from any side besides from attached side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this will be added, those big lights is annoying lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T23:19:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are white and red omnilights in the B9 pack, and flashing lights with customizable colours in the aviation lights pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKOSMOS has an LED spotlight\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rolf","CreatedById":67058,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T23:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose look nice, but I made suggestion because I am not interested in mods.
