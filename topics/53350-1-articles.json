Spinning rover wheels in the water seems to have no effect, in fact the oceans have no current, it seems. I can turn, and splash, but no directional movement seems possible. Has anyone figured an electric form of liquid surface propulsion?

Fuel is the main issue. Electric power helps keep things light. Honestly this came up because I ran out of fuel trying to de-orbit onto a small island for a landing, and it occurred to me that it would be nice to be able to recover by boating to land. We have rover autopilots now, so throw open some solar panels, and set a course, and go do other things while the rover-boat trolls along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the pesky ion engine, I would love to make use of that for something, but until we can warp while throttled up, I\u0027m not sure what good the ion engine is for game play.

Either build a comlete hull out of structural panels or use just a few panels steeply angled upwards on the ends of I-beams as hydrofoil fins. If fuel tanks stay in the water, you\u0027ll never move more than your own length before running out of fuel. Check out the challenge about building the fastest boat for ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that will get your stock boat moving and speeds up several hundred m/s are possible. HOWEVER, there\u0027s still the problem of maneuvering. Above about 10m/s no amount of rudders above and/or below the waterline will have any effect. So what you have to do is move in straight runs, stop the engines, wait until you slow down to less than 10m/s, then pivot to the new heading and fire up the engines again. Maybe RCS would work better but I haven\u0027t tried that. Also note that apart from retrorockets (which I don\u0027t recommend on hydrofoils) there\u0027s no way to brake, you just have to coast to a stop, which can take a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith mods, you have several options. Probably the easiest is Firespitter, which has pontoons. While intended for seaplanes, they make for great boats if you saw the wings and tail off the seaplane. With these, you still need a conventional engine in the fuselage. Maximum speed is about 120m/s, beyond which the pontoons explode. However, the pontoons have special rudders built into their rear ends that allow full control even while moving fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the Boat Parts and Sub Parts mods by Infinite Dice, which makes excellent boats. Problem is, none of these were intended for space, just staying on Kerbin. Thus, they\u0027re very dificult to attach to rockets to take elsewhere. Also be advised that these mods make substantial changes to how water behaves, which might impact anything else you have in the water, although it probably won\u0027t. Just keep that in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s Hooligan Labs\u0027 submarine mod. Last I looked at this, it only provides a means of getting underwater; control systems and propulsion are up to you. As seen in Scot Manley\u0027s \u0022Eve or Bust\u0022 videos, you can use B9\u0027s compressed air RCS system with a user-modified air intake to do both of these tasks, although you won\u0027t move very fast. Also note that with Hooligan subs (unlike Infinite Dice subs), the buoyancy of everything in the game is changed. The Hooligan sub parts actually don\u0027t make you sink, they make you float. Without these parts, EVERYTHING (including Kerbals) sinks like a stone and going below 600m causes instant death.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"keoki","CreatedById":91957,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T09:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEverything sinks?
