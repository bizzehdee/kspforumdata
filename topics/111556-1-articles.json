Now, probes making pilots obsolete is too strong as it is, but something should be hotfixed about this so that it\u0027s actually worth investing 1000 science into it. Instead of simply buffing the large probe, which is also an option, the already too useful smaller probe could be nerfed instead. It can have manuver following removed (It can still keep the target pro and retro grade markers), and make it available only for the 1000 science large probe."},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T00:19:07Z","Content":"I keep going back and forth on this. I really want the large probe core for efficient stations/refueling/mining/etc, so I\u0027d like it to be cheaper. I might even say I\u0027ve held of expanding some of my operations until I unlocked it as it is so very vital I think. Something that major, which really is, in some sense, the final cog (along with the rockomax node) in the fully-modular world of stations/mining/etc., is worth 1k in my book."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T06:08:59Z","Content":"i usually end up using an OKTO or HECS on all my ships, whatever their size, because all probe cores are basically the same...
