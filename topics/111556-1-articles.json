Now, probes making pilots obsolete is too strong as it is, but something should be hotfixed about this so that it\u0027s actually worth investing 1000 science into it. Instead of simply buffing the large probe, which is also an option, the already too useful smaller probe could be nerfed instead. It can have manuver following removed (It can still keep the target pro and retro grade markers), and make it available only for the 1000 science large probe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T00:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI keep going back and forth on this.
