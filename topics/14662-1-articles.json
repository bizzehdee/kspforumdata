The problem I have is that when I then focus on the individual child craft, I have almost no control whatsoever. I can\\\u0027t move the navball reliably at all and when I fire the engine it just starts spinning uncontrollably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, when I focus on the original craft and my original pod, equipped with even less control surfaces and equipment, the thing flies like a beauty. I can change the inclination and land the pod no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that pods have more control built in but is it possible to get the same control in my little child satellites that I have in my pod?

In the Kosmos pack there is an ASAS module (and one with mechjeb capabilities with an identical mesh) that weighs .01 and attaches to the front of pretty much anything, is hardly noticeable, and if that is just a nosecone on the tips of your children satellites, then you should be able to attach them by just removing them, placing the ASAS modules, and then replacing the cones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\\\u0027s also a few RCS tanks of varying sizes in the Kosmos pack and at least one of them should fit your smaller pods; they are also pretty nice looking and have a smaller vertical profile than many of the other RCS tanks I\\\u0027ve seen. Add on to that that there\\\u0027s a lot of fun stuff to mess around with in the Kosmos pack and I recommend you grab it. You could use the different modules and adapters for the different craft to give each satellite a different look and \u0027purpose\u0027 You shouldn\\\u0027t have to worry about the weight much, as I managed to land about 10 tons of \u0027dead\u0027 weight on the Mun as a habitation/research vessle that was composed mostly of Kosmos parts and used mostly its rockets with some help from NovaPunch adapters and boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zhXNW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zhXNW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
