In any design, the 45s work best centerline with the 30s outboard, particularly if you\u0027re using any kind of radial staging - the place you need the most thrust is at launch. By using both, you get the benefits of both. Even with larger rockets, those engines are good choices (best launch Isp of any of the smaller engine types except for Aerospikes, and the \u0027spikes have their own issues).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad I could be of help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T21:48:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore bracing is needed on the SRB and or the outboard orange tanks.
