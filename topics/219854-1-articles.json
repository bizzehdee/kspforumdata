The post by ZG Alpaca, I think, is a great start to introducing some competitive innovation to this classic challenge. Being a member of other communities with similar concepts, I decided to incorporate their formats into KSP to make a new, more comprehensive list of the different challenges and achievements that are possible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe list I came up with is in the form of a Google Sheet, so that it is more organized and has more potential for expansion into other kinds of optimization in the future if this does well or if someone has a good idea. To go along with this, I made a discord server for this so that discussion and a potential community is not limited to forum posts (though of course this thread may be used for submissions). Here is the link for the server and the list itself:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nList:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n8eY4omh_zHhwIawUMQayXYKfIoeIkssJcgpl7PPFP0/edit#gid=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n8eY4omh_zHhwIawUMQayXYKfIoeIkssJcgpl7PPFP0/edit#gid=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiscord Server:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://discord.gg/a44dQA2U4j\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://discord.gg/a44dQA2U4j\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe part of this that I am the most excited about is a new kind of challenge that I came up with (though of course it has been done by other people), which is the \u0022Most Landings for Least Mass\u0022 challenge (it needs a catchier name I know). The rules are simple: go to as many bodies as you can for the least mass. However, to avoid limiting the player to a Grand Tour, I allowed for landing on the same body multiple times, provided they landed on Kerbin in between those landings (see list for better rules). I included the missions that are already on the list in this challenge, since they certainly should qualify.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, I just want to note that there are many blank spots on the list. I transferred the missions from the old list to the sheet, as well as adding some run that I knew about, but the leaderboards are very incomplete and some missions are completely blank. Hopefully this incentivizes attention being given to those bodies, as each provides\u00A0 unique challenge for the player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope I said everything I needed to say, and I hope this isn\u0027t a bad idea!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
