Upon reaching orbit around Kerbin, i noticed that i could not create any maneuver nodes due to the orbit trajectory missing. The craft was listed as \u0022Landed\u0022 in the control center (which it was definitvely not, i completed a bunch of orbits around Kerbin just fine). Then I tried to decouple the lander from the orbiter when the game decided that i was indeed in orbit but my orbital velocity suddenly jumped from 2200m/s to around 500 which brought me on a collision course with Kerbin. The new trajectory was correctly plotted in the Map Menu. In the second attempt, I replaced the docking ports with a regular decoupler and made it to Kerbin orbit without any problem (could not finish the mission though because patch 0.1.2.0 wennt live before i could play again).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2.

I used docking ports on the lander and orbiter but did not connect them directly by inserting a stack separator between the two ports. Mission went fine, landed on the mun and went for a EVA with Jeb. When i reborded the lander with jeb, i got the notice that my orbiter (in mun orbit) is on a collision course, which it was indeed. The orbiter was on a very elliptical orbit just seconds away to reach apoapsis which was about the height it was before with a stable orbit but somehow the periapsis dropped below the munar surface. I was able to save the orbiter due to excessive amount of fuel reserves. The rest of the mission, including the docking process went fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-04-14T09:15:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2023 09:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by el_huracan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SoulCandy","CreatedById":225508,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-18T15:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilar issue happened to me above Eve, and just yesterday above Bop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Toni","CreatedById":184980,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-25T12:46:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am having the same issue but around Pol.
