When digging into it I found that KSP Fuel Cell and Fuel Cell Array use more fuel than KSP 1 version. I\u0027m not sure if this is intended or not, but I wanted to point it out. To simplify the calculations I\u0027ll talk in terms of Methalox as the ratio is different between the two versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 1 Fuel Cell Array uses .000225 Methalox per second ( .045 units * .005 t/unit) which is .0135 Methalox per minute. KSP 2 uses .03 Methalox per minute, more than 2x the amount per minute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the intent is for these to match the Fuel Cell Array should be changed to use of .0027 Methane per minute and .0108 Oxidizer per minute and Fuel Cell changed to .0135 Methane per hour and .054 Oxidizer per hour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, not sure if this is a bug or not, but it was a significant difference between KSP 1 and 2 and not easy to notice, so I wanted to point it out. Thank you and good luck in further development of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
