The middle pair of wheels where noticeably higher than the other four wheels and they didn\u0027t touch the ground. As the rover started to roll - not under power - the middle wheels started to turn as if they were touching the ground. Turned the motor off for the front and back wheels and I could still accelerate forward when the rover wanted to roll backwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EOK - I seem to be doing something wrong - insert image isn\u0027t working - here\u0027s the link:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/TexnnMr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENote the middle wheels appear off the ground.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
