Most recent (of several dozen) times I\u0027ve experienced this was in low Minmus orbit with an Apollo-style mission. The mothership was left in a stable orbit at just about 10km, it lowered its periapsis and crashed within a fifth of a full orbit while I was piloting the lander. When I reloaded and tried to keep it stable by firing the engines intermittently (it continues to degrade while I\u0027m piloting it), the lander quickly lowered its periapsis and crashed about a quarter of the way along it\u0027s original landing trajectory.

Slows on the way to AP, increases on the way to PE.

My grand tour visited and landed on Duna, Ike, Dres, Laythe, Vall, Tylo, Bop, and Pol, it was the same on all of them. I think it happened at Eeloo too, but another bug ended the mission before I could land. It looks like a phantom radial in force (you\u0027ll notice one of PE or AP goes up while the other goes down, depending on where you are in your orbit). It even happens at Kerbol (the sun). In fact, I glitched inside Kerbol a while back and decided to see how close I could orbit the gravitational point at the center. I was unable to circularise the orbit because the radial in force was extreme as I got close to the center, eventually yeeting me out of the solar system when I got too close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also noted that avoiding the use of timewarp with a lander seems to make any orbiting craft more stable, as long as they were stable when you undocked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-11T00:45:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2023 12:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Turbo Ben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vianna77","CreatedById":180341,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-11T02:59:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI posted two topics like yours here \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E...
