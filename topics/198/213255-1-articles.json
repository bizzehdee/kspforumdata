I\u0027d think limiting the flag title to only upper and lower case is a bug - though a minor one and really just a nuisance in terms of impact.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSite Name is forced into Title Case. If you hold down shift to get multiple uppercase characters only every other one will be uppercase, unless you add a space. Also it\u0027s not possible to have an all lower case Site Name, if that matters.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA kerbal seems to be able to only plan one flag. Is this a bug or a design choice? There is utility in placing more than one flag, so I hope this is a bug. Workaround: Reboard vessel, do another EVA, and you can plant one more flag.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUsing punctuation in the Plaque Text (or attempting to use it the Site Name)\u00A0can cause timewarp! So if you put something clever like \u0022I got here first...\u0022 then you\u0027ll be timewarping ahead at 4x\u00A0speed. Similarly, using a comma will decrease timewarp and so may pause the game. If you pause the game due to a comma, then you may be waiting a long time for Jeb to plant that flag once you close the dialog box.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo reproduce this bug take Jeb out for a walk and try planting more than one flag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T17:41:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 05:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by schlosrat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dakota","CreatedById":225122,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-22T16:21:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/217807-ksp2-patch-notes-v0130\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EThis has been fixed as of v0.1.3.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
