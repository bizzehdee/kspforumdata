The freeze is permanent and requires Task Manager to close the window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried re-installing the game (including the process of fully deleting the LocalRoaming KSP2 files and the Steam Common files), ad have tried validating game files- all to no change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy only semi-success in fixing the bug was in forcing a DirectX Runtime re-install and a Virtual Studio C\u002B\u002B re-install, and then restarting my computer. Seemed to fix the issue for all of thirty minutes before it started happening again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am running the game in Administrator Mode, and am using the .exe file to skip the Launcher. Issue persists if I remove these parameters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll my drivers are up to date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy computer specs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWindows 11 Pro\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ni9-13900k\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n4070 ti\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n64gb RAM\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
