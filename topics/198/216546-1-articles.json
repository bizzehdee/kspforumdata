After completion I save and launch. After one attempt at a launch i get off the ground and explode (this is horizontal take off from a run way). So I revert to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and ever since, I have not been able to launch due to structural linkage failure from fuel tanks to wings.\u00A0 I No longer load into the runway, I just get this crash report and\u00A0 then i can no longer leave the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. I can go to training or tracking station but the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E is always in the background with the plane i am building and if i save and go to menu and try to reload my game it will freeze on load. I have to quit the game every time i attempt to launch my plane to try to fix or change anything. It doesnt matter what I do, I cant get my plane to load on the runway because it crashes before it loads and then i have to quit the game to be able to make changes and try again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntel 12th gen I7 12 core 3.5Ghz unlocked\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorsair Dominator 64Ghz DDRAM 4th gen 5200Mhz\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadeon Sapphire XT6700 12GB DDRAM\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTUF Gaming Mother Board\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorsair H110i Liquid cooled\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPCIE SSD 7000MB read 6850 write NVME\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDual Samsung 27\u0022 curved 1080 monitors as a single 4K ultra wide (KSP 2 runs 1080 centered with black bars on each side)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
