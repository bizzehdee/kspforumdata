Each time you halve the distance, you get 4 times the radiation. From the numbers you gave, it should work out that you\u0027re at about 1/37th (2.73%) the distance to Kerbol that Kerbin is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if that\u0027s correct though, real life solar panels don\u0027t work this way because they don\u0027t work as well (or can even be damaged) when they overheat. To keep solar panels from degrading or overheating, they\u0027re sometimes angled so they receive less radiation, like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2018/10/BepiColombo_rotates_solar_arrays_gif_sequence\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBepiColombo\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think that solar panel overheating or degradation necessarily has to be a thing in the game, but it could be abstracted as a soft or hard cap on EC generation from solar panels. When heating is implemented, the panel efficiency could be reduced by high temperatures to act as a soft cap. This could also be an incentive to provide active cooling for solar panels by radiators to raise the soft cap and tap into the huge EC potential from being close to Kerbol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-15T09:30:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2023 09:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Lyneira\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
