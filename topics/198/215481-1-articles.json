OK with the exception of clouds on Kerbin were black instead of white and there were major graphics glitches on the clouds (ragged black bars) looking at them from orbit. This issue disappeared once I got sufficiently far away from Kerbin (I guess it switched to the distant textures).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the patch, and I loaded my save game containing a vessel en route to Jool, everything is running considerably faster.
