Last sunday, I\u0027ve picked it back up and gave it another chance. Whereas I wasn\u0027t able to get to Minmus before, I managed to get to Minmus, land, get back to Kerbin. Wow, amazing. But I wanted more... I made a rocket with a rover attached to it that would land on Duna to explore... After some 4 hours of gameplay, I finally managed to get my vessel in an orbit of about 50km\u0027s (forgot the exact number) around Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBecause it was 00:45 am, and I had just spent over 4 hours in to getting to Duna, I decided to quit for the day and resume the descend to Duna the following day. I took some money shots (damn those graphics) and saved the game, quit, and shutdown my computer.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETODAY: In all excitement for finally being able to descend to Duna for the first time EVER (even didn\u0027t manage that in KSP1), I loaded in my save and was ready to go... BUT\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003ENO VESSEL TO BE SEEN AROUND DUNA!!!???\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeriously, I was so frustrated that I almost threw my entire pc out. I\u0027ve completely had it. Over the course of the last few days I regained a little bit of confidence in the game (and myself), even with all the bugs that I still encounter that at least double the amount of playtime required to do anything in the game... I really got to Duna, I made it, I was so excited. \u0022At last\u0022 I thought.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo eventually be utterly dissapointed and frustrated today... I kid you not, but the current state of the game is really dangerous for my mental and physical health. It\u0027s just really demotivating for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, before anyone starts complaining with things like \u0022It\u0027s early acces\u0022, \u0022you know what you signed up for\u0022, \u0022give the developpers some time\u0022...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI work in software development myself so I know all the pain the development team is going through... I know this is a to-be wonderful game. But for now, this was just me trying to write off my current feelings/experience about the game itself. I know things will get better and I know the devteam is doing an amazing job in doing so. So all credit to them as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway... if the Dev\u0027s would like any more specific input (files, comments, anything...) they can always ask. It\u0027s not because I\u0027m frustrated that I\u0027m not wanting to help support the devs anymore \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks for listening to my whining :p\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-01T04:28:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2023 04:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Anth12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling/language\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
