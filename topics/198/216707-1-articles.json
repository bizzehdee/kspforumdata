I\u0027ve noticed that when i start running out of fuel (i assume because my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shifts) my control surfaces invert for no reason. the gimbal on my engines still functions normally, but when working against my control surfaces, it makes my plane go dead stick.\u00A0 Inverting them manually causes my roll to be inverted. everything is messed up. I hate to say the game is unplayable, but this combined with the fact that every time you play for more than an hour everything in the game just breaks, and potentially corrupts the entire career.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
