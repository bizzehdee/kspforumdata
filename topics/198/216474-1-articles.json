I came back, went to the tracking station, selected my lander and pressed control. Then when I started loading my kerbals into the lander,\u00A0 I couldnt get Enger Kerman into the command pod. In the imgur link you can see Bill, Doodul and Henbal Kerman sitting in the command pod, with Enger Kerman standing on the outside. This lander only has the command pod for kerbals. It has 3 seats. There are 4 kerbals on the mun. And since I didnt take bill kerman on the mission, he somehow teleported from Kerbin, to the mun and into the command pod of my lander.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/gallery/gGuStY6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/gallery/gGuStY6\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngame version 0.1.2.0.22258\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRunning on Windows 11\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPC Specs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGPU: RTX3060ti\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCPU: i5-11400\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSSD:\u00A0 Samsung 870 EVO 2TB\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-04-13T18:24:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2023 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Panstrovski\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panstrovski","CreatedById":228606,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-13T18:26:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso when I then came back with a second rocket to rescue enger, the first lander dissapeared underground.
