When coasting the second stage of a rocket before getting to orbit. This way you would have all the time you need to create a perfectly circular orbit using the maneuver tool without having time constraints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. When dealing with huge spaceships that cause a lot of lag. Since physics is paused time warp = 0, the lag is virtually absent, and the maneuver-making operations would be far more enjoyable and precise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven Matt Lowne cited it as a great feature in the first 25 minutes of the ESA event (minute 23:11):\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I4QwvXLETtg?start=1391\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022KSP 2: APOLLO STYLE MUN MISSION!\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve included this link to prove that it\u0027s actually expected behaviour.
