If a Slider in the PM window happens to be over a rocket part in the window behind, that part can be dragged around as the slider is adjusted. Many of the windows in KSP2 seem to exhibit this issue. Please have the uppermost window mouse event handlers consume the event rather than pass it on to all other windows in the Z stack.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
