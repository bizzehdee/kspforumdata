Begin circulization late, end up dipping back into the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Get to an AP of 300k while in atmosphere, the orbital map is normal at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Circularize at AP, check orbital map and realize that the orbital lines showing you in kerbin is gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Switch to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E then back to your vessel to see if things normalize.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.
