After a few seconds the animation played at normal speed despite high timewarp, and then legs appeared properly stowed. On exiting timewarp, the legs\u0027 model glitched out and put them offset and away from the ship. Toggling the legs expansion twice to completion fixes this error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, extending the legs causes another phantom force bug, making the ship rock around until \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E makes it settle down.
