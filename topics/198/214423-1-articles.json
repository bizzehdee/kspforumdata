I built a large rover based on the Bulldog cockpit with rottweiler truck chassis and RoveMax TR-2L wheels (similar to the stock one, but with much smaller wheels than that monster). It\u0027s not a very aerodynamic thing all the same, but I attempted to launch it on an LV that would ordinarily be easily able to loft that much payload. No good - the thing tipped over no matter how gentle I was with the gravity turn, so I encased it in a fairing... It seems to be tipping just as badly, or perhaps almost just as badly. If the fairing is helping at all, it\u0027s not doing much other than trying to look pretty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-04T21:08:27Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2023 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by schlosrat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaa253","CreatedById":68628,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-05T12:33:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been testing fairings.
