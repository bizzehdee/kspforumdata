Many things are obviously much better, like grafics and loading performance (started to slow down already... what is that new \u0022intro deactivation\u0022 about? See no difference). I am a bit more critical now since I discovered Juno New Origins, where there are a handful of very talented developers doing great things for a price that is a fraction of this early access ...
