As to the strategy - it is the only plausible when developing something as complex (and as player-favorited) as space simulation game with physics, especially from existing codebase (KSP1) that, of course, had limitations of Unity 5.x (which was released in 2015 and which means it is now 8 years old) - so, I personally think it is the only viable and abcolutely correct strategy on the developer\\publisher side.
