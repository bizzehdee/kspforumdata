normal/anti-normal) are perpendicular to your direction of travel (prograde), irrelevent of speed. They move as you thrust toward them because you are changing your direction of travel, unlike thrusting prograde/retrograde where there is acceleration but no change in direction. Radial in/out is only the same as up/down in a circular orbit, or at AP and PE in an eliptical orbit. In a highly eliptical orbit, away from AP and PE (such as during launch), radial out and up are very, very different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you launched using the up setting, your direction of travel is, well, up. When it switches to radial in/out at 36K, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E immediately tries to turn the rocket 90 degrees from prograde to almost horizontal (almost because when it switches to orbital, the momentum you carried from the rotation of the planet is taken into account.

It\u0027s also possible to just switch to prograde before 36K (as long as your rocket is stable enough to handle the ground/orbital prograde shift and the inevitable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E overshoot when moving to it).
