I have built a rocket with 3 satellites attached. I get into my orbit and begin releasing the satellites, 1 at a time. It seems the decoupler begins to float away just a little bit, then acts as if it is part of my satellite. It happens to all 3 of them, a decoupler moves away, then stays with the sat. I turn, decoupler turns.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a problem, because obviously, it shouldn\u0027t be there, but more so because it ads weight way out there and i am unable to control the satellite with thrusters on, as the weight just causes the satellite to spin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhere is the doc with image.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XbM8eLoD06yITFdt0DCP4yYmrLxRe13g/view?usp=share_link\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1XbM8eLoD06yITFdt0DCP4yYmrLxRe13g/view?usp=share_link\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
