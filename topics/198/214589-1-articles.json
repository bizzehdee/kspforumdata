If it\u2019s this your best bet may be to revert to a save that\u2019s small enough and editor can open it and then delete all the content in the last section TravelLogSomethingorother. This will get you back down to a file in the small number of MB size if that\u2019s the problem\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"real_filami","CreatedById":227474,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-06T23:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes not seem to be the same bug. Largest file I found was 3700 Kb which is reasonable. I can however try to load an earlier version of the campain and see if I can start saving from there. I can also try to backup the workspaces folder to see if there is a vehicle that is messing up and confusing the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reldas","CreatedById":227673,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-11T09:20:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m seeing the same behaviour.\u00A0 Normal save, auto-save and quick save aren\u0027t working.\u00A0 Pressing the quick save key does produce the chirp but nothing is saved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast save file size was 2,465kb so doesn\u0027t appear to be related to the huge save file size.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue cropped up immediately after a successful dock created a combined vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"salaminho","CreatedById":217180,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T12:18:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had the same issue last night.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is happening in a specific autosave that was created after a successful docking.
