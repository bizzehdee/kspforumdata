Usually, Early Access price is lower and upon release it goes up a little. I think they just measure how much of an idol is KSP as a brand for Followers of Jebediah cult - smart decision, now they can better estimate merch prices for future. I mean it is like Elder Scrolls 6 - if the fans offered early access today at $100 very many would go for it... how about $200? see? And why not - voting with money for how good previous games in series were is a great marketing tool, it motivates brand-holders to invest more which in result makes final users of the product get even more rich KSP2, then KSP3 or, for the sake of example, TES6, TES7 etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lekiffer","CreatedById":190778,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-27T23:39:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldnt be surprised if we see a ksp3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni tried the game today after a 6 week break 2 patches been added apparently i went to build a plane and every time i went to edit the wings one would flip so ones facing up and ones facing down ...not ideal for wings it wasnt a symmetry issue because they attached correctly but flip upon editing it took 5 mins for me to find the game unplayable .\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EKsp3 it will happen.... i dont hear complaints in the comments sections its just \u0022oh i cant wait for this\u0022 and \u0022i hope we see that\u0022\u00A0 \u0022i definitely want first person EVA with VR\u0022 (my kerbals cant even EVA yet), nobody is saying the game is completely unplayable .Even if all the features were added tomorrow the game still doesnt work ,the devs\u00A0 say report bugs and feedback ...6 weeks later it was actually worse wings never used to flip upon editing like that.
