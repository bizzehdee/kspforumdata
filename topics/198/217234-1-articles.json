But, this requires you to have a part already there to attach it to.\u00A0 Sometimes switching to out of the program to another Windows window and back can allow you to get unstuck, but this is rare.\u00A0 Another way out is to hit Escape and exit the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to somewhere else and then come back again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
