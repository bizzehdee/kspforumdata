Launched with small booster. Vessels spins even though the wings are covered by the faring, and should have no aerodynamic effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSetup 2: Same as setup 1, but without angled wings. Vessel does not spin and reach around 530m/s before booster runs out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSetup 3: Same as setup 2, but with the fairing deconstructed. Fairing component remain on vessel, mass is the same. Vessel reach\u00A0around 580m/s\u00A0before booster runs out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSetup 4: Same as setup 2, but the fairing has been constructed to be as non-aerodynamic as possible.. giant pancake essentially. Mass of vessel remains the same.\u00A0 Vessel reach around 220m/s\u00A0before booster runs out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn conclusion, the fairings I have tested are appear massless. They do not shield components from aerodynamic drag, while adding their own drag to the vessel. They currently have only a cosmetic function, and are a detriment if you try to build a practical vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-01T05:13:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2023 05:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Anth12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
