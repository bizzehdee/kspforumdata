am getting a malfunction when doing a surface rendevous.\u00A0 It has been 100% so far with Minmus as the target planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided to embark on a series of missions to \u0022have a gathering\u0022 of kerbals in a certain location on the surface of Minmus.\u00A0 \u00A0I landed 5 kerbals there with no issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the second mission, with the next 5 kerbals aboard, I began my approach and descent.\u00A0 \u00A0I had the first vessel targeted, and everything seemed normal until I was very close to it.\u00A0 \u00A0I saw the blue letters indicating its name and distance, but I never sighted the vessel.\u00A0 \u00A0On my final descent to within 100m, the blue letters began indicating that the target vessel was now on the move directly into the surface of Minmus.\u00A0 \u00A0Heading directly towards its center.\u00A0 \u00A0I then landed and watched the indicator.\u00A0 \u00A0I looked up the radius of Minmus as 60km.\u00A0 \u00A0But my indicator disappeared at 50km precisely.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then switched to the\u00A0 Tracking station and saw that the vessel still existed, so I hit the control button.\u00A0 \u00A0It had a velocity of 56870, and was still on a straight line trajectory, but at this point still in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of Minmus.\u00A0 \u00A0Scrolling in and out on map view, I noticed it did not have any orbital line visible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI gradually accelerated time, and it kept moving.\u00A0 \u00A0At some point I received a notification that it was \u0022out of communication range\u0022, it kept moving and I turned in map view and watch the kerbol system recede.\u00A0 \u00A0Then at some point it disappeared.\u00A0 All 5 kerbals were still pictured, and I tried to EVA one, but the EVA did not function.\u00A0 \u00A0I switched to the Tracking station again, but the vessel was no longer being tracked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese kerbals were never heard from again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steve7893","CreatedById":226360,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-04T21:30:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nduh, this is going to sound strange, but one of my
