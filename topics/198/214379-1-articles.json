It seems like any ship after landing doesnt have a trajectory line any more, and cant get one again, no matter how fast you might be going. I was nearly in orbit and I still had no line, and therefor could not make any maneuver nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock installation, no mods\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows 10/Steam\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRyzen 1700X\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRTX 2070 Super\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
