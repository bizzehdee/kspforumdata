(this is more than I generally like), and I will set the inner control surfaces on the wing to only do pitch, while the outer control surfaces only does roll.\u00A0 If there\u0027s a middle segment, that would do both pitch and roll.\u00A0 The tail is generally configured to do yaw.\u00A0 I can\u0027t do the necessary testing to actually get it to orbit because I can\u0027t launch, and sometimes even when I do launch I will get something failing halfway down the runway and have total loss of control when the flight director pops up saying \u0022stuff failed, your craft is totaled\u0022 despite it still barreling down the runway.\u00A0 Amusingly, the cargo probe will also repro the loss of trajectory line when you activate the second stage to take off from wherever you\u0027ve landed.\u00A0 I\u0027m also open to sending the craft file to the devs if that\u0027d help with debugging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter further poking around with the craft... found a bug where landing gear on a stage that\u0027s not attached will respond to toggling the gear on the current active craft.\u00A0 The way KSP1 handled this was actually making a completely separate craft every time you staged, so that inputs from one craft wouldn\u0027t affect another.\u00A0 This can be VERY problematic if we\u0027ve got an orbital craft with a bunch of drones we\u0027re flying down to the surface and having gear deploy unexpected causes parts collisions and things going boom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium
