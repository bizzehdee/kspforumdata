My probe\u00A0was 1xOKTO,\u00A0 1xPB-X150, 1xST-Micro-4 truss\u00A0and I put\u00A05 small SP-S06 structural panels on the front of the\u00A0probe oriented flat side on to the direction of flight.\u00A0Launch this (on a BACC Thumper with fins for example) with no fairing and at 5 km altitude record the Total Drag value from the F12 GUI dialog. My result, Total Drag\u00A0 = 198.8 kN\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNow cover over the same probe with a fairing AE-FF125 \u0022Cockleshell\u0022 and reduce the amount of argon in the payload to bring the mass down by the an amount equal to the fairing mass. Launch again same thumper and at 5 km observe the Total Drag. My result, Total Drag = 24.5 kN\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNow finally add a OX-4L solar panel inside the fairing attached to the truss and launch again. My result, Total Drag = 255.1 kN\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOptional exercise 1: Launch again with OX-4L but pre-jettison fairing in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. My result, Total Drag = 237.7 kN\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOptional exercise 2: Launch again replacing OX-4L with solar panel OX-4W and closed fairing. My result, Total Drag = 26.0 kN (i.e. no problem)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFixes / Workarounds: Don\u0027t use the OX-4L until the bug is fixed, instead use only OX-4W solar panels.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA list of ALL mods: It doesn\u0027t matter as I have replicated without mods but I do normally use\u00A0\u00A0Space-Warp, Maneuver Node Controller, Sticky Orbit Markers and Micro Engineer, also \u0022JOINT_RIGIDITY\u0022: 1500000.0, in PhysicsSettings.json\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOther Notes / Screenshots / Log Files: None this time\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shalfar","CreatedById":135028,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-16T19:07:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can confirm I have seen the same issue and have used the same workaround of using OX-4W instead of OX-4L.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaa253","CreatedById":68628,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-13T08:10:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am doing more testing but it looks like this bug has been fixed in\u00A0Patch - v0.1.2.0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jclovis3","CreatedById":188635,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-13T17:38:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do you get that \u0022F12 AeroGUI\u0022 to open?
