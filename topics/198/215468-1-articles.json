The TR4 wheel seriously lacks torque. Compare to the TR-2L which, while it has its own issues, absolutely flies up hills. I don\u0027t think this wheel needs to be as excessive as the TR-2L but it should be able to climb a 15 degree slope. I\u0027m having trouble with anything over 5 degrees and have to use frequent switchbacking to navigate terrain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Random craft interactions with terrain. You can see the wheels dip below the terrain on a few occasions followed at the end by the rover dying for no apparent reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sSiPxRtlYa0?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022KSP2: Kerbin Rover Woes\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t give me all this beautiful terrain and not expect me to drive it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-30T19:02:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 0.1.2.0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m having trouble getting up a 5 degree slope with the TR4.
