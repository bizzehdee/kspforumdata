The \u0022default name - 8\u0022 part on a collision course with Kerbin was my booster stage. After decoupling from the booster, and setting up my encounter, I engaged time warp to speed up to my encounter. The booster stopped following the orbit where I had left it, and seemingly started traveling in a straight line until the distance between it and my vessel was above a certain distance, at which point the booster applied the current vector to it\u0027s new position, putting it on a collision course with kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had this happen during most of my missions involving multiple vessels.
