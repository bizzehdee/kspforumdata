Soon after launch, something strange caught my eye. I looked around but couldn\u0027t find what I had seen. Then it happened again, and again. These strange assemblages of parts, with a red/blue colour scheme would spontaneously generate close to, and beneath my ship. There was a\u00A0 fuel tank with a mainsail(?) engine, a mk1 capsule, and a hand ful of smaller parts. Always the same parts. They would drift upwards and disappear. Trying to click on them with the curser did nothing. They would sometimes bump into my ship. It did no damage but it would send it tumbling.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis continued throughout the flight, from soon after launch to landing in an Eve ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI took screenshots, but somehow they haven\u0027t saved.
