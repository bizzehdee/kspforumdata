Switching back to control the original craft typically \u0022wakes up \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 and it begins correcting to point towards normal again. Some of the time, though, the crafts just seem to fire all \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters in one direction and switching back to the craft means having to re-stabilize the orbit and try again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E needs better PID algorithms. Instead of aligning with target (when overpowered) with short controlled bursts, it uses what seems to be a default burst and if there are too many \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters on a craft for its mass, they just seem to burn up MP without making any progress.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
