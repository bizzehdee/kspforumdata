The only way I\u2019ve found to change a vessel\u2019s name is to edit the save file.

I destroyed the empty stage and noticed the command pod with Bob in it took on a \u0027Default 6\u0027 name. Can edit Bob\u0027s Command Pod in the TS but it won\u0027t stay once you leave the TS and there doesn\u0027t appear to be the \u0027right click command pod\u0027 option to rename as was in KSP1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a super big deal in the grand scheme of things...but would seem an easy fix to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
