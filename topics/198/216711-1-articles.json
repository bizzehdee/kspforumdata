I made a multi-launch space station in low kerbin orbit and the next day when I came back the station was deorbitting itself but with a vertical course directly onto the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- KSP V 1.2.0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Win11 I7-8700 | RTX2060\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Step to replicate ???

For me it appears after loading a game for sure, but cannot roll-out changing ship. Once it actually happen after separation and changing a ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe bug seems not modify the size of orbiting circle, but just misplaced it, so it start colliding with Kerbin.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP 1.2.0 (vanila)\u003Cbr\u003E\nWIN10 | Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 | NVidia GeForce GTX 980 Ti\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
