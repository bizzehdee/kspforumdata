Namely, moving and re-ordering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, when she finally asked to move boosters\u00A0 to the first stage, doing so did not complete the task (I think probably because the stage the used to be first I already moved elsewhere or added a new one in). I had to undo to the start of the file and do it again.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWould suggest either:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- lock off building and noodling until she has finished talking\u003Cbr\u003E\n- a \u0022reset tutorial\u0022 button that snaps the tutorial back to the condition that the game expects it to be in\u003Cbr\u003E\n- making the criteria for passing less strict\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
