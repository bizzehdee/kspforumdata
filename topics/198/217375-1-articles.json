Anyways, when I log back in a little bit later the rocket I was using to launch the sixth and final satellite has not been started but it is in space going 9258 m/s away from kerbin. I did restart my pc between the crash and the reload. Also when I go into the orbital view the rocket seems to be falling directly into kerbol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022?imw=1024\u0026amp;imh=576\u0026amp;ima=fit\u0026amp;impolicy=Lette\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2041865033895785355/E3DD501ED20556671DD0BF07A989FB88D59615FA/?imw=1024\u0026amp;imh=576\u0026amp;ima=fit\u0026amp;impolicy=Letterbox\u0026amp;imcolor=%23000000\u0026amp;letterbox=true\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
