This causes a pendulum like wobble which is especially obvious on larger ships. It could also cause your ship to break apart if the wobble gets too strong. Also obviously bad for keeping your ship moving in your intended direction.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo replicate, put a long, large ship into orbit with some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E wheels on it. Spin the ship into a roll along its long axis, then turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. You will see that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E will spin the ship past it\u2019s intended position, reverse course, and roll back in the opposite direction only to roll past its intended position again, reverse direction\u2026 on and on. Not sure how long this will go on for but I watched it happen for a good while and it didn\u2019t seem to be slowing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
