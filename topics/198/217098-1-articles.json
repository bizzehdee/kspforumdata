The orbital information IS NOT showing up when I\u0027m in orbit. It\u0027s really frustrating because it\u0027s such a crucial piece of information for any mission. I\u0027ve tried restarting the game and checking my settings, but nothing seems to be working. I hope this issue can be resolved soon because I really enjoy playing KSP2 and it\u0027s frustrating to not have all the information I need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-08T23:09:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond the fact that this is a known bug, please help the devs by providing all relevant information when submitting a bug report.\u00A0 You can find what they are looking for here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022210281\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6291522107\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/216898-how-to-submit-a-useful-bug-report/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:375px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Socraticat","CreatedById":176118,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-10T17:42:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/228988-wm-sanford/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022228988\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/228988-wm-sanford/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Wm Sanford\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0It is frustrating.

I probably only play half as much as I would if it were at 1.0. (And that might be because I like cutting my gameplay in an editor. Even goofy data is data- and I have some amazing fun in between frustrations.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-10T17:43:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2023 05:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Socraticat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
