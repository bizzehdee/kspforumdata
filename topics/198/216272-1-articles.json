I\u0027ll hit ESC and nothing shows, I\u0027m just stuck in that view. I have to hard shut down the game. Tried loading the rocket from the Launch Pad instead, but does the same thing. THEN tried a lower count part rocket but did the same thing... I wasn\u0027t able to get back to any launch pad no matter what I did different, ended up just uninstalling until the next patch. PLEASE look into this, and hope it is remedied by the upcoming patch. SOON I\u0027m hoping. The game is amazing, and so much fun, when it isn\u0027t driving us insane, lol...
