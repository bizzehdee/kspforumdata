I didn\u0027t do too much testing with the bug, testing edge cases and stuff like that, but here is what I do remember:\u003Cbr\u003E\n-enter timewarp, everything looks fine. pull out of timewarp, you lose a couple meters per second.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-The slowdown is always retrograde, regardless of which way the ship is pointed in 3d space. whether you\u0027re coming in nose first or legs first, it is always retrograde.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-this applies if i\u0027ve landed, run timewarp while on surface, then come out of timewarp while still on surface, then launch, then do more timewarp shenangans, bug still occurs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-wonder what happens if u separate a ship while in mun \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, creating a new entity, then mess with timewarp. i dont know what happens there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
