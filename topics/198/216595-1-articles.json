So the intended behaviour is that when I move my camera along the ground toward the centre of the camera, it should zoom in on that point, and when I move it out, it should move out along the ground until it reaches the distance from the vessel where my camera was originally, and orbits around the vehicle normally.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, when I do so, the camera gets stuck near to the vessel and orbits that centre without zooming out. So the camera is now closer to the vessel, and I have to zoom out to get back to where I was originally. I can\u0027t reall who it off in photos, since it\u0027s a camera oddity, and this happened on the Mun with a landed craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-01T05:08:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2023 05:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Anth12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
