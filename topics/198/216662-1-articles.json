It is a long horizontal vehicle that I just realized has the same kind of flex issues that tall rockets have.\u00A0 This makes it a nightmare on the runway and creates failures during the takeoff run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The wings fall off every time like clockwork upon load unless the game is restarted.\u00A0 Every single change takes around 3 minutes and parts manager takes around 30 seconds to load.\u00A0 When the wings fall off they don\u0027t just fall they are jerked off the vehicle like the hand of God has taken them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.

That is not my way.\u00A0 I do not leave trash where I go.\u00A0 No staging.\u00A0 Only flying through space like an Angel without a worry in the world is how I want to fly.\u00A0 I will not rest until I drive fabulous winged vehicles all around the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere are everyone else\u0027s Eve returners I can compare to?\u00A0 Where is everyone\u0027s ambition?\u00A0 Why is the best vehicle in the spacecraft exchange a recreation dinosaur?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
