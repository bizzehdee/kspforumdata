It was really pretty but obviously bugged. I don\u0027t think this is related to the bug at hand but Im including it here just in case. Anyways I parked my spacecraft inside of the rings, then left the game. When I came back space was gone, and depending on the angle I put the camera back, space would be tinted a different color. This did not effect the map view. The game then decided it was done with this flavor of bug and switched to a view of the rings that was mostly correct.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.42\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1078459801522147468/1107767075277119558/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-01T03:52:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2023 03:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Anth12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
