Both crafts move away from the centered camera, and are controllable in very unpredictable ways. Pressing \u0027Home\u0027 button to recenter camera only recenters on the middle point. Makes staging and every other aspect of going to other planets / moons not doable and the game unplayable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
