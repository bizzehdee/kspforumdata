I noticed that the\u00A0IX-6315 \u0022Dawn\u0022 Electric Propulsion System hasn\u2019t seem to have a part revamp (that I know of). The small\u00A0ion engine\u00A0maybe small and slow but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t deserve a part revamp. The small ion engine could use some variants and a texture revamp. There are many variants I could think of like a different color or some of the inside components show more. Or anything. The little engine could use a part revamp.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/File:PB-ION.png\u0022 style=\u0022color:#0b0080;font-size:12.600000381469727px;text-align:center;\u0022 title=\u0022Part image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Part image\u0022 data-ratio=\u002270.97\u0022 height=\u0022134\u0022 srcset=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/4/46/PB-ION.png/285px-PB-ION.png 1.5x, https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/4/46/PB-ION.png 2x\u0022 style=\u0022border:0px;vertical-align:middle;\u0022 width=\u0022190\u0022 src=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/4/46/PB-ION.png/190px-PB-ION.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003EIt would be nice to see this small ion engine have a revamp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-01T06:34:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be awesome to have a larger size of this one, and a large battery to accommodate that (like the 2.5m shortest fuel tank)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kerbal","CreatedById":207217,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-01T07:48:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYa.
