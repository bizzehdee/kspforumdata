This facilitates mod and add-on development by giving developers a very short turn-around time between iterations.\n\nI had originally started from the following page, McShepherd\u0027s Modding Tutorial:\n\n[http://www.alternatewars.com/Games/KSP/Tut1/KSP_Tutorial_1-1.htm](http://www.alternatewars.com/Games/KSP/Tut1/KSP_Tutorial_1-1.htm)\n\nI think the directory structure may have changed since this was written, and I\u0027m pretty sure there are other non-part resources that could be deleted, too. Does anyone have experience exploring a minimal KSP install? Otherwise, I\u0027ll go ahead and dive in to a trim-this-and-see-if-things-still-work project, and post my results here.\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T05:24:24Z","Content":"I\u0027ve run a very pared down copy of KSP for heavy modding before, works pretty well. I think once 1.0 rolls around this won\u0027t be a huge issue since they\u0027ll be on DDS loading and you can just use a complete stock copy. Of course, paring that down will get load times into the absurdly fast... You might also consider deleting the flags, but the load times on those will be quite quick to begin with, probably not worth it.\n\nMy pared parts list is basically just one or two tanks, two engines (one lifter, one space), a pod, and maybe a decoupler and a fin. You really don\u0027t need much more to get something into orbit for testing."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T05:47:45Z","Content":"Look in the Dev links sticky.
