It\u0027s slightly out of date (by slightly I mean it was designed for 0.24.2 and he hasn\u0027t yet updated it for the changes in 0.25), but so far the only thing I\u0027ve seen that\u0027s major is that the new Wing Connectors are functionally equivalent to Delta Wings. Shock Cone Intakes are equivalent to 1.2 Ram Intakes and 4 of the new Structural Intakes are roughly equivalent to a single Shock Cone Intake. Big focus on transporter spaceplanes there. I think the guide comes with the planes he designed in 0.24.2; they probably aren\u0027t directly useable in 0.25 but they could give you a few ideas at least. And I know there\u0027s at least one there that can handle thirteen tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want my full array of advice for stock aero spaceplanes, it\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100334-SSTO-Why-u-no-fly?p=1546536\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1546536\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.
