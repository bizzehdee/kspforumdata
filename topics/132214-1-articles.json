The Ground-Based Interceptor, however, is a ground launched rocket- thus, it has much less payload capacity; on the other hand, it is much more mass-produced, and available on-demand. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-Based_Interceptor\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-Based_Interceptor\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDARPA also pursued a ALASA rocket, which would carry 45kg optical recon sats to LEO via air-launch on existing fighter aircraft. The project was intended to launch them on-demand when required. It was cancelled when the propellant was shown to be too energetic. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_Launch_Assist_Space_Access\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_Launch_Assist_Space_Access\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo replace this, I propose using the Ground-based Interceptor to launch these satellites- with a HAPS upper stage from the Pegasus rocket, it can achieve polar orbits of 20-45 kg satellites. Launched from Fort Greely, Alaska (where the interceptor is deployed), it would launch into high-inclination or polar orbits- other inclinations may use a offshore pad (like \u003Cem\u003ESea Launch\u003C/em\u003E- hell, they might be able to buy the offshore pad from them now that Zenit is almost certainly dead). Retrograde orbits are also limited, as the military will have to use a smaller 20kg optical satellite instead of the 45 kg version proposed for ALASA- or launch in a unstable low orbit (this may not be an issue, due to retrograde orbits being so uncommon anyways.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis new LV would use 4 stages, 3 from the Ground Based interceptor, and the 4th \u0022stage\u0022 a HAPS motor for the final orbital insertion (and accurate orbital adjustments) attached to the 45kg optical satellite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1st stage: 1835.2 m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\n2nd stage: 3436.1 m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\n3rd stage: 4323.1 m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\n4th stage: 387 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should also launch on-demand, due to using a missile as the boost stage, though the HAPS\u002B Satellite combination may make this more difficult (in theory, it would be fine, HAPS is hypergolic and can be stored for long periods of time). It would also be able to be implemented rather rapidly, and allow for dedicated cubesat flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo is this a good idea?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T05:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222412216\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132214\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455593700\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022143381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fredinno\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, fredinno said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo is this a good idea?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot really. \u00A0 It\u0027s not the performance of the booster, it\u0027s the location of the launch site - it presumes \u0027canned\u0027 payloads that can withstand long storage or extensive additional infrastructure in a place where such things are expensive. \u00A0 Plus it gives up the key reasons they looked into ALASA in the first place, the availability of a wide range of launch azimuths and the ability to fly to a launch point where the weather isn\u0027t. \u00A0 (It\u0027s the wide range of azimuths that\u0027s the key, you can choose one that places a recon bird over the area of interest in the shortest possible time.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsing an offshore pad really isn\u0027t much of an option, they\u0027re somewhat at the mercy of the weather (less than a fixed base, more than an airplane) and very expensive to maintain on 24/7 alert to get underway or to maintain underway 24/7.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nA friend worked on ALASA... \u00A0his description of some of the propellant testing used a goodly number of \u0027colorful Anglo-Saxon monosyllables\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
