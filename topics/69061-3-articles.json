Zond fairings have some great detail, but a lot of it is nonfunctional. TBH, it\u0027s a bit sad to see all those LES separation engines, grid fins and such to be nonfunctional. This is not really a huge priority, but I think it\u0027d be nice to have the LES as 2 or even 3-stage structure. Alternatively, give each of those engine sets a differently-named thrust transform, and add a ModuleEngines to each of them. You could get them all to work that way, but it might be a bit confusing. Your call. Oh, and it seems it looked a bit different than you made it.

I have a few complaints about engines, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. They all seem to be extended too far out of their housings. Only the nozzle should be visible. This is an easy fix, just move the nodes up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spaceflight101.com/uploads/6/4/0/6/6406961/4173405.jpg?441\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.spaceflight101.com/uploads/6/4/0/6/6406961/4173405.jpg?441\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The RD-0214 was much bigger than you made it. The turbopump machinery might be the right size, but the nozzle is not. It\u0027s a vacuum engine, it should have a big ol\u0027 bell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spaceflight101.com/uploads/6/4/0/6/6406961/6580129_orig.jpg?445\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.spaceflight101.com/uploads/6/4/0/6/6406961/6580129_orig.jpg?445\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the engine (under protective cowling) mounted on the stage. You can see that it\u0027s so big that the verniers are mounted on the 3rd stage\u0027s rim (where the small, white bubbles are on yours). Also, the vernier enigne should be a 1-nozzle part attached with symmetry. That would enable gimbal control plugins to use it for roll control. Oh, and you can see the 3rd stage bottom is not flat, but somewhat rounded. You might consider making this as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The \u0022old\u0022 Proton shroud is done a bit incorrectly. In this graphics you can see that only the upper part is the actual fairing. The lower, narrow part is really Block D housing, which is single-part, much like on N1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ilslaunch.com/sites/default/files/Proton%20Evolution.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.ilslaunch.com/sites/default/files/Proton%20Evolution.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I don\u0027t know how much of the Block D you did for the N1 project, but it\u0027d be nice to have the shroud work properly. Block D should also be included in this pack once you finish it, it was very similar on both Proton and N1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Zond fairings have some great detail, but a lot of it is nonfunctional. TBH, it\u0027s a bit sad to see all those LES separation engines, grid fins and such to be nonfunctional. This is not really a huge priority, but I think it\u0027d be nice to have the LES as 2 or even 3-stage structure. Alternatively, give each of those engine sets a differently-named thrust transform, and add a ModuleEngines to each of them. You could get them all to work that way, but it might be a bit confusing.
