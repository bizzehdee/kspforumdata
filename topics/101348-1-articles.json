I have ships enroute for each. But I have no easy way to look at the contract list and determine which contracts are already being acted upon. This is a problem when I take a new contract which is similar to an existing one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
