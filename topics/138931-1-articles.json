Besides Nifty255\u0027s intro video and creating KSPedia entries by BahamutoD i haven\u0027t found anything resembling a setup guide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith old Part Tools 0.23 it was straightforward as adding ksp script component with KSP \u0026gt; Part Tools to game object, setting up output folders and pressing \u0022write\u0022 button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow there are two entries \u0022KSPAssets.KSPedia\u0022 and \u0022KSPAssets.Loaders\u0022. I assume \u0022 KSPAssets.Loaders\u0022 is right way to go, but rest is just \u0022white noise\u0022 to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t get it - there are many plugins and part packs updated for KSP 1.1\u002B but none of the tutorials for new Part Tools ???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-04T11:30:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2016 11:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by fatcargo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fatcargo","CreatedById":93302,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T11:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a second look i\u0027ve realized i forgot to extract legacy folder as well from part tools 1.1 zip, now i got the familiar UI to work with.
