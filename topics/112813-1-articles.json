When I reloaded the game and attempted to Resume a saved game. NOTHING would come up - it was as if the \u0022Resume\u0022 had died completely (clicking resume did NOT bring up the normal load window). I started a new game - saved it - quit the game and came back. Resume button still no longer functioned. I completely uninstalled the game. Reinstalled and resume was still not working. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went into the folders and moved the entire \u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022 folder to a new location. Reinstalled from Steam again (no longer having any save games in the rebuilt folder) and the resume started working again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI moved my saved folder back into the Game folder and it broke the \u0022Resume\u0022 again. After a bit of fiddling around, I renamed persistent.sfs to quicksave.sfs and visa versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly my RESUME GAME started working again and also allowed me to go back into my saved game. Maybe a couple hours behind - but still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m putting this up on the board cause this Broke the game completly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still have a copy of the SFS files. I hope someone see\u0027s this and fixes it. if it was the \u0022Persistant.sfs\u0022 file that was broke. maybe an option that works around it to get to the other saved games?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAxehandler\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
