For example two sufficiently powerful EM fields can superpose and result in a matter-antimatter pair. It does not have to be EM, it could be fields found within plasma, or even unknown field.

QFT in my mind is not perfect, that is because it lacks a fundamental basis in itself (although not for lack of trying as in string theory), not a fault of QFT but a fault in our ability to observe that basis. When we look at Newtonian or relativistic physics, they appear complete until we observe things on very large or small scales, and quantum mechanics has the same limitiations, but in fact we cannot see anywhere near Planck\u0027s scale, so resolving more basal level of physics is difficult. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even at that, at least the way i see things the inconsistencies between particle and wave theories can be explained with QFT.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-14T03:25:02Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2015 03:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T23:00:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what you\u0027re trying to say here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, in QFT, there are no problems with particle/wave duality, because there isn\u0027t really a duality.

As you know when have had discussions in the past to specify feild when it could be replaced by particle or wave. We know that field propagation is a consistent feature of the universe, we cannot be clear, for instance, that gravity has a particle duality. Nor is it clear that any new feild that might be discovered will show a duality, so discussing a duality; although it is unlikely that it will not show aspects of a wavefunction.
