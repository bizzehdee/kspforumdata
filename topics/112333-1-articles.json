Every time you want to check where the ore is. You have to go back and change the color and the % amount. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing opposite ends of the color wheel might be better for some. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhite to black. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERed to green.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice to have different colors as well. Maybe a color wheel. Some colors are good for 1 planet but not another. IE purple on kerbin vs purple on eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do this in roverdude\u0027s scansat. Would seem an easy implementation since it already has been done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the colors are to bright depending on the planet or moon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. Ambient light would not work. Ambient light brightens the scenery above stock levels. I would like to tone it down below stock levels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis varies between some views. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be also nice to see the overlay while flying any craft around the body or focused on any craft within the SOI of the body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you have to go to map mode. Tab until you get to the orbiting body. Then you can pull up the ore overlay. You shouldn\u0027t have to go that far to get to the ore overlay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T01:52:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by David H\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T01:58:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003EDMagics\u003C/strong\u003E SCANsat, not RoverDude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, theres a dev version of SCANsat with such an overlay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T02:09:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd on the stock one thought last time play with it you could change colors and % maybe there was also some type of lay out but that might have been the %.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"David H","CreatedById":108439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T08:00:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smjjames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smjjames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003EDMagics\u003C/strong\u003E SCANsat, not RoverDude.Anyhow, theres a dev version of SCANsat with such an overlay.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought I had seen his name in there somewhere.
