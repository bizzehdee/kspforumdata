Every time you want to check where the ore is. You have to go back and change the color and the % amount. \n\nUsing opposite ends of the color wheel might be better for some. \n\nWhite to black. \n\nRed to green.\n\nWould be nice to have different colors as well. Maybe a color wheel. Some colors are good for 1 planet but not another. IE purple on kerbin vs purple on eve. \n\nYou can do this in roverdude\u0027s scansat. Would seem an easy implementation since it already has been done. \n\nSome of the colors are to bright depending on the planet or moon. \n\nNo. Ambient light would not work. Ambient light brightens the scenery above stock levels. I would like to tone it down below stock levels. \n\nThis varies between some views. \n\nWould be also nice to see the overlay while flying any craft around the body or focused on any craft within the SOI of the body.\n\nNow you have to go to map mode. Tab until you get to the orbiting body. Then you can pull up the ore overlay. You shouldn\u0027t have to go that far to get to the ore overlay.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T01:52:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by David H**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T01:58:24Z","Content":"It\u0027s **DMagics** SCANsat, not RoverDude.\n\nAnyhow, theres a dev version of SCANsat with such an overlay."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T02:09:51Z","Content":"And on the stock one thought last time play with it you could change colors and % maybe there was also some type of lay out but that might have been the %."},{"CreatedByName":"David H","CreatedById":108439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T08:00:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s **DMagics** SCANsat, not RoverDude.Anyhow, theres a dev version of SCANsat with such an overlay.\n\nI thought I had seen his name in there somewhere. His name is all over the page but it still gives the idea of what I\u0027m talking about. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E And on the stock one thought last time play with it you could change colors and % maybe there was also some type of lay out but that might have been the %.\n\nThere are only 4 color schemes. I\u0027m looking for different colors. Obviously purple will not work on eve so down to 3. As well as the one with red being high amount on duna. \n\nIn addition to saving the overlay. If you leave. you have to adjust the % and color scheme ever time you come back.\n\nA\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T08:03:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 08:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by David H**"}]}
