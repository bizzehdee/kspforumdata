Like:\n\n*scale = 1.0, 1.0, 1.0*\n\nSometimes it\u0027s incredibly picky. I think they fixed it, but it used to be that a \u0022scale\u0022 statement *without* a \u0022MODEL\u0022 block would work as an integer, but used *outside and in conjunction with* a \u0022MODEL\u0022 block would require it to be decimal. All of my scales use decimals now, to avoid further problems. (these external scales use a single number, not 3 axes)\n\nEDIT: Also, you can have problems like this with an extraneous dot somewhere.
