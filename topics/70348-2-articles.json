Instead of going for the DIRECT proposal and working on from the, there was the Constellation program that was both a conceptual failiure, and a political one.

On the contrary NASA put in a pretty unprecedented amount of effort to document everything when they shut down the Saturn V production line (at the time NASA administrator Thomas Paine assumed the shutdown would be temporary and wanted to retain the ability to reproduce the factory tooling as rapidly as possible). They still have all of that stuff. Blueprints are only a piece of the manufacturing puzzle at any rate. The thing is the engineering has progressed since the 1970\u0027s and SLS will have roughly Saturn V like performance, but at a fraction of the cost. The difference between now and then is during the Space Race NASA\u0027s budget was proportionally 10 times higher than it is now (literally).
