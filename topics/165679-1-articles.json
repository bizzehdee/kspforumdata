Which makes going into space a lot trickier. Why is this happening? It seems like the boosters have more momentum or something than the rest of the rocket, which is strange.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dafni","CreatedById":149636,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-20T07:18:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you decouple them when they are still burning?
