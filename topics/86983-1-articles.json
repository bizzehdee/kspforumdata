I\u0027ve been a long-time user of KSP (coming up on 3 years now!), and I\u0027ve decided it\u0027s time to make my own mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst item on my list: a deployable aeroshield for large-diameter landers or probes. I\u0027ve already figured out how it will be shaped and what size it will be, but now it\u0027s time to make the actual part model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m designing the part in Sketchup, and will then port it over to something else to finish the job. Awkward and time consuming? Sure. But I\u0027m much more comfortable modelling in Sketchup, and it\u0027s worked before when I made something similar for Orbiter a few years back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe development will undergo a few phases:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 1: initial development and getting the part to work as intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 2: refinement of the design (adding the little details like overlapping petals or hinges)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 3: Final touchup (texture addition, adding Deadly Reentry compatibility, adding a shroud if needed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 4: Release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll keep this up to date with new photos as development continues, and I\u0027ll be seeking help from other, more experienced mod-makers when I hit the inevitable snags.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaverickSawyer\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-12T03:56:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2014 03:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MaverickSawyer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T02:02:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, time for the first reveal:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DTPDlnK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DTPDlnK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w7Zly4n.png\u0022 alt=\u0022w7Zly4n.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u0oQW1J.png\u0022 alt=\u0022u0oQW1J.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YzJEGv1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YzJEGv1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upper pair of pictures are the fully deployed aeroshield.
