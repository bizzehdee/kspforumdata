I\u0027m recreating various craft from X-Wing, TIE Fighter, X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, and X-Wing Alliance. This craft was used by the Empire and it was seen in all the X-Wing games. The Cygnus XG-1 Starwing Assault Gunboat.

They\u0027re a much bigger nuisance than TIE Bombers as they tend to fire missiles at you a lot and that was annoying.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Nice gunboat!

I should have placed antennae in the tailroot... missile racks, I was more concerned the flight capability of the ship... and thought that placing something at the intake area might affect the ship\u0027s flight."}]}
