Just enter your mainboards actual name into the search bar, select it from the list and click download. Never had any problems with this page on my 2 previous boards. Also you shouldn\u0027t expect any major changes due to a bios update. A more recent version (every mainboard has a BasicInputOutputSystem pre-installed) most of the time only contains may compatibility fixes and other minor issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor configuring the BIOS settings you have to press some key, as mentioned by sjwt. Common ones are Del, F2, F10-F12. It should be shown somewhere on the screen anyway.

Any and all devices that need to be enabled or checked cost a small amount of time, so to ensure the least time possible is spent in the BIOS, make sure to disable all unnecessary devices. Not going to use that IEEE 1394 port? Disable it. Don\u0027t really need that old HDD? Take it out. Got a discrete GPU? Disable the on-board completely. Stuff like that will add up. Not by minutes, but every second you can shave off is a profit every boot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
