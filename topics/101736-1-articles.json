What I\u0027m having difficulty doing is planning a route there. I have MechJeb, but can\u0027t select an asteroid to have it navigate for me. I put myself on an exit trajectory from Kerbin in the direction of an asteroid only to trapped by Kerbol.

Meeting an asteroid in Kerbol orbit is exactly the same as meeting a stranded Kerbal in Kerbin orbit. You intercept the target\u0027s orbit at the point in space and time where the target will be (or get as close as possible) and reduce your velocity relative to target to zero at that point. I don\u0027t use Mechjeb, so i suggest you \u0027turn off your targeting computer\u0027 and use the navball. I find a good technique is to (1) select the asteroid as target (2) drag maneuver nodes until you find the closest intercept you can get (3) as you approach, select Target mode on the navball and use correcting burns to \u0027push\u0027 or \u0027pull\u0027 your directional marker until you moving straight at the target (4) decelerate (still pushing the marker onto the target path) until you are within a few hundred meters and your velocity relative to target is a few meters per second.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T17:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGoing to direct you to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75759-Asteroid-Rendezvous-Outside-of-Kerbin%E2%80%99s-SOI?p=1076130\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EClaw\u0027s tutorial\u003C/a\u003E on how to do asteroid rendezvous outside of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. The probe he builds for the job is good enough to capture Class A and B asteroids, and it\u0027s small enough that if you prefer to do so you could conceivably launch it via spaceplane (though I might recommend swapping out the 909 with an LV-N in that case so you have a little delta-V to spare for making inclination changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you get the rock, I\u0027d suggest hitting the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eaerobraking calculator site\u003C/a\u003E and put your desired apoapsis around Kerbin up by Mun\u0027s orbit.
