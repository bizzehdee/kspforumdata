From my gnome launcher, still no goodness, but... running it from the Kerbal Space Program directory in the terminal brings it all back: aero fx, re-entry heating, the works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad might want to look at what broke that in these latest updates (because it always worked fine using my launcher before) but at minimum I\u0027ve got a workaround that\u0027ll deliver the game. I\u0027m going to craft up a quick shell script and point my launcher at that and I\u0027ll be off to the races.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you everyone for your help! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJack\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T21:32:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPrimusrun didn\u0027t cause any issues then?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a script for my Steam install because I can\u0027t be bothered to open the game folder, it\u0027s not complex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E#!/bin/bash\u003Cbr\u003Ecd \u0022/home/user/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Kerbal Space Program/\u0022\u003Cbr\u003ELC_ALL=C ./KSP.x86_64\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stratvox","CreatedById":134498,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T21:38:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, primusrun has never caused any issues afaict.
