If not, please let me know.)\n\nI\u0027ve been really busy lately creating a new Android game, which is an online multiplayer game where players use their tanks to destroy enemy tanks. Tanks can be upgraded in various categories. The tank controls allow for multi-touch so that players can aim and shoot while driving.\n\n[Battle Tanks on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blizzy.battletanks)\n\n![k5VhCbxGIoRyyeQ43RTcsupISg5nNP2d0yanS4gF2JGc5sGVfpVNo3HGcOyJ6zPQ=h310](https://lh5.ggpht.com/k5VhCbxGIoRyyeQ43RTcsupISg5nNP2d0yanS4gF2JGc5sGVfpVNo3HGcOyJ6zPQ=h310)\n\n![HS6g3anWT3acCjxXg8_rDRnD8H-Kwiek5G3fKSzqZZDLOdvGK7y2VW1lo_FEYCjJv9jM=h310](https://lh5.ggpht.com/HS6g3anWT3acCjxXg8_rDRnD8H-Kwiek5G3fKSzqZZDLOdvGK7y2VW1lo_FEYCjJv9jM=h310)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T13:50:52Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 01:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by blizzy78**"},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T04:58:03Z","Content":"Well its ok.

My test device is rather big (10.1\u0022). So in general you need to make sure that GUI elements stay the same physical size (which I did), but then of course you run into the problem that smaller devices can\u0027t display everything if you make it too big.\n\nLong story short, I shall make some adjustments to the UI ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E When I tried to join a match there was no one there.\n\nYes, that\u0027s to be expected for a bit, since the game is just released.

I don\u0027t plan on using it in any other way right now.\n\nI should probably add some note in the UI about that.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u0027re still with me, how did you like controlling the tank in general? I know you were alone, but I\u0027d guess you drove around and fired some shots.\n\n(During development, I have been getting a request to also provide an alternative way of controlling the tank. Still thinking about how to go forward with that.)"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T12:57:41Z","Content":"Any plans for iOS?

I also get the feeling that using multi-touch isn\u0027t too good an idea here. The problem is that your hands are generally too big such that they will obscure large parts of the screen, making it difficult to see your enemies.\n\nI will implement a virtual joystick like you suggested over the next days.
