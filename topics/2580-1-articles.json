Reentry methods for 1st stage - using picaX on the fron of the stage while all the weight is on the back? issues need to be overcome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there is the payload fraction in all of this, which will get smaller and smaller.

I hope the best!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the chutes for reentry, of the dragon specifically; They\\\u0027ll test fire thrusters at a height that\\\u0027s still safe for parachute deploy. if they don\\\u0027t work, they\\\u0027ll go to backup chutes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrusters are possibly even safer then chutes; you can test them often, and you can build in redundancy easily. The big advantage ( and likely reason why they chose this ) of thrusters vs parachutes is control. You can land pin-point on a pad. Imagine the stages coming down on a tree on parachutes- bye bye fuel tanks, some stick in your engine? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr a sidewalk? if you are landing on parachutes, you need a vast flat area cleared of people. Possibly even waterproof the stages- and still have a shock absorber ( some sort of legs / airbad ) implemented. With good thrusters you just need a pad somewhat closely to the ocean. Trajectory will be that if the thrusters / landing engines don\\\u0027t fire, it\\\u0027ll overshoot the pad and land in the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
