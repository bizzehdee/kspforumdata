I can travel interplanetary space and have landed everywhere except eve. I can use a gravity assist to gain and lose velocity. I often preform an assist around Tylo to get captured in its orbit. With Tylo I can flyby with a 5k periapsis. I\u0027ve read that people use Eve for a gravity assist to other planets. What I want to know is what should my periapsis be for a gravity assist off of Eve? Does it dip into the atmosphere?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T20:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E100km is out of atmosphere and good\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T20:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is your gravity assist for?
