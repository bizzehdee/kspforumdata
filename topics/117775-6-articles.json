I timed them according to orbiter. So speeding them up is not an option. Plus we are going to have a KSp update soon with unity 5 so lets wait and see what happens there.

She seems a little sluggish on take-off. More accurately, in a climb. I can get her in the air (using the mains, I haven\u0027t tried the hover engines) but, it\u0027s a lot easier going forward than going up. Anyone else having similar issues and/or a fix or recommendation on flight profiles?"},{"CreatedByName":"Redneck","CreatedById":2030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T17:39:18Z","Content":"I have a whole profile as far as weight and engine isp fuel consumption and capacities ready to go. Only thing I need to figure out is why she is tumbling during reentry if you deviate at all during it. I was told in another thread to look at the coloffset/copoffset in cfg file. Then ill give you guys a fresh update. Thanks to commanderspock for bringing this to my attention and helping to test different changes. Keep the feedback coming guys thanks"},{"CreatedByName":"Doc Anderson","CreatedById":59918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T13:42:38Z","Content":"Before I say another word ... LOVE the mod. Can\u0027t wait to see how it develops. Nicely done! This was my favorite vehicle in Orbiter. It\u0027s a natural for KSP. Thank you.\n\nI\u0027m also having flight issues. It\u0027s very sluggish on takeoff (not near as much lift as it needs) so it burns through a LOT of fuel. I\u0027m not even making suborbital altitude and it becomes unstable as it gets low on fuel. This is likely what makes reentry so difficult.\n\nThe other difficulty is with the hover engines being unbalanced. Even setting the rear hover engines to 40% thrust, it\u0027s pushing the nose down. (BTW, selecting the right rear hover engine in the VAB to assign them to action groups is very difficult.)\n\nAnd one last question...\n\nHow do you get the crew out? Having trouble transferring them to the airlock.\n\nAll said, this is a WAY cool piece of work. Once the bugs are worked out, this could be the workhorse for servicing and refueling space stations and colonies."},{"CreatedByName":"Redneck","CreatedById":2030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T13:58:22Z","Content":"Well thank you very much for the kind words. The balancing and weights thrusts and overall profile of the vehicle is being worked on as we speak. CommanderSpock is working on the config files now trying to fix the tumbling during reentry issue. As far as hovering goes these are dependent on Throttle Control avionics and action groups extended mods in order to achieve a good hover balance. I adjusted the RCS power last night and I landed it perfectly controlled on top of VAB building last night. Ill make a video tutorial on how to set the mods up so others can achieve this. So a update is coming real soon....maybe tonight."},{"CreatedByName":"Redneck","CreatedById":2030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T02:07:02Z","Content":"Commander your mailbox is full can not PM you.

I didnt want to do the action groups because everyone has different preferences. What we need is a coder to make an engine module/.Dll plugin. This is beyond my understanding. This would also eliminate the engines working through the animated doors and blowing stuff up. Ie. Open hover doors or retro doors before engaging engines then closing them automatically\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-07T14:19:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2015 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Redneck**"},{"CreatedByName":"Doc Anderson","CreatedById":59918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T16:42:23Z","Content":"One way to do that might be to make each of the engines and the doors that go with them a single assembly (i.e. hover engines and doors as one part and the retro engines and doors as another part).
