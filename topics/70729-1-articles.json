If you don\u0027t and your burn is particularly long, you need to apply corrections for inaccuracies caused by long burn. Unfortunately the maneuver indicator on navball is extremely unhelpful in that because if you follow it, you\u0027ll end up ejecting in a very different direction than where you want to go. So if you don\u0027t have enough experience in making these corrections (and don\u0027t want to spend a long time learning them), it\u0027s recommended to pack sufficient thrust to execute the burn in under one minute.
