My rationale is that biomes aren\u0027t actually biomes, but more like different types of terrain, e.g. grassland vs. sand, or on Mun it\u0027s simply different craters that only differ in which shade of grey they are. When I worked with SAR data in the past, that\u0027s almost exactly what we used it for (along with buildings and vehicles, e.g. identify a tank model by its shape on a SAR image).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s about all I have, so I\u0027m definitely interested in a better explanation of how these sensors could work.

Biomes have a colour, and the game determines the biome at a given location by finding the biome with the assigned colour that\u0027s closest to the corresponding pixel\u0027s colour. I\u0027m also assuming that the pixel colour is interpolated like normal. So on paper, a representation like mine would be better as a map, since it shows clear boundaries and at a higher resolution (so you can see where biomes flip due to interpolation). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is only, I don\u0027t actually know how this is implemented in the game and my method of finding the biome for a given location is only my interpretation of \u0022closest colour\u0022. There appears to be an API function that I could use to find the biome at a location, but unfortunately it prints debug messages to the screen. If that gets fixed then my biome maps should be more accurate than the texture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Innsewerants","CreatedById":16461,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T07:51:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve never looked at your code.
