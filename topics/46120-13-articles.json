The main reason is that you don\u0027t know how long the lander and rover are going to stay alive. The first thing you want to do when you arrive isn\u0027t to start taking hi-res 3D pictures that take hours or days to upload, just to find out that your rover died in the middle of the transmission and you lost everything. You don\u0027t want to switch on all your instruments at once in case you overload something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first pictures taken are usually low-res quick snapshots to make sure that the lander is on the ground, that it isn\u0027t upside down or sitting on a slope. You don\u0027t need hi-res for this, but you need that info fast so that you can take corrective action if necessary, or figure out why the rover failed if it does stop transmitting. You enable the instruments and equipment in a sequence and you check power levels and to minimize any issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey you do the other system checks, which were the main purpose of the \u0022selfie pics\u0022 of the rover and lander: to make sure that everything is properly deployed, that nothing is broken off or obstructed. Again, you don\u0027t need hi-res for this. And then, as you gain confidence, you start switching on the more power hungry hi res cameras and periodically increase the data bandwidth to optimize transmissions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hi-res 3D pics will come, but they will take a while to upload. This is standard procedure for pretty much all space missions. And don\u0027t worry, the rover and lander do have memory buffers, so even if it takes weeks to transmit the early data, it is still stored locally until then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and don\u0027t forget that the Apollo pictures were analogic. The video pictures that were transmitted back live were pretty bad really. The good still pictures came from the Hasselblad medium format cameras for which the film cartridges were brought back and processed on Earth. In terms of resolution, analog is always better than hi-res digital. In terms of bandwidth though, it took 3 days to bring them back and several weeks to process them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T08:57:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stankleberry\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stankleberry\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFake. .\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuh.
