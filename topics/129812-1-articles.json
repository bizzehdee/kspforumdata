Version was pure stock 18.something. I had to learn to do in practice many things, making and launching of large rockets, rendezvous, docking of wobbly and massive ships, landing on larger planet, using approximate Hohmann orbits. I had 2 launches, docking on Kerbin\u0027s orbit. I had separate lander and I visited on Duna and on Ike. Everything went near perfectly. My ships had enough margins but was not too overengineered. It took couple of days to, calculate, plan, make, test and execute everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have visited on every body after that but have not got same feeling of success. My first Mun trip with overengineered craft was too easy to give such feelings. Maybe first Eve manned mission was near. It took even more time but most of it was relatively straightforward testing of crafts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-13T12:54:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst instruments only, IVA docking using only RasterPropMonitor, and with the game\u0027s UI disabled. \u00A0The launch and rendezevous was done as per normal, but the final approach alignment, and docking done entirely from inside the lander-can. \u00A0Above anything else I\u0027ve done in KSP, including my first orbit and landing, that was probably the most tense, and rewarding moment I\u0027ve had in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWemb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
