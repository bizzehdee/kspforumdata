This is pretty easy to test.\n\nPlanes are only vulnerable then flying low, this is takeoff and landing, add helicopters searching and small planes. in none of this settings you want to be blinded. \n\nYou will also only hit over time if you aim. The response is that the police react like you shoot an gun at the plane, might be unfair but an handgun can not hit an plane 500 meter up, you are more likely to hit randoms on the ground. \n\nAs for the 13 year old kid he did not really know the danger.

You can\u0027t make attempted murder stick for it in any but the most extreme cases, because you need to show intent to kill (and most people don\u0027t know that pointing a laser at an aircraft \\*can\\* kill, let alone do it with the intent to kill). The actual crime in the US is the aptly-named \u0022Aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft,\u0022 which is a felony (max 5 years). Anything more requires showing intent to hurt someone or interfere with a flight, which normally isn\u0027t there -- most people who do this are just having fun, and don\u0027t know it causes any problem at all (it\u0027s hard to convict someone of assault or attempted murder if they don\u0027t think their laser beam will even reach the plane, let alone cause any harm). At the federal level, it has the same max sentence as grand theft (5 years), but I\u0027m not sure how actual sentences stack up between the two.\n\nIf someone\u0027s \\*intentionally\\* interfering with a flight, it becomes much more serious, and has a much longer max term -- intentional interference with flight crew has a 20 year max."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T02:22:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I would think blasting a pilot in the eyes with a laser counts as assault, and perhaps attempted murder?\n\nOf course not.

In most cases of lasering aircraft, the person lasering the plane doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s an issue. That\u0027s exactly why the US added the specific section for \u0022pointing a laser at a plane\u0022 -- it turns out it was hard to get other charges to stick in US court in many cases, because you had to first show that they knew that the beam could even \\*reach\\* the plane with enough power to affect anything, and then that you knew (or should have known) that it could cause harm to the aircraft. Thus, Congress passed a law to make it illegal to aim at a plane or at a flight path, without requiring that you know that your laser pointer can affect the aircraft at all (because it\u0027s a lot easier to show you intentionally aimed it at a plane or a flight path than it is to show that you tried to \\*hit\\* a plane). This is possibly US-specific, though; other countries may differ on how easy or hard it is to prove this sort of thing."},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T03:08:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Attempted murder hardly.
