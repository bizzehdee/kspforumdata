In most cases of lasering aircraft, the person lasering the plane doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s an issue. That\u0027s exactly why the US added the specific section for \u0022pointing a laser at a plane\u0022 -- it turns out it was hard to get other charges to stick in US court in many cases, because you had to first show that they knew that the beam could even *reach* the plane with enough power to affect anything, and then that you knew (or should have known) that it could cause harm to the aircraft. Thus, Congress passed a law to make it illegal to aim at a plane or at a flight path, without requiring that you know that your laser pointer can affect the aircraft at all (because it\u0027s a lot easier to show you intentionally aimed it at a plane or a flight path than it is to show that you tried to *hit* a plane). This is possibly US-specific, though; other countries may differ on how easy or hard it is to prove this sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T03:08:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAttempted murder hardly.

A car thief firing beams at a helicopter to avoid capture is more like someone tossing caltrops on the road behind them -- it causes risk (and unlike airliners, a helicopter chasing a car has a *much* more increased risk to dazzle, because helicopters are less stable and they\u0027re flying lower), it\u0027s not like shooting a gun at pursuers (classing it as attempted murder would be rather excessive), and it\u0027s for the purpose of escaping the cops (doing things to stop the cops from chasing you is illegal). A stupid kid isn\u0027t trying to interfere with a pilot by shining a laser at them; if you\u0027re *trying* to interfere with a pilot, that\u0027s a much more serious crime (and rightly so), because you can\u0027t claim \u0022I didn\u0027t think it would cause any harm.\u0022 It is not safe to shine a laser at a police helicopter pilot flying at low altitudes.
