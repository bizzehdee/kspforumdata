We have the centre of thrust marker in the editors, that gives us the centre and direction of thrust.\n\nI think it would be useful if it projected a thin line along its entire axis, a bit like a laser pointer. We could then see EXACTLY where this line passes through the CoM and CoL markers, thereby making it easier to get everything properly in line and balanced."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T21:08:08Z","Content":"I have been wishing this to be a thing since i first tried to build a space shuttle."}]}
