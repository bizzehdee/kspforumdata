Usually the error you post is related to the texture cache from the ATM mod.

The tank skin in ATM cache needs to be cleared out so the new skin is generated with the proper dimensions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Korb Biakustra","CreatedById":53854,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T00:36:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help Prowler_x1!
