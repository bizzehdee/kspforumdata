The plan is to come in butt first, and slow down till I\u0027m sub 100m/s horizontally, try to kill vertical velocity as much as possible, and land on the gear, rolling BACKWARDS. The craft has rear wheels positioned far back for this particular maneuver. I have yet to try it, but in theory it should work. Lifting off again will have it take off rolling forwards, and pulse the aerospike in the underside of the nose to pitch up. Alternatively you can use terrain features to sort of launch off of.
