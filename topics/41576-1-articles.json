In practice Retrograde launches (those launching to the west) take a bit more Delta V to achiveve because not only are you not getting the little boost from the planet\u0027s rotation, you actually have to kill all of that initial velocity the rotation gives you. That said it\u0027s not a whole lot extra as far as launch delta v is concerned, I belive it\u0027s only about an additional 250m/s total, just be aware that your assent stage should have that little extra amount of fuel to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Gravity turns, for the most part the sooner you get horizontal the better, just be aware that planets with atmospheres do slow you down.

You add less speed to your vertical ascent and more towards horizontal so you can create that falling-so-fast-forwards-that-the-ground-moves-out-from-beneath-you effect. You must manually tilt your rocket so that you balance altitude gain and horizontal speed gain. In the end, you loose nearly all of your vertical speed, even though you\u0027re still accelerating because you just are adding more horizontal speed. You absolutely do not want to begin your horizontal burn only when at your apoapsis. You want to have a gravity turn and gradually tilt over to the horizon line. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley claims that the target altitude to begin the G turn is 10,000 m, but I believe this to be untrue. If your rocket has a low T/W, and may be underpowered, you will need to turn later because you will not have the appropriate apoapsis. I believe the ratio between your altitude and apoapsis should be 1:3. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you begin your turn, do not tilt further than the 60 degree mark, or halfway to the 45 degree mark. You should not go down to 45 until you have an apoapsis of around 40-50 km, depending on your T/W. When you have reached your desired apoapsis, I usually stop burning and wait until t- 50-30 seconds (depending on T/W) from apoapsis to burn at the horizon and create a stable orbit. I am sure it is not the most efficient method, but it always works for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnappingTurtle","CreatedById":69795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T15:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replies but I wonder which of you actually knows what you\u0027re talking about as opposed to just thinking you do.
