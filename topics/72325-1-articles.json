When massive ships are involved, it can get real bad with the docked ships wobbling around and flexing which just adds extra stress to your computer. After the wobble it just breaks into \u0022Moar struts!\u0022 But that can lag even worse. Anyways, to the main point. What if we welded certain high mass modules that are docked together, like the welding mod allows you to do? This wouldn\u0027t help for the massive in one launch ships, but if you aren\u0027t Whackjob you most likely wouldn\u0027t do that. Anyways, you can discuss about how you think it could/should be applied. Or if you disagree massively. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T03:50:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a good idea.
