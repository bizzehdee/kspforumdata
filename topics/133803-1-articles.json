Usually I would look at the moon, because it had so many interesting features, but sometimes I would hunt for planets. They showed up as disks rather than points. One night I suddenly realized I could see four dots near one of the planets and I realized it must be Jupiter and the Galilean moons. It was pretty neat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-09T03:09:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCloudy here too. I\u0027ve looked at Jupiter several times in the past month, though. I wish the rocky planets were in the evening sky right now...not much to look at with the telescope. I had a beautifully clear night last week, so I went outside to look at the stars (without the telescope, it was a little cold and I was feeling lazy). As I was hunting for Castor, the six-star system, I happened to notice a small satellite passing right overhead from north to south. I don\u0027t know what satellite it was, maybe a GPS one, but it was pretty neat. I rarely see small satellites from non-rural areas, so it was a pleasant surprise. In rural areas, you can almost always spot a few in the evening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
