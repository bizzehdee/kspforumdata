It then stays like that for 5\u00A0to\u00A07\u00A0seconds or thereabout and then the signal gets back again. Sometimes it happens several times in a row. So the monitor signals out and in again and repeatedly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is completely random, I say, completely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, when I then at the time of incident put the displayport cable in another port it always remedies the problem, but again, for a random given time and then it re-appears again, on any of the display ports I must add.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis happens only in KSP, not any other game, application or graphical environment does suffer\u00A0from this anomaly (at least those programs that I\u00A0run)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHence why I registered on this forum instead of some computer help site or Steam since it\u0027s then clearly KSP related, am I right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I tried all the latest drivers for the GTX 1080 TI. I tried putting my display port cable in all 3 the display ports on the back of the videocard, and I used a secondary display port cable to see if it was the cable itself. Which can\u0027t be as logic tells me because then it would be reproduceable in other games also.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe same goes for the argument that it may be faulty ports. Which it can\u0027t be because then all 3 of them would be faulty and isn\u0027t that just to unlikely to happen on a new videocard? I think it would be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know you and I like plentiful of information in troubleshooting scenarios but I don\u0027t know what to give, so just ask me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI currently play 1.4 but I got my new rig still in the 1.3.1 phase and both versions have the same problem, my bet any version before that also.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-14T13:09:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not encountered this problem myself but some experiences with other bugs suggests you might want to try configuring the display driver settings to see if there is one in there which can have an effect. It sounds as though it is activating some kind of autodetect and is changing the output to the monitor for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso make sure you have the correct\u00A0monitor driver / inf installed in the OS.\u00A0i.e. Look through the display driver and make sure it recognises the monitor by model name, if not fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf so check it is not innappropriately configured for multiple displays or stereoscopic 3D etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry changing any autodetects or \u0022let application decide\u0022 to manual configuration e.g. in the nVidia control panel \u00223D settings\u0022, \u0022adjust image settings with preview\u0022 panel you can select an alternative to letting the application decide, since the issue seems to be application related.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso if the monitor has a control panel with settings it may be worth taking\u00A0a look at these to see if it has any autodetects going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that helps.
