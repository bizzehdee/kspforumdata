It is possible to have a completely stable aircraft using FAR and the SPH/VAB tools window gives you the graphs and numbers needed to design such aircraft (ask Dirt_Merchant).

I\u0027ve had years of experience with flight sims, and once dirt explained what each number was and how to read the graphs, I started making planes that could fly well.
