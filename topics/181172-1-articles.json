seems the 1.6 update to Kopernicus somehow removed solar arrays from my action groups.\u00A0 It was quite thorough about it, too:\u00A0 if I focused on an existing ship with deployable solar arrays in an action group, it closed them and deleted the arrays from the action group; if I opened a ship file in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, it stripped out any solar arrays from action groups.\u00A0 The only thing I was using Kopernicus for was to give Jool a set of rings, so the obvious first step was to delete Kopernicus.\u00A0 Which seems to have prevented the problem from getting WORSE, at least--ship files that I did NOT open (and re-save) in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E still have their action groups intact, and ships that I did NOT focus on with Kopernicus installed still have their solar arrays in their action groups.\u00A0 So, yay for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut--the existing ships in flight which got corrupted appear to have had their solar arrays permanently removed from their action groups (okay, that\u0027s not surprising--the persistent file got rewritten with the ships in their new state, after all).\u00A0 And I\u0027d like to fix that.\u00A0 My playstyle involves building a permanent infrastructure with reusable landers, space stations, ground bases, deep-space tugs, etc.\u00A0 So some of the corrupted vessels are assets I\u0027d intended to keep around \u0022forever\u0022--and I really don\u0027t want to have to manually retract/deploy each and every array one at a time when I\u0027m docking/aerobraking/etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I expect I\u0027ll have to go in and manually re-jigger the action groups for the affected ships in the persistent file.\u00A0 But I have no idea what to look for or how to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody have any advice/pointers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n======\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdited to add:\u00A0 I may have spoken too soon and been overoptimistic in my summary above.\u00A0 It appears that the corruption occurred specifically for all instances of the shielded 1x6 arrays (but not the unshielded arrays, or the 2x3 arrays or Gigantors), and affected all such ships in flight whether I had focused on them or not.\u00A0 I also \u0022fixed\u0022 and saved several ship designs in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E when I first noticed the problem, before I sorted out the Kopernicus connection--and now with Kopernicus uninstalled the \u0022fixed\u0022 ships have corrupted solar arrays.\u00A0 (Apparently Kopernicus replaces some existing solar array code modules with its own, and this update did not do so as elegantly as one might have wished?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of which changes the core of my question--but

One element of the MOD is upgraded solar Panels. Any Panel that can track the sun - and that\u0027s all extendable panels - are updated. But my those rings of Jool are nice arn\u0027t they? Well worth this pain, right?\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, during the update it strips out the action group items. From day 1 I had configured all extendable solar panels, along with Antenna and anything else that was essential for Craft startup, or could burn off during re-entry, to use the Zero key, or as KSP knows it \u0022Custom10\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKopernicus edits the persistent.sfs, and adds the XML tag \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022\u003C/span\u003EtrackingBodyName = The Sun\u0022 to each every extendable panel in the file. 17 lines down from this tag are the action group elements.\u00A0 Changing the ExtendPanelsAction element,\u00A0 actionGroup tag, from \u0022None\u0022\u00A0 to \u0022Custom10\u0022 will allow said solar array to toggle with the Zero key. It does not affect any other already-assigned items, such as Antenna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had 642 trackingBodyName tags, and some were already configured to Custom10, as I launched ships before I realized what I was dealing with, and how extensive the problem was. So I only had 631 solar panels, across all my active ships, stations, probes \u0026amp; rovers, that needed to be updated. Obviously I wasn\u0027t doing THAT by hand. So, I developed the following regex expressions to do the find and replace fore me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteps to resolve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Save the game and exit out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Create a backup copy of your persistant.sfs file.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) Open the persistent.sfs file in Notepad\u002B\u002B (It is free to download off the web if you don\u0027t already have it.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) Do a find. (CTRL-H) and hit the radio button for \u0022Regular Expression\u0022 at the bottom of the find window.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5) Drop in this FIND regex string...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 (trackingBodyName = The Sun([^\\r\\n]*\\R\u002B){17})(^.\u002B?actionGroup = )(None.*\\r\\n)\u003Cbr\u003E\n6) OPTIONAL do a count so you have an idea of how many solar panels you are about to update.\u003Cbr\u003E\n7) Click the \u0022Replace tab\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n8) Drop in the following REPLACE regex string....\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \\1\\3Custom10\\r\\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n9) Replace all.\u003Cbr\u003E\n10) Save the file,. Launch your game, and load your save. (NOTE: If you have had this issue for a while, and go back to an old quick save, or other save, you will loose all the changes. You can do the same edit to all of the save files.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis resolved my issue - at least, for the way I use the solar array action groups. (On one class of ship, one that has 8 child probes, and where I had each prob set to use an action group to prep it for flight; I.e. probes numbered 1 - 8 were on action groups 1-8. Now, all of the probes solar panels are tied to action group 0. This is the \u0022Club\u0022 part of the fix I mentioned above.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps. and good luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInCrypt_\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-06T17:36:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2019 05:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by InCrypt_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HansAcker","CreatedById":195534,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-09T23:28:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recently ran into the same issue when syncing saves between computers.
