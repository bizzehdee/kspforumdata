If yes, how to solve it?"},{"CreatedByName":"sha","CreatedById":137368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T18:12:34Z","Content":"Sometimes, and not for a clear reason, the part is blocked by another. Like if you put something on the cockipit door. Check that your antenna has free space around. \n\ndo you have enough power also ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T18:19:10Z","Content":"Post a pic or two to get the best help, with 408 posts you should know this by now lol."},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T18:28:21Z","Content":"I\u0027m sorry, I thought it was a known issue\n\nHere you have:\n\n![xFSG1l7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xFSG1l7.jpg)\n\n![BBPtXFH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BBPtXFH.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T18:49:07Z","Content":"Thank you much, it appears that the antenna is too close to extend correctly. The DTS-M1 opens up to a dish and I think it may be just be blocked. I hope you tried extending it in the VAB to test if there was clipping?\n\nAs for the 88, sorry I can\u0027t really tell what is going on with that from that particular pic.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T18:53:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 06:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Glaran K\u0027erman**\n  \nMade more specific"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T18:51:23Z","Content":"It worked correctly in the VAB.

The VAB doesn\u0027t reflect the reality at any time. The most complete test is outdoor on the ground.
