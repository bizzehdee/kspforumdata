The drag and drop function is cool and all, but with large systems (more than the window can display without scrolling) and/or many groups, I think it would be just easier to move groups next to each other to swap servos between them via the arrow buttons. Also, it would allow more logical, arbitrary ordering of commands. I was messing around with groups and the last group of servos I wanted to be last in the list (and be activated) somehow wound up as the first group in the list (this was from a sub-assembly, though the original ordering before I made it a sub-assembly was correct...

Even faster if I\u0027m in flight it feels like. Perhaps related, the game is stuttering far more than I recall prior to using IR again. To the point of slideshow. I\u0027m pretty sure there\u0027s something else in my install feeding into this (what with \u003E40 plugins \u0026 mods), but IR seems to be exacerbating the problem. I think the memory leak is causing Unity\u0027s GC to kick in a lot more often. I was just punted from a game session while sitting on the runway testing an IR-based probe to check Pivotron settings. I got a slideshow a couple of times - about 3.3GB RAM being used by KSP at that point; crashed at around 3.5 when I tried to revert back to the SPH. It seems anything I fly with IR parts in it does this during some point in my flights. Usually during burns in space and somewhere in the 30k to 50k alt range over Kerbin. The latter I think might have NEAR compounding the issue. I\u0027ll have to test a non-IR using vessel at some point later to be sure.\n\nI\u0027m just screwing around with the game at this point... The crashes have been preventing me from putting up a comm network (RemoteTech) in a timely fashion. I\u0027ve been spending time trying to hunt down performance issues instead. (I finally pinned down the add-on that was spamming my log: last official release of TacFuelBalancer was calling a deprecated function for highlighting parts - the newer, un-official 0.90 compatibility release fixed that.)\n\nLastly: symmetry cloned parts don\u0027t seem to be carrying over user set limits. I was using some right-angle Extendotrons from the model rework. I was offsetting the minimum limit to 0.1 to prevent some clipping. Every time I used symmetry, the limit on the new cloned part would be 0.0, though it would be sitting at 0.1 physically.\n\nAlso, Rotatrons from the model rework seem to have some issues with the reset function (in the Editor at least). I engaged limits, modified them (90 degree range), moved them to check, then hit reset (while they were NOT at either limit) to adjust some things and re-test, but the Pivotrons had reset to REALLY weird orientations (this was done using the off-angle one.) Not sure if this is a model or plugin issue.

I have an i7-4771 (stock @3.5GHz) with an HD7970@2GB and 16GB of system RAM, so I expect a bit better performance than what I\u0027ve been experiencing lately.\n\nFor group ordering, can you just give whole groups their own ordering arrows, like the servos themselves? It\u0027s messy for sure, but I think being able to re-order groups would be quite handy.\n\nFor saving the groups, perhaps using something similar to how Action Groups Extended does it might work to keep the ordering? AGX uses a central external file to store configs for each vessel and loads the configs based on an internal vessel ID it generates (or so it looks to me. I had a conflict with AGX and KIS, so I was working that issue for about a week...) The file is stored in the respective save game folder.\n\nOh, not sure if you can reuse the code, but Alternate Resource Panel has a drag and drop system for reordering resources it displays. Perhaps looking at that might help? (I think there was another mod I saw that had drag and drop functionality for its displays... I think it might\u0027ve been MechJeb...)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Problem with symmetry is known, and we\u0027re working on it.

Probably 100 hours if you added it all up. Been through several different versions, updating it for looks, for KOS, for new IR. Building it takes a really long time, not just trying to find exactly the right parts for the shape. There\u0027s also the game crashing every 5 or 6 reverts, symmetry bugs, node-disappearing bugs, and so on. Then when I can find no way to make the IR parts strong enough to resisit wobbling I decide to rebuild the whole thing. \n\nFinally got to here earlier today.

With legs the position values move back and forth through the animation so the ordering doesn\u0027t match up, but I\u0027m only using the preset editor to get precise values anyway. I won\u0027t be using presets actually move the legs so no problem there.\n\nSequencer looks pretty good. I will probably stick to my KOS script because it works the opposite way (I set position keyframes and the script calculates the speed and direction required to get all of the servos there at the same time, rather than me figuring out the speed and direction), but my way is pretty specific to trying to get something complex like legs to work, where it\u0027s easier to move things around beforehand in the SPH to make sure the result keeps feet flat on the ground etc. Your way should be much simpler and easier for most purposes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T17:03:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 05:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziw","CreatedById":135292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T17:04:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027ll do for now, cheers.\n\u003E It\u0027s coming along, geometry is all done and at least it can balance on one foot while firing the GAU-8\u0027s.

Yeah, the current animator code is a bit inelegant/verbose/hard to read with all the testing for part type before any operations, but it does work.\n\nThe biggest issues for me at the moment are these:\n\n- The inability to manipulate uncontrolled joints. I don\u0027t think many people will have this requirement, but I need it because my mech\u0027s legs are connected at multiple points, and I need to align the pistons angles with the docking ports in each keyframe, although all of this is mostly because of the next one...\n\n- Joint stiffness. I only need to do the multiple point connections because the IR joints and connections are loose. I know there has been a lot of discussion about this one in the past, but it actually looks like there might be some kind of solution possible after all. The reason why I think this is that the new rework model rotatrons are, for some reason, \\*far\\* more rigid than the docking washers. Check out [this docking washer sliding around on the hip](http://gfycat.com/HorribleLonelyAlaskankleekai), compared with the rigidity of the new ones, which are used in the hips and knees [on this version, which doesn\u0027t flex at all even when dropped](http://gfycat.com/ComplicatedImpressionableAustralianshelduck). Why the new ones are more resistant to flexing, I have no idea. You can see that the new model hinge pivotrons used in the feet of the second gfy have really weird connections, see how far they compress into the girders attached to them, causing the mech to bounce when it lands. So the rigidity is not universal across the new models.\n\n- Odd joint behaviour. Sometimes joints don\u0027t move the way you want them to (like [this leg disintegration gfy](http://gfycat.com/SevereElaborateIndianglassfish) from earlier). I can\u0027t figure out how to reproduce this reliably. I know for sure that the KAS grappling hook causes issues (which is the problem in that example), but that\u0027s probably just a mod compatability thing, not a problem with the IR behaviour as such. But occasionally I\u0027ll attach a stock part (like a wing section), test the motion, and the something will resist the servo causing it to turn off-axis or fall apart. It\u0027s as though an incorrect movement transform is being applied to some of the parts in the tree parented by the robotic part. Could be to do with using offset gizmos, could be a clipping issue... I haven\u0027t been able to pin it down. But when it happens it usually means pulling the entire section apart and rebuilding it (and hoping it doesn\u0027t happen again). Very time consuming.\n\n- The in-VAB GUI is also a bit hard to navigate. It\u0027s not hard to understand, it just takes a bit of hunting and looking-closely to find servo/configuration/value you\u0027re after, and then a lot of care to make sure you\u0027re doing what you actually want to do. I can do a little video of me using this to show you the difficulties if that would help. But I expect the GUI components available are a bit limited, and it looks like you sensibly don\u0027t want the window to get too big because this would interfere with the actual geometry interface, particularly since mouse event bubbling is an issue here (clicking buttons will remove parts from your craft), but that\u0027s a bug in the base KSP GUI as far as I know, not a bug in the mod.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T01:40:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 01:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziw","CreatedById":135292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T06:11:09Z","Content":"Our editor windows should be click-through proof, i.e. clicking mouse inside our windows should not affect parts.

I could be mistaken... it could be something to do with how they are attached to their parent, or perhaps how their children attach to them. Proper scientific testing is required. But in the meantime if you can think of anything that makes the new rotatron different from the old docking washer (other than the raw geometry, obviously), that might be the key.\n\nI\u0027ll put together some click through gfys, pretty sure I\u0027ve accidentally taken parts off but again, could be my faulty memory. Will perform some proper testing for you tonight.\n\nOverall I should mention that BY FAR my biggest issues with building right now are to do with the game crashing after half a dozen reverts, and the problem with symmetry getting stuck on radial. These are bugs in the base game that, afaik, have nothing to do with any mods and which take up much more of my time than working around any issues with IR, KAS or KOS. Testing IR craft (or, really, any complex craft) requires a lot of launches and a lot of tweaking, and when the game has a memory leak that happens on revert... yeeesh. I spend half my time looking at the KSP loading screen, lol.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T07:48:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 07:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran**"}]}
