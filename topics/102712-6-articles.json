AGX uses a central external file to store configs for each vessel and loads the configs based on an internal vessel ID it generates (or so it looks to me. I had a conflict with AGX and KIS, so I was working that issue for about a week...) The file is stored in the respective save game folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, not sure if you can reuse the code, but Alternate Resource Panel has a drag and drop system for reordering resources it displays.

I don\u0027t think many people will have this requirement, but I need it because my mech\u0027s legs are connected at multiple points, and I need to align the pistons angles with the docking ports in each keyframe, although all of this is mostly because of the next one...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Joint stiffness. I only need to do the multiple point connections because the IR joints and connections are loose. I know there has been a lot of discussion about this one in the past, but it actually looks like there might be some kind of solution possible after all. The reason why I think this is that the new rework model rotatrons are, for some reason, *far* more rigid than the docking washers. Check out \u003Ca href=\u0022http://gfycat.com/HorribleLonelyAlaskankleekai\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis docking washer sliding around on the hip\u003C/a\u003E, compared with the rigidity of the new ones, which are used in the hips and knees \u003Ca href=\u0022http://gfycat.com/ComplicatedImpressionableAustralianshelduck\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eon this version, which doesn\u0027t flex at all even when dropped\u003C/a\u003E. Why the new ones are more resistant to flexing, I have no idea. You can see that the new model hinge pivotrons used in the feet of the second gfy have really weird connections, see how far they compress into the girders attached to them, causing the mech to bounce when it lands. So the rigidity is not universal across the new models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Odd joint behaviour. Sometimes joints don\u0027t move the way you want them to (like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://gfycat.com/SevereElaborateIndianglassfish\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis leg disintegration gfy\u003C/a\u003E from earlier). I can\u0027t figure out how to reproduce this reliably. I know for sure that the KAS grappling hook causes issues (which is the problem in that example), but that\u0027s probably just a mod compatability thing, not a problem with the IR behaviour as such. But occasionally I\u0027ll attach a stock part (like a wing section), test the motion, and the something will resist the servo causing it to turn off-axis or fall apart. It\u0027s as though an incorrect movement transform is being applied to some of the parts in the tree parented by the robotic part. Could be to do with using offset gizmos, could be a clipping issue... I haven\u0027t been able to pin it down. But when it happens it usually means pulling the entire section apart and rebuilding it (and hoping it doesn\u0027t happen again). Very time consuming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The in-VAB GUI is also a bit hard to navigate. It\u0027s not hard to understand, it just takes a bit of hunting and looking-closely to find servo/configuration/value you\u0027re after, and then a lot of care to make sure you\u0027re doing what you actually want to do. I can do a little video of me using this to show you the difficulties if that would help. But I expect the GUI components available are a bit limited, and it looks like you sensibly don\u0027t want the window to get too big because this would interfere with the actual geometry interface, particularly since mouse event bubbling is an issue here (clicking buttons will remove parts from your craft), but that\u0027s a bug in the base KSP GUI as far as I know, not a bug in the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T01:40:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 01:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziw","CreatedById":135292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T06:11:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOur editor windows should be click-through proof, i.e. clicking mouse inside our windows should not affect parts.

I didn\u0027t notice much difference. Or, perhaps said better, the difference between the old docking washer and the new rotatron certainly seems to be vastly more significant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will do some dedicated testing tonight to really probe this further, but right now it does seem like some of the joints are significantly stronger than others. I could be mistaken... it could be something to do with how they are attached to their parent, or perhaps how their children attach to them. Proper scientific testing is required. But in the meantime if you can think of anything that makes the new rotatron different from the old docking washer (other than the raw geometry, obviously), that might be the key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll put together some click through gfys, pretty sure I\u0027ve accidentally taken parts off but again, could be my faulty memory.

These are bugs in the base game that, afaik, have nothing to do with any mods and which take up much more of my time than working around any issues with IR, KAS or KOS. Testing IR craft (or, really, any complex craft) requires a lot of launches and a lot of tweaking, and when the game has a memory leak that happens on revert... yeeesh. I spend half my time looking at the KSP loading screen, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T07:48:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 07:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
