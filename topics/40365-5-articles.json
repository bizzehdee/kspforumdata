This option begins a reprocessing cycle that takes a few hours to complete and converts 90% of your Depleted Uranium Hexaflouride into fresh and useable Uranium Hexaflouride.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also integrated the antimatter factory into the science lab. The antimatter factory requires huge amounts of power, 5GW (1000x the 5MW that the science lab requires for its other current purposes), but the output you will get from it is enough to compete with all but the best collection locations in the solar system. The antimatter factory is 1% efficient at producing particle/antiparticle pairs so is effectively 0.5% efficient at producing antimatter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also tweaked science such that it takes into account not only what celestial body you orbit but how high your orbit is. You need to orbit the body at less than the body\u0027s radius to get the maximum research value (e.g. \u0026lt;600km for Kerbin) and research scales down fairly slowly above this limit. The science labs don\u0027t have to be in orbit though, you can put them on the surface of a celestial body to get the maximum research value too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience labs are not artificially intelligent and require at least 1 Kerbal in order to function. The lab has a capacity of 2. One Kerbal can reprocess nuclear fuel and run the antimatter factory just fine but if you have only one Kerbal performing research, your research rate will be halved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hdyNMHN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hdyNMHN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The astute will notice that my vessel here is totally pointless!
