I tend to do quite a bit of clipping to make things look nice, but am unsure if I\u0027m unnecessarily making things harder for myself. So question is this: Do intakes and boosters take performance hits from clipping things through them?\n\n![Pt1FmgM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Pt1FmgM.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:48:08Z","Content":"Unless something changed very recently then engines are either completely blocked or not at all. If you can\u0027t get any thrust from an engine then the exhaust is blocked too much. \n\nIntakes work anywhere, no matter how blocked, as long as they are pointed forward."},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T11:00:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Intakes work anywhere, no matter how blocked, as long as they are pointed forward.\n\nThe pointed forward detail depends. At really low airspeeds it doesn\u0027t matter much. I only mention this because it is possible to launch a VTOL Jet-assisted Rocket backwards when all the intakes point forwards."}]}
