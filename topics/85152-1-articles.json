One of it\u0027s requirements is a 4000-word long essay on some research question. I am very interested in aerospace engineering, and think is what I\u0027ll take on as a career, though I\u0027m not sure. The reason is that it combines all the engineerings I like. The space shuttle, for example, was a spaceship, an airplane, had software in it (astronautics, aeronautics, and software); also, future mars bases will require building structures (houses, tunnels, etc) and other vehicles (structural, mechanical, chemical).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that being said, 4000 words (not a single word more, mind you!) isn\u0027t that long for a physics essay, even with the data, labels, equations, titles, etc not counting. Therefore I thought that KSP might be a great way to simulate and carry out orbital maneuvers, ignoring n-body physics of course. I was thinking on how different orbits make for different uses (polar for mapping, geostationary for communications). Another idea is how orbital infrastructure and transportation trajectories will be when we get mining Helium-3 on the moon, that\u0027s a cool idea, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETo everyone: What are your opinions in general and on the topics I mentioned?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf anyone did IB Physics HL: Are these ideas reasonable?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETo anyone knows about these subjects: What would an interesting and useful-to-the-real-world research topic?

The closest real-world topic I can think of that is both marginally relevant to KSP and appropriate for the 11th-grade level (forgive me if your skills are above that level; they probably are if you\u0027re thinking of these kinds of ideas) would be the modeling of solar systems formation, a la some kind of geophysics-based Planet Factory. Run initial protoplanetary disc distributions through an angular momentum and accretion model (or models) and see what stabilities converge (I.e., planets form). Specific post-convergence material distributions would be particularly interesting, I think. You could then conclude by comparing the results to something like the published Kepler distribution findings.

Learn project- and design-based techniques from a solid set of labs. Choose one specialty at the beginning of your junior year that you can stay passionate about and sink your teeth into.

First off, darn it why didn\u0027t I think of this?! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently in my second year of IB and nearing the final stretch for my own EE so figured I\u0027d pop a post. I can\u0027t help with the actual nitty-gritty side of things other than saying that it looks really cool, but if you\u0027ve got any Qs about the EE in general I may be able to help. I\u0027m doing mine in geography rather than physics, but there\u0027s no shortage of orbital mechanics experts here so no big loss. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy key tips for EE (probably all been repeated many times before to you):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Hit the deadlines for your drafts and planning, otherwise everything piles on at the worst possible time. i.e. I\u0027ve got friends who have had to type up an essay from scratch in a weekend - emotional breakdowns have ensued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When you\u0027re writing it up or planning it, keep the criteria and the mark scheme by your side. At the end of the day the EE involves jumping through a series of hoops no matter which way you cut it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pick a topic which interests you. I think you\u0027ve covered this one pretty well, but worth throwing in there anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Add your references as you go. Speaking with experience, backtracking to locate webpages in your browser history and the like is a pain in the rear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a rough-guess, I\u0027d say your initial ideas go well beyond the scope of HL phys. The closest would be the fields and forces topic but that doesn\u0027t really touch upon orbital transfers at all. I do like the sound of some of the research topics that you\u0027ve brought up, and I think they\u0027d be fun to go into. The one catch I\u0027d say is make sure that it will fit as a physics EE. This is a major problem my school has run into with science EEs. Initially people were told that making it experiment-based was very important, but then midway through were told to throw half of their method and data into an appendix. This has scared a ton of us off from doing an EE in science, so I\u0027d urge you to check with your supervisor whether or not they believe a secondary-research, non-experiment-based EE would be effective (a la looking at helium-3 on the moon, etc). You probably know more about what makes a good physics EE than me by this point, but that was an issue that hit some of my mates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope my waffling is at least a tad helpful. Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
