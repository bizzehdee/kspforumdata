Having the tank higher means that the center of mass shifts less as fuel is drained from the tank. Also make sure you use mirror symmetry to attach solid boosters to allow you to move them closer to the center of mass. I used the swivel engines on my smallish shuttle design, and while it didn\u0027t necessarily look like the real thing, the methodology was pretty close to the real shuttle design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-06T17:40:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2016 05:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by NoobTool\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scientia1423","CreatedById":116562,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-06T17:57:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they look like\u00A0shuttle\u00A0and can get to space (idk surround it with a cat-ton of boosters and mammoth engines), then it\u0027s alright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook on scott manley\u0027s video on this subject.
