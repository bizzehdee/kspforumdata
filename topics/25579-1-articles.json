What I\u0027m trying to do, is build my satellite as the top half, with a computer module, while having a Kerbal controlled module in my lower stage. My thought process is to have them decouple from each other, set up the orbit correctly with my satellite, then send the lower stage back to Kerbin, so I don\u0027t have unwanted space junk. However, once I decouple, I can not gain control of my top half at all. This includes using [ or ], or right clicking to control from the computer module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is it that I\u0027m doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help guys \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(P.S.
