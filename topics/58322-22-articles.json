So I wouldn\u0027t bother with that. Spin of the bullet would be torque, really a little too detailed in scope for this game. All projectiles have a timed life, with the potential of thousands of objects in flight at one time, they must time-out or the game performance will take a hit. Therefore the larger the projectile or... the further the potential range, the longer the time-out is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 14\u0022 gun has an in game effective range of about 8.5km give or take. Enough time is given for these to reach that range. Again the range had to be limited as we can\u0027t all run KSP with all objects loaded out to 20\u002Bkm. Also by the aiming method employed it becomes increasingly difficult to aim and hit something beyond that range.
