Here are two questions and I am thankful for some advice:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.\u003Cstrong\u003E When I do a gravity turn, how do I keep my rocket at a heading of 90 degrees? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am trying to get into orbit applying the approach described in this video:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/0pA1y5a5rnk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/0pA1y5a5rnk\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I have, however, is that whenever I initiate my gravity turn by turning 5 to 10 degrees east my rocket does not stay on a 90 degree heading. Typically it moves to a 100 to even 130 degrees requiring a lot of of correction steering. I have tried to add fins, but the problem still exists. Is this normal given the new aerodynamic model or do I get something wrong? In this video the yaw, pitch, roll controls on the bottom left of the UI do not suggest that any corrections are required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. TWR\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn pre 1.0 my rule of thumb was always that a rocket needs a TWR greater 1 to lift off. Since 1.0, however, it seems that rockets with a TWR of 1.3 to 1.5 would not lift off any more. I assume that this is due to the new aerodynamic model, correct? Is this because drag adds further thrust requirements?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks for helping me to better understand the new way of playing KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T09:00:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 09:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tripolith\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T14:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout gravity turn, it depends on your rocket; please post a screenshot so that we can actually see the problem.

In 1.0 they changed the way that the specific impulse of an engine works. In 0.90.0 engines would use more fuel in the lower atmo, because specific impulse decreases with high air pessure. 1.0 corrected that behaviour. Now thrust is reduced in atmospheres. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you see a vacuum TWR of 1.5, your atmospheric TWR could be way lower or (depending on the engine) even blow 1. You can righclick the engines in the parts menu to see more info on this. Some engines perform well in atmospheres, some are totally useless. The aerospike is the only engine that works ell for both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using Kerbal Engineer Redux: It has a button that sais \u0022atmospheric\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the gravity turn: Use stability control by pressing T. Use fins at the bottom of your rocket. They will stabilize you just like the feathers on an arrow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart the turn when you have aquired some vertical speed. I always go for around 100m/s.
