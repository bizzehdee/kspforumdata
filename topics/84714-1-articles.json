It was a waste of money. But that\u0027s another discussion for another time...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, basically, I was thinking, what if you had the space shuttle used for a lunar mission. I am not asking if it would be cost-efficient, or logical to preform, just if it would be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is how I think it would work:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payload bay would have a Lander and extra fuel for the OMS(enough for getting to the Moon and back) as the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle would have a crew of three rather than the usual five, to let the life support last longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtra living space in the cargo bay if there is enough room for it with the lander and fuel, allowing for a crew of four or five\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne problem that I can think of is that the shuttle would probably have to retrofire or areobrake into LEO coming back from the Moon before reentering the Earth\u0027s atmosphere. If i remember correctly, he Apollo capsule had a more robust heatsheild to combat the increased speeds that it was travelling coming straight back from the Moon. I just assume that the shuttle couldn\u0027t stand that kind of heating because that was not what the shuttle was built for. So you can either upgrade the shuttle\u0027s heat shield(which I assume means more weight) OR retrofire/areobrke into LEO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanother problem is that the shuttle has to land specifically at either Edwards or KSC, which would be harder to time right coming back from the Moon\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddragon","CreatedById":66937,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T01:54:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mission scenario you have said was impossible with the shuttle.
