To do that, this hypothetical being of pure evilness could choose to allow players to buy funds with real money (and have the in-game fund earnings at or lower than what one has in early game hard-mode). Or to pay real money for \u0022someone else\u0022 to do rescue missions, to bring back otherwise lost craft. Timewarp might be limited, so that one can only timewarp for a certain amount of time per day, except if one pays. Parts might be unlocked against money instead of doing research, or part unlocks per day could also be limited. There might be super efficient premium-only parts, that one could unlock for a few hours by paying real money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor all of this to work, the game would have to be far more grindy though.
