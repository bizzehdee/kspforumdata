It\u0027s a KSP bug I believe. It\u0027s really bad. What I observed is the first time I fly a particular ship there\u0027s a chance this phantom acceleration will happen. It\u0027s more likely if you have a big save file or on interplanetary orbits... which sucks because a small orbit change throws your intercept way off. I haven\u0027t seen it with small saves, like 5 ships in flight, but it happens frequently with 50. I thought this was related to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E \u0022jump to ship\u0022 so I tried always going back to the Tracking Station and using the green fly button but that still has some chance it will happen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what I did was always watch the AP/ PE when the ship loads and if the phantom acceleration is happening, immediately hit ESC and go to the tracking station. That stops the acceleration. Then use the green fly button to go back to it... then it\u0027s usually normal again. This still sucks because you can\u0027t undo the course change that happened before you jumped to the TS unless you load a savegame and hope it doesn\u0027t happen again... so save often and/ or do lots of correction burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not seen steering locked or camera issues with this personally... just phantom acceleration.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe it has nothing to do with the ship parts or design.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only fix I know of is to dump the stock system and use Principia.
