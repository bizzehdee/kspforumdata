Whenever I try, I either get a forum error\u00A01C205/3 (\u0022Sorry, there is a problem. Please wait X seconds before attempting another search\u0022), or a HTTP error 500. It alternates between the two whenever I reload. The most recent term I noticed this error with is \u0022Coatl\u0022 (I was trying to find the Coatl Probes Plus mod), but there have been others in the past. Usually it only happens for one-word terms; two or more words, inside or outside of quotes, is usually fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else noticed this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-28T00:15:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, Coatl brings me to a white screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ll be mentioning this to the appropriate people.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-28T21:47:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152665-rocketsquid/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022152665\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152665-rocketsquid/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RocketSquid\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0The forum search feature isn\u0027t very good.
