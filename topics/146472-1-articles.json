happening to my chutes. \u00A0I wasn\u0027t deploying them at too high a speed, because I wasn\u0027t deploying them at all. \u00A0They were deployed automatically (and in error) because they were part of an earlier staging FNAR.

That\u0027s kind of what had already happened to you; they \u0022armed\u0022 while still in space, and their \u0022deploy\u0022 pressure was set too low so it happened while you were still too high and going too fast.
