It also starts yawing drastically at certain speeds and parts fly off the vehicle. The parts count does not change though. So, I\u0027ve somehow made a parts popcorn machine! They just starts popping off the ship! The only other thing I can think of is the extra parts are from the 2 parts I have stored in the new storage things.(nvm I did not put those in afterall.) At which point I may have different issues. Either way, I\u0027m assuming this is from the old double parts reference problem or something like it. I\u0027ll do a tear down later to identify the parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut has anyone made a parts popcorn machine before.
