It needs to be able to comfortably complete 2 survey type contracts anywhere and return home. I really like the landing site control VTOLs gave me in .90 so I\u0027m trying to include that to. Atmospheric effects lead mo to believe a cargo/service bay to hold the VTOL jets in flight is an important consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy issue is that the Wheesley engine just doesn\u0027t seem to have the thrust needed for (efficient) VTOL. I\u0027m needing near 5:1 Wheesley to Whiplash ratio to get better than unity vertical TWR and that only allows about 550 units of fuel per Whiplash. Those numbers don\u0027t seem to work for circumnavigation with scenic detours. At least not without making a monster craft that would be better referred to as a blimp. The Whiplash engine looks to have a better TWR, but it won\u0027t fit into a Mk2 cargo bay without clipping out the top and/or bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have design tips for VTOL that I\u0027m overlooking? I remember a 3:2 Wheesley to Whiplash ratio working in .90. Were the Wheesley engines just nerfed that badly? I\u0027m thinking I may be better off using flaps for STOL for my research jet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound my answer: PEBKAC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe designs I was exploring had emptied the nacelle tanks as I was exploring fuel loads or CoM migration. Since I had already found a reliable atmospheric setting for TWR in KER I was using that to judge lift thrust, but since KER doesn\u0027t properly account for jet fuel routing, it thought they had no fuel! Real hard to get good thrust when you forget to run more than half of your engines. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should go sit in the corner now. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T17:20:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 05:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T18:56:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour jet is manned, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply lug an engineer along, and use parachutes for pinpoint safe landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen uncrate your engineer, repack all the chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless the local terrain slope is ludicrous (\u0026gt;30 degrees), you will be able to take-off normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find this to be much more mass and cost effective than lugging engines for true VTOL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it uses a lot less fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, the Wheesley basic jet IS too underpowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder the new rules the jet engines are very much weaker at very low speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T19:18:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJet engines were incredibly powerful in .90; this was so they had enough power to overcome the soup.
