Is the Wheesley too underpowered or is it just me?","CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T17:53:07Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T17:53:07Z","Content":"I am trying to build a \u0022research jet\u0022 for Kerbin. It needs to be able to comfortably complete 2 survey type contracts anywhere and return home. I really like the landing site control VTOLs gave me in .90 so I\u0027m trying to include that to. Atmospheric effects lead mo to believe a cargo/service bay to hold the VTOL jets in flight is an important consideration.\n\nMy issue is that the Wheesley engine just doesn\u0027t seem to have the thrust needed for (efficient) VTOL. I\u0027m needing near 5:1 Wheesley to Whiplash ratio to get better than unity vertical TWR and that only allows about 550 units of fuel per Whiplash. Those numbers don\u0027t seem to work for circumnavigation with scenic detours. At least not without making a monster craft that would be better referred to as a blimp. The Whiplash engine looks to have a better TWR, but it won\u0027t fit into a Mk2 cargo bay without clipping out the top and/or bottom.\n\nAnyone have design tips for VTOL that I\u0027m overlooking? I remember a 3:2 Wheesley to Whiplash ratio working in .90. Were the Wheesley engines just nerfed that badly? I\u0027m thinking I may be better off using flaps for STOL for my research jet.\n\nEdit:\n\nFound my answer: PEBKAC\n\nThe designs I was exploring had emptied the nacelle tanks as I was exploring fuel loads or CoM migration. Since I had already found a reliable atmospheric setting for TWR in KER I was using that to judge lift thrust, but since KER doesn\u0027t properly account for jet fuel routing, it thought they had no fuel! Real hard to get good thrust when you forget to run more than half of your engines. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nI should go sit in the corner now. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T17:20:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 05:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T18:56:23Z","Content":"Your jet is manned, right?\n\nSimply lug an engineer along, and use parachutes for pinpoint safe landings.\n\nThen uncrate your engineer, repack all the chutes.\n\nUnless the local terrain slope is ludicrous (\u003E30 degrees), you will be able to take-off normally.\n\nI find this to be much more mass and cost effective than lugging engines for true VTOL.\n\nAnd it uses a lot less fuel.\n\nAnd yes, the Wheesley basic jet IS too underpowered.\n\nUnder the new rules the jet engines are very much weaker at very low speeds."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T19:18:41Z","Content":"Jet engines were incredibly powerful in .90; this was so they had enough power to overcome the soup. The side effect was it made VTOL kinda trivial. In 1.0, with the soup gone, jets got rebalanced. That makes VTOL hard, although I hasten to point out far from impossible, you just need to build lighter."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T20:11:04Z","Content":"The behavior of *all* jets got *changed* (yes, nerfed, but that\u0027s not the whole story) in 1.0.

Did have done fun with asymmetric lift jet flameouts on an early, overly optimistic build earlier though.\n\nProblem is jet thrust is primarily a function of velocity and altitude. Even with unlimited air, the Wheesley simply does not have much power for its weight especially at the low speed VTOL engines normally run at.\n\nDidn\u0027t even consider chutes for my jet. It would be lighter, but VTOL gives a touch more control and a bit more style. Flaps and airbrakes can handle any stretch of 500 m.\n\nMaybe I should just start looking at rockets and suicide burns for VTOL performance. I was reluctant to try that before because jet VTOL was so forgiving, but I don\u0027t think I can get good VTOL performance in a transcontinental jet."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T09:32:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Problem is jet thrust is primarily a function of velocity and altitude.

They\u0027re trickier to build and fly than a conventional cargobay/Wheesley VTOL, but there\u0027s a huge saving in dead mass. As well as ditching the cargo bay and surplus jets, the VTOL ability also allows you to get away with minimal wing surface."}]}
