I mean, I figured you lot don\u0027t bite. Unless you\u0027re the Space Kraken in disguise. Hmmnn.... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only found out about KSP in the last month or so, and shamelessly since then I\u0027ve been hooked! Many people love the game for the way it presents a challenge whilst still being fun to play; and that\u0027s certainly been true for me. As far as achievements go, being able to land on the Mun and Minmus, being able to achieve various orbits around Kerbin and the two aforementioned moons, and inadvertently sending a Mun mission into Kerbol orbit are my only claims to fame! Interplantery missions, rendezvousing, and some aspects of spaceplanes still baffle me for now, but I\u0027m oping to learn! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bit about me: I\u0027m a normal guy from London, Havering specifically if any of you happen to know the city. As for the badgers, well, I\u0027d imagine that if badgers existed on Kerbin, the Kerbals would\u0027ve sent a fair few into space by now - because what animal could be more useful for observing the effects of space on biology? Besides, who knows, Kerbals may have evolved from badgers....somehow.
