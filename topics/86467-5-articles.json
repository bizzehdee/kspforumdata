Those swept wings no longer have control surfaces that fit on the wing. I\u0027ve seen a lot of neat biplanes and such made with those wings, I\u0027d hate to seem them fall into uselessness. Having multiple styles gives us much more design flexibility so all our planes don\u0027t look identical. I don\u0027t want the old cockpit, or tanks, or even the old modular wings back...

Otherwise, I would say, in my opinion, that the plane doesn\u0027t look all that great to begin with, because of the stock parts before 0.25. The swept wings look okay (and only okay), but the control surfaces and air intakes look horrible. Again, not blaming your design, but what you have to work with. I would think you could make a sleeker, equivalent plane that looks very similar to this one, but with the new parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrew123","CreatedById":46719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T13:07:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESometimes, you can\u0027t focus on catering to the lowest denominator of spaceplane builders if you want to deliver the best experience.
