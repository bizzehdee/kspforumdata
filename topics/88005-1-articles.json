In the case of missions to other bodies in the kerbol system, the date range would often be better launch window times. So when a Duna wind approaches, you get Duna missions. Jool, you get Jool missions, etc. The mission contract will explicitly state that there is an upcoming launch window for a least energy transfer. I wonder if it is possible for it to generate a reasonable date range for return, as well?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s planetary science. It also helps new players see when they are supposed to launch for Duna, Jool, etc. (always better to have in-game education rather than having to look it up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other threads I have suggested that many or most of the \u0022rescue a kerbal\u0022 missions should have the astronaut within a spacecraft (they have to come from \u003Cem\u003Esomeplace\u003C/em\u003E, and they are explicitly not in your space program. I suggested that there be tougher rescue missions, like a guy stranded with his ship on the Mun, for example (looking like the startup screen, lol?). There might be harder ones like rescue a Duna mission that is stranded (lander with a broken leg or something, on its side). In that case, the launch window might be \u0022ASAP,\u0022 and it could tell you that it\u0027s NOT ideal at all, and you better bring a crap-ton of dv with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally (dunno if this can be done now) there would be a good way for mods at least to hook life support to these so that the real time limit would be in play (the guy on Duna has X-hundred day\u0027s LS left...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that you could also possibly have an orbiter associated with some of these missions (not owned by you). So another space program has a large Jool ship in orbit, and have had a nasty failure with their lander. They have no way to return their astronaut, but maybe they had a few lander probes, and the mission says they landed them with supplies for the stranded guy (suspension of disbelief needed for a Jool rescue, IMO, or actually needed if LS is a thing). The mission would be to rescue the guy from whatever moon he is on, and return him to the orbiter already there. Another might be to simply refuel an orbiter that is in whatever planet\u0027s orbit (mission describes a leak that was fixed, but only after they had no fuel to return). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet another rescue mission possibility, to deliver a part. This is some critical, small component (entirely abstracted). These might allow you to send a probe (it might have a tight time limit to repair for a return window) allowing a faster transit, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERescue missions with the game supporting complex limitations could easily be one of the most fun/challenging types of missions.
