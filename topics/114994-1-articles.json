Some of the tutorials say the hatch collider should slightly intersect the part\u0027s physics collider, but I found the opposite to work better. I make it almost touch, but not quite, and I get a clickable hatch, though you kinda have to click it just right (sometimes it doesn\u0027t pick up the click)."},{"CreatedByName":"Ven","CreatedById":109931,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T02:55:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I gave that a try and it works ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Thanks!\n\u003E Also, out of curiosity, do you know how to get the CrewHatch dialogue to ingame?
