And for the Downloading, in the current version of KSP(0.90) I find myself going to 4 or 5 different websites to get them, a couple of these websites are very troublesome and there are a couple mods that I have used in the past that I just are not going to bother DLing. Can\u0027t this be narrowed down to 1-2 websites???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t we all just get along!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T08:28:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll address the narrowing things down: you do not want to do that. Most modders host their stuff on multiple sites just in case one goes down. Limiting the number of sites basically means that if one goes down for whatever reason, the mod is unavailable. As for the number of sites, 5 isn\u0027t really that bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of us do get along. I\u0027m not sure where your complaint is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
