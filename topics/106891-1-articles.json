The chute is slow to fully deploy, or at least slow to reach its fully-deployed effectiveness. In my game (stock 1.0.2 for Windows downloaded from the website, no mods) this just killed Valentina when she slammed into the ground hard on what was an entirely routine and gentle re-entry up until the final 500 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps this is a natural and even intended consequences of the tweaks that were made to chutes in 1.0.1/1.0.2. If so, then at the very least the default altitude for full deployment of the Mk16 Parachute needs to be set higher, perhaps somewhere from 750-1000m.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJK","CreatedById":114951,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:59:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe this is the intended behavior for 1.0.2 - and the most realistic one, in my opinion. Even though i never had any issues with pods slamming into the ground during proper re-entries, i understand your point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that you can change the deployment altitude in the VAB/SPH by right clicking on the chute, or by setting the \u0022deployAltitude\u0022 value in the part .cfg file to whatever you deem to be necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T17:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, you can change it, but OP\u0027s point still stands.

The current default should be giving a safe deployment over the water or at KSC. Any higher landing locations probably require a higher deployment altitude, and generally craft don\u0027t come back to KSC. I have a plugin in my signature that unlocks deployment speeds too, if that\u0027s something you are interested in.
