title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to see smarter fuel management interfaces.\u00A0 Some examples would be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 Sometimes, I just want to empty a fuel tank and fill every other tank up that\u0027s onboard.\u00A0 I shouldn\u0027t need to select a destination tank to pump fuel out of a station tank.\u00A0 It should automatically fill all onboard tanks when I tell it to \u0022fill other tanks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 Tie similar tanks together that are on the same stage automatically, or give me an option to.\u00A0 Sometimes my designs have multiple small monopropellant tanks for a reason, such as center of mass considerations or simply because they look cooler than one massive tank.\u00A0 Filling or emptying\u00A0eight radially mounted\u00A0tanks is tedious and clumsy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0 Give us an option to jettison fuel like you did with ore.\u00A0 I\u0027ve wanted this capability when my Kerbal bound ships are a bit heavy on reentry, and I\u0027m trying to reuse parts.\u00A0 Mostly its because I didn\u0027t pack enough parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.\u00A0 Give us more control on pumping fuel out of a tank.\u00A0 Right now its click and pray you get close to pumping out the right amount.\u00A0 The center of mass could get messed up if you don\u0027t get the precise amount pumped in or out of radially mounted tanks, and that\u0027s not a good way to fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.\u00A0 Perhaps with the specialization of fuel stations, a module could be created to facilitate these capabilities from an interface after you right click on the \u0022fuel manifold control module.\u0022\u00A0 Surface mining operations could benefit from a specialized control module\u00A0as well.\u00A0 You\u0027ve got a science module, why not something for fuel?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.\u00A0 If I do hit alt-right mouse on a couple of tanks and schedule up a fuel transfer, I don\u0027t want the transfer to stop just because I try to do something else, like it does now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7.\u00A0 Split the engineer class into chemical and mechanical engineer sub classes.\u00A0 Chems work with ore mining, fuel conversion, and fuel management.\u00A0 Mechs fix stuff (like solar panels, pause for effect), optimize the mechanical functionality of ore drills, and restore functionality to things that degrade over time on craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T13:40:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are some great suggestions \u003Ca
