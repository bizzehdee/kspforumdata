I once made a lander with which you could cheat. When I tested it on Kerbin, it didn\\\u0027t have enough power to lift off on it\\\u0027s own using the main engines. However, with engines at full \u002B RCS I could get it up. So you could in theory cheat by occasionally applying RCS to maximize the time it takes to clear the tower.
