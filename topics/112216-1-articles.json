When i reach 20km i decide to decouple and ascend with the conventional rocket while the first stage deploys several parachutes for a safe landing (the two ships are manned, so none of them is debris i would swear) but soon one of them (when some distance between them is reached i think), the one im not flying, just vanishes forever. It doesn\u0027t happen while in orbit, i wonder it only happens in suborbital environements(?). \n\nMy question is: is there any way to avoid this? If not, a reusable air breathing first stage is not viable due to bad game developpement :-(\n\nAny suggestion, advices or oppinions about this? \n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T00:47:39Z","Content":"Yeah, physics unload and put anything more than around 22 km from you on rails. And anything on rails below around 22 km is destroyed instantly.\n\nPossible solutions are:\n\n1) Go higher with your reusable stage so you can circularize your main stage and then switch to the reusable portion and land. However, at that point your suborbital trajectory is so far away from KSC that is makes sense to just build an SSTO than can launch the payload and return.\n\n2) Stay with 22 km while the parachutes deploy and land. Good luck with that.\n\n3) I don\u0027t use it at the moment, but another option is the Stage Recovery Mod which will recover any stage that would have been destroyed if it has parachutes."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T06:13:25Z","Content":"A small update to Cybersol\u0027s #2.
