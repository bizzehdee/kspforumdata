I recently started to play this game, and I play in science mod. I need science points, so I put that science thing SC-9001 on my rocket.

If you go to fast on these engines you can hold CTRL to lower the throttle and SHIFT to increase the throttle. On the solid rocket boosters this doesn\u0027t work. All you can do to alter it is to change the thrust limit during construction. Right click the booster during construction and set the thrust limiter to a lower value. Play with this a bit, and don\u0027t set it to low because then you wont have enough thrust to launch or get up to speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestions: \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EAre you getting the red glow effect on your current rocket\u00A0most of the time on your way to space?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EDoes this effect persist for a long period while your engines are still firing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf answers to the above questions are \u0022yes\u0022 you are likely going to fast through the atmosphere.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe idea of a ascent to orbit is to have decent control from launch using engine gimbal or winged control surfaces\u00A0to get to a high enough altitude before accelerating to orbital speeds.\u00A0Generally you want to stay below 1500 meter per second anywhere below 30km altitude for your science container to survive if it isn\u0027t protected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:28px;\u0022\u003ESTEPS:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: Remove Fins near the top.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2: Remove the white rings (cargo bays)\u003Cbr\u003E\n3: Exchange the other fins (4 in the middle and 4 at the bottom) for types that have surfaces (flaps/ailerons) that can navigate your rocket.
