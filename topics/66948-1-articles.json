It is possible that I\u0027m misunderstanding how the currency system will work, but with the introduction of currency, it all of a sudden seems as if reusability of a spacecraft has become a big deal; it seems as if that SSTO spaceplanes will dominate a late career game because instead of immediately recovering the craft after landing, you land the plane, refuel it, and then send it back up into orbit. This decreases the cost of a mission from the cost of an entire craft down to just simply the fuel cost. Now I do not know if recovering a craft means you loose the funds used to build that craft, or if the funds are recovered as well. If the funds are not recovered, then there is suddenly a need to store a craft at either the KSC or the island runway. The island runway immediately comes to mind because of its two large hangars that can fit almost anything, including space planes built with the HL fuselage from B9 Aerospace. But those are only two hangars, and the island runway is not the longest runway ever built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is a feature request: is there any chance that we can get more outdoor hangars similar to the island runway hangars except adjacent to the KSC runway?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also aware that refueling is easier said than done in the stock game, as not everyone is going to be using KAS.

But to use it you have to \u0022build\u0022 one - press a button to spend all the money for all the required parts and add that ship to your built vessel list (or \u0027hanger\u0027). At this point you can \u0022scrap\u0022 a ship and gain some % of the worth back (perhaps some parts are sold at a better return, while others are essentially worthless), or you can launch it. Recovering a ship return it to the list as-is. If something is broken, it remains that way. However you can pay to repair it (you pay the price for all replacement parts) which restores it to its original configuration. Or you can still choose to scrap it, though damaged parts are worth little to nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case a space plane that returns undamaged is simply refueled (which I imagine should cost you something) and can be launched again. Something launched with a ricked would need its entire launch stage rebuilt - and you would need to pay for that - which means \u0022repairing\u0022 a rocket means \u0022build a new launch stage\u0022. I would guess that some parts (such as the claw) would be so expensive that returning and rebuilding the rocket would be far preferable to building an entire new ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be nice if each stage could be repaired separately, and if you could build something in the VAB designated as a \u0022launch stage\u0022 or as a \u0022payload\u0022 that could be built and connected to any of the payloads you have recovered previously. This would probably integrate with sub-assemblies in some way, perhaps where you could \u0022build\u0022 an assembly and then when designing a rocket it would remember what parts are sub-assemblies, then when you \u0022build\u0022 the rocket you could choose to replace the designated sub-assembly with the already built version you own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wahgineer","CreatedById":59292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T15:29:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am not aware of developers sharing any details about how the currency system is going to work yet so it is possible we are all wrong in some aspects....\u003Cp\u003ENobody knows for sure how it is going to work yet so I believe we should not be skipping to conclusions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you been living in a hole?

This would hold true for a plane, an SSTO rocket, or a massive 5 stage rocket that you aborted before even launching. The idea is that anything that doesn\u0027t make it back need to be replaced, be it a lifting stage, a broken control surface, or just the fuel. This makes planes and SSTOs cheaper to run (though I imagine more expensive to build in the first place), but it isn\u0027t due to some special rule - if you crash the plane and recover the ejected capsule it\u0027s no better off than recovering the capsule of a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for fuel I certainly think it should cost you something, and launching a rocket with an empty tank would be cheaper (as well as lighter) than doing it with a full one.
