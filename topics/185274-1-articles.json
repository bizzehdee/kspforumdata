Deployed stuff on Minmus, surrounded Minmus with relays, but every ten minutes it gives me a message that there is no connection. The problem I have is not the connection that might or might not work. The problem is the spamming with the messages. If I do something else, like fly to Duna or catch some innocent asteroid, the spamming doesn\u0027t stop. Time warping for a bit easily gives me around 200 messages. Needs a change so that those \u0022no connection\u0022 messages don\u0027t spam the message thingie.
