Fair enough. I did some missions to get some Kerbucks, upgraded buildings, etc. but noticed that I can still only build ships that weigh a total of 18.0 tons; however the parts I can add increase from 30 to 255.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt just seems strange. I don\u0027t mind it one bit because it makes the game more challenging, but it\u0027s a little annoying in the same breath because you\u0027d think that adding more parts means you\u0027d be able to build heavier ships to take you further distances. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to increase the mass of ships? Or is 18.0 tons the total weight you can build even once the buildings are fully upgraded?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T02:25:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour just got some things mixed up. The 30 to 255 is the total part limit you may have, and is upgraded via the VAB. However to increase the \u003Cem\u003Emass\u003C/em\u003E limit you must upgrade the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skyfire322","CreatedById":132033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T02:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E I did not even know that was upgradable.
