When you start out the game, you know everything about all the planets and moons by checking the map, double-clicking on a planet/moon, and reading the info. You can see the gravity, atmospheric density and height, the works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is that when you start off, you can SEE the planets and moons on the map, but you get no info on them. The gravities, atmospheres etc are randomly generated (Within realistic boundaries based on the size and orbits of the body) when you start a new game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to get this information is to send a probe or a recon team to do some science! Test out how strong the gravity is, how high and how dense the atmosphere is and so on. This way, you can\u0027t start a new game knowing that Duna\u0027s gravity is \u0022this much\u0022 and the atmosphere is \u0022this high\u0022 etc etc and it forces you to first go check it out, and THEN build suitable crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this would change the way many people play the game. You can no longer say \u0022I need a craft for Tylo\u0022 or Duna, or anywhere, because YOUR solar system is different from everyone else\u0027s. Imagine you find out that in your game, Tylo has a gravity of 0.4 and an atmosphere, but Duna has NO atmosphere, and a G factor of 1.1. Surprises all around for everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would also make design become oriented towards different things such as gravities and atmospheres, and less on the planets and moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else think this would be fun to explore a whole new unknown solar system?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T03:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is something the devs have said they are not interested in implementing, they want the same solar system with the same planets for all players.

As in everyone having planets that look completely different and are in quantities and relations to each other that are different from other players. This approach would keep the identities of Duna, Jool, Tylo, etc. but change a few of the specifics so that not every save is identical to the previous one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread made me think about discovery and the unknown and that\u0027s put me in the camp of pro-procedural generation. After playing so long, this game has just become far too predictable. It used to be fresh and exciting to venture out there, but now it\u0027s just same-old-same-old. The elements of the game that are still dynamic remain fun though. Parts can be fitted together to create infinitely different designs, so that remains fun. Contracts are fun because they also have a lot of combinations. I think (semi-) procedural system would be a great thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine starting a new safe, going to the map view and seeing a whole lot of orbits beyond or interspersed between the orbits of the standard planets. You can select them and get some basic info, but the specifics are missing and the planet texture is very blurry. So you send up a telescope to take some better pictures. It improves the quality a bit and you see that the rocky planet has a massive landform at its center. But what is it. You build a probe and send it out there. Once you get there you realize the landform is a giant crater with a solitary peak in its middle. Your probe is out of fuel so you can\u0027t investigate it further. So you outfit a manned expedition and send a lander to the peak. On the peak you find a solitary Munolith.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently in KSP, such a thing would only be possible once. Either you do it yourself or you have the experience spoiled by a Reddit post. With a procedural system you could have such moments time and time again. Awesome moments couldn\u0027t be spoiled (since there would be infinite combinations) and if someone wants to see it for themselves, people could just get the seed number and put that in a box when creating a new save. KSP would not lose any of its cohesion. A good comparison is Minecraft. That has procedurally generated worlds, but those worlds have elements that are recognizable for everyone. Desert temples, villages, etc. are all recognizable even though they\u0027re in different places for everyone. Biomes have certain looks and are instantly recognizable and have rules that transcend the procedural nature of every save (grasslands don\u0027t have trees, jungles have ocelots in them, etc.) KSP is Minecraft where there\u0027s only one level. Its an immense level, but you always start in the same place and nothing ever looks different. Minecraft would still be cool without procedural levels, but the variation allows it to transcend cool and step into awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erecognizable situations\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JayCheetah","CreatedById":81229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T22:49:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat is something the devs have said they are not interested in implementing, they want the same solar system with the same planets for all players.
