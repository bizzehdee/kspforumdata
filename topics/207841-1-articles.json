I\u0027m using the 1.4.5 version of the large boats mod and it works fine in 1.11, but how do i edit their hit points? I also want to add the hull breech module to all of the LBP so that they can sink but again, I\u0027m not the best at configs so am not quite sure how? Is there a way i could use Module manager to apply it to every part from large boats, but not everything else? And for the hit points, is there a way i could make it different for different parts, i.e. carriers get 40K points, medium parts get 20K etc. Sorry i know this is probably a bit much but is there also a way to make the joints between the parts stronger, because right now parts just snap off randomly and whenever i use vesal mover.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the help (Mods i hope this is in the right place but please move it if im wrong)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
