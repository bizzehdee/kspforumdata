When doing this in 0.90 and trying to reattach the duplicate stack, something borks and fuses the stack to the ship in what I\u0027m guessing is a now broken nodal part structure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T07:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm.

It appears that using undo at all is extremely likely to put the game in a state where the craft cannot be launched and parts that are added or removed do not appear properly. In addition, exiting the VAB/SPH in this state is impossible, though saving your corrupted craft is possible. Loading the corrupted craft then replicates the broken game state.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
