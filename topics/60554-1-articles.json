However I wanted to sort of bring them all together, along with another part I created for my own use that I call the \u0022FloatNode\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to have a single part mounting plate, on which patterns of attachment nodes can procedurally be created (typically to hold engines). A bottom stack node is then procedurally relocated up or down depending on the size of what is connected to the plate, and when something (typically the previous stage) is connected to it a fairing is procedurally created to enclose everything that is attached to the plate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have started work, and so far have a part that is the plate, on which you can arrange patterns of nodes, and also relocate the \u0022floating\u0022 node based on what you attach to it.

FAR uses node size to calculate drag, which means it\u0027s important to get it close to right. That is, if your part is 5m across, you don\u0027t want it to have four size-0 nodes; you want it to have four size-2 nodes. Thus you should calculate how wide your part is, how many nodes you\u0027ve placed (and thus how large a radius around each node is its own space), and thus what size to make the nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you would then also add support for a cfg-tunable scalar for node size, that would be great for RO (since in RO\u0027s case the example for size-2 nodes would be a 4m part with room for four size-2 nodes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, StretchySRB might be a good place to nick code from. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T19:15:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Andersenman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Andersenman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi,\u003Cp\u003EI find this mod very promising, but I would also like to raise a thought: Would it be possible to include the functionality of this new part into the existing parts themselves?
