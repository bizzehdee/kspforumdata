To work properly, the compilation project needs to access the source, but I don\u0027t want to have to worry about manually copying files back and forth as I make changes.\u00A0The natural solution is a symbolic link from the compilation project to the real file in Kopernicus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first this worked fine, but at some point something unknown to me changed, and now when I compile the shader, Unity\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0replaces my symbolic link with a regular file copy of the shader source.

Alternately, can I compile shaders for Unity without using the Unity Editor (a very attractive option since it also seems to consume 100% CPU when idle)?
