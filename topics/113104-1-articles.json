Tylo\u0027s surface gravity is 7.85 m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. If you need to know if you have enough propellant to reach orbit, compute your ship\u0027s delta-v. Low Tylo orbit requires about 2300 m/s. You can just use your engines\u0027 listed vacuum values for thrust and Isp."},{"CreatedByName":"Kuroki","CreatedById":146494,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T03:09:47Z","Content":"The very low-tech option is to put just enough SRBs on your lander to reach an apoapsis of about 15km on Kerbin and launch vertically.\n\nOnce your vertical velocity zeroes out at AP stage your lander normally.
