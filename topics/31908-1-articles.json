I\u0027ll try to go to a meadow further from city lights tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW that telescope photo is... Mother of God. It looks like some tiny crab like-insect under a microscope xD Radiators are legs, Soyuz is an eye, solar panels are antennae, the truss is the skeleton/backbone/carapace, the pressurised modules are the mouth, and the Shuttle is.. well...

Some small satellites would be so small to be less than a pixel wide from the ground, but some big stations would be more visible. The brightness would change according to the sun exposure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have always wanted to see how my ships look from different perspective. It\u0027s so bad that we don\u0027t even have ground launch tracking cameras or such like those shots we see on TV. Well yes there are remote cameras in Lazor mod but it\u0027s very buggy and I don\u0027t like it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
