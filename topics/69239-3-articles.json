Failure rate is low enough to be the safest production method, waste, although really nasty, is small volumes and ocncentrated, so not much of a problem. Also, fast neutron reactors can turn most of that waste into fuel, solving the problem while providing more energy, a double win. We seriously need to invest big money on fast neutron and breeder reactors, especially the low pressure ones as they are safer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously reducing our meat consumption would have a huge effect. First of all, much less methane emissions and much less grain to move around. But more importantly, we would have so much food, a significant amount of farmland would be abandoned, turning into forests, which are a great carbon sink.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have to bulldoze suburbs. They are a huge waste of land, and they have absurd energy requirements. Move as much people to high density dwellings, keeping only farmers and related people in rural areas. With all the reclaimed land around the cities, you can either make farmland and save on transport, or carbon sinks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReducing population makes everything simpler, but euthanasia is pretty much the worst way to do it (just after war, starvation and epidemics, which often go together). Birth rates in cities are much lower than in rural areas, which is why experts predict the population will stabilize at some point. To make the process faster, and even decrease global population, the most efficient way is to give incentives to people not to have kids. Educating women and plain bribery (in money, social status or whatever) seem to be the most efficient ways to achieve this. The problem is our economies need to replace workers to keep growth running and paying for investments plus retirements, and shrinking populations are a scarecrow for most economies, so no one will do that unless facing sure and quick doom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, we will need to get carbon out of the air. Nature will take care of it, but on time scales too long for humans. The easiest way is to turn large amounts of biomass to coal and burying it, essentially reversing what we\u0027ve been doing for the past 200 years. Turning biomass (for example weeds, wood or seaweeds) into coal \u0022just\u0022 requires heat, massive amounts of it. Solar thermal is a good way to address this, but nuclear is also an option. Then you would need to bury it, I propose using the massive holes we\u0027ve dug out to find coal in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T15:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Epoint is that is part of earth\u0027s formation. a very violent, all be it natural event. you still cant compare that to events caused by climate change through biological/artificial means.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ewas\u003C/span\u003E formed.

Plants will still make food and make O2/remove CO2, animals will still be around, soil biota will still recycle nutrients... humanity will survive. We\u0027re not talking something on the scale of the K-T mass extinction (and honestly I\u0027d give humans decent odds of surviving even that... we\u0027re a lot smarter than dinosaurs and have very adaptable food requirements).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, thanks for pointing out the worst case scenario who is not pleasant as you say and will have massive impact, the following wars will however kill more people. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes some humans will survive an K-T event.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T12:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow would geopolitics adjust to that would be another matter entirely.
