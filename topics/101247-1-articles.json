The other tech trees support my mods, but they choose part placement instead of the mod author. Just curious what others are using (and why).\n\nI left off mods like SETI Balance and Better Than Starting Manned since they alter more than just the tech tree.

I have had to move almost EVERY MOD part; I use v24 (no DLLs only parts) to move them all LOL then port the TREE into v90; I am probly the only person doing it; and even still it takes me a few days).\n\nCmdr Zeta"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T15:56:51Z","Content":"CTT here, though to be fair, I haven\u0027t tried AIDOS or a more mod oriented tech tree like I\u0027ve heard KSP interstellar has.
