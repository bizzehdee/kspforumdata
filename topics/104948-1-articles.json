There will be a selection of aircraft that I provide a photo of and a brief description. The players are tasked with recreating each aircraft in KSP as closely as possible and then attempting to get each design to fly. They may attempt as many designs replicas as they want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need a points system for this. I\u0027m not sure how to rate how closely each entry is to the intended original design. Maybe a poll of 1-10 of some sort and open the poll to every other entrant and then take the percentages and apply a point value based on the percentages?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about a points system for flight? Did it fly? How \u0022well\u0022 did it fly? That sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile these designs were not intended for spaceflight, I\u0027d like to award points for pushing the envelope of each design and actually achieving space flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny and all suggestions are greatly appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"builder396","CreatedById":128449,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:26:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI actually have a whole truckload of such designs that are based of WWII designs, including the Fi 156, He 177, Bf 110, Do 217, E13A1 and H6K4. Obviously all are still beta planes, so ill probably rebuild them from scratch and then submit them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
