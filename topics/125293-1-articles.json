I don\u0027t have it on steam, I downloaded the KSP Installer. Since 1.0 it has been updating and downloading patches just fine. But in the \u0027News\u0027 feed it says 1.0.5 is released and in the launcher it says the game is up-to-date. But when I open the game via the launcher, the game is still in the latest release of 1.0.4. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf needed I\u0027m using Windows 10.

Will you give me a Steam Key?\u003Cp\u003EIn general no. The option to transfer KSP Store licenses to Steam is only available for those who bought KSP before it originally came out on Steam, March 20th 2013. Note that if you do qualify for a transfer and choose to do it, the process is OPTIONAL and IRREVERSIBLE. If you transfer your purchase to Steam, you will no longer be able to download or update the game from the KSP Store. To move to Steam, log in to your KSP Store profile and you will find the button to start the process next to your download link.
