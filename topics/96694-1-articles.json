I vaguely remember it but I have no idea how to search for it because I don\u0027t recall what the topic was called.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason you get diminishing returns is then fuel/mass fraction of the fuel tanks. The rocket equation is basically a convoluted way of saying \u0022multiply your fuel mass fraction with some constants\u0022, therefore this figure is critically important. Stock fuel tanks carry 8 tons of propellant for every 1 ton of dry mass. Therefore, even with a massless engine and zero payload, the maximum dV per stage can never exceed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV = 9.82 * 370 * ln(9/1) = 7983.396 m/s (Using 370 Isp because that is a number found on many launch engines.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, in other words:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7983,396 / 370 = \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E21.5767 times your Isp\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimplified, even with an infinite number of fuel tanks containing the entire mass of the observable universe, you are not going to realistically get more than 21.5 times your Isp out of a single stage. Period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the closer you get to this ideal mass fraction, the harder it is to further improve it by adding more fuel tanks, and therefore: diminishing returns. Getting even 20 times Isp is insane - just try it ingame! Most rocket stages end up around or slightly below 10 times Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, at the lower end, there are also diminishing returns: having hundreds of stages is inefficient because the added weight of decouplers and engines (engines in KSP are insanely heavy for what they do!) outstrips the efficiency gains from running with very low dV per stage. Thus, there is an efficiency curve for a given tank fuel/mass fraction, a given engine Isp and a given dry mass penalty per stage, which starts low and ends low, but has a peak at a certain dV value. This is the optimal dV value that each stage should have to construct the optimal launch vehicle with these parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it gets more complicated than that, because in practical application, the dry mass penalty is going to be different for each stage, and you may be unable to hit the dV number exactly because you can\u0027t hit your TWR targets otherwise, and your rocket may end up with different dV numbers for each stage due to imprecision (and oversized upper stages tend to \u0027choke\u0027 stages below them), and so on and so forth.

I arrived at these numbers using a computer simulation. I kept changing and tweaking the numbers until I couldn\u0027t improve the rocket performance any further. I figured at that point I had pretty much hit on the optimum design. When I tried out my theoretical design in the game, it performed exactly like the simulations. Here are my basic rules of thumb:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 1 TWR = 1.65\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 2 TWR = 1.30\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERatio of Stage 2 thrust to Stage 1 thrust = 0.35\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it\u0027s not always possible to hit those numbers exactly, but I just try to get as close as possible.

I usually start my turn at an altitude of 5000 m. I then turn gradually while keeping the nose of my rocket within a few degrees of the prograde marker on the NAVball. I accelerate up to about 2300 m/s at an altitude of about 50 km, with my rocket horizontal at that point. I cut the engine once my apoapsis reaches my intended altitude (it\u0027s actually necessary to overshoot the target altitude a bit because drag will lower the apoapsis by the time I get there). I typically require a 50-100 m/s burn at apoapsis to circularize the orbit.
