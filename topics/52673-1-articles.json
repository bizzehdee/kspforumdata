What I would like is a way to enable and disable mods easily. Sins of a Solar Empire has a specific mods folder where you just edit a .txt file to choose which mods you want before launching (this is just a use example that I can think of as I don\u0027t mod games frequently, and NOT plugging another game). I\u0027m sure there are many ways it can be done. Now, this may be really stretching it, but I had an idea where, when you launched a new game, you could select which mods you wanted enabled. That way you could have a completely vanilla KSP save going and one with piles of fancy mods, depending on what kind of mood you were in. I know there are some mods that people may want incorporated into the whole game/current saves, so perhaps there could be a separate folder or way to install those mods so they would appear no matter what.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just want to know whether this is possible, as it would make KSP much more mod-friendly in my opinion.

If you don\u0027t want certain folders linked (as suggested by Eric S) either remove the line, or simply delete the link after it\u0027s been created. If you want to link the Saves then simply add that line in (I\u0027m sure you can figure it out!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I\u0027m not entirely sure whether the Extras folder exists in the stock game or if it was added by a mod I installed!
