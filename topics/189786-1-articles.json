There are designs with plenty of wing, and designs with very little wing. Your ascent profile depends strongly on which philosophy you follow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it sounds like you are climbing too fast. It\u0027s best if the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E stays in front of you always. If you get too high while you are still too slow, then you will start to fall back down into denser air again -- usually that will really kill your rocket performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI go for the big wing philosophy myself. Which leads to an ascent like this: after launch, only use the F key to adjust pitch. Climb at a little over 10 m/s until 5km altitude, at low thrust and less than 5 degree pitch. Go to full thrust, break mach 1, climb 1km for each 100 m/s of speed, at 14km start bringing the nose down to allow a mostly horizontal speed run in airbreathing mode. As the jets approach max speed, allow the nose to rise. At just past peak\u00A0speed, activate the rockets. Allow the nose to rise naturally and the jets to flame out. Then the key is to keep just enough pitch on the nose to climb while still increasing your speed. Then all you need to do is climb fast enough to avoid overheating and melting. Above 40km altitude, lock to prograde and finish the climb to orbit. This whole process can easily take over 15 minutes of flying time, but will get big payloads to orbit with very efficient fuel usage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe small wing philosophy is totally different. It goes something like: raise your pitch to 45 degrees, go to full thrust, and coast then circularize when your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E gets above 70km. This takes much more in the way of engines, and is therefore not so good for payload fraction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-14T17:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: But I though F is \u0022Invert \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E state?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-14T19:43:41Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2019 07:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Jestersage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-14T20:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth rockets and spaceplanes reach a point in their ascent at which they\u0027re travelling close to to horizontally while building up to orbital speed. The difference is that rockets go mostly up to get there and then tilt over while planes gradually climb over a distance, then start to lose lift and thrust due to thinner air, and have to switch to rocket propulsion and try to achieve orbital speed starting from lower in the atmosphere. That\u0027s why planes are so much harder. They need enough wing to get lift early in the flight and thrust isn\u0027t terribly important, and then later in the flight wings just add drag and weight and you need to power through with thrust. Flight profiles for rockets are all pretty much the same, while those of planes will vary according to the plane\u0027s relative values of lift, mass,\u00A0drag, and thrust. I don\u0027t think there is one right method for planes, but the rule is to get as high and as fast as you can on jets and wings, and when those start to become ineffective, switch to rockets before you lose speed. My design process was to build a rocket which could reach orbit starting from around 30,000m and then add enough wing to get it up there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-15T00:17:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223705149\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189786\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221573753191\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165777\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jestersage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Jestersage said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: But I though F is \u0022Invert \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E state?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you launch a spaceplane, you always turn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on first -- unless you want to fly it with a joystick (which is usually annoying).

May have to test out a bit more before I can push it: During one run I have 400 m/s left in 80k orbit, but not good enough for a rendezvous with a spacestation at 125k with an orange tank as cargo. So right now, I am trying to have a consistence profile that other people can use too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-19T10:31:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223707039\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189786\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221574122798\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165777\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jestersage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Jestersage said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo right now, I am trying to have a consistence profile that other people can use too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst find one that works for you \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFor most of stage-4 and beyond in my listing, I\u0027m again looking at acceleration.

Take your time, perhaps turn off heat so that you can go forever without blowing up. Maybe also infinite propellant so that your pane no longer loses mass as it burns fuel. Just maintain 20km and wait until airspeed settles down, then climb very very slowly and see how things change with altitude.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022atmosphere autopilot\u0022 mod is great for experiments like these.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
