Fortunately, even if you send multiple ships on the same transfer window, with their ejection burns staggered by a few minutes, by the time they arrive at Jool they will probably be staggered by hours/days already. It\u0027s very rare that two ships that leave within a few minutes of each other will also arrive within a few minutes of each other. So you should be fine. In the case of one vessel that will split into multiple vessels (such as multiple probes traveling together, or a multi-part ship), have it aerobrake as one thing before splitting up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T11:13:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepending on your mission profile, you could also do your main aerobrake with your probes connected, and then detach them later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI *just* uploaded a video (well, it was like 2 days ago) of me doing something similar (No aerobraking, but I got a lucky pair of encounters that got me in orbit anyway) in my YouTube Series, and it worked great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVAIMtwZ5r4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T14:59:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have all three ships right next to each other on almost exactly the same trajectory so that there is no significant drift, then they might be able to aerobrake together. If they are all pointing the same way and have SAS on, and are all the same design, then they will drift the same way and should stay together. Very tiny differences can pull them apart however. But even if they drift outside the physics range during aerobrake, they can still have aerobraked successfully. If your active ship gets through the whole aerobrake but the others drift beyond 2.5km, they will stop aerobraking and fly on their last trajectory on rails out of the atmosphere. If they got enough slowing, they\u0027ll stay within the Jool system and you can take them back down a second time. If they all left 2.5km at a slightly different time, they will come down at different times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt shouldn\u0027t be that difficult to aerobrake multiple ships together if you\u0027re careful and thoughtful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-25T15:02:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2013 03:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cashen","CreatedById":71281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T17:53:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust another quick addition. Because Jool\u0027s sphere of influence is so large, you can make tiny tiny correction maneuvers far away from the planet to force your ships to stagger their aerobraking quite easily. I always prefer to aerobrake ships individually, because if you fail to be captured on the first pass it means expending fuel to get captured, and that can be bad if your mission is limited by fuel (this was part of why my Gilly probe failed, because I had to burn fuel to be captured when the aerobraking failed because the two probes were passing Eve periapsis within a minute of each other).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dogface","CreatedById":75396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T20:29:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eedit -\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-26T13:20:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2013 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dogface\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lantay77","CreatedById":94971,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T20:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone, I think I can stagger my ships enough so that they arrive with enough time apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T21:00:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dogface\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dogface\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have a used stage (with a command pod) that I left in a Kerbin orbit of 53x310.
