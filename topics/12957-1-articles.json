Furthermore, if it builds up while you\\\u0027re steering, when you resume vertical flight you\\\u0027ll need to shed the additional momentum as well as resume counter-acting gravity, which would require throttling up from what had been an adequate setting for a slow descent before you built up the vertical momentum.
