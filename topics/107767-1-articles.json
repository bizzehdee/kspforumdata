(it only has 4 nukes and a poodle for engines, mainly for circularizing your orbit and de orbiting) \n\nCarries 62530 liquid fuel (designed with nuclear engines in mind) and 51,494 Oxidizer to where ever you need it in the kerbin system, and yes it does come with an orbital rocket no hyper edits here. \n\n**Cost:** 2,240,280 \n\n**Part count:** (with rocket) 604\n\n**part count:** (just the station) 304\n\n**Weight:** (on launch) 5137 Tons\n\n**Flight instructions:** \n\nYou can start your orbital maneuver from launch with this rocket and it has more than enough delta V to get you into orbit no matter how badly you do getting there so flight instructions are not really needed, stage as needed and yada yada. \n\n**Download link:** \n\n[**http://www./download/kk99ns5owowc4xm/Roflcopterkklols\u002BRefueling\u002Bstation\u002Bwith\u002Brocket.craft**](http://www./download/kk99ns5owowc4xm/Roflcopterkklols\u002BRefueling\u002Bstation\u002Bwith\u002Brocket.craft)\n\n![jevsQNl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jevsQNl.jpg)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![sq6PBSO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sq6PBSO.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E I love staging this rocket, so much violence \n\u003E \n\u003E ![s4q2gPi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/s4q2gPi.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![lYKCfyf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lYKCfyf.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Put descending node below 70km to avoid adding debris through your system\n\u003E \n\u003E ![7HybLX0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7HybLX0.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Vo4QPPr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Vo4QPPr.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Circularise orbit with nukes and poodle \n\u003E \n\u003E ![4nu3J4C.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4nu3J4C.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T00:00:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 12:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Roflcopterkklol**"}]}
