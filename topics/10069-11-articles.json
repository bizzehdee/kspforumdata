Undeterred, Malbert set out on foot to scale at least the minor peak he had been approaching. Some 30 minutes later, he stood atop the westernmost of the mountain\u0027s peaks. Because it\u0027s been part of failed launches as a Trans-Oceanic Lauch Abort Sightseeing location, he chose to name the mountain Mount Tolas. The westernmost peak was named Malbert\u0027s Peak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStanding atop Malbert\u0027s Peak, looking back at the rover and plane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RVSvj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RVSvj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe view from the plane looking towards Mount Tolas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UTHwO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UTHwO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverhead view of Mount Tolas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kzngk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kzngk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital view for lat/long:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3G3RZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223G3RZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EName:Malbert\u0027s Peak (small feature) on Mount Tolas (may require poll)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELatitude: 00 deg. 31\u0027 36\u0022 N\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELongitude: 33 deg. 29\u0027 12\u0022 W\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAltitude: 1809 m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECelestial body: Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-05T19:46:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2012 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by khyron42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Romfarer","CreatedById":20387,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T22:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy plugin got a Kerbin Positioning System which allows you to mark locations on the map.
