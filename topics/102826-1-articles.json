I am talking about a full on payload, whether it be an entire spacecraft inside the SSTO or the heavy fuel. Actually, I mostly just want to see a fuel SSTO. I know it has been done before, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be common, and I can\u0027t exactly pull it off myself, not well at least. Only recently have I been able to develop capable Mun Orbiting and back SSTOs, but I need inspiration and innovation. And celebration. Show me an SSTO that you have built that can carry a Rockomax orange tank at the smallest (the 36 tonne one), or if you want, you can go bigger and bring the daddy of all fuel tanks - the large kerbodyne one; yes, the 82 tonne Kerbodyne S3-14400. Now, I am not going to give any real scoring system since this is meant more for fun and proof of concept, and I would like to see all those who are capable with their own designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESo, what\u0027s the catch?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAaah, but of course. I am sure you were expecting rules, as you would be a fool not to expect rules with a challenge. To make it as simple as possible, there\u0027s a few things I want to happen, and a few things I don\u0027t: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ERules\u0026gt;\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I suppose airhogging to a small extent is \u003Cem\u003Eokay\u003C/em\u003E, but please, don\u0027t go too crazy with that. I don\u0027t want extremely unreal designs with fifty million air intakes per engine. Okay, that is obviously an over-exaggeration, but you get what I mean. Try to be at least semi-legit and semi-realistic as possible, as far as Kerbal Space Programme goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) This rule isn\u0027t quite as strict, but if it is possible for you to abide with, I would love to see this accomplished as well: If it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E possible, try to keep your SSTO at or under 425 parts, not counting the fuel tank which your SSTO is delivering. I am going to ask you for your .craft file for testing myself and I would prefer not sacrificing my pc to a laggy KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) As stated above, if you can, provide your .craft file. If not, that is fine, but if I don\u0027t find your craft legit I am going to insist you provide me proof that I myself can try. You should obviously provide pictures as well as the info displayed when you have it finished in the SPH or VAB (I want to see weight and part count especially). You may also provide a video of your craft in action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Keep it within a legit gameplay environment: No cheats, which means no infinite fuel, Infinite RCS, unbreakable invincible craft, etc etc. No exploitation of glitches or bugs of any kind. Yes, this includes infiniglide. If it obviously exploits the infiniglide, I don\u0027t want to see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Keep it stock. No mods. Although, I suppose the exceptions are Mech Jeb and Flight Engineer. FAR is also allowed, but I personally don\u0027t play with FAR (Though I do have the mod stored in a separate folder in case I want to mess around with it more). But if your craft design uses FAR, then by all means throw your craft at me. I\u0027ll welcome that, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) No clipping whatsoever. Cubic Octagonal Struts are okay, but no clipping. If a wing is ghosting through an air intake, that\u0027s fine, since it\u0027s not deemed a strategic clipping, but I don\u0027t want to see RAM air intakes stacked against one another. It looks ugly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) I want to see the SSTO take off from the runway (or launch pad if you prefer) and going into orbit. No hyper edit (no mods as stated above except for the following ones which are allowed), and no save file editing. That totally defeats the purpose of a cargo SSTO and the challenge. If you are doing that then why even bother with the challenge?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) This should be an SSTO, so obviously no staging. I would refrain from using the Launch clamps, but they aren\u0027t particularly restricted, however, but you really shouldn\u0027t need them if you design the SSTO well enough. I don\u0027t think I need to spell out what single stage to orbit means.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) You are allowed to use any parts you desire, but I \u003Cem\u003Estrongly \u003C/em\u003Erecommend using airbreathing engines combined with closed cycle propulsion, which is obviously what you should be doing. I have seen people launch SSTO rockets before and it\u0027s possible in KSP, but I don\u0027t want to see those. After all, we all want fuel efficiency, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) This craft must be able to go into orbit, as stated above, and must also be capable of going back into Kerbin and landing safely all in one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) The fuel tank MUST be dockable to a space station on it\u0027s own, so give it a docking port (also a must) and it\u0027s own RCS fuel and thrusters and unmanned probe control capabilities. It does not have to be docked to a station in this challenge, but you must provide proof that it can be entirely controlled on it\u0027s own and docking capable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12) You don\u0027t have to dock it to a station, as stated already, but you should relieve your SSTO of the payload in orbit. Additionally, if you feel like you can, show me that your craft can return to Kerbin from orbit both with and without the cargo payload (this rule you can do either way). I want to know that it is flyable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13) Do not use any of the fuel from the tank you are delivering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14) Have I already mentioned that the craft needs to return back to the surface of Kerbin safely and all in once piece? Make sure of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15)Be fair and be creative; don\u0027t steal somebody else\u0027s design. It\u0027s mostly okay if you base your plane off of somebody else\u0027s design. There\u0027s no point in participating in the challenge if you don\u0027t use your own design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESo, what are the next steps to this challenge and what will you be doing?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to see your spaceplane/SSTO carry at the minimum as Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel tank, but you can also carry larger fuel tanks, and as many as you feel your craft can carry, but no smaller than the orange tank, and the larger the cargo, the better. If you use FAR, be sure to let me know in your post. The main challenge is to get into LKO or higher, BUT, as an additional bonus to the challenge, while you are not obliged to do these, I recommend giving these a try if they are possible at all:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EBonus Challenge Challenges\u003C/span\u003E\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Try to get your delivery to orbit around the Mun and get the SSTO safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Try it with Minmus, although that\u0027s not too much harder than the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) This is a bit extreme, but I feel it is possible. Try to deliver the payload in another planet\u0027s or moon\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I highly recommend making it a spaceplane, utilizing the SPH and runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDo you think you are up to the challenge?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s possible, but I want to see just how capable players are of doing this. It\u0027s a proof of concept anyway, but I also want it to be fun, so, show me what you\u0027ve got. Somehow I feel this kind of challenge has been done before, but I am being a little lazy to do any research on this topic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-28T03:37:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2015 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Der Anfang\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
