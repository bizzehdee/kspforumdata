The first extra-Kerbestrial trip is an exciting one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I decided I\u0027m going to venture out further than I have previously, and Do More Interesting Things. I hardly ever visit anywhere further than Minmus, and if I do I send 1 launch and follow it religiously. I\u0027m terrible at multitasking flights, so I downloaded Kerbal alarm clock to give me some computerised help and set about designing some rockets. I decided before sending poor Kerbals to their doom in some hell (mo)hole I\u0027d send a trio of probes to a planet - a satellite capable of changing from equatorial to polar orbit and transferring to a moon, a stationary probe lander to surveil the territory and the reeentry sequence of the planet, and finally a rover to blast around the planet/moon. To make things interesting I decided that each launch must contain all 3 probes - this minimises the number of flights my tiny little mind has to keep track of. Today I finished and tested what I have designated the Semi-Local Probe Launch System - it was designed with enough dV to transfer to Duna, Eve, Dres or Moho, although from the dV map I\u0027ve seen, a Moho landing may be pushing the capabilities of my landers slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a shot from early testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mI9Fqysl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mI9Fqysl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl is slightly problematic, so a Mk 1.1 variant was tested earlier using a 5m bottom stage, enlarged aerodynamic surfaces, more reaction wheels and no SRBs. Gimbal range for the 5m stage was reduced to 0.05. This stops the engine overtaking the nose during the gravity turn and reduces instances of rapid unplanned disassembly. Pictures of this and of the probes themselves will probably be in the mission reports section for anyone interested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing deadly reentry and FAR complicates matters slightly, so everything that goes up is faired, and everything that goes down again is heat-shielded, faired, has air-brakes for some semblance of atmospheric control, drogue chutes, main chutes and a reserve chute. Total stage count right now is 24, although only the first 5 are to get the thing interplanetary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T23:13:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe space program is on light duty until the Minmus Kethane mission arrives at its destination (and until the last two semi-synchronous Mun satellites are aligned).
