Piloting, etc, is\u00A0\u0022interacting with the game,\u0022 but DOES take game time (sometimes 1:1, often times heavily warped). There is a button to warp to dawn right now, it would be trivial to have it warp 6 days (there would be 71 such 6 day weeks per Kerbin year), or 71 days (6 \u0022months\u0022 like this per year), or whatever.
