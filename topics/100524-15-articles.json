Q was around 24 kPa at that point. Ultimately I got the plane to fly by throttling back to 2/3 before attempting to pitch up, then throttling back up after I pitched up. I think the design would benefit greatly from canards; wound up lighting the rockets at 19,500 because it was getting close to not being able to climb any further and I was getting temperature warnings in the yellow - made orbit with fuel to spare as it turned out, though. I worry about what will happen when it comes time to bring that plane back down, though...might be nose heavy (i.e. a lawn dart) with the way I set things up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T16:17:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI normally set my control surface mass tweakables to be the same as the wing they\u0027re mounted on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T16:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI generally do the same; I\u0027ve been setting the main wing/elevators/flaps/spoilers/ailerons to 0.5, canards to 0.4 (when I use them) and the fin/rudder to 0.3.

It lets you visualize what the pressure field around the craft will be, which determines not just the center of lift but also the center of drag (and some other things). The center of lift is where the lift would be if you had a point mass with the same parameters (just like the center of mass is for inertia). So it\u0027s more informative than the CoL marker, but also more advanced, and thus if you could build planes that worked before it\u0027s probably easiest to just test a few and see how performance varies with different coefficient of pressure curves to get an intuitive understanding.
