As for the reason a bad RAM stick didn\u0027t make my computer fail to boot? Apparently the triple-channel memory controller integrated into the i7-920 Bloomfield (LGA1366) I\u0027m running is capable of failing gracefully by switching to 2-channel operation in the event of a problem with one of the memory channels.
