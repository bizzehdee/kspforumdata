I\u0027ve put an MK3 liquid fuel tank with four mk1 jet tanks radially mounted and nervs beneath them. Beneath the central MK3 tank I\u0027ve put a heat shield (hopefully for reentry). After landing in the Mun (which meant I\u0027ve fired the nervs for both the Trans Munar burn and the landing), the ablator is down to 85 or something from 850.
