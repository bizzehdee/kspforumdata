I hope others get some use out of it. Or at least a chuckle or two.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENow, regarding the results: All experiments shown in the video were able to be consistently repeated. Those that had inconsistent results were not included.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe fact that test 4, with the probe \u0022warhead\u0022, penetrates whereas test 3 (identical but without the probe) does not is very strange. I am no closer to understanding why some things quantum tunnel (clip) their way through the panels to the juicy innards whereas others do not.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETests 7 and 8 are also a strange comparison. Both composed of 3 oscar-b\u0027s, but the one with three times the mass (actually just under that due to the inclusion of empty tank weight in test 7) and three times the propulsion was less effective.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E12 and 13 have identical mass and propulsion, but 12 (the FLT200) consistently destroyed the panels, whereas 13 (two FLT100s) consistently did not.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor those looking for the most efficient penetrator (but NOT panel destroyer), the only part that consistently penetrated using just 2 sepratrons as propulsion was the ibeam 650.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor those looking for the most efficient panel-breaker, I have no good answer for you. FLT200s seem to be the minimum mass required, but the minimum velocity required is hard to determine (gravity tests used to precisely control impact velocity were inconsistent, sometimes the fuel tank did no damage, sometimes it clipped through the panels without any effect, sometimes it destroyed the panels)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T18:00:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery funny video, the \u0022pauses\u0022 are very entertaining, poor kerbals \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat video and great job allmhuran, we will never find the limit of KSP after all, there is always some crazy things to do !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your next experiment, you may try this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/--_RGM4Abv8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
