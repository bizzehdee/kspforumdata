Curveball-Anders took everyone to the local ice cream-pizza-pinball-chicken-applesauce-candy-methalox-whole_pineapple-drywall parlour and asked for some funds from the waiter, who choked on the pinball release-lever, tilting the machine over. \u0022Funds!\u0022 he exclaimed flabbergastedly,\u0022 you want my FUNDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u0022 \u0022HOW DARE YOU EVEN SUGGEST\u00A0SUCH A THING!\u0022 \u0022WHY I OUGHTA...\u0022 the waiter fumed indignantly as he gasped for air, collapsing while clutching his ukulele. \u0022Oh crud,\u0022 he wheezed into a squeezebox, which inflated to the size of a prize-winning pumpkin. \u0022A prize\u0022, said Starhawk, \u0022is worth funds.\u0022 Tiredly, the waiter raised a kickstarter campaign to capture the wiggly tentacles playing the piano for fun, and a plan was beginning to form in his mind. He imagined a B.O.B (Battle of the Bands) in which Jeb, for marketing purposes, screamed an Electric-Guitar intro of \u0022Let\u0027s go Crazy\u0022. The monster, however, preferred jazz piano, and tried to eat them, but a rogue hard disk formatted the simulated soft-serve ice-cream, instantly replacing people with other ice-cream-flavoured people, that tasted like Minmus.\u00A0\u0022Yuck\u0022\u00A0said the Imposter,\u00A0\u0022this paragraph is getting way too long (paraphrased into a paradox, maybe we should go back in time), why not stop it right now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nHowever,\u00A0by traveling back\u00A0before it starts back then,\u00A0Nazalassa made a discovery about\u00A0the wiggly\u00A0tentacles that play the piano for fun, that shocked the entire\u00A0Kerbal literary audience. Sentence building is mandatory practice for someone who wants\u00A0fun and do karate; that is cursed because\u00A0it changed the kerbal race\u00A0for the worse\u00A0because they caused\u00A0Geonovast to become\u00A0Kspbutitscursed and kerb24.\u00A0And that was horrible\u00A0because all he could make were\u00A0bad space flight alternate\u00A0history\u0027s that were\u00A0very very very cursed, because Take-Two made it\u00A0and they caused lag. This caused CobaltWolf to\u00A0make another magnometer to cause Kspbutitscursed to kill\u00A0royalswissarmyknife and blow up a\u00A0FAA headquarters. Meanwhile,\u00A0the paragraph exploded and nuked the pad\u00A0it was written on and caused a fire that caused\u00A0a cake to grow up and live\u00A0as a muffin\u00A0\u00A0and destroy the world\u00A0and annihilate\u00A0lies that\u00A0caused the entire kerbal race to\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Ego back in time and \u003Cstrong\u003Ecause the timline to\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
