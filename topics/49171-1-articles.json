It would take HUGE amounts of power to start and run these experiments though, so you would need the large solar panels along with the large batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Science Lab\u0022 could require 4 kerbals to do the experimenting, 8 of the largest solar panels to run the experiments, and maybe a 20,000 electrical charge (5 of the largest batteries) to start the lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReasons may be for later in development though. Like you discover technology, kind of like what has been done on the International Space Station in real life, to help civilian kerbals that will give you a credit/science boost in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun optional part:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course there has to be a down side or a risk. There would be a 20% chance to damage the experiment, so you would lose most of the science that came with it. A 10% chance to lose the experiment along with all of the science that would have been made from the sample.
