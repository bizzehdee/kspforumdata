Partially because after my Mun base it seems the next logical step and because of Scott Manley\u0027s recent trip to Eve inspiring me. I\u0027ve launched plenty of satellites, landers, and rovers to other planets successfully in my current save and others so I\u0027m confident in my ability to get there. I\u0027ve already started planning the vehicle to get me there and the two cBBp Dragon CSMs to get the fourteen Kerbals aboard. I\u0027ve already decided on taking two small rocket powered UAVs to see Duna from the air. I\u0027ve also decided that at least two Kerbals will remain with the interplanetary ship. It might be unnecessary, but I don\u0027t like the idea of leaving the ship empty. What I still haven\u0027t been able to make my mind up on is how I\u0027m going to land all the Kerbal\u0027s on Duna and Ike.

Rather than try and balance two different designs, your best bet is to use multiple of the same craft opposite each other on the hub, making 1 the best and 2 your next best as you could always mount that odd-man-out lander inline.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T21:08:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the idea of a massive trip to Duna. What is the return trip plan? Launch everything from Duna and rendezvous with the orbiting craft? Sending one craft back to Kerbin? Or have each lander have its own propulsion to take it back home? Or are we doing a permanent outpost on Duna and the gang is just going to stay there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are going to dock back with the main orbiting craft, then I say go with a multi lander plan. Each one will only need enough fuel to get to orbit and dock with the mothership. This way, you can land them in individual areas ... you know, FOR SCIENCE. Tip: Put your orbital mothership on an inclined plane. Then dropping each lander will just be a matter of timing. And then each one can launch right into the correct orbit inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are going to send the Kerbals right from Duna straight to Kerbin individually, I would go with the idea of a single larger lander with rovers. This way, the Kerbals don\u0027t get too far away from each other. They could all climb aboard the single return ship, to keep things simple. Rovers would give them utility to explore as much area as possible. You could balance a manned rover and an unmanned rover, which gets left behind to continue to rove ... you know, FOR SCIENCE.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dynamo","CreatedById":16626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T21:41:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on what you want to see. Unless you have some mods to make planetside more interesting, there will only be a couple unique landing spots for Duna, perhaps a crater or a mountain slope. I think you should go with option 2, as you shouldn\u0027t limit yourself to only 1 landing, and you can always put counterweight on for the rover if you design it carefully. In addition, since the overall weight of the vessel will likely be much larger than the rover, it can\u0027t move the CG that much relative to center. Plus, rovers make exploration of nearby terrain far less painful. Duna has just enough of an atmosphere that jetpacks are inefficient and only suitable for short trips, and the surface gravity is too low to make walking useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first trip to Duna carried 2 stock 2-man landers of my own design, a more minimal payload to ease design for my first IPV. Personally, i find it hard to deal with high payload fraction, and i stay away from huge landers to save frustration with making the transfer stage. However, if you\u0027ve got the vehicle for it, go nuts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket Farmer","CreatedById":71519,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T22:41:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou missed Option #4.
