One of my biggest complaints about building sats for ScanSat/Kethane/Karbonite/etc is that they quickly become so heavy that building on 1.25m LFO tanks with 48-7 engines is the only way to have a decent range and burn time. You quickly build beyond what an ion engine can accommodate.\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of being OP, if you decide to support ScanSat, the cool thing is that the parts in that pack are tiered in the tech tree already. The first scanner you have access to is the low res, black and white altimetry scanner, and I always thought could be made smaller to build onto an early-game probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for your suggestions, yeah i have actually found that a lot of the scanners (both the new ones from stock and the ones from mods) are very large especially considering almost every stock probe core is 0.625m (and really resource scanning is the kind of thing i\u0027d expect to be left to a probe), I don\u0027t currently have plans for Kethane or Karbonite having never had anything to do with them, but I used ScanSat in a game a while back and was considering that, I\u0027ll redownload it in the next couple of days and have a look at the parts and how everything fits into the tech tree and figure out where to go with adding support for it. That probably won\u0027t be for the initial release however but probably the first update I do instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T09:50:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nV0.1 has been released onto Kerbal Stuff!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nplease go check it out, I will create an actual release thread once I have sorted a few more things out, for now this is just a pre-release for people to test things out \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T12:43:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWAY TO GO!
