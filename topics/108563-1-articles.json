View full album](//imgur.com/a/Ffmx1)\n\nBasically this is an aeroplane launched rocket containing a 0.35m Satellite that I designed for uses such as a Remote Tech communications sat, Temperature Scan sat and what I like to refer to as a Contractual Obligation Sat (the \u0022put a satellite in this orbit\u0022 contracts)\n\nI was inspired by the Boeing/DARPA venture to do exactly this, as well as the brillaint and tiny CubeSats.\n\nI have basically finished this, but I thought I would put out a Dev page before I actually completed it, and will probably release a version that people can have a play around with and offer suggestions on ballancing and tech placement if they want to.\n\nthere are a few mods which are strongly recommended for this pack (but are in no way dependencies):\n\n- [FMRS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292-1-0-2-Flight-Manager-for-Reusable-Stages-%28FMRS-v1-0-00%29) (Flight Manager for Reuseable Stages) -allows you to jump back to the moment of separation and pilot your plane back to the runway before returning to the main mission, offering pretty close to complete reusability from your launch vehicle (only the SRB and upper stage are ditched, and they are small and cheap)\n- [Procedural Fairings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39512-1-0-2-Procedural-Fairings-3-13-bug-fixes-and-new-payload-struts-%28May-3%29) - **there is now a fairing base using the stock ModuleProceduralFairings so this is not necessary, but if you are like me and aren\u0027t a fan of confetti, i would still recommend this**\n- [Remote Tech](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305-1-0-2-RemoteTech-v1-6-4-2015-05-07) - this is not at all necessary but it is very much supported!\n- [Kerbal Joint Reinforcement](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55657-1-0-2-Kerbal-Joint-Reinforcement-v3-1-3-4-27-15) - makes the planes a bit more solid, stops the rockets wobbling on the underside.\n- [Antenna Range](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56440-1-0-AntennaRange-1-8-Enforce-and-Encourage-Antenna-Diversity) all antenna are compatible\n- [HotRockets](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65754-HotRockets!-Particle-FX-Replacement-Tutorial) will add FX to the Ion Engine\n\nThe things I still need to do are:\n\n1. Improve some textures.\n2. Go through the configs and make sure everything is sorted\n3. Make a few more parts (resource scanner, science experiments, maybe a better radial decoupler specifically for the rocket)\n\nI hope you all like what you see this is the first mod I have actually got to a stage I am happy with and am going to release and I have not been modelling or texturing for long, so this has been a real learning experience for me, but with that said, I hope you enjoy this once it\u0027s released!\n\nAlso I will be including the launch vehicle as a .CRAFT, it is completely stock and I am pretty happy with it. it\u0027ll take off without having to do anything other than throttle up, and reaches 30km at 1100m/s within about 2 1/2 minutes!\n\nOh and if you have any questions feel free to ask, and if I have missed anything important that I need to add please tell me!\n\n[A VERSION-0.96 HAS BEEN PUT UP ON SPACE DOCK FOR YOUR ENJOYMENT!](http://spacedock.info/mod/326/The%20SSR%20MicroSat:%200.35m%20Probe%20Parts) ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nPlease feel free to download and have a play around with it, tell me what you think, suggest some improvements, things still need to be done with some textures but everything is fully functioning both in stock and with RT\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-01T20:42:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2016 08:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T16:19:19Z","Content":"Looks pretty neat will keep a eye on this ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T20:11:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Looks pretty neat will keep a eye on this ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThanks for your response!
