So who knows... it may still happen in a chance update that camera zoom/angle from flight view will be made persistent too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-10T18:13:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I right in thinking the map screen overlays the flight screen? The reason I say that is if you\u2019re in map view and\u00A0hold the right mouse button and drag to rotate the view and you\u2019re burning engines , the engine sound \u2018moves\u2019 as if you\u2019re viewing the vessel in flight. Therefore, when you zoom in map you end up zooming in flight as well etc?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf so, it makes things difficult but if not, a mod could maybe fix this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
