Much more than you could except because I\u0027m not sending just a small living quarter off to the Mun. I\u0027ve constructed a space station capable of refuelling ships and that can itself be refilled. I\u0027ve also placed a small station on a 40,000m high orbit around the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the way it works is that I sent different parts of the station, built it, then sent parts of the Mun Base one by one to dock on the Kerbin station, refuelled them in order to send them to the Mun, placed them in orbit, docked them on the Mun station and them I\u0027m going to land on the Mun with a fairly big mobile base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is how it looks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4VXnSSp.png\u0022 alt=\u00224VXnSSp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe base (it was edited serval time since then and the wheels are no more connected through docking ports.
