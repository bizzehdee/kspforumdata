First is that nobody uses it and there is a reason for that, it\u2019s not accessible\u00A0enough because from what I remember you had to have your node selected and then switch to a separate tab which is very tedious and could be fixed by having the graphical editor on the UI by default or adding a button for the editor that is accessible.\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:small;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cbr style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:small;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:small;\u0022\u003E2. The second problem with the old graphical editor is not being able to switch between nodes easily because if you have nodes close together they become very hard to select and zooming in becomes impossible due to the camera having to be locked onto a celestial body which can also hide some vectors of the regular editor behind the celestial body. This could be fixed by adding an arrows and/or a drop-down menu that shows your maneuver nodes and/or adding hot keys, ect. to switch between nodes.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:small;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cbr style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:small;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:small;\u0022\u003E3. The last issue I had with the old graphical editor was not being able to switch to the \u201Cnext orbit\u201D (A feature that allows you to see what you maneuver would look like if executed a certain amount of orbits in the future and let\u2019s you execute them in that way) in the graphical editor but having to try to right click on on the node to get the option to appear. This could be easily fixed by adding the next orbit button and the previous orbit button in the graphical node editor.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:small;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cbr style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:small;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:small;\u0022\u003ESummary\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:small;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cbr style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:small;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:small;\u0022\u003ETo sum it up, the current maneuver node system is neither precise enough nor visible enough and it must be precise to do interstellar burns in the near future. A solution is to add a precise node like system or add back the old graphical editor with some improvements.

To get anywhere in a reasonable timeframe on interstellar scales, you need to be moving at some fraction of the speed of light - to get to a system 1 light year away in 100 years, you need to be moving at 0.01c... which is about 3,000,000 m/s, or 10,000,000 kph. It\u0027s still moving, but you\u0027d be going a lot faster than your actual destination, compared to what we\u0027re used to an interplanetary scales. You can\u0027t really do Hohmann transfers when going interstellar in the same way.
