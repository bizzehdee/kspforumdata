Whenever one is blocked by Kerbin, the other has a line of sight. You also need two relays in the same set-up at the destination to receive the signal, and they can then propagate it to whatever network of satellites you\u0027ve set up around the destination planet. Each relay needs at least two dishes, to communicate with the two relays it is sending/receiving from. (Due to RemoteTech\u0027s limitations, you can get away with less, but if you ask me, the more the merrier!) For bodies that are tidally locked to their parent, like the Mun, you can have only one \u0022receiving\u0022 relay. For example, you don\u0027t need two relays around the Mun, because if you place one on the surface facing Kerbin it will always be able to see at least one of the two relays around Kerbin.\u003Cp\u003EIf you \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E want a highly unnecessary degree of coverage, place a relay in orbit around Kerbol in the same orbit as Kerbin, but 1/4th of an orbit ahead or behind.

I tested various designs, but found there was simply no solid rocket booster to accommodate the payload--the Sepratrons carried too little fuel, while the RT-10 has too high a thrust-to-weight ratio. Even with the use of a BACC, too much fuel is lost to air resistance.

Instead, replacements will be launched as add-ons to other missions, e.g. if a crew shuttle has room for payload. In addition, I will reserve 500 m/s from the delta-v budget for orbital maneuvering. Satellites in an orbital plane can rearrange themselves in an orbit to maintain service at a degraded level if some satellites fail; that means global service can be maintained until an opportunity for launching replacements arises. Up to three satellites per plane can fail until inter-satellite links are no longer possible and certain areas of Kerbin will experience black-outs. This leaves another 500 m/s per satellite for stationkeeping, which guarantees a service lifetime of at least five years (if 70 km over Kerbin is equivalent to 400 km over Earth). It will be desirable to replace satellites every five years or so anyway, to update them with the latest technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoubleOSeven1","CreatedById":57582,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T20:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo when remotetech2 comes out, I get to do;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.)

I also do little ones like you have above along with one polar one per planet \u0026amp; moon for mapping and mount them on a unified launcher which has a nuke engine and enough dv to get to any outer planet or moon. The polar has extra xenon for the large plane change, but the others just need to be timed into geosync which is pretty cheap.
