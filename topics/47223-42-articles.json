This leads to multiple installs of the same mod, potentially of differing versions, which can crash the game. Additionally, a mod that explicitly conflicts with KSPAPIExtensions won\u0027t know that it exists in NFP\u0027s directory either, and CKAN will happily install it despite the conflict it creates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can, as zengei points out below, easily filter the .dll without having it in a seperate folder.

KSPAPIExtensions is something of a headache but currently we list no mods which conflict with it so that part isn\u0027t a problem at this and shouldn\u0027t be until the version resolver code is in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zengei\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zengei\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve written many metadata files for CKAN, if a file exists in a folder you don\u0027t want installed it can be filtered out; it doesn\u0027t have to be put into its own folder.
