I don\u0027t know about Lenovo, but the ALT key on all other PC laptops I\u0027ve used does not control the special functions on the keyboard. Sounds like something else is interfering, such as windows key remapping or incorrect keys.\n\nTry setting the modifier key to something else completely (not the Fn key) and see if that works. If so, then something else is up.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
