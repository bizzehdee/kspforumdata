The closest we\u0027ll get without visiting the moon is creating accurate models based on the science, just like how K^2 did in it post earlier. In fact, if we don\u0027t perform any other experiments, all we\u0027ll be able to do is just review and analyze the data from the previous experiments, which brings us to the pictures. This is the data we need to analyze to find the answer. If you want an answer, you must look at the data and figure out why it happened the way it did, not think of reasons to explain how it may have never happened in the first place. The photos aren\u0027t supposed to be a solution, they are the data; they should raise questions for any scientist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt has to slow down and not gain velocity.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually incorrect. Due to Newton\u0027s first law, an object in motion will remain in motion until acted upon by an external, unbalanced force. After the particles leave the engine, they will only be acted upon by the moon\u0027s gravity until they collide with the surface. The moon\u0027s gravity will act upon the particles in a direction parallel to the particles downward motion, so the particle will actually accelerate to the surface. It will not slow down, it will indeed gain velocity (only for a few fractions of a second before they hit the surface, but still, physics). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI expect to see some pattern or design, or a clearing away; some evidence of a recent change.

You\u0027re expecting something similar to what would happen on Earth. You need to try to completely ignore this bias. The moon is a far different environment than that of Earth\u0027s surface. If I had the rocket engine underwater near the ocean floor when I turned it on, would you expect to see the same results you see on the surface? No, that would be a ridiculous assumption, you would expect to see something different. That is exactly the same with the rocket engine on the Moon. Do not try to predict the results, and then compare the results to your prediction. Instead, view the results with an open mind if you really want to find the answer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn fact the Apollo 11 pic I cite looks like rain droplets have hit the thick dry dust, not a directed blast of some pressure level.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually a more accurate description of what is happening, believe it or not. Do not think of the thrust as a wall of pressure. It is made up of individual molecules (K^2 pointed out exactly which ones in his stoichiometric equation a few posts ago) that will individually bombard the surface of the moon much like rain drops will. On Earth, these individual molecules will in turn push the air along with them towards the surface, which will greatly increase the amount of particles that collide with dust. On the Moon, far fewer particles will be involved with the surface collision, resulting in far fewer interactions with the dust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think someone suggested that the LMs came down with some lateral motion. If so, then those 5\u0027 probes should have made some short lines in the ground until the vehicle started dropping straight down. You don\u0027t see any indication of lateral movement from that perspective either.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo not believe that we would be so confident with our LM to allow it to perform such a risky maneuver so close to the surface. The LM would be required to terminate it\u0027s horizontal velocity well before the probes touched the surface. And once the probes touched the surface, that would signal the shutoff for the engine, so no more flight operations could be performed after they touched the ground. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Apollo_15_landing_on_the_Moon.ogg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis can be seen in the videos of the landings\u003C/a\u003E: at about 2 minutes in, you can visually see the horizontal velocity change, and then the vehicle pitch downward once the horizontal velocity has completely terminated. Shortly after this an altitude of 120 feet is called, which is well out of reach of the probes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf science says there should be a change, then WOW, I don\u0027t see it! That\u0027s where I was at when I came in here.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe change will, and did, happen. You obviously have enough of a grasp of physics to know this. But to assume that it should be something extremely noticeable is just straight bias. I know that when I jump upward into the air while standing on a boat, the boat MUST also move downward as the counterpart to Newton\u0027s third law of motion (obviously a simplified example). If I were to jump again upwards while standing on Earth\u0027s surface, I also know the Earth must move downward as well, in accordance to the third law. Just because I don\u0027t see the Earth move doesn\u0027t mean it didn\u0027t. Again, some dust DID move, we know it had to. But it just isn\u0027t a enough to be visually apparent from such poor photographs. If you want to see the different, you\u0027ll need better cameras, and ideally a High res image of the location prior to the landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022It \u003Cem\u003Elooks like\u003C/em\u003E the LM\u0027s were set in place by a crane, due to the lack of any \u003Cstrong\u003Evisual\u003C/strong\u003E disturbance to the areas immediate to the nozzle.\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThis is an accurate description of the event. With zero background information, if you were to show me those images and make that claim, I would have no reason to refute your statement. But with the knowledge that it was a Lunar landing, it becomes an inaccurate description. And I should refute your claim, especially since physics does actually support the photos. \u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHowever, the photos raised more questions than they solved. I am curious about a few other things too, but will probably no longer ask about them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI have been intentionally ignoring all conversation regarding a hoax until this comment. I do not intend to participate in a conversation about if the events did or did not happen. I will however do my best to help answer any questions I feel I have the answers to. I may not be able to answer all of them, and I may not be able to answer them 100% accurately, but I encourage you to ask your questions regardless. If I can\u0027t answer them, someone else may be able to. Perhaps your questions would be best suited for a different thread though, as this conversation borderline off topic with regards to this thread. \u003Cp\u003EFinally, in an effort to bring this back on topic. As apparent with the questions LunaTrick has, and the questions of many others (some of which may not have been alive to see the moon landings), another mission to the moon can produce answers to these many questions. These are reasons to return, even if they may not be strong enough reasons to justify the cost of the trip to the moon. Hopefully, with SpaceX\u0027s plans for reusable rockets, we may have a solution to the high costs. I see this as an opportunity for a potentially immediate robotic return to the moon\u0027s surface (not including LADEE\u0027s planned crash landing). Another man landing though might be many many years away.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-15T04:05:16Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2013 04:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Natsarugiy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T05:40:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eanother mission to the moon can produce answers to these many questions.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand those same people will claim those new missions are faked too...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T08:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t understand everything NASA writes, and neither will the next new comer.

Ever since the Moon hoax web sites started cropping up, there have been web sites devoted to debunking those theories. Like this one, which answered the points that you brought up back in 2001:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.apolloarchive.com/apollo/moon_hoax_FAQ.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.apolloarchive.com/apollo/moon_hoax_FAQ.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem when debating these issues is that each time you debunk a wacky claim, hoaxers come up with another hoax. This is simply because the burden of proof lies on the person making the hypothesis. Extraordinary theories require extraordinary evidence and it\u0027s impossible to prove a negative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m not claiming you are a hoaxer. You seem to have a more open mind and I think you are genuinely puzzled by some of the things that you have seen and are just curious about the explanations. However, this is a sensitive subject, for reasons that I have already discussed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have looked into terrestrial radiation sources, including isotopes found in nuclear fallout, how to shield from that, half-lives, where my local nuke plants are located, what the seasonal prevailing winds are for my state. OK? But I don\u0027t know jack about space radiation other than high energy radiation like xray and gamma rays are the worst, and of course what I have read about the Van Allen belt, and the cross section pictures of it. Van Allan and NASA disagree on facts. I just know that kind of radiation is never good for humans and there was zero shielding, except for the mass of the ship itself.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have studied radiation, then you should know that radiation tolerance levels are measured in Sieverts, which is a cumulative value that measures the concentration of ionizing radiation absorbed per unit of a material\u0027s mass. In other words, it depends on both the level of radiation that you are exposed to AND the duration of the exposure. It works a bit like a photographic film, where the exposure depends on both aperture and speed, or like a sunburn. As long as you don\u0027t bask in the cosmic rays for too long, you should be fine. The Apollo astronauts didn\u0027t spend enough time exposed to high cosmic radiation to be negatively affected. Similarly, the vast majority of the \u0022liquidators\u0022 at Chernobyl haven\u0027t died from cancer from the cleanup work because although the radiation levels were high, they were only exposed for short periods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo sum it up, there is zero evidence that the Apollo astronauts couldn\u0027t have survived the trip. Not a single peer-reviewed scientific paper has ever been published with that claim. Yet there is ample evidence that they could, because most of them are still alive today to tell the story, with their medical records, photographs and all the documentation, archives, and published scientific results from the Apollo project. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put it another way, on one side of the scales there is your own personal hunch on a subject where you have no real expertise, and on the other side there is the word of thousands of direct witnesses, many of whom are scientists, engineers, military and intelligence personnel from all over the world, and literally tons of documentation, science publications, and historical evidence. Do you see the disconnect here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt just looks damn odd and unexpected to my eye.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, because a lot of the physics involved are unintuitive because our experience as human beings is mostly limited to our specific environment. The same is true for quantum physics or relativity. Most of it is unintuitive and demonstrates unexpected results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bit like KSP. Stuff like orbital rendez-vous is pretty hard to explain to a new player because it is unintuitive that you need to decelerate to catch up with your target and to accelerate to let it catch up with you, yet that\u0027s how it works and we have to explain it over and over again, because it\u0027s that hard to believe. There is nothing wrong with not knowing what to expect, but phenomenon like how rocket plumes affect dust on the Moon are simply not areas that you or I have any daily experience with, so we are simply not equipped to argue about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when you see something that doesn\u0027t fit your expectation, the most logical reaction should be \u0022there must be something going on here that I don\u0027t understand\u0022 rather than \u0022someone must be playing tricks on me\u0022. The former is healthy curiosity. The latter is mild paranoia.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, my usual first reaction is to pull up good old Wikipedia and have a quick read about the subject.

That just says the photos are in question - not the landing. And that we probably landed on the moon, but I suggested that maybe it wasn\u0027t Neil.

If you accept the fact that they did send men to the Moon, they did openly talk with them during the missions (the communications were monitored by foreign agencies after all), they did leave stuff on the surface, and they did bring back rocks, then they were also quite capable of taking real EVA pictures and only the pictures from inside the vehicles would have needed to be faked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if they did fake these pictures and they did actually put the LM in the middle of a Hollywood sound stage with a crane, do you really think they would have forgotten to dig a crater underneath the LM if that is what they expected? Do you really think they could have got everything perfectly right in those pictures and movies except for that one single detail?

And it was all fully declassified decades ago, and so have all of the other government secrets from the Cold War era, including the U-2, SR-71, Hexagon... even though these projects contain information that even today, we wouldn\u0027t like some people from getting their hands on. The F-117 or B-2 were kept pretty much under wraps for a decade each, but there were still leaks and it was public knowledge that there were secret stealth aircraft projects going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople who work on classified projects know that they work on classified projects, and so do their families. Usually, when asked decades later, they don\u0027t hide the fact that they worked on classified government projects even if the project is still classified. Governments can keep a project secret, but it\u0027s hard for them to hide the fact that there is a secret project. If only because the decision to keep a project classified as top secret involves a lot of people at the political level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there was any secret around Apollo, they couldn\u0027t have kept the secret (or even the secret that there was a secret) for 45 years in the current information-driven world. People who were working on the project would have known that there was a secret to keep, they would have been aware of any compartmentalization or areas where they were not allowed to ask questions. The Soviets would have noticed that the communications were not coming from the Moon, that the orbital tracking data did not match up with NASA\u0027s claims or that their were anomalies in the published photographs. Yet not a single NASA employee has ever mentioned that there were parts of Apollo that were secret and no foreign government has ever stated that something was fishy about their observations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why people get defensive when you bring up stuff like this, because basically you are calling all of these people liars. There are many people who have an interest in space who lurk on these forums, including some who might work at NASA or whose parents might have worked on Apollo. You are portraying these thousands of people as government spooks who are still today actively lying to the general public, when they are mainly motivated by noble dreams of science and exploration. If you even looked, you\u0027d be surprised at how open NASA is about everything, how much documentation is available, much more so than any other space agency.

Because there is no erosion on the moon, thesese are tiny jagged shards of rock. Because of their shapes, they form a layer that leaves very good imprints, and is also very tough to actually blow free. You need to physically dig into that soil, like the wheels of the rovers do, to really make a change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, thrust of the lander would still lift some of that up. And it would drop right back down as soon as the engines would be shut down. It would not leave any sort of impression that you would be able to detect on the photographs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s all there is to it. This is what science tells us, and a lot of it has been tested by many different groups. Experiments with simulated rigolith, based on samples brought back from the Moon, have been performed. We know how it behaves. We know what sort of conditions rigolith under the lander would be subjected to. And pictures from Apollo missions are consistent with what should have happened.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T07:13:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jwenting\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jwenting\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eand those same people will claim those new missions are faked too...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the enduring beauty of conspiracy theories.
