But now I tried putting it into another rocket and it seems like it should work fine except when I\u0027m launching it and flying the rocket, the whole thing is just vibrating, like as if the ship had some kind of earthquake going on. The navball is vibrating like that as well and my surface lateral velocity keeps extremely rapidly going between 0-5 m/s and stuff. Actually, I just tried to time warp while on the launchpad and it made my ship explode \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Any ideas why?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/28489817088851561/F44808D925D2799512715E1C0EDE40A0839305D5/\u0022 alt=\u0022F44808D925D2799512715E1C0EDE40A0839305D5\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/28489817088851742/93353CC98AFDD4F000177D7E6B8DA9569BE6DFCF/\u0022 alt=\u002293353CC98AFDD4F000177D7E6B8DA9569BE6DFCF\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T20:46:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jadis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T20:38:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have a service bay module?
