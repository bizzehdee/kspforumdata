I\u0027ve managed to bring down a couple of craft now without heat shields, it just takes more time than a more direct descent. I usually make a pass or two at a very high altitude to aerobrake some, just about 50-55KM above Kerbin, depending on my starting altitude. Generally speaking, if my altitude is very high, IE starting to return from KSO, I\u0027ll go JUST low enough to barely touch atmo, 55-59KM, which only slightly reduces the orbit, but only doesn\u0027t cause any excess heat. If my starting altitude is lower, say 80-100km, I\u0027ll go deeper, 40-50, unless its a lightweight vessel, in which case I\u0027ll go into the high 30\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-02T16:57:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2014 04:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by kalor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T18:54:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKitspace: are you using properly sized capsules?
