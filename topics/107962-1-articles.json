Are there any brilliant but broke scientists out there who would trade 500 science points for v1000,000 in cash? (used notes)\n\nIn other words, I am a reasonably good engineer but a lousy scientist, so am flush with cash but need the science to unlock some tech for a new project and, according to what I consider \u0022legitimate\u0027 business practice\u0022, I am prepared to pay for it by hacking my persistent.cfg to -1000,000funds for \u002B500 sci.\n\nHowever, it would ease my conscience if I could help someone in the community who needs funds so we could do a deal. Can share funds between several others if mutually agreeable? I would post screenshots of before \u0026 after if you need a receipt!\n\nAny takers?"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T21:05:54Z","Content":"I generally approve of this idea.
