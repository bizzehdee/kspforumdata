I have a launch vehicle with three main engines, two SRBs (separatrons, not launch boosters), and an upper stage with a smallish monopropellant rocket. KCA reports 6 engines, which is right, but not all of those engines are active at once (and some are not available for control). If I enable KCA and launch using MJ, when I tip into the gravity turn, the main engines throttle back drastically (to the point of losing speed) despite the throttle setting being \u0022full\u0022. The only engines that were enabled were the three main engines. RCS was off, the separator SRBs were off, and the upper stage was off, so any throttle computations should have accounted for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) KCA UI behavior is odd when there are multiple avionics units on the same ship. It looks like the avionics package defers so only one unit is controlling the ship, but the UI is only accessible from that controlling unit, which means guessing and clicking around to find the right one if I need to bring the UI up, which is tricky if the controlling unit is underneath fairings. A similar problem comes up if the UI is active when I dock - the active unit defers control to another unit, and the UI disappears. This means I can\u0027t change modes on the docked ship until that package becomes the controlling one. I think what should happen is that the GUI should be accessible from any unit, and that control settings that are selected are distributed to all KCA units in the combined vessel (so they\u0027re all in a known, selected state at the time they separate). The UI should remain visible if it was visible from any KCA units. I don\u0027t know how to decide which KCA unit\u0027s settings are applied when two ships dock - but I think all units should have the same setting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angmar","CreatedById":82385,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T15:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust did some testing with this and seems to work smoothly.

It\u0027s also probably not a good idea to change the name of a mod after it has been around for over 4 months, since that could cause even more confusion, especially concerning any search engine queries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to what? The SRB support? If so you will have to wait a while, since I probably won\u0027t have any time to work on that properly until December at the earliest, due to RL commitments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FellipeC\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FellipeC\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EZRM, thanks for your awnser.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MOARdV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MOARdV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wanted to throw in two more quirks I found (one is arguably a bug, the other is a usability issue):\u003Cp\u003E1) KCA seems to assume that all engines on a vehicle are available for use, whether they\u0027re active or not. I have a launch vehicle with three main engines, two SRBs (separatrons, not launch boosters), and an upper stage with a smallish monopropellant rocket. KCA reports 6 engines, which is right, but not all of those engines are active at once (and some are not available for control). If I enable KCA and launch using MJ, when I tip into the gravity turn, the main engines throttle back drastically (to the point of losing speed) despite the throttle setting being \u0022full\u0022. The only engines that were enabled were the three main engines. RCS was off, the separator SRBs were off, and the upper stage was off, so any throttle computations should have accounted for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) KCA UI behavior is odd when there are multiple avionics units on the same ship. It looks like the avionics package defers so only one unit is controlling the ship, but the UI is only accessible from that controlling unit, which means guessing and clicking around to find the right one if I need to bring the UI up, which is tricky if the controlling unit is underneath fairings. A similar problem comes up if the UI is active when I dock - the active unit defers control to another unit, and the UI disappears. This means I can\u0027t change modes on the docked ship until that package becomes the controlling one. I think what should happen is that the GUI should be accessible from any unit, and that control settings that are selected are distributed to all KCA units in the combined vessel (so they\u0027re all in a known, selected state at the time they separate). The UI should remain visible if it was visible from any KCA units. I don\u0027t know how to decide which KCA unit\u0027s settings are applied when two ships dock - but I think all units should have the same setting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Engine availability/activation is not the problem. If an engine exists, KCA knows whether it can use it, and if it can use it, whether giving it a non-zero throttle helps to achieve the overall goals. If KCA keeps engines at a low throttle that means that any higher overall thrust would be impossible since it would cause unwanted rotation. There must be some underlying problem with either your craft\u0027s layout, the gimbal range of your engines or the total strength of your reaction wheels. In a mainly stacked narrow vessel the likely culprit is that the vessel does not have enough roll authority, in which case you need to improve that either with more RCS ports, more reaction wheels, engines with better gimbal ranges (the stock engines have woefully small gimbal ranges compared to real life) or the addition of radially-attached perpendicular engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, since active (firing) SRBs are unsupported, you need to make sure that there is not a point where SRBs are active on the KCA-controlled vessel, as it will assume they can be used like normal engines. Really I should change this so that SRBs are specifically ignored by KCA for the time being so that sepratrons do not cause ill effects when activated on a KCA controlled vessel (note that sepratrons only activated to move spent stages away do not fall into this category). You may want to try your design wihout the SRBs and see if it makes a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Thank you very much for this feedback. Multi-craft/Multi-avionics behaviour is the least developed part of the plugin, and the behaviour is not ideal, as you\u0027ve highlighted.

My rocket is arranged similar to the Delta IV Heavy (three fuel tanks in a line, each with an engine), and I normally roll it so that the three engines are parallel to the horizon. This means I am adjusting pitch through the gravity turn, and that\u0027s where the engines throttle down. If I don\u0027t do the initial roll, the engines don\u0027t throttle as much, since the adjustments are primarily yaw. It still behaves worse than a stock launch. If I use a five-engine arrangement, it is markedly better, but makes for a slightly less fuel-efficient launch (less fuel in the main tank when it makes orbit). I suspect that if I could have jettisoned individual outboard tanks when they ran dry, instead of waiting for all of them to run dry, the difference would have been much smaller. So, I think KCA flight control isn\u0027t a match for my standard 3-engine lifters, but I\u0027ll keep experimenting with it on the multi-engine configurations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spearsp","CreatedById":27499,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T16:16:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis works great - thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least, it works very well for rocket engines.

With 4 engines around the centre of mass, it seems to have the engines on one diagonal following the throttle, and the other two running at about 10% - can\u0027t imagine why it is doing that. It would be nice to have a \u0022simple\u0022 mode, that merely attempts to keep the thrust vector from the main engines through the centre of mass, without attempting to follow the controls or interfere with the RCS. Turbine engines do not respond well to sudden rapid changes in throttle.

Another problem with that approach is that the new RCS module would not be able to save any of its state, so an RCS block would never remember whether it was disabled/enabled the last time it was loaded.
