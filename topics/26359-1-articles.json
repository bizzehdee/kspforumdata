I was mean to hit F9. I could end flight and send this kerbal back planet start again. But I didnt. I keep it at orbit Kerbin. Station start move far, far, far away before I could come up design for pick up kerbal. But today I was bored and mess around rocket designs. Before I launch rocket. I kick 2 kerbal out pod. I was wanted see how do people put extra people into rocket when pod is far above. In end I never figure out so I put both under engine *eviil laugh* BLAST OFF! Who know what happen to both of them lol. When It reach into gravity turns... I spotted Kerbal floating approached. I cut off engine. I never reach full orbit. But I was able to manual into same speed as kerbal is. I switched to Kerbal and manual it to get in pod and de-orbit back atmosphere. I still wonder what happen to two who was sit under engine...
