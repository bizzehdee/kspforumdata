Even the voyager dish uses only about 280W.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. From 0.8.6, the solar panels/arrays/wings are much larger for the same output (rescaleFactor of 2.3 instead of 1). On the last page there is a screenshot with solar arrays tweakcaled to provide the SETI Greenhouse (1 kerbal version) with enough energy for kerbin orbit. Each of them only has a nominal output of about 10kW (10EC/s) around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Solar Panels will follow the inverse square law power curve by CaptRobau, which means, that they only provide 3.5% of their nominal kerbin output when around the joolean system. Thus one of those massive SETI-Greenhouse solar arrays would just be enough to power a probe core (40W) and a CommTech-1 (300W), with just 10W to spare. And that is certainly not enough to recharge the batteries after flying behind a moon or Jool itself. So for a real mission to Jool, you would need both of those massive arrays just for the probe core and CommTech-1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lord Aurelius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lord Aurelius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@Yemo\u003Cp\u003EI like the proposed antenna changes, the ridiculous weight of the remotetech dishes has been bugging me for awhile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I suggested a rescale for some of the dishes is that the giant remotetech folding antenna doesn\u0027t really have a fixed dish counterpart (at least not one that looks the part), stat wise the CommTech-1 is the closest but it is much smaller, around the same size as the KR-14.

A 0.5 range multiplier would help balance it, it looks like it changes things so that to achieve the stated max range you have to use two identical antennas, while still providing a nice boost to ranges when you use a long range antenna with a short range one, so when you update your comsats so you can send your existing probes farther out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MultipleAntennaRangeMultiplier will probably need some tweaking, if you set it to 1 it looks like it basically adds the omni ranges, I just randomly picked 0.5 since it was in the middle so I would get some boost by using multiple antennas without being ridiculous.
