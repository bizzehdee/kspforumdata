The problem is that the airbrakes in stock KSP open and close far too slowly for effective maneuvering. Are there any mods that add airbrakes which open/close quickly, or that speed up the vanilla\u00A0airbrakes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T05:19:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntry adjusting this value in the config, I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s in degrees/sec\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0actuatorSpeed = 20\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-31T05:19:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2016 05:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by nli2work\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FungusForge","CreatedById":148313,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T17:52:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey, if you\u0027re wanting asymetric thrust control, try \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/97154-throttle-controlled-avionics-310-105-112-continued/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EThrottle Controlled Avionics\u003C/a\u003E, it sounds like exactly what you\u0027re looking for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
