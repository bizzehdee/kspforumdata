I have found many discrepencies within the stock tech tree, that, for the moment, have made the game almost unplayable for me.\n\nFor example, ladders are too deep and so are 2.5m docking nodes which I find are essential for interplanetary missions.\n\nCan anyone help?\n\ncheers,\n\nToby"},{"CreatedByName":"cvod","CreatedById":110540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T09:06:57Z","Content":"Have you tried the custom tech trees currently floating around? Such as the Mod-Oriented Tree (mine), ADIOS, and the Engineering Based Tree? Those are all pretty big overhauls, and there should be 1.0 compatible versions up soon. Each one overhauls it a bit differently. One of those might be what you\u0027re looking for."},{"CreatedByName":"TerrificToby","CreatedById":58095,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T09:12:20Z","Content":"ok, thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T14:55:51Z","Content":"Here\u0027s mine: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118026-WIP-tech-tree-rearrangement](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118026-WIP-tech-tree-rearrangement)"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T15:27:09Z","Content":"[SETI](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106130) is another good one as well, it also includes some minor rebalances to reflect how parts have been moved and to fix the worst inconsistencies in stock.\n\nEdit:\n\nCame back in on my PC to add a link since it\u0027s a pain from the mobile forum site, and noticed that the mobile site doesn\u0027t post signatures...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T16:44:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"}]}
