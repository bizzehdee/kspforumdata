For example, I don\u0027t have a rover and I want Jedediah Kerman to run to his spaceship, which is on the other side of a crater on the Mun. It would take forever for me to make him run over there, so is there a mod that can make him run automatically and let me do other things?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FungusForge","CreatedById":148313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T04:18:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEVA Follower allows you to move multiple kerbals at once, as well as set patrols, so you could probably set tell the kerbal to go \u0022patrol\u0022 the ship.
