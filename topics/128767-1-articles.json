Several groups also saw this as a chance to disprove Werner\u0027s paper on manned spaceflight orbiting. With much excitment and pressure, the Space Program began Project Moho, with a goal of manned rockets into space, and later manned spaceflight orbiting. The first rocket, Kerbal 1, was to carry one Kerbal above 70 km, and return safely. After much research, math, and building, Kerbal 1 was completed, and was the first manned spacecraft. Jebediah Kerman was the first Kerbal in space, and the first Kerbal to survive re-entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollowing Jeb\u0027s journey into space, Sean\u0027s Cannery released the Mk2 Lander Can. Gene Kerman, who now wanted 2 kerbals to go to space in one rocket, saw this as a change to make more news. So the Space Program signed a contract with the Cannery, in which the Space Program would give marketing for this new product, and the Cannery would allow the test of one of these newfangled products. 6 months later, the Space Program unveiled the Kerbal 2, a two seater rocket. Jebediah and Valentina Kerman were the two pilots who would fly this, making Valentina the first female Kerbal in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-28T18:59:40Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2015 06:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerbalCorgi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EIncorrect term\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalCorgi","CreatedById":155954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T16:44:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProject Moho- Atlas 1 \u0026amp; 2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the successful return of Jeb and Val, Space Program rocketeers began to look further. The Kerbal rockets, they decided, while had done their job, were becoming old and outdated compared to some of the parts being released by Rockomax and C7 Aerospace. Plus, contracts were being offered for the testing of new parts. Therefore, Gene Kerman and Werner von Kerman decided to retire the Kerbal rockets. These were replaced by the Atlas series, which continued until the end of Project Moho. Atlas 1 was designed for 3 Kerbals to journey above 70 km and successfully return. This rocket was one of the first of many that were mainly contracted with Rockomax Comglomerate. The Kerbals who were destinied to go to space were Jeb, Bob, and Bill. The safe return of them marked the beginning of the Atlas Rocketry series.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe continuation of the Atlas series was decided. Werner and Gene, after the return of Atlas 1, decided that there would be at least 3 more Atlas flights. However, Jeb had ideas of his own. Kerbodyne had recently released the \u0027Kickback\u0027 solid rocket booster and had put out a contract for 35,000 funds for anyone willing to test it. Jeb saw this as a chance to make a quick buck and take care of the second Atlas flight. Surprisingly, Werner von Kerman endorsed this idea, and was quoted as saying, \u0027What\u0027s the worst that can happen?\u0027. Valentina also endorsed this, saying \u0027Someone has to do\u00A0crazy stunts.\u0027 Jeb managed to go to space and return, though he definitely voided the warranty on his heat shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still have one more Atlas mission to go, so the final part of Project Moho will be posted this afternoon.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalCorgi","CreatedById":155954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T18:58:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProject Moho- Atlas 3 \u0026amp; 4\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Kerbals making trips to space becoming a semi-regular part of news, Werner and Gene decided go bigger. The public and media, too, were vying for something bigger. Then, Kerbin\u0027s First Record Keeping Society announced a contract for 100,000 funds for a rocket that could take a crewed rocket into space, complete an\u00A0orbit around the planet, and return the Kerbals safely. This made big news in the spacecraft world, and various companies began scrambling together crews and rockets. The Space Program had plans too, and began work on Operation Free-Fall, the project to get Jeb and brothers Bob and Bill, into orbit. But before this could happen, Gene said they needed to test this on a probe first. Thus began Atlas 3, the only unmanned rocket in Project Moho. Scrambled together in 2 months, it was launched, and completed one circuit of Kerbin and made the retrograde burn successfully. However, a software glitch caused the parachutes to jam, and Atlas 3 splashed down hard. No parts were recovered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConstruction on Atlas 4 began as soon as Atlas 3 was rolled onto the launchpad. Competitors were already putting finishing touchs on their rockets. Atlas 4 was put together in less then a month, and Werner was determined to launch it first. Just after dawn, two days after it was finished, Atlas 4 was launched. The quote from Jebediah Kerman, \u0027It\u0027s better to die in a fiery explosion then to die of old age\u0027 were the last words spoken by the famed pilot before the spacecraft door was shut.\u00A0Atlas 4 lifted off and did go to space. After they achieved orbit, Jeb set a second world record- he performed the first EVA and spacewalk. Atlas 4 returned safely and normally- in a ball of superheated plasma. Atlas 4 splashed down and was recovered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Space Program was now richer by 150,000 funds. Jeb, Bob, Bill, and Val took a long, deserved vacation, on which Jeb and Val were married. Gene and Werner ended Project Moho and the Atlas rockets, but the Space Program was far from over. Werner had just made a deal with Zaltonic Electronics and Ionic Symphonic Protonic Electronics and he and Gene began preparing for the launching of new probes and satellites.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-28T22:41:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2015 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerbalCorgi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalCorgi","CreatedById":155954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T23:03:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKopernius 1- ComSats\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027Orange Suits\u0027 returned from their vacation to find Gene and Werner hard at work.
