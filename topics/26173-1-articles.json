Do I (is it reccomended) to be in a circular orbit before telling mechjeb to do certain manuvers like rondevouing or intercepting other celestial bodies? When rondevoiung does my target have to be in a circular orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chocki","CreatedById":61241,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T03:59:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStarting it from a circular orbit helps, but if you time the launch right you can go for straight rendezvous. Just be aware of the processes MJ will use. If you are off on the launch, it may try to plan a phasing orbit. I haven\u0027t tried using the timed launch, with a direct autopilot to rendezvous to dock. Theoretically, it should work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe target being in a circular orbit helps, but again is not needed. You just won\u0027t have as many transfer windows available, but time warp solves that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
