(Spaceport\u0027s search kinda sux, too, so I figured adding the direct links to the list would help).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve hosted it on GoogleDocs, and decided I\u0027d share it in case it helps anyone else who uses lots of mods, and are finding that they are having trouble keeping track of them...Go ahead and download it and edit it for your own use. I\u0027ve shrunk the widths on a lot of the blank columns just to save room on this copy.

It will, for the most part, automatically install or uninstall mods for you. You can use it to trim down parts packs, if there are only a few specific parts you want to use from a mod, instead of installing the whole pack. It also has a backup save games feature. You can easily use this to fix any craft you have that no longer load because you uninstalled a mod. It also will list each unique part in a mod pack, and it will also give you a complete list of unique parts, and how many, and from what mods, your ships are all built with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may want to consider keeping an eye out for an update with an added feature: there is a whisper of a rumor that an automatic mod update function MAY be added in the future!...If that happens, no need to even mess with this spreadsheet I made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I could go on and on about the great stuff I\u0027ve been able to do easily and quickly with KSPMA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to \u003Cstrong\u003EKSPMA\u003C/strong\u003E: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/ksp-mod-admin/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/ksp-mod-admin/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the link to the \u003Cstrong\u003Espreadsheet\u003C/strong\u003E: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkD_PFGuuyqodFhUbXpFcFc2cXBTejFhRnNuanh4VEE\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkD_PFGuuyqodFhUbXpFcFc2cXBTejFhRnNuanh4VEE\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope someone at least finds it as useful as I have.

What I\u0027ve verified and added info to, but has NOT had an actual mod update, is in green.
