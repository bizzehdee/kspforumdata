I intentionally built it with a loss of mass, since I wanted less than 100% efficiency. And since I use waste as an input, the loss had to be a magical loss of material.

The bio waste that is left over from the reaction is simply vented into space (slowly and diffuse). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m now reconsidering and I may add something like 100 units of storage of bio waste (not sure about the name yet) to the greenhouse and it will vent the overflow (that\u0027s the default for all TACLS recyclers for all products). And then maybe add bio waste containers as extra units for people who want to ship that stuff around. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
