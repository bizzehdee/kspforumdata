Oh, yeah... I\u0027ve seen some pretty \u0022Kerbal\u0022 stuff.\n\nPossibly my favorite example of this sort of thing is the time when one of my friends, Daddyisabar from the Rocketry Forum, did his best to fly a plastic model of a battleship. With rocket engines. Pardon the large images here:\n\n![attachment.php?attachmentid=257999\u0026d=1426522480](http://www.rocketryforum.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=257999\u0026d=1426522480)\n\n(The engines went in the tubes that you see near the front of the rocket. The orca on the bottom was for stability.)\n\nBelieve it or not, this design might have worked... if it wasn\u0027t for the fact that only one motor lit. Sadly, the battleship did a bunch of flips and was destroyed upon its hitting the ground:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/3XkF-QUzA1c?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u0027Twas a great loss.\n\nTo be fair, I\u0027ve flown some pretty \u0022Kerbal\u0022 stuff as well, and some of it has even worked! This \u0022soccer field rocket\u0022 went up to nearly a hundred feet (the drag was *real*) before tumbling back down safely:\n\n![AZVyygL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AZVyygL.jpg)\n\n![pStwe87.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pStwe87.jpg)\n\nI think that these two (and especially the space battleship) are some pretty good contenders for the \u0022Most Kerbal Rocket Ever Flown in Real Life.\u0022 Good stuff.\n\n-Upsilon"}]}
