The ships would generate in various locations depending on how far it\u0027s space program has developed. Ex: a low level RSP would only have ships and sattelites in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, possibly ships landed on kerbins moons. A high level RSP could have ships, bases, etc. all over the solar system. The type of craft it spawns also needs to be determined by the current tech and funds it has, if that\u0027s somehow possible. How fast they advance would also scale with difficulty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the RSP, your main goal would be to beat them in the kerbal space race, obviously. Your space program\u0027s rep would go up or down depending on if you do certain things before or after the RSP. There could also be certain contracts, like \u0022Land on the Mun before the RSP\u0022 that would show up and give you more funds if you do it successfully. You could even go as far as, say, \u0022Launch a spy satellite to see what the RSP is\u00A0doing next.\u0022 Basically, the contract system would be geared more towards objectives that beat out the RSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the basic idea I have for it, anyways. I don\u0027t know how much work would be needed to make something like this work, but it certainly would be cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andiron","CreatedById":141782,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T15:59:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty much waiting for multi-player to come (soon\u003Csup\u003ETM\u003C/sup\u003E) to have scenarios with real players.
