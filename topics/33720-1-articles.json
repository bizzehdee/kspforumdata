Normally I wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t post anything about what I have done, but this time I felt like I needed too, because I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m very proud of myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo set things up, I had a command module stuck in mun orbit with no fuel, and a lander on mun with very little fuel. I was able to design a rescue ship(named: Rescue 811) that had a 3 Kerbal command pod and a hitchhiker pod that I was able to get into Mun orbit. I got the lander back into orbit using what fuel was left and a lot of rcs. Lander and rescue ship rendezvous and dock successful. 2 Kerbals moved over. Here was my big problem. The command module was orbiting in the opposite direction. I had enough fuel in the rescue ship to completely reverse my orbit. Command module and and rescue ship rendezvous and dock successful. Kerbal rescued. I still had the fuel and was able to make the return trip to kerbal with a successful splashdown. All Kerbals returned home safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust wanted to share.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJames\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T05:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice work!
