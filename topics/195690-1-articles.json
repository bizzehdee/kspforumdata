I have made a rough replica of the design that is able to do a vertical takeoff and turn horizontally. I had the idea of using robotics from the breaking ground dlc to make the extendable wings using hinges, however they don\u0027t seem to be stable. When going at highspeeds the wings just flail around making them useless, I am wondering if anyone has any idea on how to make extendable wings that work at high speeds\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cant think of a username","CreatedById":204905,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-23T16:05:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nuse docking ports to connect the wing after unfolding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-28T12:49:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s an option to \u0022lock\u0022 hinges once they\u0027ve stopped moving - this makes them less floppy, but more importantly allows autostruts to pass through them, letting you make much more secure connections \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
