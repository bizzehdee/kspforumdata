There could be explorers, scientists, engineers, and designers. the explorers could be the basic kerbals and fly the spacecraft/map anomlies/plant flags/be the first kerbals out of the lander etc. scientists could do research as one of there subclasses (i.e. botanist, engine research. science machine operation, sample taker, biologist, xenobiologist, xenobotanist, astrophysicist, physicist, archeologists, etc.) they could all do things and there classes could be skills so a astrophysicist could be a upgrade from the physicist but still able to do a archaeologists job of investigating anomalies found, palaeontologist archaeologists xenobiologists and xenobotanists could investigate the mystery\u0027s behind anomalies, starting with an sstv signal somewhere (maybe the one on duna? or somewhere else?) at the science complex some way of recording the signal could make the picture and help move along the story (novasiliko(did I spell that right?) had the basic story idea when he added the signal back when he was a developer of the game, maybe scientist subclasses could help with that?) to when you find the abandon frozen planet (maybe using an observatory building? (ask nova why the planet is frozen. I don\u0027t have the link in a post showing the story he was planning in a wall of text.)). this could lead to interstellar travel engines to powerful to use inside a star system (so it couldn\u0027t be used t cheat long flights to anywhere except other stars. ok engineers and designers work together to build interplanetary bases. engineers could be told to use recourses they mined or brought with them to build bases. these would be designed by a designer brought on the flight as a survey of the terrain would need to be done by the designers to make a blueprint in a blueprint module to be tanked to engineers in a factory module who will make the parts and build with them automatically. once do ne crew can be flown in and as research continues the base can upgrade into a launch platform. this could make travel easier. also some parts would need specific resources (i.e. PB-NUK reactors need blutonium.) resources could be bought from kerbin and flown in to help or just mined by the engineers. the engineers would be the only class capable of making repairs to wheels or other parts that can break but remain attached to the craft. the designers would be used for space stations as well but modules would have to be placed in the correct orbit location by the player until a special orbital factory could be researched designed to work in zero-g. the bases could still be assembled manually since factories and blueprint modules require research. before research of this designers could serve some purpose, but I have no idea what they could do (maybe help some geologists or do a survey of the terrain around ksp for future bases. the survey could be replaced with satellites or done from orbit by astronomers assisted by designers. the explores would have red helmets, the scientists could have green ones, the engineers could have yellow helmets, and the designers could have blue ones. that was my text wall of ideas. I hope you like them\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T15:52:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eplease take a moment to space this paragraph properly lol. it reads like 3 long run on sentences.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T15:52:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWarning, sarcastic comment: RTFM! \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/44952-Already-Suggested-List\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/44952-Already-Suggested-List\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T16:14:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do not support discrimination between class of any race or species, be they Kerbals or not; so I\u0027m against this idea....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T16:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol, that\u0027s not a \u0022class\u0022 that\u0027s a proficiency, skill, or specialization which has been suggested. \u0022Class\u0022 is a... bad term.
