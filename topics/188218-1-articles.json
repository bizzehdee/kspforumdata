So I went ahead and installed a few that sounded reasonable, such as the Realism Overhaul with all the mods \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E recommended, Real Fuels/Plume/Boosters/Solar System/Atmospheres, Life Support, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, etc. etc. So I think I\u0027m pretty well set on the mods front, however I read somewhere that the scale is greatly reduced. Now that the physics should be somewhat accurate, is there any way to get the scale \u0022right\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I don\u0027t mind a challenge and I would like to actually learn from this game.. but am I getting too far ahead of myself? Or is it perfectly doable to start of like this? I\u0027m pretty damn far from a rocket scientist but as an airline pilot I do have some notion of physics and flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to search for the answers to some of these questions but didn\u0027t find much.. I hope this hasn\u0027t been asked a million times before!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, thanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The FD\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-13T22:38:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2019 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by The_FD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-13T23:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know anything about the realism mods, but welcome aboard!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I think it might be a good idea to play the game stock for a little while, before you start modding the game.\u00A0 Personally I think it\u0027s better to get to know the game at its core, first, especially before something like Realism Overhaul.\u00A0 Plus learning the basics like how to get to orbit is going to go smoother in the stock system.\u00A0 Once you get some skills down - then go for the hard stuff!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-14T03:42:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a rule, I always advise new players to try the stock game for a while before trying mods.

Any intuitions you might have about how anything works are almost certain to not apply in the world of orbital mechanics, and it\u0027s much easier to learn the ropes in the stock game\u0027s simplified simulation than it is to try and dive straight into Realism Overhaul. In this case, the places where the stock game abandons realism for gameplay are there to take a thing that\u0027s a byword for complexity and make it into something somewhat manageable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also say this in part because I have a friend who did exactly as you did... and who then found himself unable to do anything in the game, because Realism Overhaul is too damn hard if you don\u0027t already have a solid framework of orbital mechanics, rocket engineering, and space history upon which to draw. Space is hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t worry - the stock game is plenty fun, and plenty challenging for a new player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bootsam","CreatedById":198563,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-14T08:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with above. Ive only just started with mods. I followed this. It needs some tweaking by the user to get it looking ok and not laggy etc or weird. I concentrated on the basics until I started looking at mods.
