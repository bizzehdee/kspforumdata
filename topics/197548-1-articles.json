But as soon as I want to move up, they re-orient to face another direction. It makes getting them back into a ship without a ladder virtually impossible.\u00A0 Am I missing something?

The space-bar is the default key to reorient the Kerbal to the direction your camera is facing while on EVA. It\u0027s possible you also have this function assigned to the same key you are using for moving up. Those settings are in the main menu settings under Input \u002B Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-18T03:43:19Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2020 03:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maddog59","CreatedById":205063,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-18T13:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the suggestions. I\u0027ve turned off the EVA auto-rotate option, as well as cleared\u00A0the \u0027orient to view\u0027 button\u00A0in the Kerbal controls in Settings.
