The whole course is a capstone project. We are currently in the process of conducting market research for our project. I figured since the Kerbal community is so friendly that some people here would be willing to take my survey.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur project deals with solar panels. All will be explained in the survey. You can take this survey regardless of your age, and regardless of whether or not you have solar panels. We are looking forward to your responses. If you have any feedback, you can post it on this forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso in case it needs to be more convincing, 4 out of 4 of the members of this group own KSP, and 3 out of 4 still play it regularly (hehehehe I convinced them all to play and they love it now). So help some fellow KSP players out and take this survey!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuG7vCzW7kXb7NuW5GJHFEITvSg-YzDRHoNvP6_HkBBHK8kQ/viewform\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuG7vCzW7kXb7NuW5GJHFEITvSg-YzDRHoNvP6_HkBBHK8kQ/viewform\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for all of your time and support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-08T19:33:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there is an issue with the last question, there is by far not enough information to answer that.

I think that Elthy as well as myself were questioning what counted as a \u0022hot\u0022 temperature. 90F, 100F? That certainly affects whether such a product would be useful for our homes in the locations where we live. The way I look at it it\u0027s a simple question of cost-savings.

For solar panels, 77 degrees is the threshold, and all solar panels, according to our research, decrease in efficiency at temperatures above 77 (that isn\u0027t just the outside temp, thats the temperature of the solar panels which is often above air temperature. If you live in a region where the air is almost never above 77 degrees, then it would make sense that you would not want to pay much for this product.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, this question is very loose, and I understand that. It\u0027s simply meant to be a baseline as to how complex our solution should be. I understand that it depends on how much more efficient our product makes the solar panels, but we have not completed any design portion of this product as we are in the market research phase still (we follow the design process).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have any comments relative to this project that you cannot explain through our mostly multiple choice quiz, I would love to hear them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for checking it out!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-10T01:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, cool.
