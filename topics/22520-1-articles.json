We have very limited experience assembling things in space. We have even less experience handling hazardous materials (like fuel) in space. We have almost zero experience smelting, calcining, or refining ores in space -- or building things from any kind of raw material. (There have been some interesting experiments with concrete made from lunar dust, though.) The cost of lifting things from Earth is high enough that developing these technologies is a necessary step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanetary Resources is a company you may want to look into (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://planetaryresources.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://planetaryresources.com/\u003C/a\u003E). They\u0027re working to develop and deploy some of the technologies we\u0027ll need to create things we need for space exploration \u003Cem\u003Ein situ\u003C/em\u003E (with a focus on asteroid mining).
