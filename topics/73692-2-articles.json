Now I can look at my ship and navigate at the same time, and do so much more precisely to boot - I\u0027ve noticed that headings that look \u0022close enough\u0022 on the navball are sometimes significant distances from my desired heading in the HUD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a couple of suggestions that would improve this further:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Others have suggested an anti-heading vector, and I second this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- An anti-node vector would also be useful; Enhanced Navball has this, and it can be helpful especially when touching up a maneuver with RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Speed/thrust indicators like MarrusQ suggested, except I would put speed next to the velocity vector, thrust next to the heading vector and maneuver delta-v next to the node vector. Duplicating these indicators for the retrograde, anti-heading and anti-node vectors would also be a nice option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What you might call \u0022rotation vectors\u0022: an arrow for yaw/pitch rate (direction of rotation) pointing from the heading vector, along with possibly arrows pointing from heading toward prograde, normal, and node that could be enabled/disabled to help rotate into position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat last one is inspired by playing with Realism Overhaul, where magic-torque reaction wheels aren\u0027t available and I have to use RCS for almost all rotation; to conserve RCS fuel, I like to turn off SAS, give my craft a little push in the right direction and then be very patient while it rotates, and it would be nice to know that I\u0027m actually rotating in the right direction. The gridlines on the HUD already help immensely with this compared to the navball, but when I need to change both my pitch and compass heading, I\u0027m still half guessing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks for the great mod!

One where I just replaced the \u0026amp; operator with the short-circuit \u0026amp;\u0026amp; operator in MainBehaviour.SetActive(), which is more correct and efficient, but not a huge deal. The other is that the alpha values are not being saved and restored (reported by shimmythejj, who is obviously a fan of your mod). Other than that, the new version is quite nice, thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can find those changes on my github at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/RealGrep/NavHud\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/RealGrep/NavHud\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully you get your version into your own github so we can collaborate more easily and save you some headache.

I\u0027d be glad to help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I\u0027ve also make the secondary lines start with 0.1 alpha (suggested by overloadut), and after seeing kofeyh accidentally click the time warp (as I did once) due to the windows defaulting to the corner, they now start more centrally.

This means that (as a workaround) you can multiply the red green and blue values with the alpha you wish to have and set the actual alpha to 1.
