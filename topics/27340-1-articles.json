It only needs about 400 DV more, because once in orbit I can construct a full fuel tank and siphon from that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe full base\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/AIo88Ow\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AIo88Ow.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AIo88Ow.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship in need with the assembly rover nearby\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/pwdUjwp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pwdUjwp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pwdUjwp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, I already tried to attach a tank to the top, but it did not provide sufficient DV so I removed it.
