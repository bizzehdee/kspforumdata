I began by planning for the evening with a check of the two Kerbin rescue contracts I had on the block - both were in low orbits below 85k - as well as a check of the maximum compliment of the Kerbinport space station (sixteen, with seven Kerbals aboard at the beginning of the night). With that information in hand, I fueled the \u003Cem\u003EProject Peacock\u003C/em\u003E craft docked at the station and rescued Calster, a pilot, and returned him to Kerbinport. I then loaded scientists Nina, Nedcas, Lagerette, Granie and Seandard along with tourist Hilliana aboard a \u003Cem\u003ERaven 7b\u003C/em\u003E spaceplane and sent them to Kerbinport as well. Rendezvous and docking was a success, though the \u003Cem\u003ERaven\u003C/em\u003E arrived a little lower on gas than I would\u0027ve preferred. Nina joined Bob in the lab and the remaining scientists were offloaded into the station\u0027s habitation module, jumping the lab\u0027s sci production rate up to about 2.6 sci per day; still low, but higher than it was. Calster was loaded as a passenger on the \u003Cem\u003ERaven\u003C/em\u003E, as was Valentina; Gwezny was placed in the craft\u0027s cockpit (Val\u0027s still in hack for crashing a \u003Cem\u003ERaven\u003C/em\u003E and killing a bunch of tourists a while back, even though it was the due to the machinations of the Q continuum throwing the laws of physics out the window (read: FAR crashed on me that night and I hit quicksave instead of quickload)). After doing some calculations, I sent the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E out again to pick up Stellie, a scientist, from Kerbin orbit. The rescue was a success and the craft successfully returned to Kerbinport despite running out of fuel - the craft\u0027s got overpowered RCS capabilities, and it turned out to be a good thing. Stellie was loaded as a passenger on the \u003Cem\u003ERaven\u003C/em\u003E. Finally, the \u003Cem\u003ERaven\u003C/em\u003E was loaded with some truly precious cargo - Bob\u0027s thirty experiments that he conducted on his last trip to Mun. The plane was rigged for a return flight to KSC at the tail end of the evening, and the flight is scheduled to take place first thing next time I play the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEnola Gay\u003C/em\u003E returns to Kerbin from Minmus in five hours, after which I\u0027ve got plans to send a batch of tourists into solar orbit. At this point I need to send up more fuel for Kerbinport. Still haven\u0027t landed the Vulture plane from the last fueling mission - I really oughta get onto that sometime soon. In fact, I\u0027ve got a lot of plane flying in my near future: Land the \u003Cem\u003ERaven\u003C/em\u003E, Land the \u003Cem\u003EVulture\u003C/em\u003E, send up a \u003Cem\u003EMagpie\u003C/em\u003E (which still hasn\u0027t been fully tested) to dock with a craft in orbit to haul down to the surface, and get the damn \u003Cem\u003EAlbatross\u003C/em\u003E refueling plane working or send up another \u003Cem\u003EVulture\u003C/em\u003E.
