If it\u0027s closer than Moho. It scoops Hydrogen. If it\u0027s very close to Kerbol but not overheating, it will scoop up 20 hydrogen every minute. If it\u0027s farther away, it scoops up 5 every minute. If the harvester is farther away from Moho, it gets 2 Helium every minute and 0.1 hydrogen every minute. If the harvester is in low Jool orbit, it gets 4 Oxygen, 0.5 Nitrogen, 2 Helium, and 6 Hydrogen every minute, making it the most resourceful when it comes down to harvesting all of them at once, but on a small scale. In far Jool orbit, you will get 1 Oxygen and 2 Hydrogen every minute. In low orbit around Laythe, you get 2 Oxygen and 4 Nitrogen every minute. In far orbit, you get 0.5 oxygen and 1 nitrogen every minute. In low orbit around Kerbin, you will get 3 oxygen, 0.01 Carbon Monoxide and 7 nitrogen every minute. In far orbit, you get 1 oxygen and 3 nitrogen. In low Eve orbit, you get 30 Carbon Dioxide and 10 Hydrogen every minute. Everywhere else you get 0.2 of Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Helium, Carbon Dioxide, and Carbon monoxide every minute. The Gas Harvester will short circuit and become inoperable if you try to use it in an atmosphere. Gas Harvester weigh 4 tons and have a crash tolerance of 10 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGas Analyse\u003C/strong\u003E: This will only work if directly connected to a gas harvester. This device uses gas to create a permanent but slow source of science. For every 1000 of any gas type, you get 1 science per hour. For each analyse module, you can store up to 10000 gas. The Gas Analyse weighs 20 tons and has a crash tolerance of 5 m/s. It can only be placed functionally in Kerbol Orbit beyond Dres, but not anywhere near Jool\u0027s path. This is to make it extremely hard to abuse without cheating. Also, you can get at the VERY MOST, 60 science per hour with this, which is 1 per minute. So, you could only place up to 10 of these and work efficiently. After the 10 modules are used up, each extra one gives you 0.1 science per day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnimal Carrier\u003C/strong\u003E: Take Different Animals up to space! You can bring up Doqs, Kats, and Fwogs, which are Kerbal for Dogs, cats and frogs. You can do an analyse for 1 animal per flight at different locations. Doqs earn you 30 science per location, 20 for kats, and 10 for fwogs. Unfortunately, the science experiments don\u0027t always work. There\u0027s a 33% success rate for doqs, 66 for kats, and 99 for fwogs. If there experiment fails, you will get 1 science and the experiment will turn inoperable unless cleaned out by a Kerbal on EVA, which takes a random time ranging from 40 to 80 minutes to do. You can only do one experiment every 10 minutes otherwise.

Each experiment has a 50% success rate, and earns 40 science each. Different gasses lead to different results. You can also choose to expose them to the vacuum, which has a 100% failure rate but earns you 20 science the first time and then 2 science any other time. It can be done over and over again for the same amount of science, but only once every 10 minutes. This goes with exposing them to other elements too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERadiowave detector\u003C/strong\u003E: Detect all sorts of radiowaves! This device requires 40 ElectricCharge per minute (this is timewarp affected) and can detect radiowaves from anywhere: Every 15 minutes you detect one kind of wave: 50% for infrared (4 science). 30% for Ultra-Violet (7 science). 10% for X-Ray (10 science). 5% for solar radiowaves (1 science). 4.9% for unknown (35 science). 0.1% for inflation radiowaves (400 science).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience Analyse\u003C/strong\u003E: This is where those science records come useful. Here, you can combine science records with scientific speculations to make new breakthroughs! These breakthroughs include tips, tricks, and easteregg whereabouts, as well as some additional science. Usually ranging from 5-200. This module can be used once every hour. The science analyse weighs 40 tons and have crash tolerance of 10 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Arial Black\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EI know that almost all of you will like some of these and disagree with other ones, so reply with feedback about how i could improve the ideas!
