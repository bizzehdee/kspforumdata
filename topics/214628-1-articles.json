Also, in KSP 1, they also behaved as decouplers, while here, as far as I can see, I need a decoupler underneath it.

Granted, it\u2019s got a rocket mode, but fundamentally its an air breather right? Have you tried other jet engines? If other jet engines behave the way the Raipier does that might indicate that this is a feature, not a bug. OTOH, if other jets can surface mount for multiple engines then this is more likely a bug and should be reported\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
