A quick tip by the way: To make the waiting time shorter, I usually do alt\u002Benter as soon as KSP loads to put it in windowed mode, then go do something else. Just alt-tabbing out of fullscreen KSP doesn\u0027t work because then the process priority goes down or something like that, and then it takes even more ages to load.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T20:51:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI doubt that\u0027s possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis game loads all assats on launch.

Every game that I have ever played, from Morrowind to KSP, that had mod support loads painfully slow when loaded down with a significant number of mods. In order to implement mod support right, the game has to load everything up front on startup, which means a slow startup time. The alternative is not pretty; the alternative is loading assets on the fly while you\u0027re playing the game, and that would lead to incredibly poor performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m simply thankful for the fact that KSP is a good stable platform to load mods on top of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T06:46:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf KSP is taking excessively long to load, you may be running into a Unity bug which hangs the game for a long time on loading if you have unused virtual network adapters (e.g., Hamachi) installed.
