Now that i had my perfect savegame to import i finaly started Witcher 3. Of course i took the highest difficulty setting like in the other games, knowing it wont be easy. But sadly i just cant survive the first ghoul assault just after the beginning...\n\nI think that the controlls are realy ....ed up. The controls of Witcher 2 were perfect, Geralt did exactly what i wanted him to do but now i cant win a fight which would have been over after 10 seconds if i had the Witcher 2 controls back. Maybe i have difficultys to adapt to the new controls after i played Witcher 2 for several hours today, including the two hardest fights in the game. Did the control issues get better for you when you played for a longer time?"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T05:40:21Z","Content":"dynamic beard growth simulator?"}]}
