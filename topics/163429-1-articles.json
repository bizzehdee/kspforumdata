Sometimes I really, really hate the contract system, it\u0027s so infuriating. I have just wasted 4 hours doing a contract worth over 800,000, 55 reputation, and which includes the following 4 objectives:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFlyby Minmus\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFlyby the Mun\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFlyby Duna\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLastly, have vessel in sub-orbital flight above Kerbin (this objective \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E be completed last).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI entered flyby and orbit of the Mun; I entered flyby and orbit of Minmus; I then used Kerbin to sling me to Duna and entered flyby and orbit there. I then entered orbit of Ike, landed, planted a flag (another separate contract fulfilled) then got back into orbit for the journey home. Each time the contract system was keeping track with the usual green tick to confirm completion. However, when I entered the encounter with Kerbin on the return, and set the periapsis, all said objectives had been reset. It was like I had been doing nothing for 4 hours. Nothing changed when I entered atmosphere; I assumed re-entry would fulfil the final objective. It did not. I was in sub-orbital trajectory and it said nothing. (Does \u0027vessel\u0027 mean the whole ship, or just the command pod/s containing the crew?)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMission Control said the contract had all but the last objective as \u0027Complete\u0027. In other words, I have to do this contract all over again with a new vessel, through no fault of my own. There\u0027s no guarantee it won\u0027t happen again. The game just does not do a good job of keeping track of completed objectives. Sometimes it treats identical objectives in separate contracts as complete, even though each contract specifies it must be done with a \u003Cem\u003Enewly launched vessel\u003C/em\u003E. Sometimes objectives reset when entering solar orbit and only return when you enter an encounter; this can be confusing and concerning as you aren\u0027t sure if all your objectives have been saved. In this case, they weren\u0027t!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have over 12000 science points; 42million credits, 92% reputation.

It may have also had something to do with going straight into an aerobrake... the game can be quite finicky about what it counts as \u0027suborbital\u0027 in regards to the atmosphere, although I don\u0027t have much experience in that regard, so someone else would be better to confirm that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t necessary have to do the whole thing again, though. If you press Alt\u002BF12, you\u0027ll open the cheat menu up. In there, you can go to the \u0027contract\u0027 section, and manually set the contract as complete from there, and get the relevant rewards and such. It\u0027s something I do occasionally when I\u0027m in these kinds of situations, where I disagree with the game over whether I\u0027ve actually completed the contract or not - I put in all the work, it\u0027s a singleplayer game, so I don\u0027t feel particularly guilty about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way the \u0027newly launched vessel\u0027 works is that the contract wants a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enew\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Evessel, not a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eunique\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0vessel. Which means you can complete four separate satellite contracts with the same satellite, as long as launch it after you take the contracts. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weywot8","CreatedById":146603,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-19T00:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you haven\u0027t \u0022rage Alt-F12\u0027ed\u0022 yet, do check a few things on your returning ship, assuming the ship in question hasn\u0027t landed, has the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E/earlier save game:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nit is in Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nentry into kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E was hyperbolic, not intersecting Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere/Kerbin\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ncaptured into a final, stable Kerbin orbit - aerocapture is fine but final orbit should NOT intersect Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere/Kerbin\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nonly after the above, allowing\u00A0KSP to run for a while after each so the game recognizes the state of your craft, then you can\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nput the ship in suborbital trajectory of your choice.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP contracts will only recognize the \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Echange\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E of trajectory to sub-orbital only if coming from a stable,\u00A0\u0022in-orbit\u0022 state.
