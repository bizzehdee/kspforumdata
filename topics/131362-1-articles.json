I have already added two modules to my base and I am now trying to add my third. Everything went as usual. I built my module, added a skycrane, test said skycrane on Kerbin, build rocket to send it to the mun, and finally go to the mun. But when I finally got to add the module, the stubborn docking ports won\u0027t connect. I wasted what was probably more than an hour trying to connect the ports to no avail, even though i could get it to align perfectly. Getting desperate, I sent a probe to connect some RCS thrusters at the back, but that was just another hour wasted as it still doesn\u0027t connect. I\u0027ve tried everything, even gravity hack. What\u0027s wrong, how do I fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022161klkn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i67.tinypic.com/161klkn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-04T13:30:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2016 01:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by storm_soldier2377\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T16:04:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t remember exactly but there\u0027s an old bug that can\u00A0set the docking ports into a wrong state...
