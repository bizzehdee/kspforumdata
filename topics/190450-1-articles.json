Mainly because even if you find flat ground with a lot of resources under the surface, even if you make it self-sufficient (kinda), there is nothing going on if you leave the scene (except maybe resource extraction). It lacks this RTS mechanic, when you can do something else and the colony grows (or actually do anything) in the meantime. You need to be there, walk your crew around, one at a time, do everything manually. You can\u0027t just select a group of Kerbals and send them to get some science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d rather do some more interesting, entertaining missions than take care over a facility on a distant world that does nothing.
