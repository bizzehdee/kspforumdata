Options to switch seats to a pilot seat can be done via an IVA menu, where it drops a request with the current occupant that they can accept or deny. In the IVA, a particular coloration or aura (say, blue) would denote Kerbals that are being currently player controlled. Any player may return to the tracking station to control another uncontrolled ship/Kerbal. This can allow for docking, tandem spacewalks, data handoff, etc. and is meant to be largely cooperative. Time warp may still be an issue, but less so (outside of grief) as most active players would likely be all on the same affected vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission control allows one (or as above more) player(s) to undertake the role of crew, using action groups, so on and so forth, effectively identical to a single player game.

In addition to the above, it will also have readouts of current mass, remaining Delta-V, TWR, ground track, and other engineering information, and finally (maybe have the above with some sort of power/antenna dependence) a speech or text API enabling communication from one craft to ground control (or others).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know the following is a bit out of this thread\u0027s scope, but piggybacking off of the ground control ideas, having the following for ground control features of the ground control could include mission preplanning mode: which allows the creation of maneuver nodes for a mission in advance, setting a launch window, and stimulating the mission via a time parameter slider (the celestial bodies move with the hypothetical time, and the location of the craft is also represented along the maneuver curve, allowing you to tweak how much each node should be moved). Additionally, having craft construction be done by ground control could also be a thing.
