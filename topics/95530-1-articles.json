There would be body panels a player could use to stylize their rovers looks, as well as add some strength and protection to its components. There would be engine components that you could tweak and interchange in order to tune the performance of your rovers, different sizes and types of tires, roll cages, suspension, etc. The mod would also include components to let the vehicles operate in airless environments(because who doesn\u0027t want to ramp a GTO off the lip of a munar crater?) and different sized inline garage pieces that would allow you to transport your muscle rovers on rockets and spaceplanes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFeatures:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EModular Construction: \u003C/strong\u003EEach vehicle body is made of only three different pieces.

Plus, if you do wipe out, your precious kerbals and cargoes inside have a much better chance at survival than if you used a regular rover built from stock parts. Frames are rated for 70 m/s impacts, wheels and frames rated to 100 m/s\u003Cem\u003E(Disclaimer: they are rated to SURVIVE impacts at these speeds.
