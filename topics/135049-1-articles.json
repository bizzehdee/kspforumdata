Thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T12:21:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck which version of B9 you are using. The details are in the file\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0B9_Aerospace.version\u003C/strong\u003E and there does seem to be something coming through the works. The version I am using is v6.0.0 and I did get a warning of v6.0.1 from the version manager I use. But then it tried\u00A0to use a link to the defunct Kerbalstuff site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy own preference is to download and install manually. The B9 install puts several plug-ins into GameData, and I can see them in the zipfile and check I have them all. I reckon we\u0027re an an in-between stage, and I would try a v6.0.0 install. That works OK in my system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe B9 mod is pretty well-organised and you can delete sub-folders of \u003Cstrong\u003EParts\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0to remove things you don\u0027t want. The whole thing has also been split into three sections, with the HX-size hulls and Legacy parts. It\u0027s not the only well-organised mod out there, but it\u0027s a good example of how to do it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
