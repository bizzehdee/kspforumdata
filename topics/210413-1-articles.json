Since it was a cancelled project there\u0027s not all that much information to be found about it, but I suspect the USAF\u0027s involvement might mean it was considered as an option for orbital cruise missiles or perhaps defensive rockets as part of... what was it called, the space shield thing that Reagan had in mind.

It\u0027s more complex because it requires a twin shaft turbine design, which means more points of failure (but some fuel or oxygen rich preburners use twin shaft turbines too). The efficiency comes in large part from the fact that your combustion chamber is running on a (hot) gas-gas reaction. I would guess that means the efficiency gains might be a lot lower for hydrogen than for any other fuel.
