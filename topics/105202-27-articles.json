I realy like what you did with MKS/OKS. I am realy entusiast about those modular inflatable part, great stuff. I noticed that You didn\u0027t include storage for TAC resource in them. So I decided to take a look at your life support system. I like the single resource system, its better, but I have some issues with the Life support status, in VAB is empty box, it doesn\u0027t update when I had/remove supply. I have to lunch the ship to see how much time I have left. Is it normal or do I have a issue with my install?\n\nI also have some suggestion (like all my suggestion, its extravagant and allot of work): \n\nI like the idea of riots when out of supply. But instand of having the original team immune to it. Its the badass that should be immune. Right now, the only thing that badass do is smiling all the time, that would be something that make them valuable. Also. instand of having a fixed 15 days without supply. It would be great if it was proportional to (Braveness \u002B Experience) / Dumbness.\n\nJust to go a bit furter, hard mode: Badass could have a chance to control the panicing crews and ration them for a longer period. ( Voice acting: Jeb is Captain Kirk and Valentina is Hellen Riplay. On Hellium of course). If Badass don\u0027t manage to constrain the panicing crew, and over time it will happen, they will riot and start to randomly destroy stuff, crash into something, head straight back Kebin and burn all the fuel etc...\n\nCrew selection is a serious business.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Great work! I have one suggestion though, more roleplay-ish. I like the idea that Kerbal don\u0027t die by default (indeed I\u0027ve done goofed and still do sometimes) and the idea of them going on a strike is funny.\n\u003E I like to pretend that, instead of refusing to work, the advanced kerbal technology has devised an \u0022hibernation\u0022 mode. Whenever they run out of the time they will allow themeselves to be hungry, they sit down and put themselves on stasis (with 0 consumption) for an indeterminate amount of time, programming the Pod to \u0022wake\u0022 them up as soon as supplies are there.\n\u003E \n\u003E I think it fits better the idea of life support. I know it\u0027s totally irrelevant and there\u0027s no need to change anything, but just pitching my idea.\n\nDeep freeze does that with dedicated part. You might want to take a look at it, good stuff."},{"CreatedByName":"Hevak","CreatedById":122200,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T23:53:59Z","Content":"VAB window doesn\u0027t work, it\u0027s the same issue for all I\u0027m pretty sure. Also not sure if it was intended to work like the TAC one where it is for building. Think it was just meant to show the status of what craft you have out already. Idk really.\n\nThe 15 days bit was a conscious choice he made instead of adding resources to every command pod like TAC does, it\u0027s something he never liked about TAC. Also the changing of consumption based on courage/ stupidity/ experience is probably a little bit too difficult to me. It would make it extremely difficult to plan and work with Lifesupport if every kerbal is using the stuff at different rates. It would also probably be quite difficult to code the timers and stuff. Espcially if you have a base or something where you\u0027re adding kerbals later. Like you have a ship with LS for plenty of time left, yet rescue a kerbal or pick up a kerbal to bring home and suddenly you\u0027re now short on Lifesupport and your trip is doomed. \n\nyour other suggestions while some are cool, he will probably say out of scope of the mod. And really I don\u0027t want a feature like that myself. So if anything it would definitely need to be totally optional. And really if it is,I think those kinds of things are better done as a seperate mod that can integrate with the life support mod, or any LS mod if wanted. Just seems like it would be better served as a distinct thing. Just my thoughts.\n\nRE: TAC storage for mks, he simply didn\u0027t make dedicated parts for TAC resources as to not clutter up the parts list, because as he said when he changed mks to USI LS, TAC has plenty of containers to use for it\u0027s own resource storage. MKS still works with TAC though.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n**@Roverdude.**\n\nSo I have had an issue pop up though I\u0027m not sure if it happens every time. I launched a craft up with no supplies into LKO to do the kerbin first contract to dock two ships together. So I launched the first craft, then went back to VAB and launched a second craft exactly the same and then did the whole rendezvous thing. Well when I got into orbit after about idk 30-40 mins or so of game time the first crafts timer in the LS window said it had been in orbit for like 10 days.\n\n then a day or so later of kerbin time, I launched a craft into orbit with a mun lander on it, moved a kerbal pilot to the lander, undocked it and then landed the launch craft. Then I launched the actual craft I was going to send to dock with the lander and carry it to the mun, and had the same issue pop up. This time the timer said that the lander craft had been in orbit for 12 days, really it had only been in orbit for maybe an hour. The craft for the trip to the moon had Lifesupport supplies on it, enough for 50 days. And when I docked with the lander, it immediately lost 12 days worth of supplies that it thought the lander was behind. \n\nVery strange. And I\u0027m trying to see if I can replicate this consistently and find more info about this issue. Other than this I mean everything works fine with Life support. I\u0027m not getting any errors or anything that I can see. And it seems to only happen to timers on ships with no supplies on board and strangely only in LKO. As I sent a quick mun trip flyby with no supplies on it and it never had any issues with the timers. And it\u0027s possibly only craft that has a docking port. Both were stock docking ports. But I\u0027ve sent many craft into orbit and had them there for some time wiith no supplies to launch satellites that had separators on them. And I never noticed an issue with timers on them either.it was only the ones that had docking ports.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T00:02:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 12:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T20:32:49Z","Content":"Really only looked at this briefly so far, but a barrage of questions/feedbacks:\n\nWhat made you decide to put all the parts in the same relatively early tech node?\n\nIs there a GUI to change the settings?

Maybe start with a screenshot of your gamedata folder."},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T15:42:08Z","Content":"It tried to find out when the Nom-O-Matic 5000 is useful for trips. This comparison is USI-LS only and does not include infos about UKS.\n\nHere is a chart from a mass-efficiency point-of-view:\n\n- horizontal axis: number of Kerbals\n\n- vertical axis: number of years of the trip\n\nDifferent Colors:\n\n- Supplies only is best choice\n\n- Supplies \u002B Nom-O-Matic 5000 is best choice\n\n- Supplies \u002B Fertilizer \u002B Nom-O-Matic 25k is best choice\n\n![Bsy7Gk8.png](http://i.imgur.com/Bsy7Gk8.png)\n\nCurrently the following choices are most efficient:\n\n- Up to 3 years: bring your supplies only\n\n- One Kerbal between 7 and 21 years: Nom-O-Matic 5000\n\n- at least 7 years: Nom-O-Matic 25k\n\n- at least 10 Kerbals: Nom-O-Matic 25k\n\n- 4-6 years and 1-9 Kerbals: Supplies or Nom-O-Matic 25k\n\nSo I would bring the Nom-O-Matic 5000 only if I have a single Kerbal on the trip for 7-21 years, which puts the part for me into the category \u0022will probably use it never\u0022.\n\nIn this regard I want to suggest the following change to USI-LS: reduce the mass of Nom-O-Matic 5000 from 1500 kg to 600 kg. (Also tried differrent values, but this would be my favourite)\n\nHere is how the chart looks like with these changes:\n\n![o5taICT.png](http://i.imgur.com/o5taICT.png)\n\nIt looks much more interesting:\n\n- Up to 2 years: Bring your supplies only\n\n- 3 years: Nom-O-Matic 5000\n\n- Single Kerbal 13-28 years: Nom-O-Matic 5000\n\n- at least 13 years: Nom-O-Matic 25k\n\n- rest: Mixture between Nom-O-Matic 5000 and Nom-O-Matic 25k\n\nThis change makes Life support a bit easier, because less mass is needed for some Kerbal-duration combinations.\n\nOn the other hand it makes Life support planning a bit harder, because the decision which method to use with regards to mass efficiency becomes more complex and diverse.\n\n@RoverDude: Don\u0027t know if my suggestion fits into your plan with USI-LS but I wanted to share it anyway."}]}
