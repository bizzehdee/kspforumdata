I realy like what you did with MKS/OKS. I am realy entusiast about those modular inflatable part, great stuff. I noticed that You didn\u0027t include storage for TAC resource in them. So I decided to take a look at your life support system. I like the single resource system, its better, but I have some issues with the Life support status, in VAB is empty box, it doesn\u0027t update when I had/remove supply. I have to lunch the ship to see how much time I have left. Is it normal or do I have a issue with my install?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have some suggestion (like all my suggestion, its extravagant and allot of work): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of riots when out of supply. But instand of having the original team immune to it. Its the badass that should be immune. Right now, the only thing that badass do is smiling all the time, that would be something that make them valuable. Also. instand of having a fixed 15 days without supply. It would be great if it was proportional to (Braveness \u002B Experience) / Dumbness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to go a bit furter, hard mode: Badass could have a chance to control the panicing crews and ration them for a longer period. ( Voice acting: Jeb is Captain Kirk and Valentina is Hellen Riplay. On Hellium of course). If Badass don\u0027t manage to constrain the panicing crew, and over time it will happen, they will riot and start to randomly destroy stuff, crash into something, head straight back Kebin and burn all the fuel etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew selection is a serious business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Heliosmaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Heliosmaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGreat work! I have one suggestion though, more roleplay-ish. I like the idea that Kerbal don\u0027t die by default (indeed I\u0027ve done goofed and still do sometimes) and the idea of them going on a strike is funny.\u003Cp\u003EI like to pretend that, instead of refusing to work, the advanced kerbal technology has devised an \u0022hibernation\u0022 mode. Whenever they run out of the time they will allow themeselves to be hungry, they sit down and put themselves on stasis (with 0 consumption) for an indeterminate amount of time, programming the Pod to \u0022wake\u0022 them up as soon as supplies are there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it fits better the idea of life support. I know it\u0027s totally irrelevant and there\u0027s no need to change anything, but just pitching my idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep freeze does that with dedicated part.

Also not sure if it was intended to work like the TAC one where it is for building. Think it was just meant to show the status of what craft you have out already. Idk really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 15 days bit was a conscious choice he made instead of adding resources to every command pod like TAC does, it\u0027s something he never liked about TAC. Also the changing of consumption based on courage/ stupidity/ experience is probably a little bit too difficult to me. It would make it extremely difficult to plan and work with Lifesupport if every kerbal is using the stuff at different rates. It would also probably be quite difficult to code the timers and stuff. Espcially if you have a base or something where you\u0027re adding kerbals later. Like you have a ship with LS for plenty of time left, yet rescue a kerbal or pick up a kerbal to bring home and suddenly you\u0027re now short on Lifesupport and your trip is doomed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyour other suggestions while some are cool, he will probably say out of scope of the mod. And really I don\u0027t want a feature like that myself. So if anything it would definitely need to be totally optional. And really if it is,I think those kinds of things are better done as a seperate mod that can integrate with the life support mod, or any LS mod if wanted. Just seems like it would be better served as a distinct thing. Just my thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERE: TAC storage for mks, he simply didn\u0027t make dedicated parts for TAC resources as to not clutter up the parts list, because as he said when he changed mks to USI LS, TAC has plenty of containers to use for it\u0027s own resource storage.

I launched a craft up with no supplies into LKO to do the kerbin first contract to dock two ships together. So I launched the first craft, then went back to VAB and launched a second craft exactly the same and then did the whole rendezvous thing. Well when I got into orbit after about idk 30-40 mins or so of game time the first crafts timer in the LS window said it had been in orbit for like 10 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E then a day or so later of kerbin time, I launched a craft into orbit with a mun lander on it, moved a kerbal pilot to the lander, undocked it and then landed the launch craft. Then I launched the actual craft I was going to send to dock with the lander and carry it to the mun, and had the same issue pop up. This time the timer said that the lander craft had been in orbit for 12 days, really it had only been in orbit for maybe an hour. The craft for the trip to the moon had Lifesupport supplies on it, enough for 50 days. And when I docked with the lander, it immediately lost 12 days worth of supplies that it thought the lander was behind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery strange. And I\u0027m trying to see if I can replicate this consistently and find more info about this issue. Other than this I mean everything works fine with Life support. I\u0027m not getting any errors or anything that I can see. And it seems to only happen to timers on ships with no supplies on board and strangely only in LKO. As I sent a quick mun trip flyby with no supplies on it and it never had any issues with the timers. And it\u0027s possibly only craft that has a docking port. Both were stock docking ports. But I\u0027ve sent many craft into orbit and had them there for some time wiith no supplies to launch satellites that had separators on them. And I never noticed an issue with timers on them either.it was only the ones that had docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T00:02:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 12:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T20:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally only looked at this briefly so far, but a barrage of questions/feedbacks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat made you decide to put all the parts in the same relatively early tech node?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a GUI to change the settings?
