Eventually of course I decided to try one mod out, MechJeb (Go figure, right?) however I didn\u0027t actually use it for it\u0027s autopilot, I just sort of love how it puts all the info I should know on the screen for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now I have come to a bit of a dilemma... The problem is, MechJeb was like a \u0022gateway\u0022 mod because after I got it, I got another mod, then another, and another, and the list just kept getting bigger and bigger as time went on... (For example I just got 3 more mods today!) Of course this isn\u0027t really posing a problem as of this current moment in time since I avoid mods that make things too easy or clutter up the parts list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally I am just concerned that one day I\u0027ll have some 50 item long mod list, and even though I\u0027m only at 18 mods currently, I\u0027m already finding myself asking the question \u0022How many mods is too many mods?\u0022 because I really don\u0027t want to get too detached from stock. So I guess really the question here is, \u003Cstrong\u003Ein your opinion, what do you think is too many mods?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just for the sake of the topic I\u0027m going to go ahead and list all of my current mods below, under basic categories of why I got them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConvenience\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrewManifest\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaystack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalAlarmClock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubassemblyLoader\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuantum Struts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActions on the Fly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInformation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnginner Redux\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtractor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELogomatic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGameplay\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChallenge\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadlyReentry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIoncross Crew Support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoteTech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoteTech Probe Compatibility\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairing Factory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISA Mapsat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Attachment System\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-15T10:28:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2013 10:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by CoriW\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T10:30:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no such thing as many mods, as long as your computer can handle it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, most things that you\u0027ve mentioned are \u003Cstrong\u003Eplugins\u003C/strong\u003E, which are just \u003Cem\u003Eone of the two classifications of mods\u003C/em\u003E, the other one which is \u003Cstrong\u003Epart add-ons\u003C/strong\u003E, which are further subdivided into two: \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Enormal part add-ons\u003C/span\u003E (just add them in your parts folder) and \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eplugin-powered part add-ons\u003C/span\u003E (parts that won\u0027t work properly or at all without installing a specific plugin for it to work).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, \u003Cstrong\u003EMods \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A0 Plugins.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-15T10:33:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2013 10:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Flixxbeatz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROFLCopter64bit","CreatedById":58314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T10:36:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe over 6.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lyndonguitar","CreatedById":61194,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T10:39:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs long as KSP don\u0027t reach the 3.5 Gb of ram usage. doesn\u0027t matter how much ram you got, as long as you get more than 3.5gb for KSP.exe, you will crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had tons of mod, before, when I start the game it is already around 3.2 gb, a little bit of playing and I would get past 3.5gb and It will crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI reduced the textures to half, and it\u0027s now using 2.2 gb, and doesn\u0027t crash anymore, and I got more room for mods!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uncle Mort","CreatedById":57933,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T10:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELoads of mods\u003C/em\u003E (to paraphrase Harry Enfield)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zanderzoo","CreatedById":65268,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T10:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is no such thing as many mods, as long as your computer can handle it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, that\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s not right.
