I don\u0027t know if Unity engine deals with varying friction of surfaces, but if it does it would be neat to have a place where when you land there you can, essentially, go EVA and ice-scate around using your jetpack (and have the challenge of it being hard to stop, and hard to get your lander to stop sliding.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not a request for a new planet. I\u0027d be happy with just altering an existing location to be like this. Minmus\u0027s flat bottomlands seem like an obvious choice for this as they almost already look like ice sheets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T11:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbin and Duna poles could do that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut i belive the ground friction needs a reworking as now it seems its the same for every place with a surface\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T16:49:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont know if Unity engine has anything to do with physical calculations of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut idea itself is really interesting!
