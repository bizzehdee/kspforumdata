Day and night, they researched and built the craft, until eventually, they have finished it. 19,300,000 bucks had been spent on the materials and a further 846,870,000 more on R\u0026amp;D. It was hoped that this jet could challenge the Kruolan air supremacy. Alas, only 12 were made.\u00A0The latest model, with a cone intake, was the best performing model, but the project had to be cancelled due to lack of funding, and the fact that they needed a new ground unit to fight with. So the project was forgotten, never used in the war.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
