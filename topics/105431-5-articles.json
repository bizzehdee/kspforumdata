Air intakes do seem to be sort of a diminishing return thing. I believe the ratio for the Sojourn Prototypes is 2 to 1; they have 4 intake air and two engines. Thus, you may want to be careful and make sure if you add more intakes than engines that you\u0027re getting more bang for your buck. They do create drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Overheating is aggravated by having parts not lined up with your velocity vector. The \u0022velocity vector\u0022, if you don\u0027t know, is basically the direction your aircraft is flying relative to the air around you. It can often be different than the orientation of your aircraft with respect to the air around it. So, try to angle long nose cones, engines poking out the back, and other such things to include perhaps parts of the fuselage slightly to match your expected \u0022angle of attack\u0022 - which is the difference between your velocity vector and where the center line if your aircraft is pointing. For my Sojourn, it\u0027s usually around 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. I think I read somewhere that in real life, the SR-71 Black Bird has an AoA of around 7.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 way up there at high altitudes. But leave your wings straight! Angling them would defeat the purpose. They generate the needed lift at their natural angle, unless it is a specific design example where there is an exception. And of course, hiding wings too tightly together or behind things may have consequences, I\u0027m not sure, but my guess is you\u0027d want to avoid that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Drag cross section profile as it relates to the velocity vector is very important and so you should try to get as many of the lifting surfaces and other components of your aircraft in line with the velocity vector as much as possible without really screwing up your stability or functionality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Unnecessary components - get rid of them. If there is anything on your aircraft that isn\u0027t serving a purpose, or that could accomplish the same mission with less mass or drag, or more lift or thrust, you should look at it with severe scrutiny. That is, if you want every edge you can get. My Sojourn isn\u0027t perfect and could probably be improved upon, but it was optimized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. As far as piloting your craft, try to learn to use your pitch trim to adjust your nose up or down in relation to the velocity vector. This saved a large amount of fatigue and tenseness in my body when flying circumnavigation, and it also makes it a lot easier to maintain a consistent altitude. You do it by pressing Alt \u002B S to pitch up - keep pressing it for small increments. Alt \u002B W to pitch down. Alt \u002B X to reset your pitch trim - don\u0027t forget to do this when you decide to leave your current altitude and decide to descend! It can result in a sudden, unexpected loss of control and it can be dangerous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aetharan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aetharan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGeez, MunGazer.

Making this entry was somewhat easier for me since it was based on my first 1.0 submission - it mainly required angling of the engines and their pre-coolers to avoid overheating for that sustained 1427 m/s flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish you the best of luck in your engineering endeavors, as well as everyone, and I\u0027d encourage you to focus on a systematic approach to beating my design - really think through what would be better than whoever holds the record with regard to thrust to drag ratio, lift, etc. It\u0027s a tricky balance. To be honest, circumnavigating makes it a tad easier for me since I don\u0027t have the complicated problem of knowing how far to extend from KSC and what not. However, the design of the craft does need to meet certain standards for circumnavigation capability, namely efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother beautiful thing about this competition is that it does require a bit of piloting skill as well as good engineering.

However, I\u0027m sure that the craft could be controlled enough for level flight for some duration and still hit that same speed mark. I\u0027m only mentioning all this in the interest of other competitors who may make crafts that adhere to the technicalities of the rules. I probably won\u0027t make an open class entry, I did a lot of work for my iron man class one and I\u0027m kinda pooped and stumbling around figuring out what to build next. Nevertheless, it\u0027s Slashy\u0027s competition and he will dictate. He may also adjust the rules - as he said, he\u0027s sort of figuring out this stuff as he goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo address your confusion about coasting up for altitude, I\u0027ll try to explain. Again, Slashy is the ultimate authority here. I\u0027m just active in this thread so I feel compelled to help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life, altitude records are often about sheer altitude, and not the ability to sustain level flight at that altitude for a respectable duration like it is here in this game challenge. So, in this challenge, if it weren\u0027t for the rules and it was just about sheer altitude alone, I could in theory make a single stage to orbit air breathing engine powered projectile that gains insane speed in the atmosphere, and even after the engines have died from lack of oxygen, it could have enough momentum and velocity left to soar off out into space, and who knows how far it could go. That, or it could easily reach the edge of the atmosphere with little effort. There could be several hundred thousand entries that could do that, and it wouldn\u0027t seem challenging, thus the term \u0022challenge\u0022. I haven\u0027t explored the limits of escape velocities established only using air breathing engines, but even if you stayed within Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, you\u0027d basically be in orbit in the scenario of leaving the atmosphere - and at that point, is it really an altitude achievement? As Slashy said, this competition is about exploring the limits of ksp aerodynamics.
