I\u0027ll build something capable of competing!"},{"CreatedByName":"MunGazer","CreatedById":141954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:46:58Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to throw in some of the lessons I\u0027ve learned in engineering these crafts for the more advanced players that are on the fence about this competition and maybe give them some pointers to get them on the board:\n\n1. Air intakes do seem to be sort of a diminishing return thing. I believe the ratio for the Sojourn Prototypes is 2 to 1; they have 4 intake air and two engines. Thus, you may want to be careful and make sure if you add more intakes than engines that you\u0027re getting more bang for your buck. They do create drag.\n\n2. Overheating is aggravated by having parts not lined up with your velocity vector. The \u0022velocity vector\u0022, if you don\u0027t know, is basically the direction your aircraft is flying relative to the air around you. It can often be different than the orientation of your aircraft with respect to the air around it. So, try to angle long nose cones, engines poking out the back, and other such things to include perhaps parts of the fuselage slightly to match your expected \u0022angle of attack\u0022 - which is the difference between your velocity vector and where the center line if your aircraft is pointing. For my Sojourn, it\u0027s usually around 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. I think I read somewhere that in real life, the SR-71 Black Bird has an AoA of around 7.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 way up there at high altitudes. But leave your wings straight! Angling them would defeat the purpose. They generate the needed lift at their natural angle, unless it is a specific design example where there is an exception. And of course, hiding wings too tightly together or behind things may have consequences, I\u0027m not sure, but my guess is you\u0027d want to avoid that.\n\n3. Drag cross section profile as it relates to the velocity vector is very important and so you should try to get as many of the lifting surfaces and other components of your aircraft in line with the velocity vector as much as possible without really screwing up your stability or functionality. \n\n4. Unnecessary components - get rid of them. If there is anything on your aircraft that isn\u0027t serving a purpose, or that could accomplish the same mission with less mass or drag, or more lift or thrust, you should look at it with severe scrutiny. That is, if you want every edge you can get. My Sojourn isn\u0027t perfect and could probably be improved upon, but it was optimized.\n\n5. As far as piloting your craft, try to learn to use your pitch trim to adjust your nose up or down in relation to the velocity vector. This saved a large amount of fatigue and tenseness in my body when flying circumnavigation, and it also makes it a lot easier to maintain a consistent altitude. You do it by pressing Alt \u002B S to pitch up - keep pressing it for small increments. Alt \u002B W to pitch down. Alt \u002B X to reset your pitch trim - don\u0027t forget to do this when you decide to leave your current altitude and decide to descend! It can result in a sudden, unexpected loss of control and it can be dangerous. \n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Geez, MunGazer. That\u0027s an impressive flight. I\u0027m not sure I have any chance at all of beating it-- certainly not with the Skypiercer, even slightly modified. Going to have to hit square one again. Still, I\u0027m learning lessons both from my own trial-and-error and from your beating me. I\u0027ll build something capable of competing!\n\nLol thanks man. This whole thing is a blast. That first craft you made back in 1.0 was jaw dropping. Making this entry was somewhat easier for me since it was based on my first 1.0 submission - it mainly required angling of the engines and their pre-coolers to avoid overheating for that sustained 1427 m/s flight.\n\nI wish you the best of luck in your engineering endeavors, as well as everyone, and I\u0027d encourage you to focus on a systematic approach to beating my design - really think through what would be better than whoever holds the record with regard to thrust to drag ratio, lift, etc. It\u0027s a tricky balance. To be honest, circumnavigating makes it a tad easier for me since I don\u0027t have the complicated problem of knowing how far to extend from KSC and what not. However, the design of the craft does need to meet certain standards for circumnavigation capability, namely efficiency.\n\nAnother beautiful thing about this competition is that it does require a bit of piloting skill as well as good engineering. Honestly this is a tougher piloting challenge for me than Microsoft Flight Simulator X or X Plane 10.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T01:52:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer**"},{"CreatedByName":"MunGazer","CreatedById":141954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T04:51:02Z","Content":"In one of the other threads, someone in 1.0.2 saw my old 1.0 submission and thought I must be using no re-entry heat.

And that isn\u0027t easy to do in the new 1.0.2 aero.\n\nTo try and help you understand/answer the question in your post, I can quote some of the original rules that were set forth, this is from Slashy:\n\n**-Record must be recorded in level flight. No zoom climbs or dives to pad your results.**\n\n**\u0022Level flight\u0022 to me means that it has achieved an equillibrium state where the altitude and speed will not degrade over time.**\n\nIn the screen shot where you\u0027re doing 1,500\u002B m/s, your vertical speed indicator is pointing straight up, and the question is also raised of whether or not the craft can sustain such speed - \u0022equilibrium\u0022. However, I\u0027m sure that the craft could be controlled enough for level flight for some duration and still hit that same speed mark. I\u0027m only mentioning all this in the interest of other competitors who may make crafts that adhere to the technicalities of the rules. I probably won\u0027t make an open class entry, I did a lot of work for my iron man class one and I\u0027m kinda pooped and stumbling around figuring out what to build next. Nevertheless, it\u0027s Slashy\u0027s competition and he will dictate. He may also adjust the rules - as he said, he\u0027s sort of figuring out this stuff as he goes.\n\nTo address your confusion about coasting up for altitude, I\u0027ll try to explain. Again, Slashy is the ultimate authority here. I\u0027m just active in this thread so I feel compelled to help.\n\nIn real life, altitude records are often about sheer altitude, and not the ability to sustain level flight at that altitude for a respectable duration like it is here in this game challenge. So, in this challenge, if it weren\u0027t for the rules and it was just about sheer altitude alone, I could in theory make a single stage to orbit air breathing engine powered projectile that gains insane speed in the atmosphere, and even after the engines have died from lack of oxygen, it could have enough momentum and velocity left to soar off out into space, and who knows how far it could go. That, or it could easily reach the edge of the atmosphere with little effort. There could be several hundred thousand entries that could do that, and it wouldn\u0027t seem challenging, thus the term \u0022challenge\u0022. I haven\u0027t explored the limits of escape velocities established only using air breathing engines, but even if you stayed within Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, you\u0027d basically be in orbit in the scenario of leaving the atmosphere - and at that point, is it really an altitude achievement? As Slashy said, this competition is about exploring the limits of ksp aerodynamics. That\u0027s the best I can offer you to explain it for now, but feel free to ask further questions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T06:58:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 06:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Three1415","CreatedById":85754,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T06:56:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Level flight\u0022 to me means that it has achieved an equillibrium state where the altitude and speed will not degrade over time.\n\nThis is still easily exploited--I know I can make a suborbital hop, then activate engines with an angle of attack of ~70 degrees and stabilize my altitude at about 32km, but I still never could have gotten to that height without zoom climbing; thus, I am confused as to whether or not such strategies are legal. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E In the screen shot where you\u0027re doing 1,500\u002B m/s, your vertical speed indicator is pointing straight up, and the question is also raised of whether or not the craft can sustain such speed - \u0022equilibrium\u0022.\n\nYes, but if you look at my prograde marker, you see that my AoA is less than five degrees, and indeed I was attempting to lower the nose as my fuel cut out.
