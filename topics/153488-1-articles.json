They may be too rarely visited and little involved in gameplay compared to the Kerbin Three, but if any rock in the solar system needs attention, it\u0027s one of these. Duna is way too monotonous (but it has been revamped according to recent Devnotes). Moho is a big, hot rock, and has the Mohole as a great landmark, but is otherwise quite bland. Eve is fine, as is Gilly, both being rather unique and serve their role as mid-game destinations decently enough. One has a lot of atmosphere and a lot of gravity, the other has very little gravity and no atmosphere.
