In that case, the bottom of my rocket was slightly below the VAB floor. My rocket was actually fine on launch, but if I warped time on the launch pad, coming out of warp would cause the pad to burst into flames and become a devastated ruin. (The rocket continued to be fine.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaising the craft slightly in the VAB fixed the problem, so I suspect the issue is that clipping your rocket into the launch pad causes it to be destroyed in much the same way that crashing into it would have that effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jod","CreatedById":68384,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T19:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was just about to create a topic about this.
