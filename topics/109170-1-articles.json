All parts imaginable.. how does this affect their function? For example fuel tanks clipped into each other, are either\u0027s capacity affected? Air intakes clipped into wings, is their intake capacity affected? Or is nothing affected at all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso...I put some winglets halfway up a rocket, in an attempt to help with stability, but it brought the lift too far up, so I tried reducing their profile by embedding them with the offset tool. However this did not affect the lift profile at all (the lift indicator in the building area). Got me thinking how clipped parts are modelled for aerodynamics (drag \u0026amp; lift)? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcuse my laziness of asking over testing all myself. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E But I\u0027m sure this is old hat for most...and it can be answered a lot easier than me testing it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (I did a search, but came up blank)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T14:15:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Watoh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T12:16:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClipping doesn\u0027t affect anything about how the part functions in the game. For instance, a radially attached part is still treated for game purposes as if it\u0027s stuck out the side even if you move it inside, so no drag savings, it\u0027s still exposed to reentry heat, etc. So in this regard, clipping is just for looks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, clipping DOES affected how parts interact with each other during animations and also with EVA Kerbals, and this can invoke the Kraken. Animations in KSP are irresistible forces capable of pulling ships apart so it\u0027s always best to give them enough elbow room to do their thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: You have a Mk 1 airplane fuselage. Somewhere in this fuselage you have the 1.25m service bay. You attach the NBS ore scanner (the \u0022hexagon on a stick\u0022) to the INSIDE of the service bay. It\u0027s too long to fit completely in there so clips into whatever part you attach to the outside of the service bay. All is well until you turn the scanner on, at which point it starts rotating. And when it starts rotating, it tears the ship apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T12:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Eand this can invoke the Kraken. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case you\u0027re wondering, the Kraken is this god-like mysterious thing the community made up.

The Kraken is the Lord of Chaos, the embodiment of the Formless Void which existed long before anything else, and shall continue to exist forever after all else has passed away. The Kraken allows Kerbals (and humans) to carve out small enclaves in his Chaos, where they think their so-called Laws of Physics work and where they feel safe. And then the Kraken periodically manifests there to remind them of how things really stand. It is thus a good idea always to carry a few extra Kerbals to sacrifice to the Kraken, to prevent him from attacking even ships without clipping \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T13:24:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClipping just takes patience, its easy to summon the kraken when clipping parts, heck i have a few craft that you load and they instantly just blow up on the runway for no reason, its quite funny.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Watoh","CreatedById":141707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T14:14:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo off-setting is just for \u0027looks\u0027 and has no real world effect.
