All parts imaginable.. how does this affect their function? For example fuel tanks clipped into each other, are either\u0027s capacity affected? Air intakes clipped into wings, is their intake capacity affected? Or is nothing affected at all?\n\nAlso...I put some winglets halfway up a rocket, in an attempt to help with stability, but it brought the lift too far up, so I tried reducing their profile by embedding them with the offset tool. However this did not affect the lift profile at all (the lift indicator in the building area). Got me thinking how clipped parts are modelled for aerodynamics (drag \u0026 lift)? \n\nExcuse my laziness of asking over testing all myself. ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif) But I\u0027m sure this is old hat for most...and it can be answered a lot easier than me testing it. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) (I did a search, but came up blank)\n\nThanks for any help.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T14:15:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Watoh**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T12:16:41Z","Content":"Clipping doesn\u0027t affect anything about how the part functions in the game. For instance, a radially attached part is still treated for game purposes as if it\u0027s stuck out the side even if you move it inside, so no drag savings, it\u0027s still exposed to reentry heat, etc. So in this regard, clipping is just for looks.\n\nHOWEVER, clipping DOES affected how parts interact with each other during animations and also with EVA Kerbals, and this can invoke the Kraken. Animations in KSP are irresistible forces capable of pulling ships apart so it\u0027s always best to give them enough elbow room to do their thing.\n\nExample: You have a Mk 1 airplane fuselage. Somewhere in this fuselage you have the 1.25m service bay. You attach the NBS ore scanner (the \u0022hexagon on a stick\u0022) to the INSIDE of the service bay. It\u0027s too long to fit completely in there so clips into whatever part you attach to the outside of the service bay. All is well until you turn the scanner on, at which point it starts rotating. And when it starts rotating, it tears the ship apart."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T12:20:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E and this can invoke the Kraken.\n\nIn case you\u0027re wondering, the Kraken is this god-like mysterious thing the community made up.

Blasphemer! The Kraken is the One True God. The Kraken is the Lord of Chaos, the embodiment of the Formless Void which existed long before anything else, and shall continue to exist forever after all else has passed away. The Kraken allows Kerbals (and humans) to carve out small enclaves in his Chaos, where they think their so-called Laws of Physics work and where they feel safe. And then the Kraken periodically manifests there to remind them of how things really stand. It is thus a good idea always to carry a few extra Kerbals to sacrifice to the Kraken, to prevent him from attacking even ships without clipping ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)."},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T13:24:27Z","Content":"Clipping just takes patience, its easy to summon the kraken when clipping parts, heck i have a few craft that you load and they instantly just blow up on the runway for no reason, its quite funny."},{"CreatedByName":"Watoh","CreatedById":141707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T14:14:27Z","Content":"Ok thanks.\n\nSo off-setting is just for \u0027looks\u0027 and has no real world effect.

I was hoping some small fins embedded would minimise the negative effect on the 1st stage and get some beneficial effect on 2nd stage.

I think its really clipping that was unclear. I assume if i had used the off set tool to move the fins up and down it would have altered the point of lift, same as placing them up \u0026 down."}]}
