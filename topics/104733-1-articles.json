Adding an orbit and a return trip means that you have to be able to slow down at the target body and in order to return quickly you will need to do all of your maneuvers without having a good transfer window. \n\nTo make it simpler, landing at the target body is not required, instead you just need to establish a circular orbit within 50 km of the surface (for airless bodies) or the top of the atmosphere (low orbit). After your orbit is established, simply turn back for Kerbin and then land safely and check your MET (mission elapsed time).\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1. Send at least 1 kerbal on an interplanetary journey to orbit another body and return safely back at Kerbin as fast as possible.\n\n2. The target body can be anything other than the Mun or Minmus (needs to be an interplanetary trip). Part of this challenge is seeing how well you cope with bad phase angles and expensive transfer burns.\n\n3. You must have a circular orbit at the target body no more than 50 km above the surface for airless bodies or 50 km above the top of the atmosphere as appropriate. A screenshot of this is essential.\n\n4. Landing at the target body is NOT required, but feel free to do it at your pleasure.\n\n5. No command seats allowed, your kerbal needs to be indoors.\n\n6. No cheats. Same basic stuff from all other challeneges here. No debug or hyperedit, kraken drives, infinigliders, config file edits, hidden aces up your sleeves, etc.\n\n7. **Stock** parts only. Mods like KER, MechJeb and similar non-part mods are ok.\n\n8. Leaderboard will be based entirely on the lowest MET achieved upon landing at Kerbin.\n\n**Leaderboard:**\n\n**Duna:**\n\n108d 3h 41m - Kelderek\n\nHere\u0027s an example Duna run:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
