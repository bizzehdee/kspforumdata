View full album](//imgur.com/a/x78KA)\n\n**Purpose:** A set of [Canadarm2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Servicing_System) look-alike parts, for building your own robotic arms. Includes rotating joints, latching end effector and grapple fixture. (Moving parts requires Infernal Robotics.)\n\n**Download:**\n\n- **Requires** [Infernal Robotics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116064) to be installed first.\n- Install with [\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067) using **\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E.exe install RKE-Kanadarm**\n- [RKE_Kanadarm-0.11.0.zip](https://bitbucket.org/spudbean/rke_kanadarm/downloads/RKE_Kanadarm-0.11.0.zip) from Bitbucket.\n- [From CurseForge](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/228505-rke-kanadarm).\n\n**Source:**\n\n- [Source code.](https://bitbucket.org/spudbean/rke_kanadarm/)\n- License: This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\n**Features** (also see album above)\n\n- **Main Parts**: LEE (Latching End Effector), PDGF (Power Data Grapple Fixture), Rotating joints (shoulder/elbow/wrists). LEE and PDGF are docking ports (they can only dock with each other).\n- **Arm Parts**: various sized poles for creating various sized robotic arms.\n- Can be arranged in unlimited combinations (Canadarm, Canadarm2, etc.).\n\n**How to use**\n\n- The LEE and PDGF are docking ports. Once they are close enough together, they will dock together like any docking port would.\n- NB: The LEE and PDGF can\u0027t dock with the stock docking ports.\n- Use the Rotating Joint and structural arms (or your other favorite parts) to make a robotic arm.\n- There are two Rotating Joints, one that stacks or surface attaches via it\u0027s base, and one that attaches via the copper-coloured rotating part. If you attach a joint in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and it remains \u0022transprent\u0022, then try spinning it around to its other attach point, or use the other Rotating Joint.\n- **Please \u0022Known Issues\u0022 below regarding self-docking!**\n\n**Supported/recommended Mods:**\n\n- **(REQUIRED) [thread=116064]MSI Infernal Robotics[/thread]**: A recent version of Infernal Robotics (otherwise the rotors will not work).\n- (Optional) **[thread=70161]Connected Living Space[/thread]**: Kerbals cannot pass through the LEE and PDFG when CLS is installed.\n- (Optional) **[thread=113111]Kerbal Inventory System[/thread]**: The PDGF Grapple Fixture is grabbable in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is useful if you forgot to put in a PDGF when building your craft -- just send Jeb out there on EVA and attach a PDGF where you need it. Screwdriver not included.\n- (Optional) **[thread=57603]RasterPropMonitor[/thread]**: The LEE has a camera that will show up in RPM\u0027s external camera list.\n- (Optional) **Docking**: Docking aids such as [thread=43901]Docking Port Alignment Indicator[/thread] and [thread=54303]Navball docking alignment indicator[/thread] can help align your LEE and PDGF (since they are actually docking ports).\n- (Optional) **[thread=59005]Active Texture Management[/thread]**: RKE Kanadarm\u0027s parts uses a moderate amount of game memory usage. Textures are 512x512 and many parts reuse textures. If you are using many mods and running out of game memory then consider using ATM.\n- (Suggestion) **[thread=93818]QuantumStrutsContinued[/thread]**: A long robotic arm has a tendency to wobble in flight. Use a Quantum Strut or two to \u0022lock\u0022 an arm into position.\n\n**Changelog:**\n\n0.10 (24 May 2015)\n\n- Now works with KSP 1.0.x.\n\n0.10 (12 March 2015)\n\n- Added 4m and 6m structural arms.\n- The PDGF Grapple Fix is now grabble via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\n0.9 (11 March 2015)\n\n- Initial release.\n\n**Roadmap:**\n\n- Please make suggestions!\n\n**Reporting problems**\n\n- Add a comment to this thread, or:\n- [Bug tracker](https://bitbucket.org/spudbean/rke_kanadarm/issues?status=new\u0026status=open).\n\n**Notes and Known Issues:**\n\n- Self-docking: Just like the real Canadarm2, your Kanadarm can have a LEE on both ends, and inchworm itself from one PDGF to another. When you undock a previously docked LEE, you may find the Infernal Robotics GUI doesn\u0027t control the parts correctly, or you may even experience other Kraken-derived behaviour. **To fix this, simply reload the scene** (e.g. by pressing F5/F9, or going to the Space Center and back). Seriously: if you are moving parts with Infernal Robotics and cause the vessel to dock with itself, **reload the scene before moving any more parts.**\n- As it says on the Infernal Robotics, **Do not attach IR parts directly to docking ports. It will make your life miserable. You have been warned!**. Remember that the LEE and PDGF are docking ports. If you run into this problem, there is a small spacer in the pack to keep the LEE and rotating joints separated.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-13T18:25:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2022 06:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**\n  \nLink to defunct download site removed by moderator"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T04:42:37Z","Content":"Its just what I always wanted!! \u003C3"},{"CreatedByName":"falken","CreatedById":17316,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T08:17:21Z","Content":"gotta test this!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\ne: You should make the power grapple fixtures KAS grabbable, so you can move nodes about for the arm to inchworm where it pleases, and also to remove surplus ports."},{"CreatedByName":"spudbean","CreatedById":66541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T08:28:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You should make the power grapple fixtures KAS grabbable\n\nBrilliant idea, will be in the next release!"},{"CreatedByName":"falken","CreatedById":17316,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T08:33:18Z","Content":"No problem.\n\nI\u0027ve given this a quick test and I really like it.

I was trying to balance in my mind having useful arms of various sizes, and not spamming user\u0027s Utility panel in the VAB with all my parts. I did make the elbow and structural arms PhysicsSignificance = 1 in their .cfg, which makes them like the stock Cubic Octagonal Strut -- super strong when stacked together (and afaict with no other down sides). So you can stack the current 2m arms together to make the lengths you want with little-or-no extra wobble.\n\nBut: an extra 4m and 6m part isn\u0027t spamming the part list, so yep I\u0027ll put it on the TODO."},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T10:34:18Z","Content":"The Rotating joints dont work for me.

The LEE and the PDGF are technically just docking ports, and you need both for them to grab together. You can technically dock two PDGFs together, or two LEEs together, and for aesthetics it is the LEE and the PDGF that should dock together. Note that the LEE and PDGF are different \u0022types\u0022 of docking ports to the stock docking port set. Just as you can\u0027t dock a Clamp-o-tron to a Clamp-o-tron-Jr, you can\u0027t dock a LEE/PDGF to any of the stock docking ports.\n\nI\u0027ll update the forum page above with a \u0022HOW TO USE\u0022 later tonight.\n\n(Just some further rationale on the docking ports: There are other approaches I could have taken with the LEE. For example, I experimented with the Magnet function from Kerbal Attachment System. A Magnet does make it easier to grab any old thing (which is useful), but a Magnet doesn\u0027t weld two vessels together like a docking port and hence you wouldn\u0027t be able to do the end-of-end inchworming to move a robotic arm from one position on a space station to another. Because if you change scene or even timewarp then KSP doesn\u0027t really deal with the Magnet very well. This inchworming was an important usecase for me, and I also wanted to achieve a similar aesthetic to the real Canadarm which does in fact require a PDFG latch. If you find the LEE/PDFG pairing a problem, you could try just using the KAS Magnet at the end of the RKE arm instead of the RKE-LEE.)"},{"CreatedByName":"spudbean","CreatedById":66541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T11:52:04Z","Content":"Updated for v0.10:\n\n- Added 4m and 6m structural arms.\n- The PDGF Grapple Fix is now grabble via KAS.\n\nThanks for the suggestions and support, everyone!"},{"CreatedByName":"falken","CreatedById":17316,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T11:55:24Z","Content":"Unlike every other attempt I have made to make a robotic arm with IR, this is the only one that did not wobble like mad except for a bit of wobble at the arm end with the dock ing node.
