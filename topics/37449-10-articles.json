While I was playing around with the configs last night I noticed you just divided density by four. If you multiply resource density by four while reducing the amount stored by a given container by the same amount you end up carrying exactly the same amount of resource. This is why I think a separate config file would correct the issue. Alternatively, have the mod run on 24-hour and provide configs for 6-hour base.

This is the same sort of issue you run into when tracking the resource in something like cubic liters or meters (although, to be fair, dividing by four isn\u0027t exactly hard). The tracking station and all in-game times are displayed in a human 24-hour format which means that, while the 6 hour time is great for role-playing, it isn\u0027t exactly practical or clear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"15nelsoc","CreatedById":57328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T00:57:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E-edit-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIssue Resolved.
