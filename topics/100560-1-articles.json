You might even want a larger wing for this, like the small deltas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an alternative, take off the nacelles and make up the extra fuel by extending the fuselage with Mk 3 parts. With swept wings (and possibly less wing; you have a lot), you don\u0027t need the extra 4 RAPIERs.

While I can calculate exactly how much I have to take to get to orbit with rockets I tend to take extra \u0027just in case\u0027 for space planes and thus making things worse because of increased weight. dV calculator from KER or MJ are virtually useless so, more frequently than not, I simply take a wild guess.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I dunno about FAR; I do however know some magic formulas that work for stock aero, and that includes fuel. The general rule there for RAPIERs is 40 units of Liquid Fuel per tonne of mass at takeoff, and 25 units of Oxidizer per tonne of mass at takeoff. That number assumes the engine will switch over to rocket mode with the craft going 1750 m/s at whatever altitude you\u0027re at (and therein lies the difference between FAR and stock aero - I don\u0027t know how fast the RAPIERs will get you while you\u0027ve still got air to work with).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, my design process for figuring out fuel load typically goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Determine the mass of the payload. This is anything besides engines, fuel tanks, wings and intakes. The command module counts as payload, your cargo bay mass counts, anything in the cargo bay counts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Multiply that mass by four - assume that\u0027s going to be the takeoff mass of the plane. That\u0027s going to give you a \u002225% payload fraction\u0022, which is what a lousy spaceplane design will usually give you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Determine the number of engines needed to get that into orbit. For stock aero, the rule for RAPIERs is 13 tonnes per engine at takeoff. Your 54 tonne plane would require five RAPIERs in stock. My understanding is that the nerfing the Turbojet and RAPIER received in FAR was done to prevent those engines from being so powerful they\u0027d rip your plane apart, and that the more realistic atmospheric pressure profile with height compensates for it (takeway there - you might consider reducing the number of engines on your plane. Whatever floats your boat there).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Now - and this is key - that maximum mass per engine is what you assume for determining fuel. If you\u0027ve got 8 RAPIERs, you assume each one will lift its maximum tonnage of 13 tonnes, so you assume the takeoff mass of the plane will be 13*8 = 104 tonnes. So you need 104*40 = 4160 units of Liquid Fuel and 104*25 = 2600 units of Oxidizer. If you\u0027ve got 5 RAPIERs, you assume each one will lift its maximum tonnage of 13 tonnes, so you assume the takeoff mass of the plane will be 13*5 = 65 tonnes. So you need 65*40 = 2600 units of Liquid Fuel and 65*25 = 1625 units of Oxidizer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no tank in the game that gives you a 1.6:1 LF/LOX ratio - those Mk2 Rocket Fuel Tanks certainly don\u0027t - so you usually have to wind up draining oxidizer from the tank. For the 65 tonne example, you could use a Mk3 Rocket Fuel Fuselage; it\u0027d put you 350 units short on Liquid Fuel, but you can make up that difference easily enough with outboard fuel tanks and adapters (like those Mk2 Bicouplers you\u0027re already using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, I use stock aero - though I\u0027m thinking of making the switch and I\u0027ve been asking these kinds of questions about how things work in FAR.
