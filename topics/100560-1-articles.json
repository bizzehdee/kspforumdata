Tbh, I\u0027m surprised you can get it to lift without canards or a tail plane... You might do well to just make it longer, even if you use empty fuel tanks to do it. I\u0027d also suggest moving the nacelles forward, as this will shift the CoM away from the back end, so the tailfin will naturally fall further behind it.\n\nWith the CoM moved (ideally to the centre of the cargo bay), you can shrink and move the main wing forward, which then gives you space for a tail plane. That should help stabilise the flight, as the CoL will be above the CoM, meaning the plane will want to stay the right way up. A little upsweep on the wing tips will help keep roll under control.\n\nOverall, I\u0027ve had much more success with longer MK3 planes than small ones.

A good flight plan for a spaceplane is to hit mach-5 on air breathing engines, as high as you can possibly get. The best I\u0027ve seen using FAR is Wanderfound\u0027s [Kerbodyne Dolphin](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90747-Kerbodyne-SSTO-Division-Omnibus-Thread?p=1727067\u0026viewfull=1#post1727067) which can be stretched all the way to 37km on air. Most of mine are lucky to break 30km, but this is acceptable with enough spare fuel. Needing rockets before 25km generally means a failed design that won\u0027t break the atmosphere.\n\nPoint is, that you know that mach 5 is about 1500m/s. You also know that orbital speed in LKO is ~2200m/s. Without air drag, if you kicked to rockets at mach 5, you\u0027d need 700 delta-v. You can assume that getting to mach 5 will take \u0027a bit\u0027 of fuel. Not a huge amount in general. Take maybe 10% of the oxidiser out of the biggest tank, put your rapiers in rocket mode in the SPH, and see what delta-v KER is showing you. Less than 2000 would make me suspicious that it won\u0027t get to orbit and be able to de-orbit safely.\n\nWhat\u0027s throwing you off is that the weight, lift, drag, and TWR of your plane are all variables that are specific to the design, as is the altitude at which you\u0027ll be switching to rocket mode. Lift and drag are much higher than in conventional rocketry, which is why the whole exercise is much harder. This is where \u0027fly it and see\u0027 comes in ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nMy suggestion would be to overkill: i.e. design and test using the maximum load you ever want to lift. Over the last week, I\u0027ve been gradually refining a \n\n\u003E ![m1ZKL6C.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/m1ZKL6C.jpg)\n\u003E \n\ncarrying an orange tank \u002B 2.5m monoprop container to orbit each time. On the runway with this load, it has ~0.77 TWR, developing to about 0.9 by 25km, which is a comfortable if not lavish amount.\n\nThis drone\u0027s actual purpose is to carry MKS base modules to LKO, which are much lighter; but the CoM is in the middle of the cargo bay, and I know that if I can lift 35T of fuel depot, then anything lighter can be attached in the right place and the plane will still fly. Sometimes it goes up with 1.0-1.2TWR and has a ton of fuel spare, and sometimes it goes up close to baseline performance and comes back almost dry. For all loads it even has enough spare fuel to top up the nerva-powered spacetug that\u0027ll be taking the payload beyond LKO, which is actually preventing the need to ever launch the fuel depot that I built it to lift in the first place! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nOne big gotcha; make sure it flies stable, and re-enters the atmosphere safely, when completely empty of fuel and cargo! You need to be sure that the CoM when empty doesn\u0027t suddenly shoot back behind the CoL, which is very easy to do if you\u0027ve been designing with a heavy load in the cargo bay. Which is why you want the CoM as close to centre of the bay as possible.\n\nWhile the design process can be a pain, in the end, what you get is a \u0027one size fits all lifter\u0027 with a known good capacity, and when you start putting it into service you put an end to designing a new set of rocket stages for every mission.

First, sweep those wings to at least 15 degrees. You\u0027re doing yourself no favors by having them straight like that. (In fact, were it my plane I\u0027d go with a low aspect-ratio delta, probably.) Second, give them a touch of dihedral - no more than 5 degrees should be necessary. This will help with the spiral mode instability I\u0027m betting you\u0027re experiencing, where sideslip leads to roll leads to more sideslip. Finally, take those wing extensions you have and turn them into winglets on the very ends and backs by making them vertical and moving them as far back as possible. You might even want a larger wing for this, like the small deltas.\n\nAs an alternative, take off the nacelles and make up the extra fuel by extending the fuselage with Mk 3 parts. With swept wings (and possibly less wing; you have a lot), you don\u0027t need the extra 4 RAPIERs.

The general rule there for RAPIERs is 40 units of Liquid Fuel per tonne of mass at takeoff, and 25 units of Oxidizer per tonne of mass at takeoff. That number assumes the engine will switch over to rocket mode with the craft going 1750 m/s at whatever altitude you\u0027re at (and therein lies the difference between FAR and stock aero - I don\u0027t know how fast the RAPIERs will get you while you\u0027ve still got air to work with).\n\nNow, my design process for figuring out fuel load typically goes like this:\n\n1) Determine the mass of the payload. This is anything besides engines, fuel tanks, wings and intakes. The command module counts as payload, your cargo bay mass counts, anything in the cargo bay counts.\n\n2) Multiply that mass by four - assume that\u0027s going to be the takeoff mass of the plane. That\u0027s going to give you a \u002225% payload fraction\u0022, which is what a lousy spaceplane design will usually give you. \n\n3) Determine the number of engines needed to get that into orbit. For stock aero, the rule for RAPIERs is 13 tonnes per engine at takeoff. Your 54 tonne plane would require five RAPIERs in stock. My understanding is that the nerfing the Turbojet and RAPIER received in FAR was done to prevent those engines from being so powerful they\u0027d rip your plane apart, and that the more realistic atmospheric pressure profile with height compensates for it (takeway there - you might consider reducing the number of engines on your plane. Whatever floats your boat there).\n\n4) Now - and this is key - that maximum mass per engine is what you assume for determining fuel. If you\u0027ve got 8 RAPIERs, you assume each one will lift its maximum tonnage of 13 tonnes, so you assume the takeoff mass of the plane will be 13\\*8 = 104 tonnes. So you need 104\\*40 = 4160 units of Liquid Fuel and 104\\*25 = 2600 units of Oxidizer. If you\u0027ve got 5 RAPIERs, you assume each one will lift its maximum tonnage of 13 tonnes, so you assume the takeoff mass of the plane will be 13\\*5 = 65 tonnes. So you need 65\\*40 = 2600 units of Liquid Fuel and 65\\*25 = 1625 units of Oxidizer. \n\nThere is no tank in the game that gives you a 1.6:1 LF/LOX ratio - those Mk2 Rocket Fuel Tanks certainly don\u0027t - so you usually have to wind up draining oxidizer from the tank. For the 65 tonne example, you could use a Mk3 Rocket Fuel Fuselage; it\u0027d put you 350 units short on Liquid Fuel, but you can make up that difference easily enough with outboard fuel tanks and adapters (like those Mk2 Bicouplers you\u0027re already using.\n\nLike I said, I use stock aero - though I\u0027m thinking of making the switch and I\u0027ve been asking these kinds of questions about how things work in FAR.
