It seems that because it is still a quite recent card, it is still not fully supported by several Linux OS repositories. But what is clear is that your driver isn\u0027t the proper one. I\u0027ve found several way to install some unofficial driver via the\u003Ccode\u003E ppa:xorg-edgers\u003C/code\u003E. However, this do not seems to be a common solution and I do not dare posting it here as I\u0027m clearly not sure that it would be a solution. I\u0027m afraid this goes beyond my knowledge...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me, your best bet is to run ksp.exe via Windows. However, if you do not want to wait for 1.1, try some more research about your \u0022Device 13c0\u0022 and get ready to backup your system and do some testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a curiosity: Are you able to change your screen resolution in Mint above 1024x768?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flagelop","CreatedById":158787,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T00:32:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, that\u0027s no problem I can still play with over 100 mods and using 5.5 gb of ram \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0I\u0027ll just have to wait for the 1.1 update for windows for 64 bit to get the enhancements.

To copy and paste\u00A0parts you have to Alt\u002Bclick but this shourtcut is used by linux to drag the window around so that it doesn\u0027t work. I\u0027ve tryed to play in fullscreen but it still didn\u0027t work. I\u0027ve also tryed to change the system/ksp shortcuts but wasn\u0027t able to find any way to change the Alt\u002Bclick thing. If you know a quick solution I would be grateful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T13:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Linux version of KSP uses the right shift key instead of the Alt key by default for exactly this sort of reason (various Alt shortcuts used by window manager).\u00A0 So, always try right shift when something KSP related says Alt...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
