Let\u0027s go wild and imagine that you manage to design and launch a smaller one for 1/10th the cost of the ISS, it will still be in the $10 billion range, before you can even consider space tourism as a viable business. With a 100% occupancy rate over a 20 year depreciation, you will still need to bill $3 million to your 3000 customers for a week stay at the hotel before you even start making a profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd we haven\u0027t even covered launch costs. This is the cost of some aerospace programs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF-35: $40 billion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthrop B-2: $40 billion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESLS: $18 billion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirbus A380: $15 billion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoeing 787: $15 billion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA reusable spaceplane would arguably incur a similar development cost (if even possible). However, the number of actual vehicles would be much lower than for example, an F-35 or A380 aircraft. The market could probably only support a fleet of 2 or 3 vehicles, which means that most parts would be one-offs and the maintenance costs would be extremely high. A single vehicle would arguably cost between 5 and 10 billion, which means that at $5 million the ticket over 6 passengers, you would have to launch each vehicle 300 times before you start making a profit. And I\u0027m not even including budget overruns, maintenance costs, logistics, infrastructure, facilities, fuel, etc... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe total upfront cost for starting an attractive space tourism business would be in the range of $20 or 30 billion at least for only a handful of tourists. Good luck in finding an investor for that kind of upfront money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will be a looooong time before space tourism ever becomes a profitable industry. The costs would have to be divided by 1000, not by 10, before it even becomes feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-21T10:58:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2013 10:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T11:45:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we could reduce the cost of sending people to space from $50 million to 5, I\u0027m sure the cost of building stations would be reduced too...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T12:12:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbface\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbface\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf we could reduce the cost of sending people to space from $50 million to 5, I\u0027m sure the cost of building stations would be reduced too...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why I quoted a cost of less than 10% of the actual cost of the ISS. The question is, how do you reduce launch costs in the first place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are stuck in a chicken and egg problem really. You can\u0027t build a cheap method for getting to orbit as long as their is not enough demand for very frequent flights. And you can\u0027t get frequent flights as long as there is no cheap method for getting to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also the problem of not having a worthwhile destination for people in orbit, and nothing particularly enticing to do once you\u0027re up there. As for commercial launches, other than comsats, there isn\u0027t much use for space at all. Even if you reduce the cost of an orbital launch to $1000 per pound, new markets won\u0027t emerge over night because there simply isn\u0027t much to do in space, except science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reasonable way forward is to progressively reduce the cost of conventional expendable and reusable multi-stage launchers by reducing development and manufacturing costs, while remaining profitable. This will take decades, but it\u0027s the only way to sustain a research and development effort and to allow any new markets to emerge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T12:28:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis thread is about the Space Shuttle, not about manned exploration of Mars. Let\u0027s bring it back on topic.\u003Cp\u003EThe only advantages of the STS compared to a crew-only vehicle were:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Capability of carrying crew \u002B cargo on the same: This was useful for the orbital assembly techniques developed for the ISS, but the Mir proved that you can actually build a space station with automated docking, so this wasn\u0027t necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 1000 mile landing crossrange: This was a military requirement, but not needed for civilian operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ability to retrieve and return broken satellites: This was tried once as a demonstration, but was not cost effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, as a payload launcher and a crew transfer vehicle it was way too expensive. It had flight duration and payload limitations. It was useless for exploration and its side-mounted design was fundamentally flawed and dangerous. Any of its other LEO missions could be done either on the ISS (or any other space station) or with a crew-only capsule like Dragon. There is no need for a space shuttle, redesigned or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny reusable spacecraft is only useful if the flight rate is high enough. Many people say that an SSTO spaceplane would bring launch costs down, but that is simply not true, because the main driver of cost is launch rate and there is simply no demand for an orbital launch every 2 or 3 days. If you built a reusable SSTO spaceplane, it would spend most of its time in a hangar waiting for a launch because there simply isn\u0027t a market for frequent launches. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA reusable SSTO spaceplane would cost billions to design, build, and maintain (even if it was technologically feasible) and simply wouldn\u0027t be competitive against cheap disposable launchers, or even cheaper reusable multi-stage launchers, even if you doubled or tripled the demand for orbital launches. What brings the cost down isn\u0027t reusability, it\u0027s demand. It will still be a while before a reusable spaceplane becomes cheaper than mass-produced disposable launchers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 on pretty much everything you say here. But I do have a couple of things to say on what you say later... ^^\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, a space station doesn\u0027t have to cost as much as ISS did. Especially if its only operational requirement is having a certain number of crew. Depending on how much Bigelow charges, substantially less than a billion including launch costs and excluding operations cost. And Thales Alenia or Energia I\u0027m sure would be willing to talk similar prices. Likewise the operations cost would be greatly reduced without the science and pioneering engineering, and all the hungry mouths to feed at the government side. In fact I think you can make greater cost saving than in launch vehicles right there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even in launch vehicles an incredible improvement can still be made. Look at SpaceX, and the only thing they did is get a handle on their supplier prices by doing it themselves. Imagine if you had a market for true mass production, that could lead to some advanced projects (\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Elike Skylon, I like that one\u003C/span\u003E) becoming suddenly profitable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. It\u0027s a chicken and egg problem right now, but you if you squint your eyes, can see dinosaurs starting to look like birds. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
