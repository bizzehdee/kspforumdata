Is it just me or did the RCS thrusters look better back then? I didn\u0027t start playing until .10.something or .11 as I was on a mac.

Oh man, I must have smashed a hundred rockets into it trying to land on those stupid fins that would always twist and break my engine. Remember before maneuver nodes and you had to wait until the mun came up over (or slip past, depending on your orbit) the horizon before burning so you could get your transfer orbit? Those new guys have no idea how easy they have it, demanding autopilots and complaining that their 5 billion part ship with their \u003Cem\u003Elanding legs\u003C/em\u003E needs more gadgets!

I must have spent half an hour building the \u0027perfect\u0027 lander, only to lose my engine because I landed 1 or 2m/s faster than I should have or the fins just weren\u0027t low enough!

Oh sure, there was an SAS and radial decouplers but in order for the SAS to amount to anything worth a damn you\u0027d need to stack three or four of them on top of one another, and the radial decouplers would snap under the force of anything significant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no Mun, and no map menu - to get into orbit you had to look up the orbital velocity values on the Wiki, and the planet didn\u0027t even rotate so you had no boost from Kerbin\u0027s rotation. Still, those were some good times! The first thing I did was download a bunch of mod parts and build a massive rocket that could reliably go into orbit and drop off a small satellite.

I quickly googled KSP and my first hit was \u0022Kentucky State police\u0022 realising that probably wasnt what i wanted i typed in the full name found what i wanted and downloaded the game which was less then 300mb at the time. The game seemed interesting there were few parts and even fewer instructions. That is the world of 0.7the Features were limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E There was no moon nor other planets. The sun was only a point of light that no matter how fast or long you travelled would never ever come any closer. Time warp? Forget it. Moving parts? Forget it. Lights, runways, wheels, Iva, Eva? Forget all of them. There was no maps no orbital information other then vertical speed and horizontal speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe atmosphere was as thick as soup and you couldn\u0027t find out if you were orbiting until you waited the 20 so minutes it took to complete a full low orbit rotation? And if you only managed half an orbit your 3 kerbals were doomed for if they touched the dark side of the non revolving kerbin they would surely spontaneously combust\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat parts did we have? That\u0027s easy. A cockpit, winglets, standard fuel part,a few structural parts,the sas, a single kind of engine, radial a decoupler, a horizontal decoupler and of course the infamous solid rocket booster\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe competition back in the day was just to reach space. I spent hours designing and creating ships after ship with the standard modules available.we had to be carefull tho.. With the lack of struts any launch could be deadly........ Ships suffered from jelly fish wobbles where the different parts would sway and wobble as they had been unrestrained. It was an interesting time and the game has come a long way since then.
