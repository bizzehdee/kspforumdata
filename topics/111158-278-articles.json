And nothing exists in a vaccum. So all those things you mentioned are all happening at the same time, but now on top of all that we have fake AI combing through thousands of pages a minute to find info to cobble together into a response that seems intelligent. Real intelligences such as ourselves, carry our knowledge around with us in the most advanced hard drives on the planet. What they call AI these days, are algorithms that are trained to look for key words within a context, and then string searched for information into a defined template.\n\nThey are accessing the servers at rates far faster and more often than any humans. The pathways in and out of servers are not infinite, so basically they are causing traffic jams because the servers can\u0027t keep up with the routing."},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-09T03:24:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, ColdJ said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So all those things you mentioned are all happening at the same time, but now on top of all that we have fake AI combing through thousands of pages a minute to find info to cobble together into a response that seems intelligent.\n\u003E \n\nAnd that is completely wrong.
