And collecting science while doing so.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, any subsequent attempt to get to the \u0022flying\u0022 situation (i.e. just don\u0027t touch the ground) would result me in taking the biome under it (i.e. Kerbin\u0027s Shores).\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m a Science hardcore, I\u0027ll go any lengths to extract science from a planet to the last bit.

The kerbal needs to be exactly at the peak of their jump.\u00A0I\u0027ve never managed to do it with any other science device. Logically, that would imply that you could do it by making a science craft that could jump something less than a meter off the ground -- and then performing the careful timing of taking the experiment while you are more than half a meter in the air. If you are in the air, but too close to the ground, you will only get surface results. And if you get too high, then you will only get \u0022flying over\u00A0Shores\u0022 data. So, there\u0027s a minimum and maximum altitude, and you will have to time your experiment taking very carefully, and your craft will have to survive all the bouncing around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I\u0027d really be interested myself in knowing what the maximum altitude was that you can bounce and still be in the proper minibiome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-11T13:14:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2020 01:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fierce Wolf","CreatedById":200019,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-11T13:44:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a super trick for that, that feels a bit like cheating.
