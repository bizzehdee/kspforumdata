For somereason the plane is aligned to 90 degrees on launch but the runway is .4 degrees off this. Tow in and Tow out plays a big part in your corrective steering and your aircrafts beahviour at speed but if its just this slightly bizarre natural drift your worried about then its because the runway is not perfectly aligned east west. As far as I\u0027m aware it is perfectly flat and doesn\u0027t slope forward or backward but I\u0027m not sure, and I\u0027m also not sure what circumstances that would truly affect your takeoff adversely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T19:00:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s another thing to consider.
