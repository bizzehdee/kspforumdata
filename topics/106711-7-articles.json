It\u0027s 285 taking off from a runway and landing horizontally at 118 tons. This is beyond un-realistic, it\u0027s broken. The \u0022power gets anything into the air\u0022 mantra only applies if you can significantly angle the craft upwards, which you can\u0027t normally do taking off from a runway and only applies to landings if you land tail down.\n\nThis may not apply to those who I quoted just now but it amuses me when people say that high altitude jets and adding wing pieces for aesthetic reasons are wrong and shouldn\u0027t be in the game because they are un-realistic but then completely accept that a plane built like the one above can fly without any wings at all.

I just wanted to make a cool looking engine as Rapiers are the only real choice to getting SSTO\u0027s into orbit with big payloads. The TWR is completely dependant on how fast you are going and how high you are. Peak TWR at 20km is only 2.19 and then you are limited by drag and heat factors. You need this many engines to make it useful!\n\nIt does need about 200m/s to take off but it will glide at about 90m/s for landing when it is lighter.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E No, because someone posted a 20% cargo fraction spaceplane just a few posts earlier...\n\nI meant that the arguments about high altitude jets came about when 1.0 came out and before 1.02.
