you have there. Very impressive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo not connect LEDs directly to the Arduino, use a shift-out or display IC instead (74HC595 or MAX7219). Having tried both approaches, the IC\u0027s let you extend if you want, and as you say enable you to have an effect when the ressource is out (I would go for blinking).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther, you might want to consider your AP clock. Instead, how about detecting whether AP or PE is closest, and display time to that? Throw in a 7seg block in front to read A or P and you are gold (or two LEDs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou asked about the LCD display, and I want to suggest adding a rotary encoder beside it so it can display whatever you need for the situation.
