If you don\u0027t have access to a 3D printer or a CNC machine they might be worthwhile for their ease of installation and uniform look."},{"CreatedByName":"T.A.P.O.R.","CreatedById":137748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T11:34:31Z","Content":"Thanks for the advice on the keys.\n\nmight give them a miss and stick with toggles.\n\nMulbin\u0027s panel has a great solution to backlit labels.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![9Prt4Zz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9Prt4Zz.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nI tried finding long lengths of the stuff to no avail.\n\nCould be a cheap/easy solution to printing my own bezels\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-24T19:41:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2015 07:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by T.A.P.O.R.**"},{"CreatedByName":"T.A.P.O.R.","CreatedById":137748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T08:31:51Z","Content":"Small update (if it can be called that).\n\nNot much time to do anything fun this week.\n\nI\u0027m still waiting on a bunch of stuff to arrive, but the VU meter really threw me off balance.\n\nAs much as I like missile switches, I\u0027m leaning toward using mini toggles as they\u0027re a: cheaper b: smaller footprint c: I have heaps of them with wee hats.\n\nThe panel is about 74 cm or 29 1/2 inches wide and yet seems to be easily filled up. \n\nEspecially with that big old VU meter, which I simple *must* use (unless of course it doesn\u0027t work).\n\nThis is the basic layout for the action groups and the corner of the square at the bottom is the centre point for the launch button.\n\nThe silver thingies are my LED bezels.\n\n![F94Sg7NY9qIjDgGiKOoz-cPEjuwrtTMGh8IdKrfIaHE=w800-h600](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/F94Sg7NY9qIjDgGiKOoz-cPEjuwrtTMGh8IdKrfIaHE=w800-h600)\n\n![IMG_0433.JPG](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-354eiV-DCuw/VRUTUmd447I/AAAAAAAABus/tqFwx_L6PT8/w450-h600-no/IMG_0433.JPG)"},{"CreatedByName":"T.A.P.O.R.","CreatedById":137748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T20:47:27Z","Content":"*Actual* progress.\n\nAfter discovering the old Bakelite display was dead, I changed plans.\n\nHere\u0027s my \u0022vision\u0022 for the project.\n\nAs stated in the KSPIO thread, I don\u0027t know what to display with the two seven segs on the left and the LCD.\n\nLots of parts are still in transit, including the two clock modules.\n\nOne for time to Apoapsis and the other for time in the \u0022real world\u0022.\n\nThe real world clock wont be connected to the Arduino at all and will run on battery so I\u0027ll need to add clock controls on the front panel too.\n\n![Panel%2BLayout-Displays.jpg](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8Jo4ckumjjg/VRcNDfwieeI/AAAAAAAABvM/w-jiVya9lB4/w956-h265-no/Panel%2BLayout-Displays.jpg)\n\n![Panel%2BLayout-Full.jpg](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-311H8iufff4/VRcNDI-mw4I/AAAAAAAABvI/KOhHwegZNLc/w958-h447-no/Panel%2BLayout-Full.jpg)\n\nI did work on the control board yesterday and as you can see there are many switches and LED bezels.\n\nThe LED bezel on the top left will be wired to the KSPIO handshake light.\n\n![IMG_0441.JPG](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-njBriLpMvrw/VRcP9mBx_dI/AAAAAAAABvg/MrNkqeKYRZ8/w600-h800-no/IMG_0441.JPG)\n\nI\u0027ve added in a rotary switch to control what is being displayed on the VU.\n\nThis is for (as I see it) maximum flexibility, since it allows for chemical rockets, aeroplanes and ion propulsion.\n\nAlso I just like the look of the chicken head knob next to the 1966 VU.\n\nThe current switch is single pole, so I think I need to invest in a double pole switch to avoid suing up precious pins on my Mega for the LEDs.\n\nThen again... maybe they can refuse to light up when the tank is empty?\n\nLeft to right I have Xenon, Mono, LFO, Jet, Air Intake.\n\nElectricity will have it\u0027s own read out via a Led Bar graph.\n\n![IMG_0442.JPG](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oDAVt4AbdYQ/VRcP98lfhLI/AAAAAAAABvk/DdWUK3Uhbqc/w600-h800-no/IMG_0442.JPG)\n\nI\u0027ve left a fair amount of space down the bottom in case I decide to add in a key panel for QWEASDZX for those times when I want to fly entirely on the control board.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-28T20:54:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2015 08:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by T.A.P.O.R.**"},{"CreatedByName":"Freshmeat","CreatedById":111048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T11:30:03Z","Content":"Holy Cow, that is a large work you have there. Very impressive.\n\nDo not connect LEDs directly to the Arduino, use a shift-out or display IC instead (74HC595 or MAX7219). Having tried both approaches, the IC\u0027s let you extend if you want, and as you say enable you to have an effect when the ressource is out (I would go for blinking).\n\nFurther, you might want to consider your AP clock. Instead, how about detecting whether AP or PE is closest, and display time to that? Throw in a 7seg block in front to read A or P and you are gold (or two LEDs).\n\nYou asked about the LCD display, and I want to suggest adding a rotary encoder beside it so it can display whatever you need for the situation.
