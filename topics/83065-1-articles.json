That needs to be fixed. If we go the FAR route we need to deal with the fact that a (mostly) proper atmospheric simulation actually makes it easier to get to space from Kerbin with a properly-built rocket because the current simulation adds a level of \u0022soup\u0022 to make it harder. It\u0027s also completely unintuitive at the most basic level because a \u0022gravity turn\u0022 in KSP isn\u0027t a gravity turn. In fact, \u003Cem\u003Eyou can\u0027t do a gravity turn\u003C/em\u003E in stock KSP. That, IMNSHO, is really bad because the player has no real world experience they can draw from to figure out how to properly launch a rocket. As far as planes are concerned the big problem is things with the aerodynamic properties of a brick wall (literally) flying quite well. It\u0027s #lolphysics and it makes KSP look really bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines in KSP aren\u0027t very good either. Rocket engine isp affects fuel flow, not thrust, which is completely backwards from how rocket engines work in the real world. It doesn\u0027t work properly with the rocket equation (with launch vehicles, anyway) which means that players can\u0027t rely on proven math to get them to orbit. Jet engines use intake air as reaction mass (IIRC ferram4\u0027s diatribes about them) which results in them being 16x more effective than they actually should be (also, spaceplanes are \u003Cem\u003Ereally hard\u003C/em\u003E IRL). And nuclear engines should really only use Liquid Fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as orbital mechanics, I personally feel the patched conics/on-rails approximation that KSP uses is perfectly fine and does the job. It could be more accurate but, as I understand it, that\u0027s more of a failing with Unity/PhysX and floats rather than KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, planet size is a big issue. The densities of planets in KSP are completely out of whack with pretty much anything we have experience with, made of some sort of unobtanium. That can be glossed over to make the game more \u0022fun\u0022 (this is a really subjective term) and while I think stock should have realistic planets, I also realize it\u0027s not going to happen. However, you have to deal with the issues arising from changing the aerodynamics simulation and parts balancing somehow. Rather than retain some artificial \u0022soup\u0022 that makes the game look bad, increasing the planetary radii by a small amount while retaining the current surface gravities will address the problem handily. You only need to increase the size of Kerbin by \u003Cem\u003Ehalf again\u003C/em\u003E to keep the current delta-V-to-orbit that Kerbin has while using FAR. In turn, I also argue that every other planet and their orbital SMA be increased by a similar amount for consistency. This will make KSP slightly harder when dealing with the rest of the solar system, but not by much. In fact, it will make getting other places much more satisfying IMO and actually make things like the SLS parts fit in better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s reentry heating, which everyone expects but KSP doesn\u0027t model. Life support is another touchy topic but would serve as a progression device early in the tech tree while also providing a penalty for too much time-warping (which some people seem to have a problem with) as well as providing an excellent illustration of how difficult space travel actually is (something KSP doesn\u0027t even bother with).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s just a short list of the issues in KSP, but I feel it touches the major, glaring problems.
