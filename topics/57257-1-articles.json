I modfied my 5 stage flower to a 7 stage flower by ALT clicking my external pod, changing to 6 and re-attaching, Then I re ran all the yellow hoses. Now when I launch my tanks run out of oxidizer right away, and the engines shut off due to lack of oxidizer but there is still fuel available. Anyone run into this before and know how to fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3762/11488858854_a9ab625465_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002211488858854_a9ab625465_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: NVM, I figured it out.
