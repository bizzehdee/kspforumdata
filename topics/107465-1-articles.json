Tested using a vessel at night, drill running and at 100x time warp my power dropped to 0 in about 5 seconds, at 1000x timewarp it dropped to 0 in about 20 seconds and I gathered lots of ore and converted it to lx/o at the same time.

This is no problem in sandbox where everybody has that, but it\u0027s an issue in career. Expect way lower rates with less experience, although still better than using a probe or a non-engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the OP, I agree, high warp mining ignores power consumption. But I\u0027m cool with that. The whole reason for warping is to minimize the amount of your limited spare time you have to spend on the boring process of filling up a tank, so you can spend more of your time moving stuff around in space, which presumably is why you\u0027re playing the game in the 1st place. The electricity thing helps with this so I\u0027m not complaining.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-RanZ-","CreatedById":51892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:50:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emeh, forget I asked, got moved to an unread sub forum now to die.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
