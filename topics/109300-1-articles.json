It then uses either the defined flow rule for the resource or the specific flow rule you specify in the call to take the resource from whatever part(s) on the vessel it should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that there is at least one bug in RequestResource when using the ALL_VESSEL or STAGE_PRIORITY rules.

Yes, RequestResource is used to actually remove (or add) resources to a vessel via the particular part following the resource flow rules. If you just want to know how much electric charge is on the whole vessel then you will have to add it up. This either means looping through the whole part list and adding it all up, taking care to check the disabled flags etc., or calling Part.GetConnectedResources to get a list of the resources actually available to a particular part and iterating through that list instead (much easier but may cause lots of garbage collection if called often for large vessels).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems I forgot to add the link, sorry and fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
