I have recently been working on flying a SSTO, and have been having problems. I generally will get to a 70-80km orbit with no fuel left over. I use either RAPIER engines or a mixture of Ramjets and aerospikes. I generally fly a flight profile with a 30-40 degree climb to 10km, then I throttle up to full and go at about a 2 degree AoA. Once I hit about 1km/s speeds I pitch up to about 30 degrees, raising apoapsis. Can you guys/gals help? I don\u0027t know what I can do to save more fuel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, sorry if I placed this in the wrong area!
