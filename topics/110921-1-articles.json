After parachuting down to the ground, it won\u0027t let me retrieve the spacecraft, nor will it let me go to the space center. I can even get out and walk around on Kerbin, but it still says I\u0027m in flight. Is this a bug, or am I missing something?

The only time I\u0027ve run into this was when I had a mod installed with a custom engine, and the engine was what was touching the ground-- my guess is that it was some sort of problem with the engine\u0027s collision mesh, or something. Have never seen this bug in stock, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne question: Does it just say you\u0027re in-flight when you\u0027re focused on the spacecraft, or does it apply to your kerbal when he/she is out walking around? e.g. could you complete the contract by taking the kerbal out, and then retrieving just the kerbal?

As to your question, it won\u0027t let me retrieve the kerbal by himself either. I figured out several workarounds for it. The first workaround is to land in the water. It doesn\u0027t seem to happen if I can reach 0 elevation. The second workaround is to quicksave, and then go to the space center anyway. At the tracking station, I can retrieve the craft. What\u0027s interesting is that if I try to fly the craft again, it goes back into the same mode as before where it thinks I\u0027m in flight on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrplainswalker","CreatedById":144996,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T19:58:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems that I might be the only person experiencing this problem, for some reason. In any case, if anyone else happens to be experiencing it, the true workaround is save file editing. My previous workarounds don\u0027t always seem to work. So now anytime I get a rescue mission, I play it as usual and then when I reach around 2000m over Kerbin I quicksave, edit the quicksave file to change my status to landed, and then reload and recover vehicle. Kinda stinks that I have to resort to those levels, but whatever works in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case anyone is interested, here\u0027s the video I watched on editing save files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/0wXVm3M2I2w?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"danturo","CreatedById":145988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T23:16:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI experienced a similar problem once.
