Instead of 2 kg, a lump of negative mass would be -2 kg. Nobody knows whether negative mass can exist but there have nevertheless been plenty of analyses to determine its properties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is a mockup using my\u00A0pathetic Microsoft paint skills:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CM_Drive.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://s22.postimg.org/fejwnz3s1/CM_Drive.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe basic parameters of the\u00A0modded part involved would be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBe able to extend a counter mass field around the\u00A0ship (via a UI pop-up with tweakables i.e. radius/length)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nObjects inside of the field need their mass reduced to .001 or equivalent/all engines affected by the field should have their thrust reduced to 0 (an engine uses mass to propel itself forward, if said mass is within the field it shouldn\u0027t have the ability to produce thrust)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPower usage should be extremely high and variable to the size of the field or negative mass needed (I.e. heavier objects need more power to reduce the weight)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe\u00A0weight of the drive itself should be quite considerable, perhaps 14 tons or more\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAtmospheric Usage should\u00A0not be allowed\u00A0or\u00A0cost\u00A0ridiculously more power (perhaps 10x or equivalent to make for interesting gameplay)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt should unlock under the last tech node of electrical (I always felt something other than the 2.5m battery was needed there)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine a ship with one of these installed orbiting kerbin; while turned off, mechjeb is telling you that you have a measly\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 0.13, 280\u00A0\u2206v, and total vessel mass of 45 tons.\u00A0 You switch the drive on and your power supplies start to sap down as the field extends around your ship.

In their lore, humanity attained interstellar travel by discovering ancient jump gates that projected fields around starships that reduced their mass to near-nothing. This allowed incredible acceleration, and even removed the speed of light as a universal limit (somehow, I forget). Humanity later discovered and joined a galactic collective of sentient races that know how to build this technology and apply it to many different engineering problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dewar","CreatedById":107737,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-29T23:09:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelieve it or not I\u0027ve never played any of the mass effect games.
