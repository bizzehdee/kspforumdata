Why make a such a half ass effort in the early stage of design?\n\nIt was the 50\u0027s and 60\u0027s. Nothing was known about working on the surface of the moon (some scientist theorized astronauts or cosmonauts would sink out of sight in the moon dust) or exactly the effects of space radiation would be human body so hard \u0022mini-spacecraft\u0022 suits seemed wiser. Plus some of the early mission profiles imagined longer stays on the moon, so \u0022more\u0022 comfortable suits were in fashion. Ever had a nose itch in an Apollo style helmet? So all kind of concepts were envisioned and prototypes built. And that\u0027s what these are concepts and prototypes. Look at Grumman\u0027s LEM\u0027s development.

You see the latex gloves and boots?\n\nThink modern suits uses an rigid top anyway, the pressure is just 1 bar or less, no issue keeping under pressure, the problem is avoiding it becoming an balloon. An suit of gothic plate armor would not be an bad starting point, you would still have problems with the elbow and crouch who also was an weak spot on armor but hard to reach."},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T06:51:34Z","Content":"The big problem. for any pressure suit, is constant volume joints. NASA went for flexible suits, building on USAF experience, but there are movements that are impractical. There were attempts at rigid suits, echoing certain sorts of diving suit, which had different movement constraints from the way the joints worked. Either way, the astronaut has to learn how to work within the limits. NASA did test them, but their astronauts arrived with experience of the high altitude military pressure suits.\n\nAnother idea is the skin-tight elastic suit, replacing air pressure with mechanical force. It\u0027s harder than it looks, very dependent on the right materials, and it\u0027s right on the edge of possible tech even now.\n\nAll pressure suits have a minimum set by the working of the lungs. Rigid suits can allow use of normal air, oxy-nitrogen at full atmospheric pressure. But low pressure risks the nitrogen turning your blood into a fizzy drink for vampires. Divers spending time at high pressure have similar problems when they come back to the surface.\n\nThe first Russian Space Walk had problems with the suit swelling too much at design pressure. The cosmonaut struggled to get back into the capsule.\n\nPure oxygen is a fire risk at normal atmospheric pressure. Divers using oxy-nitrogen mixes are depth limited by toxicity problems for both gases. Instead they use an oxy-helium mix with very low percentages of oxygen: at high pressure there\u0027s enough oxygen, the helium doesn\u0027t poison them, but their voices go all squeaky."},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T07:21:09Z","Content":"It\u0027s funny that the guy who designed it is called hazard. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Actually, those suits are not bad at all.
