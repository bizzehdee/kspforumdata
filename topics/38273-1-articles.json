But, I\u0027ve made a few small ones and gotten them to fly, but never in to orbit and always somewhat unstable. But, I\u0027m planning my first mission to Eve, and as part of that mission I wanted a craft capable of exploring Eve, landing and capturing some CO2 from the atmosphere, and bringing it back to orbit for conversion to oxygen so my little guys don\u0027t suffocate (I\u0027m using ioncross lifesupport and Kethane). I figured a kethane powered space plane was the most viable option for doing this given Eve\u0027s gravity and atmosphere, but am happy to land it near a ground based fuelling station before heading back in to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, that\u0027s all a very long way off, because I\u0027m yet to actually get my plane off the runway in less than 10 separate pieces, let alone assemble the mighty colony ship. The problem is that soon after firing up the engines, it starts pulling to one side (the left), rolls and crashes. SAS/ASAS helps a little, but not much. It crashed rather quickly when using the two kethane jets, but can sometimes make it to the runway when using the nuclear engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been pulling my hair out for countless hours now trying to get off the ground, have tried different balancing of COM and COL, single sets of landing gear, doubled up sets, angled sets, multiple sets attached to wings or fuselage, putting the gear on backwards, tail fins, no tail fins, different flaps settings etc. No matter what I do, it always pulls off quite sharply after a little while, but it seems to be more reliable with less thrust or with the nuclear engine only, but of course then it doesn\u0027t go fast enough to get off the ground before the end of the runway. Below is my latest incarnation (i hope the steam links work) with lots of landing gear, which seems to help. Flaps are usually set to 1 as the problem seems worse at higher settings. The two kethane jets are stapped underneath the wings, as this seemed to work better than above the wings or on the wing tips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should also mention that I\u0027m using FAR, as that seemed to make things easier a while back. I\u0027d love to be able to refine it so that it flies better and is stable at speed and altitude, but obviously I need to figure out how to get off the ground before that\u0027s even possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone help?

Actually, putting the wheels on pylons is even worse for that, since most supposedly structural parts have the rigidity of a rubber band, especially around their attachment points. If you don\u0027t believe me, try lifting again, but this time with the camera pointing at the wheels during takeoff, and enjoy the landing gear dance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to place them on the heaviest parts of the plane (i.e: the fuel tanks that make up the fuselage), and then strut the whole thing firmly, till you can be sure than applying a few tons of force (your engines on) won\u0027t make the landing gear bend out of position. Preferably, with no parts between them and the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, more lift makes you lift off slower, but I think that\u0027s kind of obvious (lift is proportional to speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and if you can\u0027t pull up (which looking at the plane, I\u0027m not sure you could), then try moving the rear landing gear closer to the center of mass: think levers and Archimedes, and you will know why that works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

Not only will this make driving rovers easier (you\u0027re not trying to pitch your craft whilst turning or accelerating), but with your RCS off, you\u0027re only moving the wheels (or in this case, landing gear) and not using the torque from the command pod. That\u0027s how I solved it for my planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhomever that was that suggested not using FAR until your used to the stock drag model, I disagree. Considering that down the road we will probably see a stock drag model similar to FAR, why not get used to it. Also, the stock model doesn\u0027t work properly when using planes a FAR is much closer to a real life analogue than stock (that is unless I\u0027m wrong and jets like the SR-71 actually pointed their nose 40* in the air to maintain level flight above 60,000\u0027 @ Mach 3\u002B).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Rune is right as well (forgot to mention), you could probably go with more structural rigidity (MOAR STRUTS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: Just to illustrate the difference that the positioning of your landing gear makes, take these two examples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) This is one of my early SSTO Craft.
