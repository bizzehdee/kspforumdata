Complexity, cost, weight, effectiveness, etc etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou make it more complex, the R\u0026amp;D costs are gonna go up and it introduces more points of failure, wasting the whole project. You reduce the cost, you lose complexity and its ability to effectively do its job or you again introduce more points of failure. Weight is an easy one to reduce, but you can only go so far and still maintain the same returns unless we\u0027re inventing all new alloys, again, increasing the cost. Overall effectiveness is going to dictate the size and complexity of the robot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time a robot can be invented that can cover, analyze and thoroughly explore the same area in the same amount of time a human would be able to do so is right around when there won\u0027t be any point in sending a robot. Humans will either be dead or already been there and gone. And thats without considering the impossibility of said rover to return this sample and countless others that a manned mission would be able to do without a separate, dedicated sample return module that would further offset the costs you\u0027re supposedly saving by sending this robot. In-situ lab work can only go so far on what would be still be a small robot.

And yes, time is a huge factor. Curiosity is an amazing rover and I delight myself in every picture its sent back to us, but the average person isn\u0027t going to care when it takes years for it to get somewhere interesting. A human can walk and cover the same distance and do much of the same science Curiosity has been doing in a single day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRobots are only truly efficient when its unfeasible or pointless to send humans in the first place. We\u0027re barely getting to Mars as is, let robots explore Europa and Titan. Same with missions focused on maintaining orbit.

You might not spend a billion dollars to launch a robot to Mars, but what you do spend is returned by a limited amount of science taking years to come to fruition. The billion dollar crew spends the same amount of time on the surface and turns that billion dollar investment into that much more science, if not even more than what we could imagine. A robot isn\u0027t going to kick a rock and see something funny in the rock, just to find out Martian\u00A0microbes have found a way to live inside the rock (for example). Its gonna roll right around it or over it and keep on steaming ahead to wherever its going.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd again, you don\u0027t know that. You only know the trends.

US private and public launch vehicles launching crew to likely Russian and/or Chinese built habitats serviced by automated European vehicles. And ultimately this is what I\u0027d prefer to see. I\u0027ve always been in favor of the idea of space exploration becoming a United Nations effort rather than that of a single nation. Regardless of how we feel about each other at home, if we\u0027re going to explore another planet for the first time we should be doing it together, and the United Nations taking on that mantle of a global space program would be a good way to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I do firmly believe in 10 years SLS is going to be around.

And at the very least, it would still fly several times before it was completely scrapped. They aren\u0027t just going to melt down all of this hardware they\u0027re building for scrap before they\u0027ve even flown it. Despite the slow pace and delays, its still on track to fly at some point.\u00A0 Even more importantly, no one at NASA is likely to support it unless a clique of people with a pet project get into positions of power and also manage to get the approval to redirect the entire organization to do something completely different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-26T02:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRobots are \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E more cost effective.
