Looking for some inspiration on communication satellite carriers. I like having junior docking pockets on my satellites, so at later times, I can fly out to them and refuel and/or greatly change their orbits at need. Especially useful with some contracts stating an existing satellite needs it\u0027s orbit altered. Or you\u0027re just docking an upgrade to it, expanding it\u0027s capabilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that docking port usage tends to mean my generally sleek rockets have these ugly, lumpy sticks extruded at somewhat random intervals and I just can\u0027t seem to design something that does the job, without looking like my satellite emplacers have cancerous tumors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote, I also usually play with RemoteTech mod, although sometimes I turn that off, so Im looking for inspiration on manned carriers, or something I can modify into manned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T17:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll usually put an upside down 2.5m to 4x1.25m adapter on top of the rocket, stack the satellites on top of the 1.25m attachment nodes with docking ports or decouplers, then put a 2.5m fairing beneath the adapter to enclose everything. I also like putting Jr docking ports on my satellites for the reasons you mentioned, plus\u00A0you can use them in lieu of a stack decoupler. \u00A0I\u0027ve launched up to 8 satellites and probe landers in this fashion on a single rocket. If you wanted the carrier craft to be manned, I suppose you could put a 2.5m lander can in the stack also.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T19:13:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps a good idea is to make reusable rockets with a Mk2 fuselage. What I have in mind would take off like a rocket but probably be able to land like a plane, and would make orbit either as a single stage or with the help of a couple of SRBs. The rocket would be able to have a Mk2 cargo bay of whatever size is appropriate for your satellites, or perhaps the option for a Mk2 crew cabin. Additionally, you could probably have a version of the satellite carrier which has a junior docking port situated inside of a cargo bay and pointed outwards on some sort of truss setup, to make it fairly easy to dock with a satellite without requiring awkwardly shaped lumps on the outside of the carrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T19:45:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/q7xcvW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002215826548620_b7e2d95163_b.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7568/15826548620_b7e2d95163_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was an entire RT set for Duna ( which is why it\u0027s aerodynamic ) in one shot, complete with mapping sats. Not sure you could fit the sats in a Mk2 fuselage, but maybe. The lifter plane was a scaled up B9 HL craft ( HL is what spawned current stock Mk3 ) so I\u0027m not sure if Mk2 fuselages can fit in Mk3 bays either, but I\u0027m sure there\u0027s some way of fitting it all together.

Those octagonal S2 parts I still use all over the place these days, there\u0027s nothing like them in stock ( they\u0027re literally 2.5m parts turned into octagons ). The problem with Mk2 bays is you\u0027d probably have to line the sats up horizontally, and I doubt you\u0027d get ... I think 9 of them in there without it being quite insanely long/tall. I guess you could just assemble a carrier in orbit. Actually that wouldn\u0027t be a bad plan, you could drop pods of sats off so they ( the pods ) could get into individual resonant orbits.
