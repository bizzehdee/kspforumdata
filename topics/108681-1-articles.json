Apple can, and do, revoke keys used maliciously or in violation of their developer agreements, with the OS regularly downloading the current revoked keys list. They can also block individual apps, rather than an entire developer, for cases where there\u0027s something which is problematic but not malicious. There has been signed malware in the past, I believe, and not just on Apple\u0027s platforms. It\u0027s not a high security system, but raises the bar quite significantly and adds risk of being traced by authorities for malicious acts.\n\nUsing a 3rd party key would be a quite silly thing for any legitimate developer, as your apps could get blacklisted due to improper behaviour by someone else.\n\nThe annual fee also gets you access to closed betas (and various other closed downloads), and the ability to publish via their App Store."},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T07:21:47Z","Content":"On the plus side if Squad sign up they get Crash logs when you hit the \u0022Send Report\u0022 button. \n\nWhich should be good to crush a bug or two."},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T16:26:55Z","Content":"Yes please!
