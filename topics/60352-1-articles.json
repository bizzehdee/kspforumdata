As you can see, the ship is quite large (took up all of the VAB height and just hardly fits into a 3.75 expanded fairing), and with my current level of ship building, wouldn\u0027t be able to get off the ground with out the KW mod. Although it works well to get to Duna, land, and return home, I have to wonder if there is a more simple way to do this? I have made ships that can reach other planets before, but this is my first that has the ability to land and return.
