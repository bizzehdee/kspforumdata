Making energy important is one thing but no generation is an arbitrary difficulty hurdle which sucked all the fun out for me. Other trees did the whole \u0027no solar till late\u0027 and they were just as little fun to grind through. But I digress) and the probes showed drain properly. Most of BTSM is module manager alterations meaning the stock methods are still used which in turn means Fusebox can read it. Anything going through the BTSM DLL will be masked though and unless those methods are public (which I doubt since he stated he wants no other mods near his) then you can\u0027t read the usage. I\u0027ll check it again with whatever BTSM version is current.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the colour and font style people, I thought of a way to let folk change it that won\u0027t cost me hours of coding.
