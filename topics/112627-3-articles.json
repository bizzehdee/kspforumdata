Would be cool to see the Corvus command pod in this node for those, who use it instead of the K2 pod. But corvus has some additional cool parts, which could be added in the node below.

Real Chutes parachutes (already exists)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to start with Bi-Planes, But I think, they should be integrated into the aviation tree. I noticed some balance issues. When you unlock the Bi-plane cockpit and some LFO engines, technically you can go to space! Of course, I limit myself and don\u0027t fly Bi-Plane cockpit higher than 5 km. Would be great to have the altitude limitations for all cockpits. And if you put your poor Kerbal in an unpressurized cockpit on the rocket and launch he will die of hypoxia.

Your mod is set up with a probe that has no control at the beginning, which encourages trying out builds for what are really sounding rockets, as opposed to the full-fledged controllable rockets. The limited science gaining options at the start also make it harder to get a massive burst of points at the beginning that lets you progress too fast.
