As I will be leaving the atmosphere I need to pack some extra zoxy. I know I need to research zoxy 1 tech unless I want to carry extra zoxy in an additional main system tank. However, say I do go for the tech route, what are the prices of the tanks? The costings table shows two tanks, small and large (capacities of 150 and 800 respectively), but what about the 2 sizes of radial tanks (capacities of 75 and 400 respectively)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-28T15:52:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not in this game (not yet : ), but I\\\u0027d point out that, per the decision of the modmaker, the large tanks and main module are being phased out for the next version, the older models are here only to keep continuity with older .craft designs.
