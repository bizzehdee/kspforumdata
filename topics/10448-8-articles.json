What players tend to do is give instructions on how to set that up (landing m/s) and at what altitude to engage it (if engaged high up it can be wasteful). This works well. I\\\u0027m good at manual landings too, but there will always be an element of risk so I suggest just using the landing autopilot.\n\n@robsr3v3ng3: The crew have to survive! Always!

Most people simply cannot afford to send up a secondary, non-profit (at least, no immediate profit) rocket up into orbit with a payload for the station. But some of use (myself included) do have a spare grand or two which we could spend on such missions, but this amount of money would never launch a rocket.\n\nNow of course we all could just save those few grands over 4 or 5 turns and then have enough for a personal rocket, but that\\\u0027s 4 or 5 turns away! What I propose is a sort of \\\u0027funding pool\\\u0027, kept track of in the OP, where people donate howevermuch of there budget to. \n\nThen, with a pool which would grow much quicker with several lenders, a space-station mission can be attempted by an individual using the pool. First this person must request the money for a pool in a forum post (to prevent multiple people claiming the same money) with whoever posts first gets the money. This money MUST then be spent, in the same turn as it is claimed, on a space-station mission. Whether it succeeds or not isn\\\u0027t the matter, it\\\u0027s simply that i see this as an easier way to set up mutually beneficial missions.\n\nIf the pool is claimed, but the player doesn\\\u0027t do a mission (for whatever reason, i realise the RL has a tendency to get in the way of internet shenanigans! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) ) it is returned to the pool at the start of the next turn.\n\nThe pool may not be spent on personal missions.\n\nAll of the pool (or however much claimed from the pool) must be spent in the turn it was claimed purely on a space-station mission (don would be able to confirm this by knowing the player\\\u0027s turn details (i assume ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) ) )\n\nPlayers are morally obliged to spend some of their own money on a space-station mission when drawing from the pool (ie not to fund the mission purely from the pool, incase of failure so that pool isn\\\u0027t completely emptied for no success). Obliged! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAnyway these are just my thoughts, post what you think!\n\nOh and also information about the space station, that is tracking it\\\u0027s completion and how to complete it, might want to be in the OP.\n\n - Bellaby"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-26T11:50:05Z","Content":"So, I completed the turn, the new contract and updates tech/missions are now in the OP.\n\n@Bellaby; looks like a cool initiative, I\\\u0027m all for it as long as you guys do most of the legwork yourself.

I\\\u0027ll keep track of the \\\u0027fund\\\u0027 in the OP if you like, everyone can say per turn how much to put in it etc. I was going to put a spacestation progress bit in that anyway (as soon as something gets launched), so it can go in there.
