A system designed to assist you in planning an intended orbit or trajectory. The node, once calculated, provides a burn time and a count down to said burn time as well as a visual representation of your intended orbit or trajectory. You orient toward the trajectory/target marker and wait. When the timer reaches zero, you burn along that trajectory until the desired velocity and time is achieved then cut engines. You should now be in an orbit more or less matching your desired altitude or on your way to wherever you were travelling to, along a trajectory that more or less matches what you intended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, you might be anywhere from a few hundred, to a few (single digit) thousand metres out in an orbit - depending on how you managed thrust and how quick you were in cutting thrust - but it was in the ballpark. With interplanetary (including transit to the Mun and Minmus) intercepts, your periapsis could be tens of thousands of metres out if you timed it wrong or under/overflew the trajectory target marker. But you had plenty of time to turn retrograde (or prograde, depending on what you had intended) and make a slight correction burn, either manually or using another MN.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the way it worked in KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe I\u0027m approaching MNs in KSP2 wrong, but when I make a MN at suborbital apoapsis and drag prograde, I\u0027m expecting an at least roughly circular orbit. Instead I get a wildly elliptical orbit. Tweaking the radial/normal/pro/retro has no where near the desired effect, dragging the entire node results in wildly differing orbital patterns. I know how to fix it manually, but the point is I shouldn\u0027t have to - that\u0027s what MNs are supposed to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPreviously, I make a MN from 90km perapsis, that is essentially the \u0022centre\u0022 of the node. My 90x90 desired orbit wouldn\u0027t be exact - even if I didn\u0027t play around with moving the node - but it\u0027d be ballpark and I could work with it. In KSP2, I make an MN from 90km perapsis, to have my desired periapsis\u00A0in orbit at 90km or anywhere close to it, my apoapsis is now well over 200km.\u00A0 Way worse than anything KSP1 would do, but fixable once I\u0027m actually in orbit. Burn says 37 seconds. Wait to burn, do so when the timer hits zero. Don\u0027t look at the map, just focus on the burn time and make I\u0027m point toward my intended trajectory. 37 seconds is up, cut thrust when it reaches zero. Periapsis is under 90km. Apoapsis is now 480ish km... I shake my head, mutter under my breath some things that I know I couldn\u0027t do better than the devs, and then try to burn for the Mun - using a MN. My MN projected path is put my periapsis at 2,234km. Can\u0027t be bothered tweaking it, already over it. Fast forward to burn and burn. Watch the timer run to zero, cut thrust. My periapsis is...interplanetary.\u00A0 Now if I was following this in map view, I\u0027d have seen this coming and cut thrust early. I could (did) also see the Apo/Peri readout on the main screen go beyond my established parameters, but I still have like 7 seconds of burning to do and I wanted to see just how and why the MNs are so wrong almost all the time.\u00A0If I\u0027m aimed at the right spot (which I was - according to the nav ball), burning for the right time (which I did, according to the timer), whether I\u0027m looking at a map or not I should be pretty bang on where I intended to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I will admit, and concede, that perhaps I am approaching MNs in KSP2 wrong and there could be a better way of getting circularised orbits (using MNs, doing it manuually isn\u0027t that much of an issue \u003Cem\u003Ebut that\u0027s not the point\u003C/em\u003E) and interplanetary trajectories with the current system. But Mk1 Eyeball Trial and Error Pro/Retrograde burns seems to yield far more reliable results and be far more efficient than using a node. That shouldn\u0027t be a thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a physics-based simulation game about travelling to other planets why such inaccuracy like this even a thing? Especially when the previous iteration of the game seemingly has a better algorithm for calculating burn times and is relatively accurate with not only those times but effecting the desired orbit or trajectory you were seeking. \u00A0Sequels are meant to be better, not be actively worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat am I doing

not the literal centre) of that manoeuvre. The node takes your intended information, calculates it then applies a formula to it so your starting point isn\u0027t at the node itself but further ahead/behind as required, the node is just the interactive point at which you tweak your data. It needs to be somewhere along your projected trajectory (rails) because that\u0027s how the node is able to be created, but your start point is calculated based on what you want the thing to do, rather than where you want to do it. Works in my head, but there\u0027s probably a ridiculous amount of complex calculations occurring in the background to make that a reality.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-17T02:24:17Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2023 02:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Cailean_556\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sea_Kerman","CreatedById":226149,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-17T02:52:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue is for many of the use cases of the new maneuver node system, the \u0022center\u0022 of the node can be in an\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eentirely different \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Efrom the start of the node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, perhaps there could be 2 node modes, one for precision high-thrust short burns where it splits the burn and generates a sort of secant to your trajectory, and one where it works like it does currently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KTwWc7k.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002257.06\u0022 height=\u0022497\u0022 width=\u0022871\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KTwWc7k.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
