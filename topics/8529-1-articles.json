I\\\u0027ve tried many many combinations of tanks, struts, decouplers, solid boosters etc. Is there anything that I should be watching out for and doing to avoid this. I\\\u0027m tired of all these rockets tipping over on the launch pad and blowing up. Is there anything I can modify in the files themselves to make the parts not so wobbly?
