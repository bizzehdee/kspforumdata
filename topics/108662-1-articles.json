As a design principle you\u0027d like to have the weight at the top of the rocket, which is hard to do because fuel drains from the top. Use the biggest tanks you can and/or add stages, slow down, fly as close to prograde as you can, and if that doesn\u0027t do it add fins."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T07:44:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wow, I must do everything wrong.

Plus going faster seems to save dV, in moderation.\n\nFor the OP, you basically need to use some plane concepts to build better rockets in 1.0\u002B. You\u0027ll want a center of lift behind your center of mass, even as your tanks empty. More, lower fins with more lift will make you more stable. However, then you will need more control authority to turn (canards/winglets/etc). As a compromise, I find the small delta control surfaces to be good for small-medium sized rocket fins."},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T09:19:01Z","Content":"With the current gimbal implementation, it can help to steer and to stay on course, but it can also induce flipping, because every gimbal movement of the engine makes it\u0027s thrust deviate from the ideal centre of mass / centre of thrust line.\n\nI would recommend limiting the gimbal and working with aerodynamic controls instead if possible. When correcting the course, the ungimbaled engine still thrusts through the centre of mass and doesn\u0027t induce a snowballing effect for flipping.\n\nHowever, you could even do a little trick if you have multiple tanks in a row. Then you can disable the fuel feed for the upper fuel tanks, moving the centre of mass up during ascent. This reduces flipping dangers, too. However, you must manually (or by action group) reenable the fuel feed once the lower tanks are empty."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T09:50:47Z","Content":"Keep on trying. I struggled a lot at first, then finally found how to do it.\n\nEvent my lightest rocket was flipping. Now I have a steady small rocket (I don\u0027t event touch the steering).\n\nHeavier rockets seem to be easy to take to orbit. They are more forgiving in angle of attack.\n\nDon\u0027t use SAS except when rocket goes slightly off course (usually on tacke-off)\n\nAs many have told : add fins far back then try and retry. Try different thrust limitation on boosters. \n\nMJ is no helping a lot. You must ensure the rocket to fly manually before attempting to use MJ."},{"CreatedByName":"Fishslap","CreatedById":143204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T11:25:01Z","Content":"Depends on the craft I think. Usually this happens to me when I lean into the orbit if the rocket is too heavy in either end. If you don\u0060t use fins this will often lead to control issues until you get high enough. Also the nose will tend to drop if you\u0060re too slow or refuse to come down if you\u0060re too fast. If you go much too fast you\u0060ll tend to get gyrations, especially on long ships. If you use too many boosters from 0-10 000m you get trouble. If that\u0060s the case try staging them so one half of them fire when the first half is done. Remember to stage ditching the spent ones at the same time as the second battery fires though. If you get sonic visual effects around the craft that\u0060s fine. but you\u0060re not supposed to get heating effects because that means you\u0060re losing momentum to the air resistance and are wasting fuel and thrust you should be using to get into orbit. It looks cool but it\u0060s a sign that you should stage your boosters to lower your speed below 10 000 meters and increase it above 10 000 meters.![71pxk0.png](http://i43.tinypic.com/71pxk0.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T11:35:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 11:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fishslap**"},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T12:49:41Z","Content":"What else may help you is to manually manage the fuel flow... For anything under 10mT payload in my career save I\u0027m using a rocket SSTO to maximise my funds efficiency. To avoid the 9km spinny fun times which it will do even with fins, disable the tanks higher up (click the little Green triangles and turn them into Red \u0022No entry\u0022 signs), and let the fuel drain from the lower tanks first. Then enable the next tank as the lower one is about to become depleted. This way it\u0027ll keep your CoM nearer to where it was when you built the thing in the VAB. A bit cheaty? Maybe...?\n\nUsing the above, you may not even need to use fins (assuming you have a gimbal engine - which if you\u0027re SSTOing seems a given, to me at least). Warranty void if attempted without fins. No guarantees that above and aforementioned will prevent catastrophic failures due to pilot error."}]}
