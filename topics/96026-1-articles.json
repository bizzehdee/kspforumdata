The requirements will mention that your Outpost will need to be able to support x kerbals (you don\u0027t need to bring them... you just need to have the capacity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the contract list will show green checkmarks for the requirements met. The ones without the checkmark... are missing. As Tsotha mentioned: on the launch pad you should meet \u003Cstrong\u003Eall\u003C/strong\u003E requirements (except the \u0022landed at...\u0022 one of course).
