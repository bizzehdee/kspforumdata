The difference is most of them had their engines buried in the fuel tank, not external to it like how most KSP mods have their engines.  I built a Lander yesterday with 5x 1.25m fuel tanks and 5 LR-81 engines.  I successfully landed it on the Mun without issue..  My attempt on Duna was less successful as my chutes did not slow me down enough and I burnt through my fuel supply 100m above the Surface...   KeeeerrrrrrSPLAT!\n\nAlternatively you can download Porkjet\u0027s Stock replacement rocket parts in the 1.2 discussion boards...  There is a new \u0022lander\u0022 engine in that mod.

Go ahead and bury them in your fuel tank a bit / clip them into the mount.  \u003Cu\u003ELots\u003C/u\u003E of real world craft were built that way, but as \u0027hollow\u0027 stuff is such a PITA to implement in Unity / video game physics, I\u0027ve settled for a compromise method.  I do not consider it \u0027cheating\u0027 to offset an engine inside a fuel tank slightly;. with the high unused volume and dry mass of the tanks, I would think there is plenty of wiggle room to imagine that the tank had an inset for the engine.\n\nMu usual Mun lander is either the LC2POD or SC-B-CMX with either LR-81 using one of the short straight shrouds, possibly with extra tanks clipped inside the empty area of the shroud, and the engine offset so only part of the bell is protruding below the shroud (legs mounted on the shroud, if they are even used).\n\nAlternatively, I do have the LMDE and LMAE prototype parts available as well.  Those were the \u0027real\u0027 mun-landing engines.  Yes, they are pretty huge though (as they were clipped inside tanks/lander IRL), and they sadly also unlock at the same time as the SD engines.  There isn\u0027t really any good spot for alternate lander-specific engines on the stock tech-tree;  the first good node for small engines is \u0027propulsion systems\u0027 which is near the middle of the tree, and where most  are already located (with the rest in prec. propulsion)."},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-28T17:26:52Z","Content":"speaking of the vertical offset, where do I modify the limit for it and the engine spacing? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-28T17:31:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 minutes ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E speaking of the vertical offset, where do I modify the limit for it and the engine spacing? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nBoth are currently hard-coded I believe; I had no reason to think that someone would want to offset stuff by \u003E 2m (or whatever I set the max at).
