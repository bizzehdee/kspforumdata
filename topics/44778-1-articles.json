I\u0027ve been playing KSP just under a month now, and lurking on the forums slightly longer. I\u0027m probably pretty far behind by most standards: I haven\u0027t successfully ventured past Minmus (I had a Moho satellite flight go slightly awry, and haven\u0027t encountered a convenient interplanetary window since). I have a fledgling station in LKO, another station in Munar orbit, I\u0027ve landed on the Mun but not returned (I simply kept the Kerbals there to man the station), and I\u0027ve only begun my Kethane mining activities; I haven\u0027t yet put a wheeled vehicle on another body, and haven\u0027t landed anywhere other than the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKWR, Mechjeb, Kethane, B9, Lazor Docking Cam, Subassembly Manager, and Crew Manifest have been integral in my operations so far, and I have several other mods installed that I haven\u0027t yet broken into (like KAS), and also several others downloaded that I\u0027m not quite ready to install (Remotetech, Ioncross Life Support, etc). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to becoming a contributing member of the community!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T23:41:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
