Been having a ball with it so far but I noticed something that seems strange to me. So far I\u0027ve come across three \u0022Gemini ... Liquid Fueld Tanks\u0022. There\u0027s the \u0022Short 2.5M\u0022, the \u0022Small Silver\u0022 and the \u0022Medium Silver\u0022. They all look basically the same (other then size) so I\u0027ve been using them in combination with each other to make various Atlas and Centaur creations. But I noticed that while the \u0022Small Silver\u0022 has half as much fuel as the \u0022Medium Silver\u0022, the \u0022Short 2.5m\u0022 actually has 57% as much fuel as the \u0022Small Silver\u0022 but it\u0027s less then half the height. Was this intentional or is the \u0022Short 2.5m\u0022 not supposed to be used along side the \u0022... Silver\u0022 tanks?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I noticed. IRL, the original sustainer engine used on the Atlas SLV-3 rocket produced around 366kN of thrust while the booster produced around 1650kN. I know that in game the two chambers on the LR-89 booster have to be represented by two seperate engines so that\u0027s around 825kN / chamber. In other words, the sustainer engine produces about 44% thrust compared to each chamber on the booster. Now, I know the thrust in game isn\u0027t going to match the IRL thrust. That\u0027s fine. But why does the sustainer produce more thrust (293kN) then the boosters (125kN)? Shouldn\u0027t the \u0022Mercury Atlas Rocket Booster Engine\u0022 really be producing somewhere around 665kN to keep a simialr ratio to the real life engines?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:10:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chrisl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chrisl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother thing I noticed.

The Flight profile is more in line with the RW Atlas/Mercury but it is about 10x harder to fly given the lack of good feedback in KSP RE resources. You have to GUESSTIMATE how much fuel needs to be left to make orbit with the low thrust LR-105\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fail to orbit about one in five attempts with this config.

Much closer to \u0022Scaled Real Life\u0022 End result is similar (Mercury capsule in orbit of Kerbin at about 75-90K meters.) End result is also much harder requiring you to spend a lot more time finessing the controls (I often have to attach Fins to the Booster section to keep the thing flying correctishly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T00:12:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 12:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pappystein\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StoryMusgrave","CreatedById":131938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:14:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFASA isn\u0027t replica.

Those are not necessary however because those planes can be cobbled together with various plane packs. If you did make those planes, it would be an EXTREMELY popular pack. Regardless of that it still would be very popular. Most space infrastructure is represented more or less in this game.

The actual X-plane progression was about what we got (well upto the end of the scope for FASA as laid out.) Actually right up to the X-30 we stayed on course for projected NASA projects. A Few X-15 flights were canceled due to the loss of some of the aircraft but in the End nothing \u0022Astropheric\u0022 was planned after the X-15. The Lifting bodies are often shown on modified Titan II/IV launchers but that was more for orbital re-entry testing than full use. NASA was able to simulate most of the early orbital re-entry with the Lifting bodies by strapping bigger engines on them than originally designed. Then Balls 3 or Balls 8 would drop them as high as the B-52Bs could go and they would climb then dive to simulate the future space shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voidryder","CreatedById":57308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T02:40:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of Frizzank doing X-15\u0027s, lifting bodies...well sign me up and strap me in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
