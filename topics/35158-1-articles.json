Is there any thread, committee, shadowy quasi-NGO that is organising, listing or in any other way standardising add-on resources / variables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr put this another way, I am thinking of making a part, that uses Lox and LH to make water \u002B power (like the thing that went bang in a spectacular fashion on Apollo 13). Realistically, the H2O is a byproduct that is only there for balance reasons at this moment in time. My question therefore is, is it acceptable to re-use existing resource.CFG files, so save each addon maker defining 15 un-interchangeable versions of \u0022water\u0022 etc. and if so, is there a thread etc defining / documenting / distributing such KSO style programme?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConversely, if such a development resource does not exist, straw poll on the best place to make one.
