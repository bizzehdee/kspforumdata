Today I achieved my first manned orbit after a little while, but soon, what was once all good and golden turned bad! Jeb went out on a quick EVA, but he accidentally made the craft gyrate out of balance, and he couldn\u0027t get back in! I tried to help, but now he has no more EVA propellant and he cannot fly to the ship, even though it is near.. How do I get him back? Please help Jeb, he will not survive reentry, which is coming soon, I think.. ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T16:06:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainApollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"zxczxczbfg","CreatedById":74636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T17:27:58Z","Content":"Send up an unmanned retrieval ship with a reentry-worthy capsule for Jeb to ride in. You\u0027ll probably need to look up tutorials for rendezvous maneuvers. Until then, though, just leave Jeb in orbit (Kerbals don\u0027t need life support in the stock game and there\u0027s no time limit for EVA).\n\nFailing that, I don\u0027t think Kerbals can die from re-entry heating. You could just nudge Jeb out of orbit (make sure to land him on his head, which is the toughest part of any Kerbal, believe it or not).\n\nIn any case, if Jeb dies he respawns automatically.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T17:30:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zxczxczbfg**"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T17:29:50Z","Content":"yeah without the aid of another vessel, jeb is pretty much screwed."},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T17:30:43Z","Content":"I agree with the poster above.
