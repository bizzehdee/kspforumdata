Based on what Squad have said, you\u0027re completely wrong about that. They have said quite clearly that development will be continuing long past 1.0, ever since 0.90 and 1.0 first started to be mentioned.\n\n1.0.1, or 1.1, or however they choose to number it, is a certainty. With the amount that has changed between 0.90 and 1.0, I\u0027m expecting them to release a bug fix release in a matter of weeks to fine tune it and mop up any easy issues. If any serious issues appear, it could be in a matter of days."}]}
