Your orbit is close to the requested orbit, but not close enough. You need to fine-tune your orbit somewhat more. I suggest to set up a maneuver node at a place where your orbit and the requested orbit are close, fiddle with the node until the resulting orbit matches as good as you can make it, and then fly the manuever node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Super4Jet","CreatedById":204125,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-21T07:24:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I thought those are the maximums, as Geosynchronous orbit should noramlly be \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E=\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E.
