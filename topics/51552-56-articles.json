Kerbal Alarm clock is also a big plus, as you can setup your nodes for multiple craft and go about doing something else, either in the game or real life, and it\u0027ll let you know when you need to pay attention again (or pause the game). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and something that does mapping, whether it be ISA, or mapscan, which I believe is the new one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say kOS instead of MJ because with kOS you get more control over what happens, like opening solar panels when out of the atmosphere (something i sometimes forget to do), or deploying chutes or landing gear before landing. Granted some of the stuff takes a lot more programming knowledge than most people have, but it can do some of the simple stuff that MJ does, such as ascent/orbit. It\u0027s not quite to the point yet where you can select a body to orbit, or vessel to dock with and it\u0027ll do that, but in a way I think that\u0027s good as it forces you to figure out how to do that on your own. Unless of course you take someone\u0027s complete program and use that, then it\u0027s sort of the same thing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m going off topic so I\u0027ll stop here and go try out the fix cilph posted. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E For Science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also use all these mods except for KOS, I haven\u0027t been able to figure that one out yet.
