I have the latest KSP version, but i still cant see any flags? When i open the choose flag window, there are no items in it. I even followed a tutorial how to make a custom flag, and put it in GameData\\Squad\\Flags and i noticed that there are many default flags here, but in the game, i see none of them. I tried to click on the flag in the space center, and tried to assign a flag to a ship too, but the flags are always missing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-25T10:48:47Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2013 10:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Vlk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T22:18:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould I have a picture?
