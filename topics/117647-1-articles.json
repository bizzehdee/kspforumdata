More specifically, this will be the underlying framework for the next big things, like Multiplayer. The idea with this framework is to leave the base game, as much as possible, unchanged, and by not changing it so much, we get to cut down on unity compile times, as well as making the new content much more portable and easy to work with. \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis may sound somewhat familiar if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re a mod developer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and it actually is. This framework uses the same runtime assembly loading system we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve always had for mod plugins, but it goes beyond it on some areas, mainly asset loading and such. It also involves designing a new build pipeline (coming soon) to automate builds for these things, hopefully without requiring the entire game to be rebuilt every time.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is one good addition that might help out modders too. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure if this happens when developing to a build of KSP, but it did in Unity and it was driving me mad. Whenever I ran the game, the assemblies would load and all, but after stopping, they wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get released from being \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153in use\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. Meaning any attempts to recompile in the following 2-3 minutes would result in the .dll files not being copied over because they were supposedly being used by the game. I found this awesome C# feature though, called Shadow Copying, which is meant to solve that exact problem. What it does is, whenever you load an assembly into your program, instead of loading it from the dll file directly, the file is first copied to a temp location, then the copy is loaded. That leaves the original dll file free to be modified, and allows me to keep my sanity at reasonable levels! Everybody wins!\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll in all, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m pretty happy with the way this system is working. It might not be terribly exciting unless you are an organized data structure enthusiast, but this will allow us to continue building big things for KSP in updates to come.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMike (Mu)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve just finished re-implementing the Kerbal portraits back into the flight scene.

It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been wild, considering the office is in maintenance mode and the dev kit has a certain number of requirements to be able to be recognized by the computer; and even physically finding a place on a desk for the kit to sit is hard. The dev kit and development side and the PS4 SDK are under NDA, so forgive me for not being able to disclose much about it, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m only hoping we can play our WIP KSP version on the PS4 test kit sometime this week.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDaniel (danRosas)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGot a little tired due last week\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s trip. Picked up some stuff for Squad, and visited good friends! Back home, I worked on a launcher screen for Max, and kept on with the assets for of the game. Created prefabs and imported the new stuff. Next thing to do is pull the scripts, and start making those assets work. On the other hand we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been playing Rocket League in our spare time, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve discovered a new obsession.

In an earlier devnote I mentioned that we are planning on making knowledge base run under app launcher. This shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t affect the look of the game much but it was necessary in order to have the app launcher go on the right hand side of the screen.

The Unity 5 work goes along nicely, as goes the studio renovations and repairs. The most important thing I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been involved in is helping Badie get used to the studio and her new duties.

The Experimental Applications have been closed - with a final count of 387 - and preliminary filtering and sorting performed, with the majority of the applications still undecided on. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve created a pretty simple mail merge and have just been going through them one-by-one, quickly eliminating the applications that aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t viable, leaving a good quantity of great applications. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll take its time, but I want to ensure I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not overlooking any applicants and there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s no real metric that applicants can be filtered out by - other than the NDA question.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdditionally, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been auditing our Experimental Testing Team, which has been its own bit of fun in Excel!
