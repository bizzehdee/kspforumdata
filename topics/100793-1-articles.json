Cockroaches need food. If they won\u0027t find anything to eat, they will leave for greener pastures (so to speak). Maybe they have easy access to cereals or other storeable food in cabinets?

Each empty lot separated by houses are its own mini biosphere with different environment, and it is fascinating to watch the interaction of species there.

If you don\u0027t leave any bits of food, clean the place regularly (yes, this means moving the furniture from time to time to access all the places) the place would become unsuitable for their living. Of course, if you don\u0027t live in a standalone house they might come from your neighbors, so there are slow poison baits that act slowly allowing a single cockroach to live long enough to get to their nest and poison all its mates. It also prevents them from breeding. I found it very effective some time ago.

They won\u0027t live any longer than humans. They are parasites and without us they won\u0027t have any food / places to live. Besides, some biologists say that cockroaches will soon extinct completely. Some 20-30 years ago cockroaches were a scourge of any urban area where I live. Now I cannot even remember the time I saw one for the last time. There is hypothesis that they hate electromagnetic emissions we have surrounded ourselves with. Cell phones, wi-fi routers, etc. all of this apparently makes them uncomfortable.
