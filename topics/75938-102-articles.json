I can\u0027t necessarily get you the source myself, but lo-fi has been rather cooperative with other addon developers in the past. Even without the model source, however, you could probably pull it off using the current configs and models as a reference. I believe they\u0027re not all that much different from a wheel, except that there\u0027s simply some form of transform instead of a wheel fixture. It may be more complicated than that, however, since I also know there are ray-casts involved in the KF modules. I honestly don\u0027t understand it well enough to explain it further. As the very least, though this is rather hacky, you could likely create your own part, then weld it in the config with a current repulsor model, then use a combination of the standard repulsor module along with lo-fi\u0027s object removal module to basically leave the repulsor functionality available while removing the visual aspect of the original model, allowing your own model to be the primary visual element.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure all of that even makes sense to me, but you can look in my signature for my standard disclaimer which applies to just about everything I say.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"occ","CreatedById":118787,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T05:10:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am having a problem with the repulsors. I created a simple hovercraft (less than 50 parts) and put it on the runway. I found that the craft\u0027s repulsors did, in fact, react to the ammount of weight on the craft. I was also able to adjust the height of the repulsors. However the \u0022extend/retract repulsors\u0022 function did not work, and even when I had no part of my craft touching the ground, (I knew this because the repulsors were drawing energy, and I was able to verify that the craft was not weighed down so much that it was negating the repulsor\u0027s function) the craft would not move. It was on the runway, so it should have at least slid forward. It did not. I even tried placing a pair of lv-t engines on the back end. I do run somewhere around a metric ton of mods, but I do not think that was the problem because KSP\u0027s RAM usage did not go above ~2.5gigs (that is with aggressive texture management and half-res textures) Please ask if you would like any more information about this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T06:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm... one thing to pay attention to is whether or not the repulsors can actually reach the ground. We\u0027ve seen cases where the repulsors were placed too high up on the craft and couldn\u0027t repulse high enough to work. Also, the extend/retract functions are poorly named, since all they do is increase/decrease the height. Also, the repulsors will draw energy if any of them are actually turned on, regardless of repulsion activity (I\u0027m pretty sure of this, not entirely though) and with no regard for what parts of the graft might be having collision issues with the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are right, however, that the repulsor field does mimic wheel suspension in that it responds not only to the height setting, but also to craft weight. Another thing to keep in mind is that even if a repulsor is as zero, there is still a collider under it that can still collide with the ground and, even when not actively repulsing, may scrape the ground even if the appearance is that the craft is hovering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso, check the repulsor attachment positions to make sure they aren\u0027t too high (if not using the surface attached repulsors) and, when in doubt, add more power and repulsor units to the mix and try again.

This allows you to have the repulsors respond to a landing after catching air over a hill by giving a little instead of suddenly impacting with a hard bump. This also allows the craft to go over a tiny little bump without actually bumping itself into the air the way a wheel would.

Repulsors have absolutely no friction with the ground, so the only thing slowing you down is the air and gravity, the latter of which the repulsors are actively trying to counteract in the vertical direction, but will gladly let you slide uncontrollably down any slight incline your craft sets itself upon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the up-side, if you want to land on the water, or on rough terrain, and your descent is shallow enough, repulsors will allow you to land safely most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Madrias","CreatedById":89995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T23:48:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom having used repulsors as anti-lithobraking devices on lighter crafts, I could give a bit of information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximum Altitude is not what you want, contrary to popular belief.

I\u0027ll do some digging around in the code...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know for certain that the tweakscale exponent settings don\u0027t take that into account at all, but we have a special variable that we set along with the scale which modifies a lot of other variables within the code, so it\u0027ll take some digging to figure out if the suspension is modified by it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, absurdity with wheel numbers is a rather realistic situation with extremely heavy craft. Considering the vessels in KSP are likely a lot heavier than what we would build in the real world due to the fact that we would build parts that are made specifically for the purpose of that vessel rather than using rocket and space station parts to fill in the gaps... well, we\u0027d likely be using an absurd number of wheels too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: So, I did some poking around and it turns out the \u0022springRate\u0022 variable, also a config parameter, is indeed multiplied by the \u0022tweakScaleCorrector\u0022 variable which is set to the equivalent of the current scale. \u0022springRate\u0022 is a badly named variable for \u0022Spring Strength\u0022 in the code. However, part mass (and other settings) is covered by a completely different exponent which is outside of this mod\u0027s specific settings, which means the strength may not be updating to compensate for any other changes such as the part\u0027s own mass. If the wheels are having to compensate too much for their own mass, then the vessel mass may not be taken into account correctly.

If you haven\u0027t modified your local file, then you could try modifying your own local file and see if it makes any difference. In the code, those settings are already multiplied directly with the tweakScaleCorrector variable which is made to equal the scale level. However, if we also scale the base value that the scale corrector multiplies with then, in theory, we can increase the spring/damper to better match the new part scale without touching the original code. Granted, this is a work-around that we would want to update in the code itself later, but for now this is a good way to test the results. Since I don\u0027t have any really heavy rovers built at this time, it would be quicker if you were able to test the results. I\u0027m going to try and explain what to edit now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in the file named \u0022KF_Scaletype.cfg\u0022 you will be looking for this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003ETWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    name = KFModuleWheel\u003Cbr\u003E    !tweakScaleCorrector = 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept there will be different values matching what scale levels that size-class can take.

This thread has been dead for a while now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, on the topic of the magnetic RCS, that could be done by basically recreating the ion-RCS, but stripping out the xenon requirement, and using something like RCSFX to eliminate any form of visual effect to go with the RCS firing event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the control issues, I have never actually tried using mechjeb with a track setup, but it would make sense that it would have issues. It\u0027s built to handle rovers that have to be moving forward to turn and tend to turn without half of the rover actually slowing down slightly to finish the maneuver. My suspicion is that it freaks out a bit when the vessel\u0027s velocity appears to change suddenly, which itself causes a trajectory change that it tries to compensate for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wheels, however, I have had no issues with. Granted, the softer steering tends to turn the craft a little less precisely (in the time that mechjeb would normally expect the turn to be done) and so its reaction time is a little slow, but otherwise it hasn\u0027t given me any trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
