Different sample types could be unlocked as you progress.

Try taking soil samples of the launchpad dirt, get some crew and EVA reports from around the space center, and then venture out offshore to test the water and the nearby islands. You can get a lot of research done with what you start with, and a lot more still simply by taking your trusty goo canisters all over the place. Best of all, you can leave the canisters anywhere on Kerbin and recover them for full science value right from the tracking station.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poryy","CreatedById":81075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T12:03:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny comments on 3?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T23:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Poryy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Poryy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny comments on 3?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a comment on 3: \u002B1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have a suggestion for improvement of the research tree: tools used to collect research points should not be choices you can unlock, but should automatically be granted to you when you have accumulated enough total research points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you like this idea, feel free to put it in your main post!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-22T23:03:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2013 11:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poryy","CreatedById":81075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T17:34:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have a comment on 3: \u002B1\u003Cp\u003EI also have a suggestion for improvement of the research tree: tools used to collect research points should not be choices you can unlock, but should automatically be granted to you when you have accumulated enough total research points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you like this idea, feel free to put it in your main post!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mean things like the thermometer an the barometer?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
