I can\u0027t let him perish. So I used a few tips from Scott - first, I had been doing F5 quicksaves along the way. The last one was at periapsis with Minimus going 1000 m/s (lol), so that wasn\u0027t gonna be enough. But he also gave a tip about if you run out of fuel you can use the thrusters. But they weren\u0027t making puffs of smoke for me like they were doing for Scott. So I read the wiki and learned that the \u0022R\u0022 key turns on the RV-105 Thrusters - I thought they were always working! Anyhow, the combination of using all my liquid fuel and most of my monopropellant from the thrusters (19.53 left out of 110) got me into orbit! YAY!!! I DID IT!!!

Can I really put another ship in orbit and get the two ships close enough so Jebediah can fly to the other ship with his jetpack? I have solar panels on the capsule, so Jebediah will be okay even if it takes me a while to get back to him, right? I\u0027m loving this career mode.

For any ship not with a science lab this will get more return than just keeping and returning one run. It also gets you some science right away without having to wait for the mission to complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T22:11:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022asb3pe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022asb3pe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt seems as if we never want to transmit data unless it is the only means for returning the science back home (i.e. a one-way probe to deep space).
