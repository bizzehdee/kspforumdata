I just finished my first session of (failed) VTOLs, and I still not sure what went wrong. I understand that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E should be closely aligned with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E, but whenever I test my spaceplane it either roles to the side so much it flips upside down, or it just rotates in a circle without rolling. Both turn into uncontrollable free falls and spirlas before it disappears into the water. Could anybody give me advice? Also, 75% of my plane tests veer off the runway and explode before I get halfway of the runway. Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coyote Foxtrot","CreatedById":197339,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-07T21:58:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen is comes to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E, there is a bit of nuance to it. When it comes to standard forward flight, the purpose of having \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E behind \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is to have passive stability to the craft. With the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E infront, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E will naturally want to increase; this is considered to be unstable. Having the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E behind means that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E naturally wants to decrease; this considered to be stable. The further back the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is, the more stable (the more the craft will want to return to its flight path vector/prograde) it is, but also the more resistant it is to change. Having \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E close behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is to balance between stability and maneuverability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlacement of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E however is also dependent on the torque produced by thrust based around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s vector and position relative to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sort of balance between stability and instability is on two planes for pitch and yaw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the issue is purely on vertical takeoff with little to no horizontal speed, aerodynamics play almost no effect and it now comes to a balance of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E relative to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. You want the average vector mainly to go through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E; it does not necessarily have to be directly underneath the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, but it would require a greater angle the further away resulting in horizontal movement. Without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters or different engines/gimbling engines for thrust vector effect, you will essentially have no control over the craft in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E mode. You can either have engines rotate/gimbal around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E so it results in torque in different directions or you can place multiple engines that you can quickly vary the thrust in to allow for uneven thrust and control over the craft.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will need to maintain some of this vertical thrust and balance until you achieve enough airspeed for you control surfaces to be effective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the issue of veering off the runway, assuming you are mostly using a tricycle gear design with a singular nose wheel, the same idea with the stability and instability with lift applies with the gears. It is best to get pressure off of the nose wheel as soon as you can to reduce its friction with the surface and power to change the crafts direction and then instead rely on your vertical stabilizer and rudder for yaw control. Make sure the main gear is just behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E to allow the needed force to pull your aircraft up is reduced as it\u0027s like a seesaw. The further back your main gear is, the smaller your moment arm for your elevators are and the less force you have to rotate your aircraft (assuming you are not using canards).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
