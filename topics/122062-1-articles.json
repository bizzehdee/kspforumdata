It took about 30 episodes and I was surprised how close to the real thing the end result actually looks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve edited the footage down. Here\u0027s a \u0022quick\u0022 version of the assembly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/mvyvKzQOCQg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/mvyvKzQOCQg\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were obvious limitations, like no robotic arms to manipulate payloads, so most parts were either docked using non-authentic little \u0022tug boats\u0022 or by having RCS capability of their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final part count is 1291, clocking in just around 195 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was all done with KSP V1.04, in a video series on this channel called \u0022KSP: Operation Vanilla\u0022. It\u0027s in German.
