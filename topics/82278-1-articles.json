I have been hunting for a real flight stick but I said \u0022what the hell..\u0022. It works (amazingly) but of course is useless for multi-axis control. I am on a crazy limited budget (all my fun money is going to KSP-related things, cause insanity). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any good suggestions for a cheap, but decent flight stick? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to hear from the KSP community, not random reviews. Good for this game, and space sims in general perhaps. Single piece, as much as I would love thrust sticks and pedals I can only afford a single unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to play Microsoft Flight Sim back in the day (never had a stick, tho) and even used my experience to co-pilot for a few hrs in a single prop (best time of my 15 yr old life). I miss the feel of a joystick, and I think it might get me to go IVA more and build some space-planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWon\u0027t be much longer until I cut out boxes and surround my computer desk with markered on \u0022buttons\u0022 and \u0022readouts\u0022, turn off the lights, turn the AC up, and liquefy back into a kid again. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisHale","CreatedById":116537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T02:34:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, you can find them for around $30 and it includes twist, throttle, hat, and lots of buttons.
