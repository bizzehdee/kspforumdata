Rabbi ********* called me back, and after talking sent me some links with more information. \u00A0Three days later I sent back the donor form to see if it would be possible for me to do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hospital \u00A0(NY Presbyterian) sent me a package for blood work, which I had done and had it sent back to the hospital.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy blood type is AB, which is pretty rare, only about 4% of people have it. \u00A0So I wasn\u2019t expecting the call which said that I actually matched two people on Renewal\u2019s list. \u00A0So we moved forward some more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis still wasn\u2019t quite real to me, it was like something I was putting my toe in. \u00A0Within a few weeks I was at the hospital for the donor evaluation, which was an all-day event. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe testing showed a couple of anomalies, so I had to go in again for some more tests. \u00A0The subsequent tests showed everything was normal, the anomalies were caused by some medications I was taking and were harmless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the call: \u00A0When would I like the surgery, sooner or later. \u00A0I just wanted to do this and get it over with, so surgery was scheduled for June 16. \u00A0 From what I understand, this was on the short side of what donors usually do. \u00A0I spoke to my company to be sure that this wouldn\u2019t impact anything at work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTick, tick, tick. \u00A0All of a sudden it was June 12, my last day at work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurgery was scheduled for Tuesday. \u00A0I had to be at the hospital in NYC at 6:30 AM. \u00A0The weekend passed quickly, did some errands on Monday, did the pre-surgery prep work as well. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMonday night had some unexpected visitors show up, including Rabbi ****** and his son-in-law Rabbi ****, who is the Rosh Kolel in *******.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep, but sleep came surprisingly quickly. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had my alarm set to go off at 4am, car service was picking me up at \u00A04:30, along with Rabbi ***** who was coming along for support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe ride in to the city passed, we got to the hospital at 5:45, and had to wait until \u00A06:00 before they started processing the people waiting. \u00A0The wait wasn\u2019t long before they called me in. \u00A0I got into the hospital gown, and was waiting and chatting with Rabbi ***** when Rabbi ****** of Renewal asked if I would be willing to meet the recipient, who was in the next bed over in the pre-op room. \u00A0So, unexpectedly, I met the recipient and his wife, who were very emotional and extremely grateful. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout 10 minutes later they walked me (a long walk) into the operating room.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy only real complaint was that I asked the anesthesiologist to tell me when they were going to put me to sleep, and instead, she just went ahead without telling me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo to the talk\u201D, my wife insisted. \u00A0Thank G-d for my wife. \u00A0The end result was that 3 months later, I was walking into an operating room to do the donation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy? \u00A0Why put myself through the pain, of the recovery, of being out of work for a month?\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think this can best be answered the same way President Kennedy asked and answered the question about going to the Moon. \u00A0If this was easy, there wouldn\u2019t be any issue about donors. \u00A0But it isn\u2019t easy, both in qualifying to be a donor, and in doing it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI decided to donate my kidney because I could, not because it was easy. \u00A0It wasn\u2019t easy. \u00A0Pain medications don\u2019t work well on me, so I had more pain than most. \u00A0But the end result, a year later,was to see my recipient at a seuda, healthy and able to enjoy life again after nearly 40 years of suffering. \u00A0I suffered for a week, to end someone\u2019s lifetime of suffering.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u2019m not vain, and don\u2019t boast about things. \u00A0I made arrangements with my company to be able to take the time off, and aside from most of the people in my department knowing, that was that. \u00A0At least, until the end of the week, when the CEO of my company, Saki *******, learned about it and, rather than sending a normal Friday, end of week message, \u00A0sent the following message to all company employees:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis week I\u2019d like to highlight one of our phenomenal Achieve employees: Jonathan *****, Manager of Technical Operations in our development team. Last week, Jonathan voluntarily donated his kidney through an organization that matches volunteers to individuals challenged with kidney failure. This amazingly selfless act made me so proud to have Jonathan on our team. Besides being a dedicated Achieve employee, Jonathon is a father and grandfather, who has inspired many of us by giving someone he never met before a new lease on life.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nJonathon, I am amazed by your selflessness.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI could not have done this without the support of my wife, my rabbi, my company, and Renewal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an ending to this, the benefit to myself went far beyond the initial donation. \u00A0During a checkup about 6 months afterwards, the doctor found an extremely early tumor in my thyroid; \u00A0it was essentially undetectable, and would not have been found except for the donation. \u00A0So in the end, my donating a kidney saved not only the recipient\u2019s life, but my own as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-08T16:01:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2016 04:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by linuxgurugamer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-08T03:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a pretty amazing thing to do.
