I\u0027m planning on making a single carrier ship to ferry landers for the 4 other moons. Landers for Pol, Bop, and Vall were designed based on, um, ground-based observations of the Jool moons, but I decided I needed to take a closer look at Tylo and its massive gravity well before finalizing my lander for that moon. I\u0027ll try to stitch together some of my images to avoid putting up unnecessarily long posts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my Laythe base, Quad-Mega Base 2.0, which will be conducting operations on the Jool side of things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/2013-04-28_00031.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-04-28_00031.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the launcher and a shot of the probes sent to Tylo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Endurance/Tylodoomedprobe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Tylodoomedprobe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe less said about the ill-fated lander the better, but the orbital Sat-Map probe, visible underneath the lander, worked fine.

As expected mechjeb failed miserably at landing, running out of fuel about 500m above the surface. But I was able to bring it down myself with plenty to spare. I landed at a fairly high region, about 8km up, using about 3000m/s of delta-v. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Endurance/Tyloprobe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Tyloprobe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this information in hand I finalized my Tylo lander design and finished launching the components of my mission.

Most of the mod parts come from the Kosmos pack, with a few fuel tanks from KW, radial engines and command pods from HOME, and a few Sat-Map probes. The assembled vehicle is about 225 tons, made up of 364 parts, with a crew of 11 Kerbals, and a total of 16 different crafts, including the core carrier, and the landers, rovers and probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Endurance/EnduranceMinmus.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EnduranceMinmus.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis picture clearly shows that I\u0027m a no-talent hack, who just threw together some parts and clicked the \u0027fly-mission\u0027 button. Or, no, I mean it shows my exit from Minmus, and shows the flaw that should be obvious from the previous picture, that my vessel is severely unbalanced. The heavy Tylo lander is about 75 tons, while the Vall lander is only 45 tons, meaning the whole thing will pull towards the heavier side. With a full fuel load and no way to balance things out or set engines at different throttle levels, I have to use the Vall booster engine to adjust my heading. Activating and deactivating it allows me to, more or less, stay on course, but it\u0027s pretty tedious. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Endurance/Minmusexit.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Minmusexit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I got back down to lower Kerbin orbit I activated the radial engines to take as much advantage of my high velocity as possible. I still had to play around with balancing thrust levels, but it wasn\u0027t quite so bad at this point. After a few minutes of this I deactivated all but the 3 nuclear engines and carried out the rest of the burn, and I was able to finally balance the load enough to stay on target and successfully set up a Jool encounter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Endurance/KerbinExit.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KerbinExit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother crucially important bit of information that I learned, which in retrospect should have been head-slappingly obvious, during these burns, was that the amount of delta-v required to move from a moon, back to a low orbit of the the planet is only slightly more than what\u0027s necessary to break orbit around the moon. I had been thinking that returning from a moon to a low orbit around the planet would take a delta-v equal to that required to \u003Cem\u003Eget\u003C/em\u003E to the moon in the first place. Which is of course, dumb; that\u0027s what it would take to get back to low orbit, and then circularize my orbit at that point. So all of my landers were designed with 1000-1500 m/s of extra delta-v that I was planning on using to get from the outer moons down to a Laythe orbit. So this should simplify some things, allowing me to set up encounters of Bop and Pol, the two small, highly inclined, moons without dragging the whole vehicle along for the ride, and maybe ensure that I actually have enough fuel for the return trip. It\u0027s amazing how many things there are to learn after 200 hours of playing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up I have to optimize my Jool encounter, launch some of the initial probes, and figure out the ideal way to launch and set up encounters for the Bop and Pol landers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T15:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that I\u0027m on my way to Jool we can take a closer look at the different components of my spacecraft. Here is the core module and one of the light Pol/Bop landers. You can see that the core is very simple, just a fuel tank and a big engine (that\u0027s the nuclear engine from the Kosmos pack, I used it just because I like the way it looks, it is no more powerful than the regular engine and it weighs a lot more). The trusses are actually very stable when accelerating, with just a little bit of flexing at the docking ports for the heavier landers. The big RCS thruster on top helps with turning and stabilizing the craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the right is the light lander, which is actually made up of four separate crafts. On the bottom is an extra fuel tank used to refuel the core stage after the transfer burn to Jool. This will be released with a few L of fuel and set to plunge into Jool, one on as steep a descent as possible, and the other on a bit of a slower path. On top there are two small probes that will be released upon achieving orbit around Pol/Bop. One is a small Sat Map probe with enough fuel to set up a wide, polar orbit. The other is a small lander that will be used to scout out possible sites for the manned lander. In the center we have the lander itself, with fuel enough to line up my orbit with the target, land, take off again, and meet with the carrier back in Laythe orbit, this time a lot lighter, with many fewer parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Endurance/Enduranceschema1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Enduranceschema1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we have the mid sized Vall lander, and the heavy Tylo lander. The Vall craft has the same two probes on top, the lander has a bit more fuel to compensate for Vall\u0027s much higher mass. The landing struts on the radial tanks give the small lander plenty of clearance, so it will be deployed after landing with the radial engines. The lander can then blast off again and meet up with the carrier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tylo lander doesn\u0027t have any Sat Map or lander probes, since I already launched those, but it does have a small Jool relay probe on top. This will be released during the transit to Jool and should arrive several days ahead of the other craft to act as a communications relay in high Jool orbit. It carries another rover on the bottom which will be released upon landing. The tall, radial fuel tank stacks will only be used for the descent stage, dropping off before the final landing. The radial engines are only there to give the final boost necessary for landing, and the first stage of take off. The central, nuclear engine should be able to finish getting the craft into orbit and to get back to the carrier around Laythe. Neither of these two ships have RCS thrusters on the final stages, so docking should be tricky, but doable. I found that a stack of I-beams work great when you need to have a really long ladder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Endurance/Enduranceschema2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Enduranceschema2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first Jool probes and the communications relay are released after setting up a reasonably close encounter with Jool. They are each set to arrive about a day apart from each other, and about 5 days ahead of the main craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Endurance/Probelaunch.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Probelaunch.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust after reaching the Jool system I released the Bop and Pol landers. This far out they can perform most of the inclination change necessary to reach their targets without spending much fuel. This lets me keep the main craft on an almost flat inclination for the initial approach to Jool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Endurance/ProbelaunchatJool.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ProbelaunchatJool.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I call orbital spaghetti. The two probes are set to crash into Jool, while the relay probe arcs behind the planet in a highly inclined path. The two landers are at an inclination that will let them meet up with Pol and Bop, the orbits of which can be seen along the top. One of the landers looks like it will have a glancing encounter with Laythe, but it doesn\u0027t seem like it will have much of an effect. The three main craft are all set to aerobrake around 30 minutes apart, so I\u0027ll have to be careful about the timing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Endurance/Orbitalspaghetti.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Orbitalspaghetti.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two probes meet their inevitable demise, quickly at first, and then slowly, as they drift down in the increasingly dense atmosphere of Jool.

I really like the overall design though, I think maybe some slightly bigger engines on the bottom of the radial tanks could improve it a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Anyone know how to get this thread moved to mission reports? Spacecraft exchange doesn\u0027t really seem like the right place for it. I can share .craft files if anyone is interested though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Thanks for moving this\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-27T17:56:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2013 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
