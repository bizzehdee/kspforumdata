And since the 0.25 update when the old wing parts were replaced my the new SP\u002B wing parts, I realised I had to change a lot of my replica\u0027s designs as I used a lot of the old wing parts. I would rather go for many wings to choose from than just a few types. And it\u0027s not just me. You see everywhere now in the KSP community where there are more people wanting the old wing parts back. One thing I also realised is that it was very hard to put landing gear properly with enough clearance on certain designs os planes/spaceplanes. I hope in the next update I can see more varieties of landing gear and the old wing parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. If any of you are gonna say that there is a mod that re-adds the old wing parts and adds more landing gear, I know they are out there. But I only make stock replicas, like many, many more people out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-17T07:37:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2014 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RonaldoFTW\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T07:30:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m with you on the landing gear part.
