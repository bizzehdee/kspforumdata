Another problem I encounter is with really powerful stages; if I\u0027m over-generous with the throttle, it can get \u0027stuck\u0027, which greatly increases the chances of my Kerbalnaughts exploding in mid-air or crash-landing, due to being forced to either try and wrestly back control until the fuel runs out or attempt to eject the faulty stage (which can be a dangerous since there\u0027s a good chance the ejected but still-burning stage will simply accelerate through you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts: The throttle sticking issue appears to be a natural consequence of my tendency to over-engineer things - One of my latest designs, and the one with which I can say I am most pleased with performance-wise, is the Kratos MkI, which has as the lowest stage a cluster of \u003Cem\u003Enine\u003C/em\u003E E-600 engines with \u0027big red\u0027 SAS modules. I reckon the best solution here is to just take care with the throttle. With great power comes great responsibility.

One way to deal with that is using the EAS-4 struts to help lock the engines down. Another trick you might try to help deal with the sticky-pad bug is using SRBs or the \u0027stage-and-a-half\u0027 concept, where you have extra power for the early part of flight, then jettison them and continue on only your main engines, reducing weight and fuel consumption after getting past the phases of flight that require maximum power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for tipping over, that happens most often with top-heavy rockets, particularly ones with low thrust-to-weight ratios. You may need to find a way to move weight further aft, or add a Yawmaster to manually assist the SAS. Of course, extra-long rockets also tend to have a lot of sway due to stack flex. (My VK Nova Mark Two is incapable of a vertical climbout during first stage burn; it tends to settle in about 2-3 degrees off vertical in a random direction, then straighten up after first stage separation.) If that\u0027s the problem, you pretty much have to live with it... or find a way to make the rocket shorter and/or stiffer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-25T12:59:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0027stuck throttle\u0027 issue sounds like your engines are tearing their connections free, severing your control, but continue to bulldoze your rocket forward; it\u0027s exactly the same effect that occurs if you fire a stack decoupler before a liquid stage has finished burning.
