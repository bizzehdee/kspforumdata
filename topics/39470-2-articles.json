(You\u0027d probably want to be able to use time warp during that.) Imagine, though, being able to have your warning siren go off to inform nonessential personnel to clear the area, then the PAO and air-ground loops discussing the start of fueling, then its progress, then its completion, followed by the power-up of the vehicle, the loading of the crew (\u0022Bill has been beaten into a stupor and successfully stuffed through the hatch into his couch, and is now being chained down...\u0022), the final checkouts, and then the final five minutes start with another sounding of the siren, then all the chatter as the vehicle is transferred from operating on ground control to fully internal operations before the terminal count, ignition sequence start, and launch commit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat \u0022hardcore mode\u0022 where you simulate the whole countdown could also be an opportunity for the future, to give people the *option* of random failures during the countdown, with the possibility of built-in holds during the count in case you need more time to correct them without aborting the launch unless the failure wasn\u0027t something that could be worked around or fixed without someone going in with a wrench... it would give the abort function a real purpose, and also give you the option of adding a \u0022hold count\u0022 function to the controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother suggestion: Have it detect if someone hits the \u0022abort\u0022 action group (by default, backspace) and immediately interrupt the count with the \u0022abort\u0022 spiel, plus a bit about mobilizing the search and rescue teams downrange, since I\u0027d figure that using the abort action group would trigger any launch abort system--this would be for simulating a case like Soyuz T-10-1 (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_T-10-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_T-10-1\u003C/a\u003E ) where the launch escape system is used on the pad because of a major fire or other indications that the booster is about to blow up on the pad, and thus an abort-launch-and-get-out option would be inappropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Athlonic","CreatedById":57996,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T21:51:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like what I just read rdfox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome features are certainly beyond my coding skill (for now) but at least I got a serious \u0022to do\u0022 list now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will do my best \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will implement Kerbal voices and a simple \u0022funny\u0022 launch sequence first, as these will be default settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then more serious things later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your feedback again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T03:21:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks interesting - I\u0027ll be installing it, and I look forward to your next version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne minor nit to pick: when the announcer says \u0022liftoff will start in t-minus 10 seconds\u0022, the counter should \u003Cem\u003Ebe \u003C/em\u003Eat \u002210\u0022 when he says \u002210 seconds\u0022, and then he goes right to \u00229...8...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it stands, he\u0027s saying \u002210\u0022 at T-12s, then again at T-10s.
