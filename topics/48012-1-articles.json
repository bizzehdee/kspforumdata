I suppose this isn\u0027t entirely necessary but I find boosting to a parking orbit makes whatever else I\u0027m going to do much easier. For me and what I do in game, 100km parking orbit is the standard around Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Select Mun as target. At the descending or ascending node burn normal or anti-normal to get the inclination difference to 0.0 degrees. In some cases having the inclination difference \u0022close enough\u0022 may not cause much worries but I find this just makes everything else easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) In map view, zoom out far enough to see Mun\u0027s or ital path. Swing the view so that you\u0027re looking at Kerbins polar cap, and so that Mun is in about the 2 o\u0027clock position. Now zoom back in and place a maneuver node at about the six o\u0027clock position and set your burn for an intercep with Mun. Some fine tuning may be needed with the exact placemen of the node, but you should end up with a delta-v of between 820 and 850 generating you an encounter with the Mun, with a Mun periapsis of anywhere between 300km and a couple thousand kilometers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.). Once you are in the Mun\u0027s SOI, place a node at your munar periapsis and use the retrograde arm to place yourself into orbit around the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) lastly, if desired, circularize your burn at your desired altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the process I go through in getting to the Mun or Minmus.
