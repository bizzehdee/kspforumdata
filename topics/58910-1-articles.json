Ideally, you want to keep it somewhere between 1.8 and 2.2 or so; that minimizes fuel losses to gravity and drag. In the vanilla game, the gee meter gives you a rough indication of how that\u0027s going: during the vertical part of the launch, you generally want to keep the gees about halfway between the first and second mark (i.e. between 1-2G); my own observation has been that this should be closer to the one gee mark. Once you make your gravity turn, you want it to stay roughly at the top of the green zone. If it climbs out of the green, throttle back a bit to minimize fuel losses to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-06T19:38:40Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2014 07:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T20:34:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to get into the math without necessarily waiting for the old math texts to show up, and at the risk of making a shameless plug, I\u0027ve run through several of them in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24623-Tutorial-Video-Krash-Test-Kerbals-How-to-science%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKrash Test Kerbals\u003C/a\u003E vids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso you can check in on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28352-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpecialist290\u0027s drawing board\u003C/a\u003E, which will point you to several other sources that will briefly explain the equations and methods behind the Kerbal madness.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T23:04:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022purpletarget\u0022 data-cite=\u0022purpletarget\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you want to get into the math without necessarily waiting for the old math texts to show up, and at the risk of making a shameless plug, I\u0027ve run through several of them in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24623-Tutorial-Video-Krash-Test-Kerbals-How-to-science%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKrash Test Kerbals\u003C/a\u003E vids.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs purpletarget has already done me the kindness of plugging my own little project, I\u0027m going to return the favor by seconding his recommendation of the Krash Test Kerbals video series, as it is indeed quite a handy resource if you want to dig into the nuts and bolts of how the game\u0027s physics work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the subject of atmospheric drag in particular: A while back I was working with another user on testing and debugging an atmospheric drag calculator, and we managed to fine-tune the aerodynamic equations to be quite precise for a simple 2D prograde / retrograde simulator.
