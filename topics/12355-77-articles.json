For what ever reason the new MechJeb version has the tab on like the upper right side of the screen, rather than the absolute middle right side of the screen like older versions. Can anyone tell me how to fix this nuisance? I want the damn tab in the middle of the right edge of the screen, in its current position it\u0027s obscuring the info and kerbal info buttons as well as gets in the way of my resources tab when it\u0027s open. This hopefully is just a bug because it\u0027d be a stupid and annoying change otherwise. So yes, can anyone tell me how to change this if possible?
