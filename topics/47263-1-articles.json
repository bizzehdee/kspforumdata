Kerbal isn\u0027t the only game i stream but it\u0027s one of the usual suspects along with Faster Than Light. You can read about my streaming interests on the channel page if you\u0027re interested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have a set schedule, because i\u0027m not sure i could stick to one. Usually i go live around 21:00 CET (UTC\u002B1) but other times are also possible. Maybe in the future i actually settle on a fixed schedule, but for now it\u0027s not really possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to KSP. I\u0027m not the greatest player/builder, or even a very good one. I suck hillariously with anything that has wings. But i try to have a good time doing silly things or just basic Kerbal stuff. Drop by, say hi, ask questions or facepalm as i do what i do. I typically stick to Kerbin and it\u0027s moons because it takes too long to fail somewhere else. And i guess i wouldn\u0027t know how to begin. And because i \u0026lt;3 Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe space program is entirely stock (nothing wrong with mods) except Subassembly, and i don\u0027t clip or airhog. Because \u0022easy\u0022 although sometimes clever. Also, all missions are manned missions except rescue craft for obvious reasons. Kerbals want to see stars and besides, it\u0027s called Kerbal Space Program not AI Probe Core Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s that. Come visit, and if you like what you see, come visit some more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/frumple1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.twitch.tv/frumple1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE - Due to my limited upstream internet speed, the visual quality is generally below Twitch average. Nothing i can do about that as i alreadt hit approx. 111% of the national average. Maybe with time upstream imporves, maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI leave you with a screenshot of my latest, greatest, heaviest and most pointless contraption ever. The Mainsnail Mountain, the core of which is currently orbiting Kerbin in a swank 100k orbit.
