I think if they all have only one, similar to each another, mod protocol, we just can have only one backend and many frontends to it. Without total rewriting of frontends. What about it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI knew kRPC\u00A0and Telemachus(I am active maintainer) comm. protocols, but I think we should create one unified protocol over HTTP/WebSocket based on JSON.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThx for attention\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
