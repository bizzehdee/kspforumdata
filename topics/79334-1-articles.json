I have enough intake air and my speed is over 1000m/s but it still seems to want to go nose down. I can keep the nose up but its kind of like a bouncing effect. To begin with I thought maybe it was due to having the landing gear too far forward but that wasn\u0027t it. Then I thought maybe its drag causing it or its the SAS but if I switch the SAS off my plane tends to be awkward to fly. Or its the plane bouncing on the atmosphere or something. However it doesn\u0027t always happen at high altitude either so I\u0027m confused. I know it must be something I\u0027m doing wrong but I don\u0027t know what.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Sometimes despite having the velocity and what I think is a high enough altitude my AP suddenly starts falling and it doesn\u0027t matter how I orientate my aircraft but I just end up heading towards the ground again. Is this due to Kerbin\u0027s gravity and me not having a high enough altitude? Same problem occurs for me with some rockets so I think it must be a personal design flaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Ideally how much oxidiser do I need for a spaceplane since I often find I run out too quickly. I can get into orbit but circularising often costs me all my oxidiser. Is there a specific ration of fuel/oxidiser I need to apply?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions will be greatly appreciated. I\u0027m only 100 hours into this so far so I\u0027m sure I\u0027m still making stupid mistakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-24T17:13:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2014 05:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jade Falcon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T15:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst question, do you have a picture of the craft?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond question are you using FAR or NEAR?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jade Falcon","CreatedById":114719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T15:50:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Hodo No I don\u0027t have a picture of the craft to hand and no I\u0027m not using FAR or NEAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T16:05:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jade Falcon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jade Falcon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@Hodo No I don\u0027t have a picture of the craft to hand and no I\u0027m not using FAR or NEAR.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk.

It seems to depend a lot on the aircraft, some designs they are really useful other designs not so much. In fact in some cases I have noticed adding them just ends up shifting the CoL in front of the CoM which is really bad. To be honest I really hate them on planes kind of destroys the aesthetic look for me which is another problem I have since I often feel the need to make something look nice but it seldom flies nice. lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless I just tried something new and adapted the Aeris to my purposes so I could understand why it works. I now believe my problems arose from not noticing enough how the fuel shifts in flight, pilot error in regard to not shifting my pitch enough with Alt-WASD and also I think trying to get through the atmosphere a little too severely I think I\u0027m trying to power through it and not coasting along enough rising my velocity. Plus also letting my intact air get too low and not realising how its affecting my ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I got this shameless Aeris ripoff into orbit, circularised and despite the low fuel readout at the bottom left I do have enough to burn retrograde and finally fly down to Kerbin.
