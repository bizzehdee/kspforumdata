It basically takes you from looking through a normal lens to a fisheye lens, or similar. The underlying mechanic might not actually be precisely focal length, that is just the thing that readily springs to mind when I see it. Not really sure if it serves a useful purpose for the average player, or why it exists. It does possibly produce some interesting artistic effects and options.\n\nMod \u002B (scroll fully the other way) returns it to more or less normal."}]}
