Almost all of the negative reviews are just FSX fanboys whining about tiny things and not being able to learn."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T18:41:53Z","Content":"X-Plane appears to be the natural successor to FSX, which pretty much has been the standard for years.

It\u0027s basically a virtual wind tunnel.\n\nBut unfortunately it\u0027s only a base to build on - if you dont want to invest large amount of money in to professionally made planes, do not buy it. Default planes are very very undeveloped to say at least."}]}
