To get my juices flowing I decided to test things out on the Mun. I threw up a polar orbit satellite with the regular scanner on-board, and found a couple 70% candidate sites. I landed a small lander in each with the surface scanner, and both show ores of \u0026lt;5%!! And when I go back to the overlay they no longer show the high concentration. =( Is this common?

Actually calculating the resource value for each position on the planet would be prohibitively slow. So the overlay makes a texture, calculates resource values for certain pixels, then interpolates in between. So the pixel within the crater that is being used for the resource calculation is below the cutoff, but it only appears this way after scanning the surface, because the average value for that biome is above the cutoff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can actually see the interpolation at work if you look carefully. Close to the center of the blob in the crater there is a slightly brighter spot. That is the actual location that the overlay is using to calculate the resource abundance. So at that exact location (which might be very difficult to land at, each pixel on the global map represents probably several kilometers) the concentration is below the cutoff, and nothing appears at all in the crater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can try editing the MapResolution and InterpolationLevel fields in the GameData/Squad/Resources/Overlay.cfg file (the current overlay type you have on is listed as SOLID, the others being LINES and DOTS) . Reducing the interpolation level and/or increasing the map resolution (use 512 or 1024) will probably allow you to see resources on the overlay in the crater. It will also probably be slower to generate, causing a bit of a hiccup when you push the overlay button.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T05:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DMagic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DMagic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem here is that the map overlay is not accurate.
