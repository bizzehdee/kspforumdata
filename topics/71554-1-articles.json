As long as it\u0027s not clipped inside of a larger part through, you should be able to right click on individual parts to see what resources they have, though off the top of my head I can\u0027t remember if it shows any sort of consumption rate. Otherwise you should be figuring out your total consumption rates based on the individual part consumption parts given in the VAB/SPH. Fusebox basically automates that process, from my understanding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T20:59:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pantek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pantek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for the hint!\u003Cp\u003EI had a look at Fusebox, but could not find a way to list the parts currently using power, only the sum of current power usage and the estimate how long the batteries will last during night.
