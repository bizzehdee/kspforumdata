I also never took a screen shot of my the ship or cared enough at the time to pull up a mission log or anything like that. My priority was successfully get \u0022Flying low\u0022 PresMat situations in different biomes around KSC and I\u0027d been crashing and reverting a lot willy-nilly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was piloting a simple lander/rocket thing with 3-sided-symmetry, radial mounted engines with a presmat and some thermometers on it. I was flying from the direction of the launchpad toward the shore/ocean. Once above the beach near the water my craft slowed down and started feeling like I had accidentally staged my parachute or something. I was traveling upwards at the time. I cut my throttle to zero figuring the chute would safely plop me down and I\u0027d have to reload again, but instead of decending I continued floating like a cloud, upwards. (Sounds dumb, but that\u0027s the best way I can descride the feedback I was feeling from my craft.) and there was no parachute. It continued floating up for a little while then started to decend. It was basically a very cushion-ey feeling ballistic trajectory. I started my throttle again and it was having very limited effect on changing my course. my ship behaved more like it was underwater with no buoyancy than a rocket in flight. (I was above the ocean. The bug started at the shore, but I was only very briefly above it. I don\u0027t know if it has anything to do with it since rockets seem to act like they\u0027re inflatable pool toys when they go underwater, and bob right to the top.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESort of a trippy bug. Haven\u0027t seen it since. (I haven\u0027t played too much since the update. Very overwhelmed by KSP right now with all the new stuff and less forgiving career science-wise.)
