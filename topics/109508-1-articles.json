I need some more help, but think it\u0027s probably best to move the discussion over here (@moderator: please move this to somewhere more appropriate if there is somewhere). I\u0027ve had a good look around the forums and have only found cursory references to Dvorak so far... if indeed there is ongoing discussion and I\u0027ve just been unable to find it, I\u0027d very much appreciate a link to it!\n\nRecap:\n\nI use a Dvorak keyboard layout, not a Sholes (\u0027QWERTY\u0027) one. As a result, I\u0027ve been spending a lot of time in \u0027Settings\u0027, reconfiguring the key bindings. Perhaps the only viable option is to plug in a USB Sholes layout keyboard to play KSP, but I\u0027d rather not resort to that as I\u0027ve used a two-keyboard setup in the past to get around this issue in other applications -- and it has never been satisfactory.\n\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121130-KSP-and-Dvorak?p=1936065\u0026viewfull=1#post1936065\n\n[Thanks to Endersmens](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121130-KSP-and-Dvorak?p=1936065\u0026viewfull=1#post1936065)\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121130-KSP-and-Dvorak?p=1936065\u0026viewfull=1#post1936065\n, I now know how to reset KSP to the default bindings settings (which is a relatively simple matter of deleting -- or renaming -- the settings.cfg file in the root KSP directory). Not an ideal solution for non-computer literate folk, and perhaps when I find the \u0027[official] Wishlist thread\u0027 I\u0027ll post in there requesting a \u0027Reset bindings to default\u0027 option within the KSP interface itself.\n\nWhat I\u0027d like to do is experiment with setting the key bindings so that KSP will work on the Dvorak layout I use every day -- but do so in a way that would allow me to save all those settings so that I can reapply them to the default at a later date, should this become necessary (for instance, on a complete reinstall). Because not only is it not a small job, it\u0027s also quite error-p r o n e\\*. Not to mention mission-critical.\n\nThere are at least a couple of other KSP Dvorak users out there... and my work could even be of use to them, too.\n\nLooking at the settings.cfg file it may simply be a case of saving the block of text from \u0027PITCH\\_DOWN\u0027 to the \u0027}\u0027 before \u0027TRACKIR\u0027 (1347 lines), and pasting that over the top of the similar block in a new settings.cfg file. I\u0027d prefer a better solution (if there is one) as the copy-paste technique could lead to unexpected results if the format of that section were to change in the future (as, indeed, it may have done due to the \u0027Completely revised Input Mapping system\u0027 implemented as of v1.0.0).\n\nOne major concern I have is the possibility of breaking something due to unexpected collisions of key assignments. There\u0027s clearly a lot of overloading of key functions in the default key mappings (ie, the same key does something different depending upon what mode you\u0027re in, such as the spacebar separating stages in the \u0027Staging\u0027 mode, but toggling between rotation and linear control modes in \u0027Docking\u0027 mode), and I wonder whether this itself would tend to render any attempt at the kind of major remapping exercise I\u0027m contemplating so fraught with potential pitfalls as to make it futile.\n\nWhile I\u0027m at it, I think I may also be tempted to move some of the key assignments around. I\u0027m not keen on the proximity of some of the keys in the default placement. For instance, the movement keys (WASD) are too close for my liking to THROTTLE\\_CUTOFF and RCS\\_TOGGLE, which, if hit accidentally, can have bad results. As just one example, I want to move THROTTLE\\_CUTOFF (default \u0027X\u0027) to \u0027Keypad0\u0027. Assuming that re-laying the keys in a strict one-to-one correspondence to change from Sholes to Dvorak is itself a viable project, would it be a \u0027bridge too far\u0027 to try to move other stuff around? (One obvious impact would be that it might render my revised layout of less use to others... though I could do it in two stages).\n\nGood grief, so many words. But I think that about covers it. Thanks in advance for any thoughts you may have.\n\n\\* spot the stoopit censor bypass\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T14:30:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 02:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pendant**\n  \nminor typo"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T14:47:53Z","Content":"Note that action groups work only on the number keys.

I like the layered design. I see it\u0027s optimized for the German language rather than English (I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s your native tongue?).\n\n\u0027The problem\u0027 with KSP, as with many games, is that, where keyboard input is required, it is all too often assumed that the user will be using the Sholes (\u0027QWERTY\u0027) layout. The four keys \u0027W\u0027, \u0027A\u0027, \u0027S\u0027 and \u0027D\u0027 are commonly hard-coded as the keys for up, left, down and right respectively. This is fine with a QWERTY layout, as these four keys lie together in positions that correspond with the respective directions:\n\n![WASD_zpsdfvlcpem.jpg](http://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u128/snafubucket/games/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/WASD_zpsdfvlcpem.jpg)\n\nHowever, on a Dvorak keyboard layout, the placement of those four keys is not particularly useful for movement purposes:\n\n![WASD-Dvorak_zpstdtfkvtd.jpg](http://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u128/snafubucket/games/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/WASD-Dvorak_zpstdtfkvtd.jpg)\n\n\u0027Left\u0027 and \u0027right\u0027 are still ok, relatively speaking, but \u0027down\u0027 has become \u0027up\u0027, and vice versa. Also, these keys are a bit too far away from each other to be of much use.\n\nAs DMagic and Keith\\_Bones have pointed out, if one has both Sholes and Dvorak layouts configured in Windows, one can toggle between them using \u0027Windows Key \u002B Space\u0027. This works after a fashion, but for a newcomer like me who still has to learn which key does what in KSP, it\u0027s a pain in the posterior. Bear in mind that I\u0027m using a keyboard on which the keys are laid out according to the Dvorak layout, not QWERTY. So if I have Windows set to \u0027QWERTY\u0027 mode, the keytops don\u0027t do what they say on the tin. The game will be telling me to press (for instance) \u0027X\u0027 for \u0027Throttle Cut-off\u0027; but if I do press the key labelled \u0027X\u0027 I\u0027ll actually be telling the game to (ironically) apply the brakes -- the wheel brakes, that is! On a Dvorak layout, the key I really need to press for \u0027Throttle Cut-off\u0027 is \u0027Q\u0027, **not** \u0027X\u0027.\n\nThe point is that if the game \u0027understands\u0027 the layout I\u0027m using -- which it can do, if I redefine the keys appropriately -- then there\u0027s no confusion at all. Instead of telling me to press \u0027X\u0027, it will actually tell me to press \u0027Q\u0027, and everything is fine.\n\nI\u0027ve made quite a bit of progress on this. I still need to test it some more to check that everything is ok, but I\u0027m convinced enough that what I\u0027ve done works to offer [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/larc7abz9aen8fi/KSP%20Sholes-to-Dvorak%20keybind%20conversion.DROPBOX.xls?dl=0) [created in OpenOffice, but saved as MS-Excel 97/2000/XP (.xls) for widest compatibility]. It\u0027s a spreadsheet that not only does what I need for Dvorak, but should also be of use to anyone interested in using it for other layouts too, since the \u0027Conversion Table\u0027 on the second spreadsheet in the workbook can be adjusted to conform with **any** desired layout.\n\nI\u0027ve also allowed for custom redefinition of many KSP keys, should the user wish to experiment with non-standard placement. I\u0027m not sure as yet whether there would be any unexpected effects from trying that, though. I may just be being over-cautious; perhaps there\u0027s no problem at all with that.\n\nFor anyone who just needs the ANSI Dvorak keybindings, I can offer a plain text file: [KSP default Dvorak bindings](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5gtwqnaff5wkcrb/settings.cfg.Dvorak%20bindings%20verbatim%20Version0.2.1.txt?dl=0).

This way people only\\* have to paste it over their existing settings.cfg, which isn\u0027t all that confusing.\n\n\\*well they willl have to change their other settings if they had them other than default, but there aren\u0027t many, so it should be all good. Maybe offer the .cfg for non computer people, and the .txt file for those who wanna keep their other settings and just change keybindings. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"pendant","CreatedById":143841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T15:47:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, the way you suggested might be a bit too complicated for non-computer people.\n\nOh, I agree. Your solution has its advantages. But there are advantages to my offering too:\n\n- it enables those with **any** keyboard layout (not just Dvorak) to generate the keybindings they need to apply into KSP\n- it neatly lists all the keys, reducing the risk of error\n- it facilitates customisation of the keybindings\n\nA certain amount of computer literacy is implied with any file manipulation.\n\nIdeally, we shouldn\u0027t have to jump through these hoops in the first place!"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T16:01:47Z","Content":"Have you any modding experience?\n\nYou could make a mod that adds a \u0022Change keybindings to Dvorak\u0022 option in the keybindings settings page."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T17:14:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thank you for the link to the marvellous New World Symphony!
