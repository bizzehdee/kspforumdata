The engine modules are now able to override the default flow logic as defined by the resource with their own, \u003Cstrong\u003Eso even though turbines use the same module as SRBs and Liquid Engines, they set up their own flow logic for LiquidFuel, so that in their case, the lookup method used is the STAGE_PRIORITY method. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor other modules/propellant configs which don\u0027t define a particular method, the resource default is used.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the necessity that prompted this change, other than the improvement in long-term stability as tanks drain out, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethis is very much essential to support wet wings and drop tanks. Using the default stack-based flow logic means tanks in child parts (as wings tend to be) will be unaccessible unless a fuel line links them\u003C/strong\u003E to some spot in the drainage route of the engines.
