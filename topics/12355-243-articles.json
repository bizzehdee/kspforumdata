Just had two Pathfinders slam into Moho at 500 m/s while using \u0022Land Somewhere\u0022. MJ started the final burn much too late to be effective. When using \u0022Land At Target\u0022, the ship starts oscillating \u002BNML to -NML (around the RAD axis) when the delta-V remaining in the de-orbit burn reaches 0.1 m/s, burning in brief bursts as the ship crosses retro-grade, finally giving up and going into a spin around the RAD axis which it never seems to come out of. The ship just locks up with that 0.1 m/s remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, this same lander design functions perfectly with MJ at Mun and Minmus.
