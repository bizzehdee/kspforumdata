Its percentage is lower than an asparagus design, but it\u0027s actually very easy to fly. And it simply can\u0027t be replaced with a more traditional stack; part of the Bucket\u0027s appeal is that its U shape allows me to hold awkward payloads inside it in an extremely stable way, by strutting horizontally.

Not because SSTO rockets are terrible, but the bragging rights for doing a spaceplane \u0022right\u0022 are much higher. With a rocket, you just hear people yell \u0022moar boosters!\u0022 and can make the rocket as big as they want, but with a plane you try to keep things small, and doing it perfectly has a big appeal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the PhysX comment was just wrong.
