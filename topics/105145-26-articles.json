Specifically:\n\n- Payload must be mounted to a decoupler or docking node and separated from the lifter in a stable orbit with a periapsis of at least 70km. The decoupler/docking port must stay with the lifter.  \n- Payload must be inert and contribute nothing but incidental body lift and command authority to the lifter (one crewed pod or probe core is ok, its reaction wheel and battery may be used but not its monopropellant, if any). All additional reaction wheels, batteries and fuel tanks in the payload must be disabled via tweakables.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t look like you separated any payload, and it also looks like you\u0027ve counted the mass of the engines and fuel tanks used for ascent as payload."},{"CreatedByName":"Psycopyro","CreatedById":151917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T09:51:01Z","Content":"Hi Kerbaunauts,\n\nHere my entry:\n\nThis entry is not a record breaker, but more to share with you an concept that I used to transfert crews, landers and satellites to space station or interplanetary vessel.\n\nThis is a mix between American space shuttle and Airbus Adeline.\n\nI guess category of that is unlimited, because I used Rapier in AirBreathing mode.\n\nLaunch Pad: 351.638T\n\nOrbit: 46.5 T\n\nPayload Fraction = 13.22%\n\nCredit / Ton = 1180\n\nThis is improvable since the heat shield of engine, is a esthetic/realistic thing, and Mk3 cokpit is here to transfert crew, which is not counted here.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ayEUZ/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-25T21:19:31Z","Content":"[@Psycopyro](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/151917-psycopyro/) That may not be the highest fraction but it is certainly an interesting design.
