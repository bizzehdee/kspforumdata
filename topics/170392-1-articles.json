Longtime fanatic of KSP, but this is my first time really on the forums.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of you space fanatics might be interested to learn that I\u0027ve been an employee of the US Space and Rocket Center for some time now. More specifically as a Space Camp Crew Trainer(You know, the guys in blue flightsuits who get to lead around teams for the week). I figured that there might be a few people around who would like to hear about the ins and outs of the Camp program, especially if there are a few interested in attending. So expect me to show up occasionally and share some photos from our lovely museum, or maybe\u00A0a peek behind the scenes of Space Camp.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-02T01:40:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if we have any of your former students on our forum?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-02T01:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think we do!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not one of them, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, welcome aboard!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
