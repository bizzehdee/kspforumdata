I had to send my PC in to get a desktop config error fixed on windows 8.1. Well i got it back the other today and was going to play a bit of KSP but there seems to be a issue with kerbal engineer. The windows for KER show up but there is no text in them ( as in deltaV or TRW nothing). I tried to re-install KER and pulled out the one other mod I was running to see if there was a easy fix. When that did not work I did a clean reinstalled KSP and am still getting this issue I Also noticed the issue with out KER installed in the eva/iva buttons over the kerbals, also in the Flight results window after a crash there is nothing in the log. I am not sure what is causing the problem, everything was running fine before i had the desktop config error. All that was done to my PC when it was out was to fix that and to remove a bit of adware that my antivirus missed. I have tried rolling back my drivers or my graphics card and messed with the setting in both the game and Nvidia\u0027s control panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help i can get would be great thank you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreen shots: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/FW8Rnv0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/FW8Rnv0\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/pNxceQ4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/pNxceQ4\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/CmKuiUx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/CmKuiUx\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDXDiag: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/gkj1g18tm1ft1f1/DxDiag.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/gkj1g18tm1ft1f1/DxDiag.txt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T14:21:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T08:56:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like some normal system fonts are missing or corrupted.
