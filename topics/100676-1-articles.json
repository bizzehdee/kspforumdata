I had to send my PC in to get a desktop config error fixed on windows 8.1. Well i got it back the other today and was going to play a bit of KSP but there seems to be a issue with kerbal engineer. The windows for KER show up but there is no text in them ( as in deltaV or TRW nothing). I tried to re-install KER and pulled out the one other mod I was running to see if there was a easy fix. When that did not work I did a clean reinstalled KSP and am still getting this issue I Also noticed the issue with out KER installed in the eva/iva buttons over the kerbals, also in the Flight results window after a crash there is nothing in the log. I am not sure what is causing the problem, everything was running fine before i had the desktop config error. All that was done to my PC when it was out was to fix that and to remove a bit of adware that my antivirus missed. I have tried rolling back my drivers or my graphics card and messed with the setting in both the game and Nvidia\u0027s control panel.\n\nAny help i can get would be great thank you\n\nScreen shots: [http://imgur.com/FW8Rnv0](http://imgur.com/FW8Rnv0) [http://imgur.com/pNxceQ4](http://imgur.com/pNxceQ4) [http://imgur.com/CmKuiUx](http://imgur.com/CmKuiUx)\n\nDXDiag: [http://www./view/gkj1g18tm1ft1f1/DxDiag.txt](http://www./view/gkj1g18tm1ft1f1/DxDiag.txt)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T14:21:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T08:56:46Z","Content":"It looks like some normal system fonts are missing or corrupted.
