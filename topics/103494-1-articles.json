Ascended with a turbojet, circularized with an ion engine. Landers for Tylo and Laythe. Ion lander for the other moons.\n\nMissions highlights:\n\n- Re-entered while trying to orbit Kerbin.\n- Smooth landings and takeoffs at Laythe and Tylo.\n- Ran out of fuel and had to abuse the eva jetpack.\n- Ion lander used for Bop. Pol was done with jetpack.\n- Returned to Kerbin safely.\n\nDetailed album of the trip.\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/n7QfE#0:cool:](http://imgur.com/a/n7QfE#0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T03:43:46Z","Content":"IIImpressive."},{"CreatedByName":"Nik333","CreatedById":138436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T16:02:28Z","Content":"It\u0027s hard to believe that it\u0027s possible to do it so light-weight.

And it was barely possible. Before the update that changed SAS it would\u0027ve been easier to do, and much lighter.

The landing legs were never designed to support a Kerbal on eva, but they worked out great.
