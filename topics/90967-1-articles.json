Turn out I had to land on the darkside of the Mun, and I totally didn\u0027t prepare for the pure darkness below, despite the sun is still over the horizon, just setting down. You could guess what happened with a landing without any idea where \u0022land\u0022 is. After that I learn to put lights on every spacecraft intending to land anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this makes me wonder, how realistic is that? I understand that, since there is no atmosphere on the Mun, there would be no refraction of light that would give some visibility at sunset. However, how does light work in space then, exactly? Does it mean any side of a space object that is not facing the sun would be in complete darkness? Would there only be two stage between visible and not visible? Are there other kind of effects that may be in play to allow darkside of objects to still be somewhat visible?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-22T15:52:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2014 03:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T14:30:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn real life ithout an atmosphere or another body to refract/reflect it, pretty much yeah, you\u0027d only have starlight unless the sun is \u0022up\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut KSP does not handle dawn/dusk 100% accurately, light passing through mountains isn\u0027t modelled for instance, and to get that darkness the light from the sun is actually turned off or it\u0027d shine through the Mun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin can still be lit and so can the sun, but that is by actually lighting the body itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T15:39:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote that you can land pretty well in IVA, this is pretty dangerous on Mun because of all the craters who is hard to see from orbit and work better on other bodies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me IVA landings in the dark has an benefits, I don\u0027t get scared of the ground rushing towards me and can keep higher speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the rocket does 10 m/s braking so going from 200 m/s to standstill in 20 seconds is reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hazarada","CreatedById":72036,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T16:11:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve landed a few times in the dark by observing my altitude and praying that the \u0022sea level\u0022 altitude isn\u0027t too far off from the terrain altitude, rather fuel inefficient though, always prefer a day landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carter","CreatedById":18177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T16:30:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re performing manned landings, I don\u0027t think it is unrealistic at all to do daytime landings exclusively. That\u0027s what I do. I time-warp until my LZ is about one eighth through a day cycle before I begin my descent.

Most notably, my first manned landing on another planet (Moho) was done at night. The reason was because I had landed the science package on a seperate lander, and being Moho, when my orbit finally intersected with the location of the landed science package, it was night time and I wasn\u0027t going to wait half a Mohovian day for the next landing window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for realism, typically you are correct. If it is an airless body, then the night surface would be virtually pitch black. The only light you would get would be a small amount from the stars above. However there are some important exceptions. Just as we get some illumination at night from the moon, the moon also recieves light reflecting off the Earth during lunar night. It\u0027s enough that you can actually make out details on the lunar surface when looking at it through a telescope.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aleis","CreatedById":62823,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T17:15:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have done this same thing as well and, it is the reason why I also include a spot light on all landers just in case\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T17:21:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShame ksp can\u0027t emulate moon light ( planet shine )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T17:38:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShame ksp can\u0027t emulate moon light ( planet shine )\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E I think there is a mod for that.\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I just realize another thing: shouldn\u0027t this mean our lights would also have a much better range in airless body due to the light not being refracted?
