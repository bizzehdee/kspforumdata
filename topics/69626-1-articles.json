He had been where no Kerbal had ever gone before, to put himself in orbit around Eeloo with a free return trajectory. No one had been this far yet and no one would until a more efficient design could allow a landing. Unfortunately, he had little time to admire himself for his piloting skills. Science had to be done, and those RADAR scans weren\u0027t going to complete themselves. And if he avoided getting the first ever information about the dwarf planet, Erbal Kerman would strangle him when he got back. \u0022Well\u0022, he commentated to mission control, \u0022here I am above Eeloo, and we are currently running RADAR scans in order to map it\u0027s surface. The outside temperature is a toasty -450 degrees. Perhaps we should take a walk outside? No, back to the RADAR scan. Let\u0027s see what it\u0027s found. Rocks... more rocks... Even more rocks... how interesting...Ooh, a hill! With a cliff... and... Tentacles!? MISSION CONTROL!!! I FOUND A DEAD SPACE SQUID!!! WHAT DO WE DO!?!\u0022 Mission control could not believe it at this point. \u0022Don\u0027t panic.\u0022 Said Gene Kerman. \u0022There\u0027s not much we can do until you verify that you\u0027ve been getting your standard eight hours of sleep. Are you sure it\u0027s not just an anomalous rock formation?\u0022 Shelming Kerman: \u0022I think I\u0027ve been getting enough sleep. Just in case I haven\u0027t let\u0027s check the telescope camera and... looks like a squid to me. Kinda like a Kraken actually. I\u0027ll be sending you pictures.\u0022 About twenty seconds later, the Inland tracking center on Kerbin received half of a dozen photographs of what came to be known as the space Kraken anomaly, causing half of the mission control team to faint. Even worse, the spacecraft commander found that it was moving and tried a radio hail. It promptly rose from the ground with an incalculable amount of delta vee, suddenly destroying Shelming and his ship. After that, Gene Kerman and Erbal Kerman were the only two mission controllers still standing. \u0022Erm,\u0022 started Erbal, \u0022should we warn the Laythe colony about this?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEND OF CHAPTER I\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Also available on Wattpad.com)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-19T23:03:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2014 11:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by VelocityPolaris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efailure of science comprehension, corrected by RogueMason.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VelocityPolaris","CreatedById":101162,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T11:24:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E[head]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Kerbal Space Kraken Wars\u003C/strong\u003E[/head]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[hr /]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[h4]Chapter II - The sole survivor[/h4]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[p]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill Kerman was having that feeling again. He, since childhood, had a remarkable ability to tell when something was going to go wrong. It was quite frightening, and everyone who had ignored his warning had either died or gone through a very traumatic experience. For example, just above his current position some years ago, he was able to predict the destruction of the KSS Spirit of Kerbin in the battle of Halcyon one before the enemy fighter was even within sensor range. Parts from his destroyed ship were still in orbit around international laythe base, which he was ready to take into space. Unfortunately, they could not yet evacuate themselves from the presence of the oxygen-stocked moon, as the geologist survey team was still heading toward the rocket by shuttle bus and were kilometres away. They couldn\u0027t leave without the geologists, since that would doom kerbals, but nevertheless Bill was quite annoyed by the colony\u0027s current status as sitting duck. At that moment, Murphy\u0027s law decided to exercise itself in full capacity. A Kraken dived from the sky and headed straight toward the rocket, as Bill Kerman tried valiantly to dodge it using Jet engines and travelling sideways along the ground. Unfortunately, the powerful green space Kraken rammed the craft side-on, blowing up the fuel tank and every other module of the colony. Bill Kerman himself decided to jump out and received a rather large gash in his EVA suit as a reward. It seemed to be worth it, as the Lander-Can he was in had exploded, and the Kraken was flying back towards space, but his spacesuit had been entirely ruined. Along with the lives of his 35 friends. Fortunately for Bill, Laythe has a partly breathable atmosphere but it is quite cold out, and other gases exist that are poisonous to life forms. Gladly, it was a warm 6.21 degrees Celsius outside, when the gases were least deadly, but at night it would drop to -21 degrees. In Celsius. That left him with five hours to find the geologists before night on Laythe, which would either kill him or... kill him. After a laythe month here, he knew the terrain by heart. Bill Kerman, which little or no spacesuit, walked in the direction of the shuttle bus.[/p]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[h3]END OF CHAPTER III[/h3]\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-19T23:27:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2014 11:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by VelocityPolaris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EHTML FTW!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T18:47:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to the Fanworks sub-forum.

Too bad that they would have to dump the bus when they took off. From the back of the bus, one of the geologists complained. \u0022I don\u0027t see why we had to leave. We were just in the process of finally finding some good samples.\u0022 \u0022Billy-Bobrod! If we stayed there, we would be putting the entire base in danger! They might have left without us!\u0022 Yelled Samney Kerman, a veteran of the spiritwolf wars (if the other side had one, it would have been called the Hanland wars) and a former member of Halcyon one, the first laythe colony and the first colony to be captured during a war. Philwise Kerman, whose eyes were better than anyone else\u0027s, saw something in the distance. \u0022Hey, guys? I think I see a Kerbal far ahead. Adly, slow down a bit.\u0022 Adly, not someone to waste time, was reluctant to comply. \u0022Slow down a bit, Adly. I see him as well.\u0022 Said Samney. Adly stared ahead, and, with difficulty, managed to get a clear picture of the Kerbal walking towards them. He gasped. Billy-Bobrod saw it two. \u0022Great Kerbol! He\u0027s not wearing a spacesuit!\u0022 \u0022What is that idiot doing? It\u0027s only an hour until this place freezes!\u0022 Yelled Samney. Philwise noticed something else. \u0022That\u0027s an orange flight suit he\u0027s wearing. That could only be captain Bill Kerman!\u0022 Adly was shocked. \u0022Something must have happened at the base! Quick! Get a sandwich and some blankets ready! We\u0027re picking him up!\u0022 Bill Kerman, who noticed the vehicle approaching, jumped into the air to get it\u0027s attention, and then fainted out of exhaustion and exposure. He woke up ten minutes later spread across two seats in the shuttle bus. Samney was leaning over him with a first aid kit and a blanket, which he put over Bill. \u0022Samney? Aren\u0027t you supposed to be on Halcyon one? How\u0027d you get on the Spirit of Kerbin?\u0022 Asked Bill groggily. Samney and Philwise exchanged glances. \u0022The radiation must have messed with the captain\u0027s head.\u0022 Declared Billy-Bobrod. Bill gave him a strange look. \u0022Who are you? You aren\u0027t on the crew manifest for halcyon one!\u0022 Samney, who decided that they would not be able to get him to his senses before Bill declared them all Hanland spies, made up a quick lie. \u0022You\u0027ve been out for years, sir. You\u0027re on Laythe. What happened might take a long time to explain.\u0022 said Samney. Bill nodded and promptly fainted. \u0022It\u0027s all of that radiation marching through his head\u0022 explained Philwise. \u0022It should all dissipate in a few hours.\u0022 At that moment, Adly Kerman hailed the three geologists from the front seat. \u0022It looks like we\u0027re approaching the base... that is, what\u0027s left of it. All four Kerbals (Bill, the fifth, was still unconscious) stared out of the windows and gasped. Their ticket home had been completely destroyed, with only a few girder segments and winglets remaining. There was even a large crater which had been created by the explosion of the fuel tanks. \u0022Great Kerbol!\u0022 Exclaimed Adly. \u0022Out of forty-two Kerbals - only us five are still alive?!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnd of Chapter III\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
