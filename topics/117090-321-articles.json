Wet mass was in the 35t neighborhood.  I\u0027m still not exactly sure how the mass is being calculated, but it\u0027s definitely got something to do with the \u0022topDiameter\u0022, \u0022coreDiameter\u0022 \u0026 \u0022bottomDiameter\u0022 keys and multiplied by the \u0022mass\u0022 and \u0022volume\u0022 keys.  I ran a number of tests.  I set \u0022@mass = 1.0\u0022 and left it there.  Then I started changing the diameter values.  Setting them to \u0022\\*= 1.0\u0022 I ended up with a dry mass of 1.0.  Setting them to \u0022\\*= 1.1\u0022 resulted in 1.331t.  Using \u0022\\*= 1.2\u0022 resulted in 1.728t.  Using \u0022\\*= 1.3\u0022 resulted in 2.197t.  Using \u0022\\*= 1.4\u0022 resulted in2.744t.  Using \u0022\\*= 1.5\u0022 resulted in 3.375t.  Using \u0022\\*= 1.6\u0022 resulted in 4.096t.  If I changed \u0022@mass = x.x\u0022 to something other than 1.0, it basically acted as a multiplier.  So in the end I have all the diameters set to \u0022\\*= 1.6\u0022 as you suggested, and I used \u0022mass = 1.6\u0022.
