I\u0027ve had some of my builds go into a flat spin and be completely unrecoverable, while others could recover. Namely, a flat spin is the craft\u0027s attempt to find a point of balance while in a drag-heavy state. The easiest method is to pitch down until you can recover... but how much you can pitch down will depend on how much changing the control surface orientation changes your craft\u0027s shape. For a large craft with small control surfaces, it likely won\u0027t help... but with a small craft and large control surfaces, you might recover easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How do I plan reentry... KSC?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, you drop into the atmosphere planning to overshoot then essentially use a slalom-like path to slow down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, Scott Manley shows a pretty good plane-type reentry starting around 15:25\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/bc178PPRwy0?start=925\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Is it normal to burn... \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really. Part of the point to using a space plane is that it can use its wings to burn off velocity during reentry and keep temperatures manageable. Of course, there are limitations. If you drop straight back from the mun you will come in pretty hot no matter what you do... generally to bring back a whole vessel (space shuttle) you\u0027d want to establish stable low orbit over kerbin, and then reenter with apoapsis lower than 80-100km. If you have an apoapsis in that range, you should be able to reenter without a problem and without any retrograde burns in atmosphere. That said, if you pitch down too much you will start to speed up and see reentry effects happen. I believe the video above also shows an example of that as well. The main thing to consider is whether you have enough lift or not for the weight you are trying to bring down. I think the best way to figure that out is through experimentation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022...balance CoM...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBalancing CoM can be tricky, especially with shorter crafts. Try to put fuel near the front to offset the weight of the engine, use structural fuselage to set the engine further back. The center of lift should be between the CoM and center of thrust. This being said, if the center of mass shifts, the center of lift can end up in front. The easiest way is to make your craft longer, and put more weight toward the front to offset the weight of the engine(s) at the rear... this should give you plenty of room to put the wings somewhere in between. EDIT: Be aware though that to make taking off easy (if you use a traditional horizontal runway launch) the rear wheels should be somewhat closer to the CoM than the front wheels... this means that if your CoM is too far forward, you may end up accidentally knocking engines and/or tail pieces off when you go to pitch up off the runway (longer lever).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-28T08:08:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2014 08:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by impyre\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T08:27:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, thank you! *hug*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat Flatspin sucks... i mean that thing tumbles down from like 30km to death... when i fly my RC-Pane it always stabilizes itself after flatspin if i put my hand away from controls, so is it possible to build a plane that does that in ksp with near?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess if i would try to do a slalom like \u0022aerobrake\u0022 it would flat spin to death, but first i need to try that out anyway \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell i see my problem now... i need to slow down somehow not just \u0022fly\u0022 with pitch 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you have been a great help, thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T08:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to prevent/help recovery from flat spins is to ensure that the aircraft is designed such that the drag at the rear is always greater than the drag at the front. This type of aircraft will always be stable in just about any situation... but it usually ends up looking like a dart. Thus you have a rocket with fins. Rockets with fins are super stable, even at high speeds, so long as center of mass and center of thrust are properly aligned and the drag profile has greater drag at the bottom.... kinda like a dart. However, rockets generally don\u0027t turn very quickly, especially not while in the atmosphere. Planes are meant to be more maneuverable, but the tradeoff is stability. You just have to find a balance that feels right for you. Also, the another point about center of lift, the further from center of mass it is, the more stable your craft will be in general (again, note that stability makes maneuvering harder).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eleven","CreatedById":60502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T16:12:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just tried FAR for the first time yesterday and was overwhelmed.

If you aren\u0027t having problems with heat, it may be a testament to solid reentry trajectories. Don\u0027t fix it if it ain\u0027t broke, knowatimsayin? I personally usually forgo shielding in favor of lighter weight. I control reentry temperature by using the engine bell as a shield (as it\u0027s designed to withstand high temperatures) and just throttle up a bit if it starts getting hot. For larger rockets, it can be difficult to maintain the appropriate direction (engine-first)... but generally it isn\u0027t a problem.
