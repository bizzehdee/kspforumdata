VHF radios, echosounders, sonars, autopilots, etc), but a programmer by hobby. It just so happens that the latter is often paid, so I happen to call this work. Now, I used to have a playlist dedicated to good background music when I needed to concentrate, but I\u0027ve found that instrumental music works so much better.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor quite some time I\u0027ve tried to build a decent playlist of music that allows me to \u0022get in the zone\u0022. Now, I normally have a very wide taste in music (70\u0027s progrock, 00\u0027s death metal, 90\u0027s rock, classical and some stuff that is generally hard to categorize. I can listen to almost everything, but country music and accordion makes me cringe.), but when it comes to background music for work I tend to be picky, as I\u0027m often thrown off my game - Fathering three kids has taken its toll on my ability to hear myself think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I just thought I\u0027d mention an artist named Adam Young. He\u0027s released a few albums that sounds like it\u0027d be soundtrack to movies, but instead they\u0027re soundtracks to historical events. I mainly thought about sharing this with the KSP forum, as this is where I first learned about him as something else than Owl City.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in case anyone is interested, here\u0027s the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://open.spotify.com/user/jarmund2/playlist/7ArDWhYqmM86GU3YskLTYp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Espotify playlist\u003C/a\u003E that I currently use for when I\u0027m working on something in a solitary fasion. Please note that at the time of this writing, I still haven\u0027t sorted through all of Adam Youngs stuff yet to see which tracks are to be added to that list, so if you\u0027re interested in that, you need to check that out separately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, what music do you listen to when you need to get \u0022in the zone\u0022?
