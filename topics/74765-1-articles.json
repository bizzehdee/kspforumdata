The inbound leg does not have the circle on it (the circle shows Kerbin escape).

Based on what you said, I think your inbound leg is down and to the left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why your inclination is 106 when you launched east is because the inbound leg is 106 degrees clockwise from straight east. So you really need to launch on an orbital heading of around 196. It actually looks slightly more than that to me, but it\u0027s a start. Also, you MUST make sure you time warp and launch when KSP is on the correct side (under the orbit).
