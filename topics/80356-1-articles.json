Still getting the hang of this. Let me describe the features that I\u0027ve worked into it. I\u0027ll try to include this in future posts as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Stable VTOL hovering. I took great care in balancing the VTOL engine so that you can hover with SAS off. It only slightly veers off and requires little taps of control to keep straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Symmetric fuel drain from all tanks and all engines. This ensures the center of mass doesn\u0027t change with fuel consumption, so it will keep the same flight characteristics no matter what the fuel level is, hovering included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Short, easy take-off roll. The rear landing gear are very near the center of mass so that you can start pulling back under 30 m/s. The landing gear are raised slightly to allow more pitch without hitting the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Slightly unstable within 10 degrees or so of prograde, but completely stable outside that region. This give it the feel of \u0022taking itself off\u0022 once you pull up off the runway on takeoff. With SAS turned off, it will climb all on its own. This also helps when going 1500 m/s in the upper atmosphere trying to reach orbit. There is less resistance to pitching up. However, you can pull up hard and it will never flip around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Single engine prevents spinning on flameout, so you can push it all the way to the end. I can get it to around 2000 m/s orbital velocity just using the jet engine. It still has the majority of fuel left in the tanks after reaching orbit using the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Lots of air intakes so you can keep using the jet up to like 40 km altitude (with reduced throttle). I also didn\u0027t clip any of the intakes together, if that makes any difference (feels like cheating to do that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Lots of lift! It can actually take off with 1/3 throttle in the turbojet while fully fueled (not using VTOL engine). When fuel tanks are about empty, it can take off with just the second little tick of throttle (maybe 10% or so).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried getting to minmus, but I have a feeling that might be possible. I\u0027ll try that out tonight!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sabe042","CreatedById":117428,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T01:37:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk I figured out how to post pictures!
