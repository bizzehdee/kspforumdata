If so what do i need to do in order to match the inclination and longitude of the ascending node of minmus?

You need to launch to an inclination of \u002B/- 6\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E depending on whether you are at the ascending or descending node with Minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo figure this out, and to launch at the right time, select Minmus as your target when you\u0027re on the launch pad, its orbit should then be highlighted in green on the map screen. So just warp ahead until the KSC is directly opposite from where this green path intersects Kerbin (You can use either the Mun or a satellite in an equatorial orbit to make sure you are looking straight down at the KSC). If you are at a descending node (Minmus\u0027 orbit should go down on the right side of the map screen if you are looking directly down on the KSC) then you launch to -6\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E, the opposite if you are at the ascending node. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo change your inclination just turn to a direction slightly above or below 90\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E during launch. You can watch the map screen and check one of the ascending or descending nodes to monitor your inclination relative to Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T00:11:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt only costs 70 m/s to correct from a non optimal intercept for a total of just under 1000m/s,, not counting circularizing.
