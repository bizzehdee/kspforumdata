I\u0027ve also noticed that several experiment results from the Mun and Minmus have a 500\u002B data yield. However, I am only able to process experiments in the lab that are 500 or less (depending on if there\u0027s already any data being processed and turned into science points). Is there a way to deal with such experiments at the lab for long-term gains? Or should I just recover/transmit those that are above that 500 cap?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T10:15:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 10:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xandalis**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lorunification","CreatedById":135645,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T09:33:51Z","Content":"May i ask which experiment yields more than 500 data for you?"},{"CreatedByName":"xandalis","CreatedById":66674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T10:15:13Z","Content":"\\*Facepalm\\* I just realized that I set the science multiplier rather high for this particular game; that may have a thing or two to do with the values I\u0027m seeing.
