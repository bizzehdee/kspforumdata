The Mk 4 and the Drop pod are almost ready from a release standpoint. There are still a few bugs to work out before you want to go for a public release, ones that will cause a less-than-pleasant experience while using the vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Drop pod will also require people to develop new styles of flying in order to land it safely, and exiting the pod will also require new skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You\u0027re currently on a bug hunt, and using large amounts of Raid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

Part of development hell. Choosing a few insiders to alpha test the existing package would be a good way to ensure that the end product meets expectations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Who cares?

That\u0027s just the way we roll. Bobcat didn\u0027t mean to say that we have a lot of bugs to resolve, just that we need to get mass balanced for smooth flight characteristics, and get parts balanced for game-play with stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022difficult to manage\u0022 part is the fact that due to game and plugin limitations, you have to understand the VAB well. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we want people to be able to use mechjeb if they wish, and mechjeb flies according to the pods original up axis, we need to orient the Mk4 pod vertically in the VAB. But since the cart plugin suspension responds strangely unless the parts original local orientation points the wheels down, we need to orient the chassis horizontally in the VAB. If you are not familiar with rotating parts in the VAB, this can be a frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the game has a glitch where the last up axis parsed in the part.cfg connection nodes must be the first axis with a part attached in the VAB. The other up axes don\u0027t work until then. So the parts need to be assembled in a certain order. Another potential frustration here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we have no control over other plugins or attachment node function, we need to accept these build idiosyncrasies so that we can enjoy functionality and eye-appeal of the Mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the DROP being hard to manage, not really. The issue lies in the mass balance. Since it is balanced for vertical flight it can be a little twitchy when landing horizontally, because the COG is centered for vertical flight with default accessories attached. I have no problem with that, but some may find it challenging. But we\u0027re looking at these little details and trying to give the mod the best function possible before release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end result is that the Mk4 Mod will be released very flight worthy and as easy to fly as possible. But, it will take more skill and planning to land a Mk4. You\u0027ll need to to plan your balance for vertical liftoff, as always, and also for horizontal landing...consider that a challenge. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s worth the wait. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BobCat","CreatedById":22422,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T19:11:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AJjtg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AJjtg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enew toys from CrashnbBurn\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"orson","CreatedById":31453,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T19:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was looking at the pod ..but is that a new chute ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashnBurn","CreatedById":32280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T19:59:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, new \u0027chute.
