If you plot the node without executing it, you can then adjust it accordingly before letting the autopilot perform the burn, but it sounds like you\u0027re already doing that. So far as I know there\u0027s no function to set up a complete orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"mackadelik","CreatedById":143364,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:35:26Z","Content":"Thanks for the reply. It sounds like there is no 1 click orbit button : p Although it would be very convenient... I think it might be a bit excessive and it really is working great as is!"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:35:40Z","Content":"Well i find it easy to just set the node myself and let mechjeb execute my node for orbiting planets. The landing autopilot works great but make sure you choose somewhere flat or make it so your lander can never be toppled even landing on a slope because mecjeb doesn\u0027t care about slopes it just lands you wherever you chose for him to land."},{"CreatedByName":"chlue","CreatedById":94579,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:57:43Z","Content":"if you want to rely fully on mechjeb you can go like this:\n\n1. ascend autopilot into something like 75 km (the lower the better, but you should avoid falling back into the atmosphere, so 75 is what I usually use)\n\n2. select mun and use hohman transfer to target. Tweak node to get the closest encounter match your desired orbit high and execute it\n\n3. fast forward to the SOI change (the new handy \u0027\u003E\u003E\u0027 buttons)\n\n4. use the circularize feature, choose @ periapsis and execute it\n\nNot a single \u0027I win\u0027-button but close enough :-)"}]}
