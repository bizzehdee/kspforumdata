Only now i couldn\u0027t extend one of the radiators (they deploy from within the cargohold). because it was stowed. It\u0027s radial buddy deployed jsut fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realize this \u0022stowed\u0022 restriction is there to prevent us from extending solar panels or start engines inside cargobays or fairings, but can someone create me a patch that disables this annoying feature?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no clipping involved, not even while the bay is closed.
