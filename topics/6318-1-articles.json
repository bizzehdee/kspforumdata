Especially when you ask the bus driver if he has an outlet you can borrow for a few blocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this minor problem, coupled with me finally getting something that can be called a smart phone, has lead me to a project idea. I want to try my hand at a mobile development project, and I figured why not something that is like KSP in spirit, but simple enough to run on a cheap, bare bones phone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current idea is something that has more design and theory testing stages, coupled with an object based CAD system with kind of a late 80s style interface. (Anyone remember CADs that ran on DOS? I swear I\\\u0027m not actually that old, I was just a geeky child.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Game\u0027 flow would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Component Design - A few basic \\\u0027object\\\u0027 types with rather primitive geometry options, which have different functions. Tanks, valves, pumps, (controls/computers?) etc. You then set up parameters, lengths, heights, widths, diameters, wall thicknesses, initial contents and initial states: Oxygen, Gas vs Liquid, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Component Testing - Taking your custom pieces, and putting them in the wind tunnel! Run them through their paces, and see what happens. (Would also double as an advanced object properties calculation step, which would simplify runtime calculations during launch stage.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Vehicle Assembly - Taking all your pretty little components, and slapping them together. (Similar to how KSP does it, but most likely simpler wireframe/2D CAD view)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Programming/Flight Plan - Setting up your burn stages etc ahead of time. How things are \\\u0027suppose\\\u0027 to go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Launch/\u0027practical Testing\u0027 - Fuel things up, and let it fly. Minimal \u0027Data Only\u0027 style display, possibly basic simplified graphics, small labelled dots on lines. No detailed rendering of what is going on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Basically the whole project has to run nicely on my HTC Status/Chacha, with its pathetic little 480x320 landscape display. Because, as much as I like the community, I\\\u0027ll be programming for my device first and foremost.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay also include designs for building up your facilities. Designing your launch systems, etc, and not killing off your work force. Not yet sure on what to do for a \\\u0027campaign\\\u0027 style game play. Possibly scenario based: X amount of money to do Y mission in Z time. Such as getting to the moon on a shoe string budget. May also include a missile game as well, and roll in a DEFCON style option. \u0027In the Race for Space, Thermonuclear war can be \\\u0027Plan B\\\u0027\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo idea about any kind of direct multiplayer option currently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m kind of thinking that it would be interesting to be able to design the engines and combustion chambers themselves. Most likely I will just make up a simplified chemistry to go with it, just because having a totally accurate sim for it sounds a whole lot less fun to program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, other thoughts or input on such a project? I figured I would start the initial planning with input from this community on general ideas, because we\\\u0027re clearly all fans of rockets. If I get a chance I\\\u0027ll do some mockups of UI concepts and do a little more paper planning over the weekend. Possibly get more detailed User Experience Documents written up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, given that I\\\u0027m starting this project and looking for input on another developer\\\u0027s forum, I won\\\u0027t be planning this as a paid app unless the devs give it the thumbs up later. (Assuming it even gets off the ground. Most of my programming is done for stuff running on \u0027computers\u0027 the size of small buildings. Working with the runtime resources of a smart phone isn\\\u0027t really in my field of experience, so this could go horribly horribly wrong.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot currently looking for help on the project. Not considering an iPhone version at all. (Unless someone wants to send me a Mac Mini, and $105 USD for dev account and XCode. And possibly a 3rd gen iPod Touch.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoxtane","CreatedById":6626,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-04T02:57:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou added the functionality to turn these rocket designs into KSP rockets?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luckless","CreatedById":3954,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-04T03:07:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the note of App-KSP interaction, I think the most I would do is provide a basic import/export functionality for component and rocket blueprints, primarily for backup and sharing of your designs in game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I would publish the specs on the format, so if someone else wanted to write a converter, they would be able to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGraphics wise, I\\\u0027m not planning on much.
