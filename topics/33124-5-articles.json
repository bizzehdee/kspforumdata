Anyway, when I hit the \u0027translate forward\u0027 key, the thrust vectors indicate the FORWARD FACING thrusters firing, obviously causing the green movement vector arrows to indicate rearward movement. Same thing the other way - \u0027translate rearward\u0027 = rear facing thrusters firing = forward movement. This only seems to be with the forward/rearward axis, though. Up/down and left/right indicate properly. To be clear, this is just with the graphics in the SPH or VAB, when in flight the thrusters behave as they should. No reason they shouldn\u0027t, this plugin has nothing to do with actual part function.

Thank you for it, I\u0027ll have to look and see if i have wheel wobble on the troublesome models.

Might need refuel in space, but that\u0027s another issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let me see if i got this straightened out. A large red torque value is good only in rotating you ship in space, you don\u0027t want the green arrow here, or smallest possible. If in Kerbal air-space its ok only as long as your wings counter the force. If your docking you want the smallest torque possible so that your not drifting all over the place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd once in space you might want to place RCS to counter torque from thrust. Is there a way to show both thrust and RCS at the same time so that one can adjust. Or would that throw off the RCS mode with no engine thrust? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if i said this but thanks for this Mod! It is something that was MISSING in the game that I feel is needed. Also thanks to the hints and this mod, i have tamed a ship that i named \u0022crash-o-matic\u0022 because no matter what i tried it would crash on take off, Or if it made it into the air it would fly till i go to adjust the plane and spin wildly out of control. It has now been taught how to behave and flies very very good. The Snap option for the landing gear was mostly at fault. As with few out of place RCS thrusters as i used them on takeoff to help get a nose up profile. I\u0027ve also started placing my Wings high up on the body sometimes the center of lift is above the center of mass, yet just behind or dead even with center of mass with fuel. Since i have a fuel balance mod i feel that is the best place to adjust too. But as it gets lighter it tends to drop backwards, so i might change it to dry mass instead. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf i am missing anything here any hints that i\u0027ve not found out, let me know i will say i this much \u0022When it comes to spaceplanes i am a noob!\u0022 But i wish to learn quickly and replace that noob status with something better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for the help m4v, power5000, and anyone else i may have missed,\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
