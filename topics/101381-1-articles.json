Even the amazing minds at NASA do things incrementally. So just start with seeing how high you can go, then try to beat those records with smaller, cheaper rockets. Then work on ever-longer sub-orbital flights until reaching orbit becomes a simple extension. Then work on coming back down. Then send some robot probes to fly past the Mun, impact the surface, orbit the Mun in different inclinations, etc. You get the idea.\n\nThe Apollo-style crewed landing and return mission is the first thing I wanted to do, but is actually a huge milestone to be proud of. After that, a crewed interplanetary mission is much the same. So take your time getting around to things, learn as you go, and enjoy the journey!\n\nOh, and its ok with me if your kerbals are disposable. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T18:49:55Z","Content":"See My Signature.\n\nThe Drawing Board really is THE best place to look for tutorials, as the others said.\n\nOf my own two, you may already be a bit beyond \u0027Induction To Construction\u0027, a better flight tutorial would suit you more.\n\n\u0027Exploring The System\u0027, on the other hand, won\u0027t teach you to fly but will give you designs for everything from flying in atmosphere to launching small satellites, visiting the moons, other planets and landing everywhere.\n\nYour own designs will be better, because they\u0027re *yours*, so treat the ones in that just as examples of what can be done.\n\nHave fun. :-)"}]}
