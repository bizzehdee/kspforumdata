Even the amazing minds at NASA do things incrementally. So just start with seeing how high you can go, then try to beat those records with smaller, cheaper rockets. Then work on ever-longer sub-orbital flights until reaching orbit becomes a simple extension. Then work on coming back down. Then send some robot probes to fly past the Mun, impact the surface, orbit the Mun in different inclinations, etc. You get the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Apollo-style crewed landing and return mission is the first thing I wanted to do, but is actually a huge milestone to be proud of. After that, a crewed interplanetary mission is much the same.
