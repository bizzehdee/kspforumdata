A 2 player game with a world as big as Earth (randomly generated). It would be a post-apocalyptic setting, with lots of technology still functional. Kind of like DayZ. Both players would start at random places in that world and the goal would be for them to find each other so they can rebuild the civilization. May contain zombies, but definitely not as many as in DayZ or worse, L4D. Also, rebuilding civilization would not be a part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

The player could progress through a series of challenges in which he/she must complete objectives of increasing difficulty; for example, the first mission might be to simply shoot the cannon\u0027s projectile straight up, but later challenges might involve getting the projectile to hit a target somewhere on the screen or intercept another projectile.

Or perhaps just SpaceEngine\u0027s planned space exploration game begin with the dawn of manned exploration, and have the player develop infrastructure in their own solar system before venturing out into the unknown. Or maybe that combined with something like Spore or (potentially) Thrive, where you must evolve your creature first. Also, a more extensive version of Civilization V (with battles akin to those from the Total War saga) taking the place of civilization stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow great that would be . . .
