I had a question about black holes, but this is also a thread for other people\u0027s thoughts about black holes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering, could a spacecraft use black holes as a catapult sort of propulsion? For example, it\u0027s well known that modern-era spacecraft will use temporarily orbit a planet, hit the periapsis of the orbit, then burn their way out of orbit, with the extra speed given from hitting the periapsis. My question, again, is, could a spacecraft do this some type of manuever with a black hole? And where would they go about it? On the edge of the black hole\u0027s event horizon?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T16:21:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGravitation is gravitation, so I guess the answer is yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuess you just have to be careful to do this with a save distance of the black hole, so the gravitation gradient doesn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t rip your ship apart\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kStrout","CreatedById":116630,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T16:27:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBe careful of tidal forces, send probes or Jeb first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T21:52:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERead the Larry Niven short story \u0022Neutron Star\u0022 for the dangers of something like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s only a neutron star in the story, they\u0027ve got FTL drives and indestructable hulls... and effectively a murder mystery.

But yes, the situations in which you could actually make practical use of black hole gravity assist are bound to be rare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if we\u0027re talking about using black holes for boosts, we probably aren\u0027t talking about things on scale of a star system. There are plenty of black holes going around with the other stars in our galaxy, and these can still be used for significant boosts. One of the limiting factors of boosts from planets or even stars is that there is only so much angle change you can get without hitting the thing. With black holes, that limitation does not exist. Your trajectory can have any exit angle you like. Just watch out for tidal forces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pikachu8091","CreatedById":104167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T12:31:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn relation to my first question, do black holes have a gravitational force outside of the event horizon?

There are still huge forces (gravity of the black hole) outside the event horizon, which can still effect anything from radio waves to spacecraft (that is why light is bent by the black hole). In relation to your second question, there is no escape from the black hole once you have passed the event horizon. To make it simpler, imagine you are on the edge of a sinkhole.
