I fooled around in Sandbox, building huge space stations and mostly failing to get them to orbit. For my first career save, I actually did pretty well. Then I found mods, and since then my KSP now takes like 10 minutes to load. I\u0027ve also discovered the addiction of Alt\u002BF12, and once I used it for the first time I basically can\u0027t stop. I still play this game, being a passionate supporter of SQUAD\u0027s creation, and I also play the Enhanced Edition, which I bought because I was sick of my computer\u0027s framerate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-23T21:48:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2018 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by The_Cat_In_Space\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-23T00:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I first started playing Kerbal Slideshow Program I built a four part rocket and went up, then down, then made a terrible rover that broke immediately.
