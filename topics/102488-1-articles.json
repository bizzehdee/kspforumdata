That documentary, along with Wikipedia, shows that the first failed engine had a broken hose in an ignition system if I remember correctly, and the computer was partly crosswired and shut down another engine. Wikipedia states that this was also vibration, and tests on the ground in the atmosphere covered up the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the S-IVB underperformed due to a similar issue in its engine. Furthermore, it failed to reignite for a simulated trans-lunar injection, requiring the Apollo spacecraft to use its Service Module engine to get as close to the high-speed reentry as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing - while Apollo 13 is known for its Service Module oxygen tank failure, it experienced problems similar to Apollo 6 on a less severe scale. Due to vibrations and combustion instability (again, Wikipedia is providing this info), the center engine of the second stage failed. This is shown in the Apollo 13 movie. Nevertheless, Apollo 13 was able to get onto its planned trajectory towards the Moon (the more famous oxygen tank failure is unrelated.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ten Key\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ten Key\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Spirit and Opportunity Mars rovers both have aluminum from the World Trade Center built into them.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Abrasion_Tool\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Abrasion_Tool\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard of this before.
