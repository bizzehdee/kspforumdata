All the tutorials I\u0027ve involve binding code to new parts that you add to a vessel. I\u0027d like to create a plugin that runs regardless of whether it\u0027s bound to a part. Are there any examples of that anywhere?\n\nContext: I wrote a C# software controller for a joystick with light-up buttons. I\u0027d like to be able to figure out what buttons to light up based on the current state of the game. For example, the \u0022Toggle SAS\u0022 button on the joystick could light up when SAS is enabled on the active vessel. Further, I\u0027d like to detect when the user is in the VAB, so I can dynamically change the joystick\u0027s button bindings. I\u0027d like the plugin to work without having to explicitly add a part to the ship. Is this possible?\n\nThanks!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAnd one more search answered my question....\n\n[KSPAddon(KSPAddon.Startup.MainMenu, false)]\n\n public class YourPlugin: MonoBehaviour\n\n {\n\n public void Awake() { }\n\n public void Start() {\n\n print(\u0022Holy Sh\\*t the plugin started correctly!!\u0022);\n\n }\n\n }\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOne more followup, are there any blacklisted libraries anymore? The wiki mentioned System.IO used to blacklisted, and I need a System.IO.Pipe for the interprocess communication to my joystick controller."},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T14:44:40Z","Content":"No thats been removed.
