At this point, we might as well just plug these matrix representations into computer and make it do the hard work. The following are the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we hit the sytem with a resonant wave. \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BD = \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JK04QqM.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022JK04QqM.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe top part of the image shows probability distribution for the charged particle. It\u0027s clear that under influence of the incoming energy, particle begins to oscillate. Which is what we expect. It\u0027s also clear that it does so in continuous fashion. Gradually building up the sing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom part shows corresponding energy levels in multiples of \u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00BA\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0. They are discrete. Energy is not a gradual distribution. Particle starts out at precisely (1/2) \u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00BA\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 and then starts gaining higher energy elevels with no states anywhere in between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leaves just one more things to consider. What happens if energies don\u0027t match? Here is the simulation with \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BD = 1.5 \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PZ68mgE.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022PZ68mgE.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that while there is some effect, oscillations finally die down. (The electromagnetic wave keeps hitting the system, it does not go away.) Once oscillations die down, process repeats. There is \u003Cem\u003Eslight and brief\u003C/em\u003E excitation of second energy level, but it quickly vanishes. The net transfer of energy from photon to the particle is zero. However, the fact that particle did move a little has an effect. And this happens with atomic excitations as well. The fact that glass has no transitions invisible light means that it does not absorb light. But there are transitions \u003Cem\u003Eclose\u003C/em\u003E to visible light, which is what gives glass an optical density. This interaction \u0022slows down\u0022 the electromagnetic wave without ever absorbing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe conclusion is pretty straight forward. The description in Chemistry texts and some popular science articles about electrons \u0022jumping\u0022 orbitals in atoms is a gross oversimplification. Electron never jumps. The electron cloud transitions gradually from one orbit to another over time. Likewise, probability of finding electron in ground or excited state transitions gradually. The only thing that \u0022jumps\u0022 is the actual energy. It never matches an intermediate value between the two states.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main difference between atom and simulations above is that in an atom, all energy levels are different. That\u0027s what allows a transition from one state to another, rather than to a distribution of states in the simulation. Otherwise, results are very similar, and the atomic orbital does look llike it\u0027s forced into rotation by the oscillating EM field. Maybe one day I\u0027ll actually have time to put together some animations for these as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T16:55:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for that!

And so I tested this out on a number of occasions. Predictive algorythms, in silico analysis, etc. Its one thing to say this is what I saw in college, its another thing to say this is whats happens in the real world, or this is what is happening right now, be ause for me right now is every weekday morning I have a small stack of manuscripts with little jewels from all over the world hoping to shine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result is this, I wont say 100% of the time, but nearly 100%, you can find the best referees that you want, no-one will referee the paper.

Yes, the editirial board and their suurigates get stuck withbthe task. Lesson learned, send the manuscript back to the authors, make sure they fill in the gaps in the equations, then pick referees and send it. Even doing this, i have gotten papers back from the referees with glaring oversights in a peper missed requireing an editorial rejection. I take alot of pride in keeping the editorial process open scientifically to expert review, msny journals say they do this, but judjing by the results i suspect many repeatedly farm the same referees. I have never had a paper in my oversight workflow retracted, knock on wood, but I have been close to a couple that have and peering into the process I susoect i know why. I don\u0027t work in a specifically math feild, computer science, chemistry feild, physics, or biology; the feild I work in covers all of these so you could consider them a good reference audiance for this group.

Either might pull that submission abstract aside, read it for intelligebility, as frequently happens, ask the journal assistent for a printout of the haul it off to a dark quite room with a sigle light and see if he/she could make sense of the M\u0026amp;M and results section. After pouring through abbreviated math, go back to the assistent and ask for a technical rewrite. It wouldn\u0027t matter how tough, complicated or long-winded that math is, that person would still have to go through it and try to make sure it made logical sense, that process would repeat itself until the submitter withdrew or complied.

For whatever reason it is particularly popular in developing countries, I was basically told by the editor if you pick up a manuscript, say Ph.D. (its a type of learning algorythm) and you cannot figure out the math in a few minutes, do not send it for referees send it back to the authors for a rewrite.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I believe you and parts of it sound perfectly reasonable, such as not using Genbank codes alone without also defining the gene. I would have thought three letter amino acid codes are standard enough not to need explicit definition though. And likewise, I\u0027m a bit puzzled about the last part. Where do you fit into this process? What is your particular role? Naively, I would have thought it was the referee\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ejob\u003C/em\u003E to review the maths and check whether it makes sense or whether it needs to be bounced back to the author. I\u0027m genuinely curious here because what you\u0027re telling me seems an odd way to do things - but I have no reason to doubt you either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd so I tested this out on a number of occasions. Predictive algorythms, in silico analysis, etc. Its one thing to say this is what I saw in college, its another thing to say this is whats happens in the real world, or this is what is happening right now, be ause for me right now is every weekday morning I have a small stack of manuscripts with little jewels from all over the world hoping to shine.\u003Cp\u003EThe result is this, I wont say 100% of the time, but nearly 100%, you can find the best referees that you want, no-one will referee the paper. When this happens, and I have to send the manuscript back to the corresponding author and get him to flesh out his math, i don\u0027t have any suitable referees left and then guess who has to referee the paper. Yes, the editirial board and their suurigates get stuck withbthe task. Lesson learned, send the manuscript back to the authors, make sure they fill in the gaps in the equations, then pick referees and send it. Even doing this, i have gotten papers back from the referees with glaring oversights in a peper missed requireing an editorial rejection. I take alot of pride in keeping the editorial process open scientifically to expert review, msny journals say they do this, but judjing by the results i suspect many repeatedly farm the same referees. I have never had a paper in my oversight workflow retracted, knock on wood, but I have been close to a couple that have and peering into the process I susoect i know why. I don\u0027t work in a specifically math feild, computer science, chemistry feild, physics, or biology; the feild I work in covers all of these so you could consider them a good reference audiance for this group. I stand behind the claim, define the variables and abbreviations, in the long run it will pay off, trust me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, genuinely curious, but when can you assume an abbreviation is just part of the common parlance in the field (or outside it for that matter) and doesn\u0027t need to be defined.

For example 16ORF168 might mean putative open reading frame 168 on chromosome 16. Some of the putative genes are actually QTL, quantitative trait loci, located up 500,000 base pairs from the gene they regulate. The problem is logical, once you define the gene for most loci, the referees or the reader becomes curious about the rest. The quantum mechanic equivilent of genetics is linkage disequilibrium, it is a logical nightmare because any specific inheritance group can have its own favored recombianation site. Almost any broad based gene searches done now are representative testing based on population standards and the cosequence is that if you have a particular representative setting on a inherited identity-by-descent locus. That particular site may be the only good representative on a haplotype up to 10 mbps in length. So that it looks real, until you realize that the hap-map surveys are not representative of very minor things. Its like a wormhole except in a genome, the effect is caused here, but the linkage shows up a light very far a way. When tested ODDGENE shows up significant, but its not the gene and its way far away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would have thought three letter amino acid codes are standard enough not to need explicit definition though.

Thursday i heard this exact phrase \u0027No abbreviations in the title\u0027 paper went back to the author for a technical rewrite just like that. Its even worse than that, we are constantly sending back papers for plagerism of 25%, at 40% summary rejections begin, we have seen plagerism up to 95% - cookie cutter publications based on their own or colleagues work. From certain universities of certain countries a majority of manuscipt are return for plagerism scrubbing or outright rejected. 20 years ago this was unheard of, they would have been rejected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere i fit in was 20 years ago i was refereeing alot of papers really bad manuscript, so the editor sending me this stuff says yes, the rejection rate was too low but when they sent the papers out the referees were not paying attention. One reason was the papers were written like crap and hard to read and referees were making mistakes. Referees themselves were getting tired, and it became very hard to find them and more junks were ending up at my doorstep, at which it was difficult to refuse. the problem is that bad papers lower the impact factor. Impact factors show up. The the asian flood hits publication, the number of manuscripts quadrupeled in a manner of few years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are correct, don\u0027t look it from my point of view, every author should hope he gets the best and most critcal referees as possible. That seems like a automatic process, but potential referees will simply refuse. I have found MS were the invited referee is the most knowledgable person and no daylight between his work and the MS and they refuse. When do they refuse, when they see the abstract; that\u0027s it and its rejection by refusal to referee. But the assistent doesn\u0027t know why. So i become the potential referee, if i read an abstract and say I wouldn\u0027t mind being a referee, the paper goes to referees and in generally there is no problem, maybe 1 in 10 get hung up and i end up having to help find referees. But those that don\u0027t pass the initial those papers get inspected and they often go back for a technical, some papers don\u0027t even belong in that journal they belong in another feild. Some of them need major language rewrite. IOW i have to get the quality high enough so that I don\u0027t end up refering it. If everyone refuses to referee the MS, then someone on the editorial board gets it and well, it seems im it. The most common papers stalled are on theory, literally and emphatically, no one wants to referee these. In silico are the biggest hot potatoes, they fair much better if they offer one emperical test or new experiment. You would think a referee would ask for experiments in the revision; nope, they all just refuse to referee. Its peer review via austricizing the manuscript. Now you see why i don\u0027t do math, i\u0027ve had migranous afternoons trying to figure out the logic of some of these monsters, and you have to look up 5 papers with 2% differences that use similarly migranous formulations. If its not related to my own work or something i enjoy, the math is too much like work. IOW, those formula should be as fluid or they are going directlty back to the authors.

If you expect her to search the MS for first uses of 15 abbreviation then you might be asked to define it. It has happenned. Its actually not the referee who does alot of this, its an assistent.

Specifically, we wish to hit this oscillator with an electromagnetic field of frequency \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BD. I am going to demonstrate that so long as \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BD = \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0, the energy of incoming photon is absorbed. Otherwise, energy cannot be absorbed, and there is no transition to higher levels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause position is proportional to a\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A0 \u002B a, we can describe the interaction with the electromagnetic field of incoming photon as follows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nH|\u00C3\u00CB\u2020\u0026gt; = [\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00BA\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0(a\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A0a \u002B 1/2) \u002B (a\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A0 \u002B a)qE cos(\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BDt)]|\u00C3\u00CB\u2020\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(There is a constant in there, dependent on \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0, which I absorbed into charge, q for simplicity.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, while there is no clean way to solve this algebraically, we have everything we need to solve it numerically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u0161/\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u0161t |\u00C3\u00CB\u2020\u0026gt; = -i/\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00BA H|\u00C3\u00CB\u2020\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile one could solve this in coordinate space, it is far easier to use the fact that we have a convenient basis and re-write the equation in the following way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u0161b\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003E/\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u0161t = H\u003Csub\u003Eij\u003C/sub\u003E b\u003Csub\u003Ej\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere b\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003E are the aforementioned complex numbers describing the system in term of its superposition of eigen states of the non-interacting Hamiltonain, and H\u003Csub\u003Eij\u003C/sub\u003E is the matrix representation of the interacting Hamiltonian. At this point, we might as well just plug these matrix representations into computer and make it do the hard work. The following are the results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, we hit the sytem with a resonant wave. \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BD = \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JK04QqM.gif\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JK04QqM.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe top part of the image shows probability distribution for the charged particle. It\u0027s clear that under influence of the incoming energy, particle begins to oscillate. Which is what we expect. It\u0027s also clear that it does so in continuous fashion. Gradually building up the sing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bottom part shows corresponding energy levels in multiples of \u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00BA\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0. They are discrete. Energy is not a gradual distribution. Particle starts out at precisely (1/2) \u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00BA\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 and then starts gaining higher energy elevels with no states anywhere in between.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis leaves just one more things to consider. What happens if energies don\u0027t match? Here is the simulation with \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BD = 1.5 \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PZ68mgE.gif\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PZ68mgE.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that while there is some effect, oscillations finally die down. (The electromagnetic wave keeps hitting the system, it does not go away.) Once oscillations die down, process repeats. There is \u003Cem\u003Eslight and brief\u003C/em\u003E excitation of second energy level, but it quickly vanishes. The net transfer of energy from photon to the particle is zero. However, the fact that particle did move a little has an effect. And this happens with atomic excitations as well. The fact that glass has no transitions invisible light means that it does not absorb light. But there are transitions \u003Cem\u003Eclose\u003C/em\u003E to visible light, which is what gives glass an optical density. This interaction \u0022slows down\u0022 the electromagnetic wave without ever absorbing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe conclusion is pretty straight forward. The description in Chemistry texts and some popular science articles about electrons \u0022jumping\u0022 orbitals in atoms is a gross oversimplification. Electron never jumps. The electron cloud transitions gradually from one orbit to another over time. Likewise, probability of finding electron in ground or excited state transitions gradually. The only thing that \u0022jumps\u0022 is the actual energy. It never matches an intermediate value between the two states.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main difference between atom and simulations above is that in an atom, all energy levels are different. That\u0027s what allows a transition from one state to another, rather than to a distribution of states in the simulation. Otherwise, results are very similar, and the atomic orbital does look llike it\u0027s forced into rotation by the oscillating EM field. Maybe one day I\u0027ll actually have time to put together some animations for these as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother reason for \u003Cstrong\u003Edefining variables in plain English\u003C/strong\u003E, someone may upgrade the forum and this results in unintelligible variables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/FlIrgE5T_g0?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich reiterates what I said:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee minutes 26:18-30:17\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
