I want my planets to look like in Matt Lowne\u0027s videos. But it\u0027s obviously not as simple as just enabling \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u00A0Scatterer, etc on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E. The mods I\u0027d like to use are: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, SVE, SVT, and Scatterer. I don\u0027t really care about any other mods, I simply want my universe to be moar realistic that the lame stock planet graphics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, when I enable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E followed by Scatterer, I get the realistic atmosphere look I wanted. But when I go to enable SVE, the \u0022Apply changes\u0022 button is grayed out. If I enable SVE first, it says it \u003Cem\u003Eincludes\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, however\u00A0when I do this I get SVE but still have the lame atmo-less look to Kerbin, Eve, and Jool. This is just one example. Then we have stuff like: \u0022SVT (for Windows)\u0022, and \u0022SVT-High Res\u0022. No indication of what the differences are, what dependencies they have, if they are compatible with SVE,\u00A0etc. I have Windows, and I want High res. But it won\u0027t let me pick both! How on earth do I know which to use? And what does it mean when one of the mods in the list turns red for a second?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor each mod, it seems there are several secondary \u0022config\u0022 and \u0022component\u0022\u00A0mods with them, and others I have to select from. I have no clue which of them to pick! This is probably part of my problem. This is all very annoying because every time I have to update KSP or build a new install, I have to remember all the same stuff I did last time...\u00A0before I realize it looks totally different than last time! (Why can\u0027t they just make standard\u00A0things like good visual mods stock?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow before you suggest it, yes, I know I can just download the individual mods and apply them one by one. Problem is, I can\u0027t get the mods to work out correctly seeing as some parts of them override each other. I also don\u0027t have the time to be re-doing this all over again for every update. So I use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, for no other reason than that!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone help me understand what all these little mods alongside SVE, Scatterer, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, etc\u00A0are, and tell me what I need to do in order to enable all the main\u00A0mods at the same time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-12T01:41:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2017 01:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Jeb!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HobbitJack","CreatedById":172428,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-12T02:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not sure, but maybe they are conflicting mods(?)
