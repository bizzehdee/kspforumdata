I\u0027ve had this issue a few times in the past and reinstalled KSP each time it has occurred, but this time I\u0027d rather not. I also have far too many mods installed to uninstall them one by one to find which mod is causing the conflict.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoninFrog","CreatedById":203049,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-24T05:21:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReading through the log, it seems to be\u00A0having trouble loading the following mods:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nKopernicus\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbal Health\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSCANsat\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTexture Replacer\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPersistent Trails\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003E\u0027ODScenarioModule\u0027\u00A0\u003C/span\u003ECouldn\u0027t figure out this one\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSnacks\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-24T14:25:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre all the mods you\u2019re using compatible with the version of KSP you\u2019re using and which version is that?\u00A0Since you\u2019re running KSP directly in your steam folder it\u2019s possible that the game has been updated to v1.9.1 from v1.8.1 or earlier, and a number of mods aren\u2019t yet compatible with that version yet.
