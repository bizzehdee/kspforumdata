I have a contract where I am supposed to perform temperature scans on Kerbin. I have succeeded in completing two of the three scans, one remaining of which is a stationary location, a surface reading. To make matters worse, it\u0027s on the mountain range just 60 or so kilometres away from the centre. I can get there by flight no problem, but actually landing on a slope proves to be not only tedious but also very difficult. I want to try to recover my crafts if possible, or I would have lost funding rather than gained any, since this contract offers only a few 10k or so funding total. I have tried several approaches:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) \u003Cstrong\u003EMunar Lander styled air craft with rocket motors to ease landing.\u003C/strong\u003E A munar lander with jet engines meant to cruise the 60 km between ksc and the scan location, and equiped with a landing descent rocket motor. While I rely on the rocket motors exclusively during the landing phase (rather than jet engines, for obvious reasons), the whole thing seems to tip over. Even when I do successfully land (a little more than half the time), I am never on the spot I need to be, usually several metres off or so from the location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) \u003Cstrong\u003EDeploy a rover straight from the space centre. \u003C/strong\u003EVery slow, very tedious. By the time I get 10-20 km out, the wheels break (I must confess that I have been using mech jeb auto pilot and go afk since it would take me hours to get to the surface scan location). The only problem is that at some point either the wheels break or it tips over, and even with the landing leg restabilizer method, usually they break before I can get thing back up right. It\u0027s a leg dance, and it just simply doesn\u0027t suffice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) \u003Cstrong\u003EDeploy a rover/flyer hybrid.\u003C/strong\u003E Again, same issues with both issues of 1 and 2 combined. The only reason to this approach was to leap over hills and such, and let the rover crawl the majority of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4)\u003Cstrong\u003EPayload drop style aircraft. \u003C/strong\u003ENow this is an interesting one, and have come close to succeeding, with some issues of course. Basically, fly an aircraft over the location, try a precision drop. The payload is a rover with chutes on it. This makes it easier to just go right to the spot. Even if I dont land right on course, that\u0027s why I drop a rover off nearby as close as possible and have it get there on it\u0027s own. This would be a flawless method if I wanted to recover everything from it, except that there is one major problem that gets in the way: Either the load or the aircraft disappears completely off the fabrics of kerbin space-time, whichever one I am not controlling. I wouldn\u0027t mind just letting the drop craft vanish and finish the mission controlling the rover, but I would lose way too much compared to the funding I would earn from the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to cancel the contract either, or I would obviously be penalized. Any suggestions on what I can do to get the stupid surface scan on a hilly slope? I want to be able to recover everything used if possible, without it vanishing on me or anything like that. Also, is there any possible way of preventing things from vanishing? I am not sure why in the world that happens, but it seems to happen only in the atmosphere of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T20:28:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could try the method from no.1 but just add parachutes to help you land.

If you don\u0027t have the parts available in your tech tree that I used, you can still accomplish it another way... which I\u0027ve also done before. I created an earlier jet which, when over my target, could eject the entire nose of the jet with all the science experiments attached, and would float down on chutes (manned mission). Of course, the rest of the jet was sacrificed and crashed, but I got my science. You could try the same thing with a small rover on/as the nose of the jet... just put rover wheels and chutes on it. Might be worth a try if you don\u0027t mind sacrificing the rest of the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as mods, I\u0027ve not used it but \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305-0-90-0-RemoteTech-v1-6-3-2015-02-06\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERemote Tech\u003C/a\u003E might be what you\u0027re looking for... others here could probably tell you better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-15T02:22:12Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2015 02:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordFerret\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IllicitMedic","CreatedById":66677,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T02:26:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes there is a mod that can extends the 2km range (pretty much as far as you want) but I don\u0027t remember its name, I\u0027ll try looking for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027m still looking for it, but in the mean time, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292-0-24-2-Flight-Manager-for-Reusable-Stages-%28FMRS-v0-2-00\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis could be of use.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-15T02:32:23Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2015 02:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by IllicitMedic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
