But that\u0027s not what precoolers do in KSP. They just act as a part that absorbs heat... apparently somewhat faster than other parts. They also act as an air intake and unlike other intakes have quite a high heat tolerance. So if your intakes are exploding when you get to high speed, try using more precoolers. On the other hand, this no longer seems to happen in 1.0.2. But in any case, your engines were never going to be the first parts to overheat anyway, your cockpit, intakes, wings, and so on would always be destroyed first, so as an \u0022engine cooler\u0022 they don\u0027t have a lot of use.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T19:23:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 07:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
