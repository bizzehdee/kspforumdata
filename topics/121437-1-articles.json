I could run in excess of 1000 parts on these versions (although anything above ~1000 became very laggy), now with 1.0 1000 is more or less the absolute max ill load in to the game let alone launch (lag becomes unbeareable above ~500 parts in atmo, and ~800 in vcaccum).

Heck, the race to cut parts has gotten so bad ive started editing fuel tank capacity to cut down on stacks of fuel tanks, my SSTL (single stage to laythe, bop, pol, and back) fighters have gone from ~80 parts with missiles, to under 60 now.
