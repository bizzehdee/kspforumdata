The first stage is a pair of SRBs, with sepratrons to push it away when decoupled. Second stage is a pair of liquid tanks with engines, also with sepratrons, and the main stage is a single 3.75 meter stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need the sepratrons because without them, the separated boosters sometimes collide with the ship. But, when I use them, I get the following in the Flight Results\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of damage doesn\u0027t appear to be significant, since I am now getting most of the parts and cost being recovered. But it concerns me when I see that the EnergiaQuad was damaged, since that is the main engine of the main stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried stepping the sepratrons down to 50% thrust, but that didn\u0027t help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this inevitable, getting some minor damage like this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETIA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[00:00:00]:
