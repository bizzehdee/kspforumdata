It looked ridiculous. Way too big. Ended up using the small instead.

It gives the necessary height to avoid tail strikes, particularly for classic delta wing designs which require pulling up fairly hard on takeoff with the wheels set a fair distance behind CoM.\n\nWhat\u0027s needed is shorter matching versions of both, so that you can have wing mounted main/rear gear, and body mounted nose gear while still keeping the plane more or less level.

And I\u0027ve managed to use them quite well on small planes to grant them a larger AoA when landing. However some wheels to bridge the gap would be nice as a separate part. Maybe something with a single, relatively large wheel like the front wheels on P-40\u0027s and Spitfires."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T10:48:05Z","Content":"The smallest retractable one could be slightly redone IMO.

I.e. existing small gear for mounting to the bottom of the body, longer variant for mounting to wings, and the combination of the 2 used together resulting in a plane that is horizontal."}]}
