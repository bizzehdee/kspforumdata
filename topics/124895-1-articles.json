Sensors were installed and passed operational tests, so I proceeded from the hangar into various areas around Kerbal Space Center to establish baseline atmospheric test results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring this process, was required to exit cockpit of rover to physically download sensor data onto a USB drive before re-use of sensor in different location. Note: Must return Jeb\u0027s USB drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn second extra-cockpit excursion, was attempting to retrieve data and lost footing on forward section of rover. Received no noticeable injuries during the fall, but was admonished by Mission Control for cursing over open circuit. Ignored this, crawled back up to cockpit via rover\u0027s wheel assembly, returned to cockpit and proceeded with mission. Performed additional tests at R\u0026amp;D facility and KSP tracking station. Exited cockpit to retrieve data and again fell from the vehicle, landing headfirst on this occasion (see photo of scuffed helmet, attached). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStood. Attempted to climb back onto rover using same method as before. Rover instead began to move forward, as it appears I forgot to engage parking brake. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelieving this to be minor obstacle, made continued attempts to climb onto Caterpillar Rover Prototype No. 1. Each attempt only resulted in rover achieving greater velocity and required me to wait until vehicle slowed to make further attempts. Pursued vehicle on foot until it halted. Made another attempt to climb wheel assembly. During attempt, right foot became lodged in assembly. Attempt again propelled Caterpillar Rover No. 1 forward. Vehicle\u0027s momentum sufficient that Mission Commander was dragged along with vehicle along its route (see embedded photo)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://40.media.tumblr.com/fe5147003678b9d8a87438992381511d/tumblr_nxkxovkc8Q1u8zapwo1_1280.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tumblr_nxkxovkc8Q1u8zapwo1_1280.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmonished again by Mission Control for cursing over open channel. Responded with pleas for assistance. Was advised by Mission Control that no personnel were in hangar complex but they would \u0022send someone to find Jeb or Val.\u0022 Replied again. Was not admonished for said response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENoted vehicle seemed to be headed for tracking station antenna structure and from my perspective, it appeared Caterpillar Rover Prototype No. 1 would impact the building at slow rate of travel and presumably halt. Continued to be drug along behind rover as it narrowly missed structure and continued toward nearby incline. Continued pleas for assistance reinforced with profanity continued to be ineffective in obtaining help from Mission Control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaterpillar Rover Prototype No. 1 proceeded to incline and picked up speed as it traveled to lower altitude. See above paragraph for description of my reaction. Was advised by Mission Control that \u0027velocity not life-threatening\u0027. Suggested Mission Control personnel recreate incident and take turns viewing from perspective of just below right middle wheel of Caterpillar Rover Prototype No. 1. Noise of helmet scraping along terrain obscured response from Mission Control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERover seemed to bounce as it transitioned to flat ground. Foot, happily, came loose from wheel assembly, and roll to side to evade rear wheels proved successful. Rover continued traveling into surrounding grasslands. I stood and pursued on foot. As ankle sustained some injury while using previous mode of travel, experienced significant pain during this process. Extensive verbal reactions helped ease this sensation. Advised Mission Control to not bother with further admonishments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://40.media.tumblr.com/af25f27f57210b234bd2ba5b128cede3/tumblr_nxkxovkc8Q1u8zapwo2_1280.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tumblr_nxkxovkc8Q1u8zapwo2_1280.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFoot pursuit took longer than expected as rover had gained significant momentum. Began to worry as direction and rate of travel made encounter with seashore seem possible. Happily, Caterpillar Rover Prototype No. 1 began to slow some distance away from shoreline, though not quickly. Eventually caught up. Halted rover\u0027s forward motion by blocking it with body. Again attempted to climb onto vehicle. Attempt was again unsuccessful and despite urging from Mission Control refused to try again, recalling previous experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://40.media.tumblr.com/c62ee719b8b2ede77c40697bb4a63759/tumblr_nxkxovkc8Q1u8zapwo3_1280.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tumblr_nxkxovkc8Q1u8zapwo3_1280.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERetrieved socket wrench from tool vest and hurled it against Caterpillar Rover Prototype No. 2, resulting in minor paint scuffing. Asked what positive results from action were by Mission Control. Advised Mission Control of various other places socket wrench could fit. Mission Control expressed doubts about my statement, citing insufficient width of receptacle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturned to Hangar area on foot, later assisted by Range Safety Officer with golf cart. RSO attempted to engage in conversation. Responded with profanity. Attempts ceased. Retrieved Caterpillar Rover Prototype No. 2 from Hangar and proceeded to No. 1. Ensnared No. 1 with wheel assembly of No. 1. and ENGAGED PARKING BRAKE. Exited cockpit, leapt onto rover No. 1 and entered cockpit where I ENGAGED PARKING BRAKE. Drove Caterpillar Rover Prototype No. 1 to hangar along with test data. RSO retrieved second rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://40.media.tumblr.com/ff5715751be1d1d8088243718385be9a/tumblr_nxkxovkc8Q1u8zapwo4_1280.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tumblr_nxkxovkc8Q1u8zapwo4_1280.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInjury status of Mission Commander includes sprained ankle, numerous bruises, severe chafing and minor lacerations, elevated stress hormone level.
