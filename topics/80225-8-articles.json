And in my experience the cost in config is always what the part costs in its default state, whatever you put in it. So something weird is happening both here and in the fork of ExLP you\u0027ve mentioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The radial parts are hollow (you may look at configs: 10kg per m3 meaning some struts and coating and 1.2kg of air), 91.4% of their mass is in their hull, meaning ~scale^2 increment. But the hub should have much more inside, like internal airlocks and pipes and wiring, yet it is still only 100kg per m3 and mass is split ~50/50 between the surface and the volume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Al-Li alloys that are used in aerospace are not so drastically lighter than aluminum itself (~2.6 vs 2.7, see \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alcoa.com/global/en/innovation/papers_patents/pdf/lmt2007_110.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alcoa.com/global/en/innovation/papers_patents/pdf/lmt2007_110.pdf\u003C/a\u003E for example). And if you increase the mass as the square of the scale it means that the walls of the scaled hollow part will remain to be of the same thickness. Imagine 5m wide hull (size4) still made form the same 3mm aluminum sheet, and what mechanical properties would it have. That\u0027s just a thought about the complexity of physical models, even as simple as the one I use to compute parts\u0027 masses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want you to understand me correctly:\u003Cstrong\u003E I do want to make things lighter\u003C/strong\u003E, because propulsion systems in KSP, as futuristic as they are, are still too inefficient and weak for such huge parts. But I can\u0027t just get the numbers out of thin air. All these computations allow me to balance the mod, to keep the challenge in game. So if you feel a part\u0027s weight is unreasonably high (or low), please, look at configs -- there are always complete descriptions of weight distribution -- and propose some changes. I will be glad to have some help in that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re welcome =) And there\u0027s still so much to do!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allista","CreatedById":99885,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-20T23:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E12 tons sounds a little excessive for a scaled up hub.

If I\u0027m not destroying a loaded ShipConstruct part by part, it remains rendered, which breaks the Editor in some ways. And a delay cannot help, because most of initialization of any module is done within OnStart method, and this method is not called on ShipConstruct.LoadShip. Only OnInitialize is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I think it\u0027s too counterintuitive and inconvenient. But storing ships in editor is still buggy (see known issues) and I will have to reimplement it, at least partially, at some point.
