The low mass can make up for the less efficient Isp, also requiring a less extensive launch vehicle. The LV-N is just too heavy to lift for the purposes of a tiny probe or satellite, outside of going to some of the more D-V intensive planets. For either moon the smaller engines can be more efficient depending upon your design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas Cook","CreatedById":77805,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T19:29:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven if you try and succeed to bring them to other planets on their own, I wonder if you could kill interplanetary speeds with the ion engine alone and remain in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T21:18:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse a simple design and learn how to fly them.
