Now, this would need a few things\n\nWater (new resource)\n\nElectricity (for it to work)\n\nSomething to contain water\n\nSo. Basically, a radiator would use electricity and use water to cool the engines. It would only take a small amount of heat off of the engine, making them not too overpowered.\n\nHow to get water:\n\nWater tanks! New part btw.\n\nInline and radial, in 2 sizes\n\nThe tanks must be connected to the radiator with a fuel pipe in order for them to work\n\nHope you liked this suggestion!\n\n-G1"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T21:37:32Z","Content":"Cool idea but maybe a bit too complicated for some simple radiators.
