I know the game does this automatically but that is only done to parts that are attached to a part you are moving, resulting in the disconnection to the main body (ultimately to the command unit) for the parts attached to the part you are moving (Confusing? Yeah, I know\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E) I am asking if there is away for me to group things together so that if I decide to move it, it all moves. For example, when building a wing I may us multiple parts forward to aft along the\u00A0fuselage to create a wing. I would like to be able to select a part that makes up the wing so I can move it along the aircraft without having to move each individual\u00A0part.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-31T02:03:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2018 02:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Metro_Stalker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAttempting to clarify my question\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-31T04:40:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, you can do that in stock to some degree.

Attaching wing sections to the fuselage ahead of/behind existing wing parts will continue to make \u201Cstrips\u201D of wing parts like you do now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf, however, you choose one wing part to be the \u201Cwing root\u201D, so to speak, you can build a whole wing like a tree branch, adding more wing parts to existing ones (which may mean parts are put on \u201Csideways\u201D), able to pick it up and move it as a unit as long as you remember which root part to grab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will, however, change the distribution of forces within the wing. Instead of a number of wing strips each cantilevered off the fuselage, you\u2019ll now have the entire wing force being beamed through the network of wing parts back to the root, which may introduce deflections and moments that are significantly different than what you\u2019re used to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past, this has required (for large wings) extensive use of struts to re-distribute the forces back to the fuselage components along the entire chord.
