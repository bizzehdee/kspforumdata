It\u0027s been quite some time, and I hate to admit it but actually years since I\u0027ve played. My question is how do I get the updates? (and yes I already purchased this game along time ago) I know there has been updates since i was away and I know i missed some. However when I click \u0022Check for updates\u0022 nothing happens except all the writing on the screen goes un highlighted and not clickable. Any help or tips on how I can resolve this issue and get the updates would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T03:29:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you bought the game through the store, you should be able to log into \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/kspstore/index.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe KSP store\u003C/a\u003E and find your purchases there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you bought the game on Steam, or transferred your purchase from the store to Steam, then the game should be in your Steam library and downloadable/updateable in the same way as any other Steam game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re still having trouble redeeming your purchase, you can contact Squad via email at \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b6e7c09243b3f2224256e7c0f\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u0022bfcccacfcfd0cdcbffd4dacdddded3cccfdedcdacfcdd0d8cdded291dcd0d2\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, though please bear in mind the offices are closed during weekends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T03:32:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 03:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by technicalfool\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbstian","CreatedById":67864,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T05:33:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022technicalfool\u0022 data-cite=\u0022technicalfool\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi there.\u003Cp\u003EIf you bought the game through the store, you should be able to log into \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/kspstore/index.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe KSP store\u003C/a\u003E and find your purchases there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you bought the game on Steam, or transferred your purchase from the store to Steam, then the game should be in your Steam library and downloadable/updateable in the same way as any other Steam game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re still having trouble redeeming your purchase, you can contact Squad via email at \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#664351240916120f0908435122\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u0022b0c3c5c0c0dfc2c4f0dbd5c2d2d1dcc3c0d1d3d5c0c2dfd7c2d1dd9ed3dfdd\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, though please bear in mind the offices are closed during weekends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhhh I see, yeah i see where I can download my purchase again.
