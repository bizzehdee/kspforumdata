It\u0027s been quite some time, and I hate to admit it but actually years since I\u0027ve played. My question is how do I get the updates? (and yes I already purchased this game along time ago) I know there has been updates since i was away and I know i missed some. However when I click \u0022Check for updates\u0022 nothing happens except all the writing on the screen goes un highlighted and not clickable. Any help or tips on how I can resolve this issue and get the updates would be greatly appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T03:29:06Z","Content":"Hi there.\n\nIf you bought the game through the store, you should be able to log into [the KSP store](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/kspstore/index.php) and find your purchases there.\n\nIf you bought the game on Steam, or transferred your purchase from the store to Steam, then the game should be in your Steam library and downloadable/updateable in the same way as any other Steam game.\n\nIf you\u0027re still having trouble redeeming your purchase, you can contact Squad via email at [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b6e7c09243b3f2224256e7c0f), though please bear in mind the offices are closed during weekends.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T03:32:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 03:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by technicalfool**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbstian","CreatedById":67864,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T05:33:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi there.\n\u003E If you bought the game through the store, you should be able to log into [the KSP store](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/kspstore/index.php) and find your purchases there.\n\u003E \n\u003E If you bought the game on Steam, or transferred your purchase from the store to Steam, then the game should be in your Steam library and downloadable/updateable in the same way as any other Steam game.\n\u003E \n\u003E If you\u0027re still having trouble redeeming your purchase, you can contact Squad via email at [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#664351240916120f0908435122), though please bear in mind the offices are closed during weekends.\n\nAhhh I see, yeah i see where I can download my purchase again. I wasn\u0027t sure if I hit \u0022download\u0022 if it was just going to download/reinstall the same game I got back on 2013-05-22 or if it was going to come with the updates? (Also I got it for mac \u0026 never transferred to steam if that makes a difference. Also do you know if the update will have me keep my current missions going?
