I started slow - I hadn\u0027t collected much science yet and the plan on this trip was to learn as much as I possibly could. I was still early in the tech tree - everything was still in early tech tiers (nothing over 45 science I think) and the tier for batteries. I sent Jeb up on a mighty mission to perform a Munar flyby to get a gravity assist out to Minmus orbit, with about 4k electiricy power (I had 40 of the the stick on batteries around my fuel tank) to support the science kit transmissions since the pod doesn\u0027t hold much data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to a miscalculation, Jebediah ran out of fuel on the far side of Minmus while engaging in the corrective burn to get himself back to Kerbin. Oh dear!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... He got out of his ship and pushed it. Pointed the ship retro, engaged SAS, got out and maneuvered himself against the cold engine, and blasted his suit jets. Ran low on jet power, got back into the airlock to refill it, then rinse and repeat. Jeb spend over 90 minutes (real time) doing this to drop his periapsis - it was all the way out at 22 Million km! Managed to get it to just 22km before I went insane and had to stop the repetition. Safely splashed down in the ocean and recovered a whopping 490 science from the trip, including what was transmitted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are some of your most outlandishly crazy / lucky return trips?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kialar","CreatedById":60893,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T13:56:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did a Mun mission yesterday with a two manned lander. On return to Kerbin, my first chute ripped off on deployment.

And then I came down with lucky 25 m/s on a hilly slope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll but one landing leg disintegrated, the craft flipped, but remained intact at it\u0027s core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter recovery I gained 504 science points.
