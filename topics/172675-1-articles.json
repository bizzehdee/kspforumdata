I charged it and activated it at 0.1c and it worked fine, the real issue was when I set it to 1c. For some reason the moment I set it to 1c it got completely destroyed. I also used another warp drive mod (warp drive standalone) and it had this problem as well. Is there some kind of limit now that I didn\u0027t know about?
