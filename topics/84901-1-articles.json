I know when you do rendezvouses in orbit, you can match orbit inclination by burning during an AN or DN. But if I\u0027m just orbiting and want to change my orbit inclination, I can just do it at any time, yes?

Since it is in a pretty much perfect equatorial orbit of Kerbin, you will have the AN/DN in relation to it available. Of course, if your circular, the AN and DN hardly matter for just inclination changes. You can really do it anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI gotta warn you though, changing from equatorial to poles in LKO is not just inefficient, it\u0027s VERY inefficient. You need to have a bunch of dV to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond question: yes and no. Your inclination change will always change AP/PE but you can counter the change by aiming it right. When you make a maneuver node you would change the inclination and then adjust the AP/PE afterward, you will see the direction you aim is not right on the Normal/Antinormal mark, but just off it to correct the eccentricity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-18T14:30:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2014 02:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-18T14:30:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022guitarxe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022guitarxe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd another question regarding this - is it possible to make inclination change burns without affecting your AP and PE?
