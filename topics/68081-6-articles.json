The follower lost his engine on landing but otherwise got home safely. My issue was that the follower kept losing altitude no matter what I did, and refused to keep up. I had to do a correction about halfway through the flight because he managed to drift about 600m lower in altitude, and the denser air made him drag slowly behind. After the correction I managed to land him by guessing his altitude and trying to mimic what I should do as the leader (managed to stall him in the process).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s gotta be a way to have the follower mimic altitude.
