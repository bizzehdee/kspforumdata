I modded the Mark 55 Radial Mount Liquid Engine, to have 500 pounds of thrust. My Rover/Lander has 4 engines, which equals to 2000 pounds of thrust; 500 pounds more than one Mainsail. It also has a very high heat and damage tollerance This is to get my ship to leave Eve\u0027s atmosphere unharmed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, is it \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E powerful for Eve? You see, I use MechJeb\u0027s Landing Autopilot. And it didn\u0027t do the breaking burn like it has in the past, with this design, which is why I feel I made the engines more powerful than they need to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a picture of my Rover/Lander, on the launchpad. Going by it, can someone help me out by balancing the right thrust to make MechJeb use its breaking burn again, yet also be able to escape Eve\u0027s crushing gravity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i42.tinypic.com/34xidco.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002234xidco.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s not all. When I tried to land on Kerbin, the chutes ripped off after it slowed to 100m/s. This has never, \u003Cstrong\u003Eever\u003C/strong\u003E happened to me (even with this design), and it feels very discouraging. I\u0027d like that not to happen again. And I think it happened because again, Landing Autopilot didn\u0027t do its breaking burn. I think of how powerful the engines are, it let physics slow it down, and had no need to use the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T05:55:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks at the engine thrust (twr) and calculates exactly how long it will take to kill its vertical speed. You simply were just impatient and didn\u0027t wait to see what it would do 3 meters above the ground lol. Try it again and let it do its thing.

Landing via deceleration burns sounds kinda dangerous, not to mention a waste of fuel when there\u0027s all that cushiony air for your parachhutes to catch and slow you down. Strap some radial parachutes onto the radial engines cause I\u0027m not sure if that one will slow your ship down enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso anything that lands on Eve usually doesn\u0027t come back. Since Eve is just overall bigger than Kerbin, you need more TWR to lift equivalent weights back on Kerbin. So to get that rover off of Eve requires a bigger rocket than the one that took you onto the planet in the first place. Doesn\u0027t seem like those radials have enough fuel to get the job done anyway. Atmoshphere\u0027s a whole 20km higher than Kerbin\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-15T06:12:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2013 06:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by painking\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"painking","CreatedById":69085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T06:08:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edouble post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benie","CreatedById":70327,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T06:09:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, fuel isn\u0027t a concern for me (note my title).

When I burn through the atmosphere, my lander slows down substantially. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt handled Eve better than I expected.

Mechjeb knows when to burn and for how long, and while it\u0027s scary to watch your rocket plummet to its death while mechjeb does nothing, you gotta trust its math. Mechjeb also occasionally just decides not to work. Try turning the autopilot on and off to see if it changes anything. Also your lander isn\u0027t going to rip itself apart. If rocket tears itself apart from too much thrust, then you didn\u0027t put enough struts on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThePsuedoMonkey","CreatedById":58589,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T06:47:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on your landing speed and number of parachutes I\u0027m guessing that thing is about 6 tons, in which case a total of 216kN of thrust will give a TWR around 2 on Eve. Now if you just removed the engines from it, the parachutes would drop your landing speed under 3m/s anyway. As for the braking burn, terminal velocity on Eve is around 60m/s and 2000kN on a 6T ship means an acceleration of over 300, so a suicide burn would start 0.2s before crashing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cashen","CreatedById":71281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T06:50:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEve\u0027s atmosphere is so thick you shouldn\u0027t need rockets for landing.
