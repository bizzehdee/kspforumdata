I see no glaring super-bugs, only minor quibbles for the most part. If they\u0027ve got the tutorials properly updated, then the game will be just fine. Plenty of far more successful games with far nastier glitches and bugs than KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022montyben101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022montyben101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8gCQbmk0B4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry squad but shouldn\u0027t you at least address some of the major issues before coming out of beta?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWHAT major issues? They\u0027re addressing aero, warp issues, adding even more variety by making Karbonite stock, and I rarely, if ever run into bugs. And both of the ones I can think of involved doing things absolutely crazy. As I said above, if their tutorials are properly up to date and marked clearly, I don\u0027t see the \u0027major, glaring\u0027 issues you seem to be on about. Yes, Unity 5 would be nice, but given that we know that Directx 11 works pretty well for cleaning up the game, I\u0027d rather have them working on getting it fully compatable and using that to massively reduce any issues. They\u0027ve already said they\u0027re rebalancing everything, adding in more parts to make things easier in other spots, and have worked to get the contracts turned into something fun. Seriously, everybody I talk with have been wondering why KSP hasn\u0027t been updated to 1.0 since about March last year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-24T03:03:52Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2015 03:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CptRichardson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"montyben101","CreatedById":74173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T02:58:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketPilot573\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RocketPilot573\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI have come to a realization, the statement \u0022As development in Beta has progressed\u0022 makes no sense. .90 was not Beta because it was still using the old development strategy; The \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Erealease\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E of .90 marked entry into Beta.
