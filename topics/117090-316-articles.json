Hoping that I\u0027ll get the second set of geometry worked out.  Looks like there will be specific sets of landing legs for each type of tank setup -- no way to avoid it while still having the geometry and mechanics be even somewhat realistic.  The points-of-attachment on each of the tank types varies widely between each type of geometry -- the attach points used on the bare LV tanks simply won\u0027t work for cylindrical tanks (as they don\u0027t exist) -- and vise-versa; the cylindrical attach points don\u0027t exist on the LV tanks (either paneled or bare variants).\n\n- Bare Octagonal Tanks -- will use the gear shown previously.  Might also make a \u0027medium/heavy\u0027 version that looks a bit more robust... but the current version looks fine when scaled appropriately for the tanks.\n- Paneled Octagonal Tanks (or other square\u0027ish form-factors) -- will have at least one landing leg variant specifically for these tank variants.\n- Cylindrical Tanks -- will have a third set of landing legs intended specifically for mounting on cylindrical parent parts.\n- Might make more than one variant for some of those setups.  Some might wait for future development -- right now I\u0027m specifically aiming to create landing leg sets for the LV tanks.\n\nAlso continuing to work on the ModularPart/ModelDefinition/ModelData systems module rework.  Today saw quite a bit of ripping into the ModelDefinition class and cleaning up its internal handling of various model related parameters.  The ModelDefinition class is the root storage container for any data pertaining to a single config defined \u0027model definition\u0027 -- stuff like height, diameter, volume, cost, attach-node positions, animations, as well as any data specific for the functioning of that model -- solar panel data, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and/or engine thrust transforms, fairing positions, and a list of other compatible adapters/models.\n\nThe goal is to allow for everything related a single \u0027model\u0027 to be defined in a config file.  The PartModule then loads these model definitions into \u0027model slots\u0027 (nose, upper, core, lower, mount, upper-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E, lower-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E, solar-panels) that will allow for choosing of the models for a part in the editor (e.g. the current MFT tanks/other modular parts).\n\nThe big change compared to the current setup is that no longer will functions be part-module specific (e.g. you currently need to use the SSTUModularBooster PartModule if you wanted thrust/transforms handled properly for SRBs); rather, all of the functions will be handled in a single PartModule, and the configuration of that PartModule within the Part will determine the specific functions that are enabled and usable for that part (it will be up to the author of that part/models configurations to make sure that all of the config values needed for the functions are specified appropriately).\n\nProbably still a few weeks away from even starting to have anything usable on this branch of the code, but when I get to that point, I\u0027ll likely start offering \u0027alpha\u0027 versions to aid in testing of all of the changes and help track down any incorrect configs."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-18T22:03:50Z","Content":"![mkjuiGW.png](https://i.imgur.com/mkjuiGW.png)\n\n![tlSPKqO.png](https://i.imgur.com/tlSPKqO.png)\n\nLook how wide and flat those ^^^ deploy... they presumably fold upwards. \n\n![B0V2kqM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/B0V2kqM.jpg)\n\nAnother upward folding geometry."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-18T22:50:23Z","Content":"[@tater](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119411-tater/)\n\nWould love to see a few more images of those \u0027upwards\u0027 folding landing gear from the first two images you\u0027ve posted above.
