First, as I have stated before, the new parts will most likely be moved either in.24 or a patch there after, I highly doubt their placement in the techtree is set in stone (I know this is a bit offtopic but I am sure it will come up sooner than later....again). Second is the known fact of the in game money system, for career mode, that will also be coming in a future patch. Now if you have to budget how much your lift stage and payload cost together it would serve to reason you would want a lifter that costs less, however if you have not reached it in the techtree, saying that the new parts are further in the tree than they are now of course, you might have to reconsider the payloads you are launching. Right now without any form of \u0022budget\u0022 we can build what we want in career mode, with what we have unlocked of course. Once we, as players, no longer have that luxury we will have to build more efficiently in terms of money. If you are only looking at what we have without looking further ahead I can see where you would believe the engines are \u0022op\u0022 to main sails, but once you factor in other items that are not, but will be, in yet you can see why they are this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the new parts are better than the old parts, once they are moved higher into the tree and cost is factored in I believe you will see why they are the way they are, especially if the contract system is what pays the bills by doing; mission reward-parts cost = profit/loss for the mission (remember you will most likely have to budget how much you spend to build your rocket most likely). So while you COULD get a 100t payload in to orbit with the older setup, the cost would make it less rewarding once you can purchase the new parts. At least this is how I have been looking at it for now, since it is far from a completed product I have to keep that in the forefront. A lot of players act like every thing that is in game right now is set in stone for final release, but things can and will change but it takes time. It is fine to say it is \u0022op\u0022 at the current state, but believing this is the final version of these, or any, parts is not helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T14:09:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FlightSimXManiac\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FlightSimXManiac\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebut I still maintain that if content for these size 3 parts was made\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has: the ARM pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Squad did not want to maintain two different pieces of software - which would have delayed every update for both versions (think about the forum-bloodshed that would have caused ...) - and since lots of players voiced their wish to include the new parts in the standard game ... but as always: whatever you do, you can\u0027t do right (for everyone).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the wiki has not been updated and I cannot look into the game right now (and do not intentionally memorize numbers in games), I cannot compare the hard numbers to form my own opinion whether the new engines have gotten only perks and no drawbacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut keep in mind that these parts have been created with a purpose, the ARM \u0022addon\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you like to make exaggerated counterarguments:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mainsail is very powerful compared to other smaller engines and it helps a lot to make things easier when the player finally unlocks them in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould the Mainsail be toned down/removed in sandbox mode? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jamille4","CreatedById":63373,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T14:11:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t understand it either.

These are the only parts like that, but I think it stands to set a dangerous precedent where KSP relies on having the best parts rather than using the best parts for the job. So far Squad hasn\u0027t shown that they intend to pursue that sort of mentality but career progression is (maybe) far from finished and may adopt that strategy. Take, for instance, KW Rocketry. Every engine in that pack outperforms the stock engines. Because of that, I quickly found I wasn\u0027t using any of the stock pieces, and not just for appearances. It\u0027s dangerous to fill the part bin up with obsolete parts and that\u0027s the bulk of the pro-change argument. Right now they are 3.75, but what if they introduce a superior 1.25 variant?

The engine would be able to carry a few tons less, which would be countered by more thrust (stupid_chris boosted the quad to 4000, I would go even higher). The difference is in the fuel fraction, which determines how much delta V you can extract at a certain TWR, so by decreasing the TWR and increasing the thrust you can launch the same gross mass to orbit with the same number of engines and stages, although each stage would require slightly more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T15:21:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI request thread be closed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was proposing a simple solution and had created this thread to discuss it and present any possible shortcomings or concerns, not to argue over ARM again.

KerikBalm makes a good point and provides what he feels is supporting info. Then you come back with a #dealwithit. So, let\u0027s push your \u0027opinion\u0027 a little further. Sandbox doesn\u0027t unlock parts. Are you implying that it would then be fine for sandbox players to have a toolbox full of comparatively useless parts? Or are you implying that we should be artificially restricted (Hi Flower Child!) in Career mode for the sake of progression? What exactly is your point? And who are you to be speaking for Squad? The developers have said the game will change, and have changed from their stated direction before.\u003Cp\u003ELastly, what Squad HAS said is they want the game to be fun. So, The Space, let me ask you this: if adjustments were made to align the parts with the tentative progression the other engines follow, how would that affect your game? Would it cease to be fun? Would you lose interest? Or could it be that you don\u0027t actually have anything useful to add to this discussion? If I were a betting man, I\u0027d go all in on the last one. It\u0027s not bad enough that you jump into an argument without at least reading the last few pages, but that when you do its with a weak strawman and the premise that you know what the developers are doing. That\u0027s just a bit rude, don\u0027t you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003ENo, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s rude to express my opinion on the original poster\u0027s issue. I don\u0027t really get your argument about comparatively useless parts in sandbox. You are the only one limiting yourself from using certain parts in sandbox. \u003Cp\u003EWe are already \u0022artificially restricted\u0022 in career mode because of the tech tree and I personally like that because in my opinion progression brings a nice element into KSP by giving the player a sense of accomplishment and technical progression in their own space program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also believe that Squad intends career mode to be the so-called main game because career offers more gameplay features than sandbox and everything that can be done in sandbox can also be done in career but there are many features unique to career mode. I think it\u0027s perfectly fine for some parts to be primarily designed for career even if it means some people will start using them instead of some older parts in the sandbox. I don\u0027t believe sandbox can be completely balanced in terms of parts while maintaining progression (which already exists) in career. In my opinion sandbox is all about having fun and testing some crazy designs and not about strict balancing of parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have inside knowledge from Squad but I believe they have a reason to make the new engines more powerful and wouldn\u0027t just randomly pick stats for the engines. It was also said in one of the past Squadcasts (unfortunately I can\u0027t remember which one it was) that Devs wanted the new parts to be end-game content and a reward for experienced players.

Case in point, resources. What Squad has said and done has changed, so even based on what they\u0027ve said we can only take it with a grain of salt. As far as \u0027artificial restrictions\u0027 I agree, that was vague. In Flower Child\u0027s mod, progression is reduced to attempt to force you into implicit missions in a specific order. No trying to go to Duna with the first segment of the tech tree, you better do a dozen sub-orbital missions. I simply dislike the idea that KSP could be reduced to a game where succeeding is simply a process of achieving a certain technological advancement, and it seems like a lot of the charm of the game is reduced. Case in point: MechJeb. It could be a career unlock, but you can bet many folks would be upset that a \u0027I win\u0027 button was being added to the game. I don\u0027t think the new engines are that, but the arguments for and against would be frighteningly similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI appreciate that you added some meat to your opinion, even if I still disagree with it. Squad also made three different SAS objects with the same stats. They\u0027ve been slow to balance the game, and I think that is intended. I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll see that for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo NASAFanboy, that\u0027s why I think maintaining two versions of the game is silly and pointless. For all the work they\u0027d spend doing that, people could just download a mod and have whatever flavor they want. It is wholly up to them to decide what the \u0027stock\u0027 flavor is going to be, whether or not we add our own additional seasonings to taste. Since stock is the only version which binds our accomplishments, they will most assuredly balance it eventually, but two versions is not only a bad compromise, it\u0027s a lot of work that would only serve to waste Squad\u0027s resources and further divide the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
