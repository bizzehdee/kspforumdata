So I took the station to chase after the floating command module figuring I could dock with it, only to realize I would eat up all remaining station RCS doing so if I even got lucky. I figured I could launch a rescue mission, so I gave up, hit reload to try again (contrary to the rules on the wiki for the wiki Campaigns) and tried again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second attempt I docked, but then I wanted to fix my station\u0027s altitude since my chase from the previous episode left it in an elliptical. I wanted 140km circularized. So I circularized it. Then I must have left the darn engine running (the low rumble should have been a clue). I turned off the engine and checked my periap which was on the otherside of Kerbin from my view point. I thought I read 140km. Whew close call. No need to worry. I left my two Kerbals on board, and returned one Kerbal home. And on the way home I was wondering why the station was at a lower altitude from my returning spacecraft... so I toggled back to the station and checked the altitude 40km!!. It was burnin\u0027 in the darned atmosphere! *Smack Head Here* the station left said atmosphere but next time around, I knew the station would die. There was no hope of a rescue... so I figured I\u0027d just quit the game for the evening and come back to it when I have a plan.

The problem is, over the years, most of us have been conditioned to just spam click any \u0022OK\u0022, \u0022Yes I\u0027m sure\u0022 etc. buttons that pop up, because most of the time, we DID really mean to hit those options. So when the \u0022Are you sure\u0022? option pops up, it often won\u0027t stop us from clicking \u0022yes\u0022, because we are actually letting our trained and conditioned subconscious minds operate the computer menus while we think about something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is simply how the human brain works- it offloads common repetitive tasks to the subconscious so that the conscious mind can pay attention to more important things.
