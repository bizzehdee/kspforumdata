You don\u0027t have to yaw all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)Uh, this happens to everyone. It\u0027s some kind of bug i guess. Try simply steering the jet on the runway, usually it deviates very little anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) If you bounce a couple times before take off, it\u0027s probably that you don\u0027t have enough lift, and so your jet needs to go faster in order to get that needed lift, hence not lifting up on the first time. Try increasing wing surface//increasing lift-to-weight ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you feel that yourplane has enough lift but won\u0027t point its nose up, then try putting the back wheels closer to the center of mass.
