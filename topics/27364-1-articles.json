Obviously building it all in one piece and launching it would be extremely impractical (and would potentially take away the fun of building it piece by piece). I already know docking mechanics, so, once these things are assembled in space, how would I go about landing them, and what things should I consider? I want this structure to come down safely onto the Mun, no parts snapping off or anything.

When I land large habitats and structures, I usually just put an eject-able probe core on top so that way I can fly/land it just like a normal lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T05:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI put this base together with these modular pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used docking ports and\u003Cstrong\u003E TouhouTorpedo\u0027s Modular Multiwheels \u003C/strong\u003E instead of lander legs, then just landed each piece and drove each section in place, docking them on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach module has two docking ports and one inflatable HAB with a second type with four docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/21909-0-16-TouhouTorpedo-s-Modular-Multiwheels-%28Tosh-s-Cart-Mod-powered%29?highlight=Omniwheels\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/21909-0-16-TouhouTorpedo-s-Modular-Multiwheels-%28Tosh-s-Cart-Mod-powered%29?highlight=Omniwheels\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/GftOIdg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GftOIdg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GftOIdg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/hJLg2X3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hJLg2X3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hJLg2X3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/zoTkyc7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zoTkyc7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zoTkyc7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sadron","CreatedById":61671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T05:43:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose are certainly interesting, and that makes a good potential opportunity for making my base.
