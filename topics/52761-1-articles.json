My personal favorite. So you are saying that you would rather take a slightly laggy game with regular updates (every 2-3 months) that is mostly stable, has a strong mod community, and throw it all out the window. Make all the modders work on top of Squads current work totally useless, and have the next update be 2-3 years do to the fact that pretty much everything would need to be coded and unit tested and debugged. Oh and everyone would have to buy the game again and the cost is now 50-60 dollars because the cost of the new license is so astronomically high it eats up any and resources the team currently has. All the while alienating the modders who now need to pay out to get the API for the new engine so their mods work...Yes this sounds like a fabulous idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion *bows to softweir* The description of the children was poignant and perfect.
