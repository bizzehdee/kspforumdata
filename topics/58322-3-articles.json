An example of what I\u0027m talking about is how I spent nearly 5 hours on tuning the CIWS code. Tweaking and reloading gets really tedious at times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example is during development you get excited about one part of the project and spend a lot of time getting it right, then you later realize that there are 5 other things that need to be done and perhaps one of those will impact something you\u0027ve already worked out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can say the basic mechanics, sounds and fx are in. I can re-vamp those later once I get time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting some persistent data saved and reloaded is the next issue, and a bit of a roadblock at the moment, but if I can\u0027t get them to work the way I want I\u0027ll put it on the future to-do list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the comments everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"epicfacecanada","CreatedById":100875,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T14:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eeven though it isn\u0027t released could I somehow download what you have so far\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
