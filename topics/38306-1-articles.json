I sent it to Jool, and I plan on visiting all of the moons. At once. Forbin has six ion/RCS powered probes, each with an array of scientific equipment, as well as a manned lander. The plan is to send a probe to each moon, and one in orbit around Jool, then I\u0027ll pick a moon I like, and land there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/a0AQYF9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022a0AQYF9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy LV is an array of SRBs and asparagus mainsails, with an orbital skipper engine. This launch stage will put Forbin into a 200km orbit with ease. The planetary transfer stage is a bunch of glitched together NERVA engines and a few big tanks. The CM is a cupola, because they look awesome. Descent stage is pretty standard, and the probes are clustered above the CM. each has a pair of Gigantor solar sails attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8KT3P3K.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228KT3P3K.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fkfQdHQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fkfQdHQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EtW82VP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EtW82VP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s even got a shielded docking port in case you want to refuel the orbiter tank in orbit and shoot for Eeloo.
