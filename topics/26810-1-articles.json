Some probelms completely violate common sense (Look, I really, really do not need 600 apples.), while others, are just....plain and boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw this rocketry probelm in a math test, and I got it wrong, after I factored in things like drag and wind and gravity. What the heck? Also, what really ticks me off is that all the textbooks teach by examples, which means if there is even a slight change in the probelm format, I\u0027m pretty well screwed. And, its hard for me to learn that way, as I prefer much more straightforward things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T21:46:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe reason most people hate math is because schools really suck at teaching it. in high school math was this 1-dimensional abomination where you did a hundred identical problems every day for weeks at a time, and they only got as far as basic geometry and algebra. in the decade after high school, i ended up teaching myself advanced geometry, trig, linear algebra, calculus, etc, on my own, with very little effort. why? well because i kinda had some computer science early on, and it kinda got me into game design as a hobby (starting with simple 2d classic game clones to eventually 3d game engines). i wasnt trying to solve a page full of arbitrary numbers but instead actual problems, like how to draw a line in a framebuffer and how to collision detect a polygon with a ray.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emath education is too procedure oriented. they show you the procedure and then give you problems ad nauseum until you get really fast at it. this might have been a good way of doing things prior to the 80s and 90s where calculators became dirt cheap. everyone needed to be able to work with money, so you needed your basic operations down, and the construction, automotive and food service industries needed you to be able to operate on fractions, but in this day and age where everybody practically keeps a computer on their person at all times it doesnt make any sense at all. a boss isnt going to hound you for using a calculator to solve a problem like a math teacher wood because they know it will save time and increase profits. math education should focus more on solving actual, practical, problems instead of the monotonous grind it is today (i dont really think its changed that much since i graduated highschool in 2000).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T21:56:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it seems to me your problem is not math but math class \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E How old are you by the way and what are you doing in math class atm?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took me years at university to get, that math itself is interesting.
