So with me still learning about space planes, I went through 3 designs before I developed a pretty neat SSTO that I am satisfied with. Below 500m it\u0027s pretty much a jet fighter, even without the advanced reaction wheel on. I used a rapier for this design, but in the future I might swap it with two radial 48-7s engines and a turbojet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/E8T1h\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
