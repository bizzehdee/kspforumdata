So with me still learning about space planes, I went through 3 designs before I developed a pretty neat SSTO that I am satisfied with. Below 500m it\u0027s pretty much a jet fighter, even without the advanced reaction wheel on. I used a rapier for this design, but in the future I might swap it with two radial 48-7s engines and a turbojet.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Looks good, although I think the canards at the front are pretty ugly... getting rid of those would improve the aesthetics a lot."},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T14:05:01Z","Content":"Well congratulations for not giving up.
