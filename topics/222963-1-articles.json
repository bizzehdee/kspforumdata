Where are all the vessels?! There may be a 50% failure rate because kerbals, but that still leaves a lot of potentially functional vessels out in space you have explored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EThe NPC ship idea\u003C/span\u003E could be that after entering orbit around a body and returning back to Kerbin, there is a small chance when exploring that body again, a vessel will spawn in orbit within a few thousand km of the active vessel. They would be owned by the different companies from the contract system (the ones that seem to always get kerbals stuck in space). The vessels would be from a library of vessels like the repair contracts are.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere would need to be things in place to prevent the player from controlling them, maybe like just outright locking controls. And that there would be reputation penalties for significantly altering their trajectory or damaging them (likely doable). Basically, you can either track in tracking station, or intercept it and load it that way before tracking somehow, then it would despawn either if you havent chosen to track it, or if you have chosen to stop tracking it just like asteroids in the tracking station\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis would scale with how much you explored the area, like.. at first you would see just simple little rockets similar to your early game stuff, then later on it would be a variety of space stations. You might be able to borrow some fuel out of a fuel depot if it is possible.\u00A0they would keep their names after undocking with the naming priority stuff and will despawn if you let them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure how doable NPC ships would be, but would be a neat addition..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps there could be contracts for refueling some vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003Ethe bigger wrecks idea?\u003C/span\u003E Simply have the game choose from a library of vessels, destroy a non-crew part, spawn a kerbal in a part that can hold crew\u00A0 (and make sure the kerbal IS in the part that is able to be spawned in). Doing this instead of just spawning a single crew capsule part with one kerbal inside would add a bit of variety.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor these ideas, the game should check and make sure the vessels being spawned in are using only unlocked parts, and maybe scale with how much you have explored an area...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust some ideas! let me know if these already exist!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-13T14:10:22Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2024 02:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 13\u0022\u003EJanuary 13\u003C/time\u003E by JcoolTheShipbuilder\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
