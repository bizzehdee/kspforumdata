Now I\u0027ve revived the project again and I wonder if there would be any interest in this. It\u0027s basically supposed to be a pack including 3 different rockets, a SLV (Small Launch Vehicle) for small payloads to LKO or MKO (\u0026gt;120km and \u0026lt; 2868km), a MLV (Medium Launch Vehicle) and a BLV (Big Launch Vehicle). They each are not supposed to be really stockalike (this is why I didn\u0027t want to integrate it into SELV), but with more realistic models but custom textures. This is the SLV, based on ESAs Vega rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aKpuurr.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aKpuurr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223MkO8qz.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3MkO8qz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 solid stages and one small liquid fuel upper stage for final orbital insertion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder now if there are enough people now offering interest in this for me to continue on it and eventually release it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T20:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, offering my two cents - if it\u0027s not intended for use with RO, I would prefer it to be stockalike. Simply put, there are two main art styles for KSP. Realistic, and stock. Realistic obviously being the style preferred for Realism Overhaul, while Stockalike is used for, well, everything else. Unless you\u0027re planning on doing a total conversion for the game, then making it fit into the art style of the intended playstyle is probably a good move. Again, that\u0027s just my two cents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T22:12:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarn.
