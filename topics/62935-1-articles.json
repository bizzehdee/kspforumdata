I was able to clip camera trough the ship, so i could see (and click) internal fuel tanks. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thanks to this great scientific breaktrough (kind of) I was able to launch my first SSTO plane to Mun (not an easy thing, i spent few hours to learn how to make orbital rendezvous with my refueling station). Well, it did not landed (i have no equipment on board for vertical landing, nor enough oxydizer to make such fuel-consuming and dangerous manouver with main engine), just did a very low pass at about 1000 m above ground level. But since I had good fuel reserve, I decided to try slingshot manouver to Minmus orbit. It worked quite well, I was also able to establish nice, round orbit around this moon (good exercise for future operations). After few circles I decided it\u0027s abut time to return home (It was already \u002B10 days expedition and my ship was running on fumes). Return took me only about 24 hours so you can imagine the speed at periapsis. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I thought i can slow down just like that, after single pass at 60.000 meters... Silly me. Speed was close to 3.500 m/s, so even after emptying all my monopropelant tanks (no more oxidizer at this point) ship went trough upper atmosphere like a hot knife trough butter. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I did 3 full circles around Kerbin before I was able to slow down enough, reduce my enormous apoapsis and make a proper reentry. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But of course, my base was at the wrong side of planet, as usual. It was obvious, that even with 200 l of liquid fuel i will not be able to reach it. So, I\u0027ve landed at some random plot of land and that was it.
