I picked up the Clone Wars core set a year or two ago, and I basically botched it. Haven\u0027t touched it much since, but I have decided to try again. I have a LAAT L/E gunship and some ARC Troopers, along with a pretty well-painted Captain Rex. I saw that they had a 501st set, and I am hoping for a loved one to give me one for Christmas. Anyways, I wanted to try to redo my already sealed LAAT L/E by taking the sealant and paint off and disassembling it. Hopefully I didn\u0027t use model glue, but if I did, does anyone know how you could take it off? (I do know that it melts the glue and stuff)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReplies would be nice!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-11-25T05:19:39Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2023 05:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Nov 25\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by AstroWolfie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
