TweakScale lets you fill a lot of gaps that currently exist - for example, the first aerodynamics tier has those delta wings. Well, they\u0027re kind of small to the point of looking really silly. Use TweakScale to scale them up to 150% (which you have to manually add to the settings because it goes 100% -\u0026gt; 200%, which is too big) and you have a normal-sized wing on a normal-sized aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the problem with the current mod is that TweakScale is extremely cheaty.

I don\u0027t like the idea of scaling engines, solar panels, science equipment, etc. I\u0027m not sure about tanks, I mean we do have enough of them for every size. What is lacking is structural and aerodynamic components, have scale on the girders, octagonal struts, and structural planes would be incredibly useful at keeping station part count down. Being able to scale the Mk2 wings would give us the Mk3 wings we have been asking for, since 1.0 didn\u0027t add what we really wanted. Make sure that scaleable parts can have a separate tech tree unlock for EACH scale on a per-part basis and you have a winner, then you can eliminate the 3 entries for fairing bases, 3 entries for heat shields, etc. You just have one part called \u0022Heat Shield\u0022 and that part scales up or down.
