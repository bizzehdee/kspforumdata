I was always wondering if they should be used in EVE\u0027s atmosphere, because there You move kinda slowly. And I wanted to find out if You can reach high enough speed on EVE to see nose cone effect.\n\nSo I did this test. I put 4 similar rockets on EVE. Everything is the same. Except nose cones.\n\n![JT9auXe.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JT9auXe.jpg)\n\n![TJ86JNq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TJ86JNq.jpg)\n\n![vOSfW9r.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vOSfW9r.jpg)\n\nThe Quick answer is YES. Nose cone effect kicks in at about 100 m/s (at 1500m in this example). This effect is more noticable in video. I leave a link.\n\nAlso, I want to ask... Someone told me that i CAN\u0027T put any video links in this forum topic (general KSP Discusions). Is it true? Or can I? And... should I? Do You want to see similar stuff?

However, they can get quite heavy, which would be an even bigger problem on eve than on kerbin. You can see how it can\u0027t keep up in the beginning, before the speeds are enough to make aerodynamics matter. That\u0027s because of the extra weight. You can also see is the very end that the fairing one eventually caught up (after running out of fuel and tipping over)."},{"CreatedByName":"bos","CreatedById":147353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T15:17:49Z","Content":"I have noticed that if you deploy the fairing, much of the mass is shed but the drag \u0026 stack occlusion remain (only things inside the fairing are now exposed to drag).
