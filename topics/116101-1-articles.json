I was always wondering if they should be used in EVE\u0027s atmosphere, because there You move kinda slowly. And I wanted to find out if You can reach high enough speed on EVE to see nose cone effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I did this test. I put 4 similar rockets on EVE. Everything is the same.
