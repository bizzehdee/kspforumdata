If you release everything to too large an audience immediately, before it\u0027s tested, then you get the same exact errors being reported again and again and again, clogging up the issue tracking list. The big problems that everyone runs into get reported by everyone. Instead you first release to a small population, discover the big problems that are so common everyone hits them, fix those problems, and then for round two you release to a larger population to find the slightly less common bugs, then for round three a much larger population, and so on.\u003Cp\u003EEven open source projects stored on public sites like github, that theoretically have every little change released to everyone in the public at once, still tend to flag the code as \u0022developers only for now\u0022 and then promote it to \u0022beta for testers\u0022 and only after a while do they promote it to \u0022ready for the public now\u0022. You can access the newest code at any time but are warned in a big way that a lot of it doesn\u0027t work yet and unless you\u0027re trying to become part of the development process by making bug reports and participating in the QA of it, you should still stay away. (That if you\u0027re just trying to use it as an external end-user, it\u0027s not ready for that yet.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the \u0022Minecraft snapshot\u0022 system, it seems to work fairly well.

Now will you just let it rest for once and stop derailing the thread?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d like to see is some variance in solar system generation so it\u0027s not identical every time, to aid in replay value of the game. The best way to do it is to use procedural generation *that starts from a seed that can be selected from something outside the algorithm\u0027s control, like the system clock, thus making the result effectively as random as a computer is capable of and not pre-determined*. And furthermore I\u0027d like people to stop trying to derail that suggestion by disingenuously *pretending* they don\u0027t know exactly what that means just so they can have a pointless argument over nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD\u0027s idea that it\u0027s a bad thing for different players to end up with different solar systems is simply not something I agree with. This is primarily a single-player game and having the exact same solar system every time means eventually you\u0027ve explored everywhere and done everything already. And having an algorithm with the capacity for random seeds does not have to imply that it\u0027s mandatory for every player to play with such a random seed start. You can have the game default to using the same universal seeds for all players, and make picking a different seed from the default be an option. That leaves it up to the player whether they want to share the same experience as everyone else or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore you don\u0027t need to randomize absolutely everything to get some variety. You can bias the algorithm to make it more likely to end up with gas giants farther out, small solid planets further in, and make it unlikely to get two planets at the same orbit, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-15T21:42:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2014 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neamerjell","CreatedById":86054,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T05:31:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERealism vs. Simple game play: Why not make a setting with a slider that goes from easy simple mechanics to \u0022any more real, and you\u0027d need NASA\u0027s permission to run it\u0022? Okay, maybe not that real, but you get the idea. So simple could be like what the stock game is now with possibly Mechjeb integrated into it, and no engine overheating. The next level up could add additional aerodynamic effects, temperature effects like engine overheating and reentry effects, and maybe remove some of the Mechjeb functionality, like ascent guidance. The next level could be hard core, adding things like weather (when it gets implemented) so you have to compensate for wind, air pressure and temperature, meteorite impacts (randomly generated), etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T03:23:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022neamerjell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022neamerjell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERealism vs. Simple game play: Why not make a setting with a slider that goes from easy simple mechanics to \u0022any more real, and you\u0027d need NASA\u0027s permission to run it\u0022? \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dislike the idea of making it be a slider. Individual checkboxes per feature? sure. A slider? no. This is because in every game I\u0027ve ever played with a difficulty slider that turns options on and off it\u0027s always been the case that the options I want on don\u0027t fit with how the game makers designed the slider settings. For example, in Fallout New Vegas, I wanted a mode that was as hardcore for ME as possible, but not hardcore for the dumb NPC followers who kept choosing to kill themselves through no fault of my own because the AI made them dumb as rocks. \u0022I\u0027m an NPC. The game doesn\u0027t allow me to take anti-venom doses. Oh look its a few stinging insects in the distance that we\u0027re trying to skirt around. I\u0027m going to run directly toward that nest of giant stinging insects all by myself even though I was told to stay put. Oh look, I died from venom, how did that happen? Now all the quests involving me have failed because I\u0027m dead.\u0022 So in that game I\u0027d have liked to cherry pick which realism options I wanted (basically everything except dead NPC\u0027s stay dead - which kills plot lines when the AI runs at poison insects, or walks off a cliff). But the slider didn\u0027t have that as an option. Once I added the need to deal with hunger, thirst, and rest, for myself, I was also activating the perma-death for NPCs which I didn\u0027t want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifficulty sliders almost always end up making options into \u0027package deals\u0027 in which I don\u0027t care for how things have been packaged together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
