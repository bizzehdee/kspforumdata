I have stumbled across a issue with my last few rockets. The center of mass is right in the middle of my ship as you can see in the screen shot. It always has a tilt and I wouldn\u0027t be asking this if it didn\u0027t do the same with my other last few rockets. Can you please give me a suggestion on why this is happening and how to fix it?\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3j40CkV.png\u0022 alt=\u00223j40CkV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T06:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour ship is so tall that even the smallest vibration can start tilting it.

Drag affects each part individually without regard to how you would expect air to flow; it\u0027s as if each part was individually flying through the air on its own. The rocket has all parts with 0.2 drag, so for KSP drag purposes it may as well be a perfect sphere. The caps work by having lower drag per unit mass, so the caps feel less acceleration due to drag than do other parts, which causes a torque. But the force isn\u0027t big (the caps are probably 1% of the mass of your rocket) so they don\u0027t have much effect at straightening out your flight -- as evidenced by the fact that people could fly rockets with caps in previous versions even though those caps had high drag. Basically, they\u0027re just cosmetic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerospikes used to have low drag also, and those have mass, so they caused problems: they really wanted to be flying ahead of your rocket, even if you would normally put them on the bottom. Useful as retrorockets on Eve though, for that very reason; this is no longer the case in 0.22 (sadly). SRBs have high drag, so if as most people do you put them on the bottom, they help you lift off straight. But really, the way to affect drag is to put winglets on your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T15:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWiglets help, (AV-R8\u0027s if you have them) I would put them on each stage, if you have launch stabilizers those help too.
