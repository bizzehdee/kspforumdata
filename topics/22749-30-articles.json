I am using the build 2.0.8b56 of MechJeb which is newer than the 2.0.8 download they link to and has a few bugs ironed out form the original 2.0.8 release. There\u0027s a smaller link below in the 2.0.8 thread that points to \u0027Get Latest Builds\u0027 or similar, try going there. BACKUP everything before you try a dev. build, they aren\u0027t guaranteed to be stable.

If you leave it with even a tiny amount of rotation it can spin out of control and break up. I did it by extending the solar panels (of all things) then when I switched back after de-orbiting my ascent stage fro Ares I I caught it before it was too late and it was spinning wildly. I used MechJeb\u0027s Smart A.S.S. to klill the rotation and left it several time s after that and it was fine. It may be a good suggestion to try letting the ASAS settle the Orion before leaving it. I have no tired to contrast whether leaving ASAS on or leaving ASAS off changes the likely-hood of a spin and breakup, I guess it remains to be seen...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BobCat","CreatedById":22422,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T19:56:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMmm... i love more historic craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://gyazo.com/4ce0647443e54d7d72d983e62b6e324f.png\u0022 alt=\u00224ce0647443e54d7d72d983e62b6e324f.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://gyazo.com/e821c3f5137b5c3b186d03ab405b32bf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e821c3f5137b5c3b186d03ab405b32bf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"finkmac","CreatedById":57413,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T20:10:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat LK \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E looks better\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6Not sure what it is about the LK that appeals to me\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BobCat","CreatedById":22422,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T20:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall Altair test \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/PfJfIcpUQC4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T20:34:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022finkmac\u0022 data-cite=\u0022finkmac\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat LK \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E looks better\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6Not sure what it is about the LK that appeals to me\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s that the LK makes Altair look positively flimsy by comparison, at least to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"godzilla7","CreatedById":54541,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T20:48:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBobcat after altair maybe you could make the mars direct crew return vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
