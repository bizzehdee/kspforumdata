There are two generic white coats used for splaceplane or rocket parts, and there are at least *five* different shades of gray used for trim (Mk1, Mk2, Mk3, Spaceplane, Airliner, etc...). This really bugs me when building intricate craft so I decided to fix this with FireSpitters texture switch plugin (FSTextureSwitch2) to add a widget to swap between textures and trim colors, as well as fix a number couple of misaligned textures and add a few aesthetic changes along the way. I hope they suit your fancy ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nThis mod is dependent on the [Firespitter](http://snjo.github.io/) *plugin* maintained by [@RoverDude](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/) and [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-1-0-x-Module-Manager-2-6-3-%28May-4%29-Bonsai-Trimming-Kit-Edition) maintained by [@sarbian](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57146-sarbian/).
