I think it\u0027s a good location, being very close to launch site (advantageous b/c rocket most likely will only go straight up into space, as it does not have to go into orbit), having plenty of space for landing, and being empty since the 60\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbart\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbart\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem with Blue Origin is that you can\u0027t really discuss the way the rocket looks.
