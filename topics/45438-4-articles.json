Also a fair amount of thrust: if you\u0027re coming in directly from Kerbin, there\u0027s going to be quite a large difference in your velocity when you enter its SOI (which is rather surprisingly large if the wiki is to believed).

Braking at Eeloo is much easier because your orbit is already at one of its slowest points, the apoapsis; Moho is the opposite because you\u0027re intercepting near your periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile they\u0027re both undoubtedly hard, Moho takes the crown.

It taught me how to do a proper rendezvous and docking. I watched Scott Manley do it countless times, even watched the tutorials and nothing helped. I got mechjeb, because I saw Scott Manley using it for something, and guess what? It was a better teacher than any advice or video ever was. MechJeb is a valuable asset in this game, and considering that they \u0026lt;Squad\u0026gt; have NO INTENTION of giving us an auto-pilot, it very well may become the go to addition for such a glaring vacancy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESource: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Planned_features\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Planned_features\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom of page reads:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOT HAPPENING:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteam Achievements\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAUTOPILOT SYSTEMS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeapons or Military Features\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlien Civilizations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETerraforming\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealistically Sized Celestial Bodies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConversion To A Different Game Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, also, those who think Autopilot is cheating scare me, and I hope none are actual real world pilots, because, they use Autopilot for everything, including landing sometimes \u0026lt;yes, autopilot can land in real world\u0026gt;, as does NASA... just saying.
