I want to make a reusable space program like Scott Manley\u0027s but my small problem is even using his launcher I\u0027m having a hard time getting to orbit. I was wondering if anyone had a good video of how to do it or like instructions or something. It\u0027s really frustrating but also very cool! Also when I set myself a challenge it really bothers me when I can\u0027t do it haha. Any help of any kind would be a massive help!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mokmo","CreatedById":62363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T19:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe launcher with all the turbofan engines?

I do the whole puffing of the engines to maintain 100m/s as well. Gravity turn all that good nonsense. I just can\u0027t get seem to get it into orbit.

I\u0027ve seen in some episodes he was turning it on and off when he was carrying a heavy load, so it might just be for higher atmo/vacuum flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from this, I\u0027d need to check one of his videos where he uses that ship again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malaugrym","CreatedById":57689,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T23:01:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess you aren\u0027t Manley enough?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry, I couldn\u0027t resist \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T23:14:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHe also only uses a single intake per engine so shuts of the jets at 20km.
