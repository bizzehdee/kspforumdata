Things happened way too quickly for there to be a good photo op, but Bill had a concern about low fuel and was trying for a most efficient launch into polar orbit and was not perfectly careful about where he was going. The craft had four small tanks and engines around at Mk 1 lander can core with a science package on top and legs attached to the tanks. A great wide base, but at about 160m/s he clipped on tank leg and engine clean off on the crater rim and the remaining craft was spinning badly (engines were off at the time waiting for the top of the arc for an orbital burn). Bill immediately opted for EVA and managed to slow down and land safely from that speed with nearly 2 units of EVA fuel left.

Here\u0027s a screenshot of the basic lander design I was using in that career, unfortunately not of the lander I\u0027m specifically talking about, but it is the central \u0027core\u0027 of the lander that was used (it\u0027s missing the clamp o-tron, and additional ascent engines for EVE)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S9UXo0k.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S9UXo0k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem was something about the descent/landing/ascent from EVE broke something in the lander supports, and once out of EVE atmosphere any thrust over 35-40% would start the \u0027legs\u0027 gyroing around, actually they started gyroing at anything above 10-20%, but could stay on course until 35-40%. So Jeb took this crippled lander, and managed to get it back to Kerbin and landed it at the north pole. When it landed, only one of the four legs was still at a right angle to the central stack, one was twisted about 30% off center, and the other two were pushed up about 15%. Turns out I had not noticed that I had completely lost the struts on those 3 legs, and only the struts from the central stack to the 4th leg were intact. An examination of the mission log showed that jetisoning the Eve ascent packages after transfering the last of their fuel once I had reached the resupply tanks in orbit had somehow destroyed those missing struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second awesome moment I had was landing at a 45 degree angle as you can see in this picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p2ySqg7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022p2ySqg7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s my firm belief from Jeb\u0027s normal lack of response, aside from being happy/excited, to all forms of \u0027exciting\u0027 incidents that there is something not right with him. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T00:43:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI landed a spaceplane on the KSC runway.
