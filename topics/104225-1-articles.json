We know that the popular mod, FAR, more realistically models a real-life atmosphere. When playing with FAR installed it takes less delta-v to get to orbit on all the bodies with atmosphere -- Kerbin, Eve, and Laythe included (probably Jool too, but not the Sun). Since Squad is also going for realism with their new aero, it could be reasonable to assume that it would take less delta-v to get to orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuuuut Squad has also stated that they\u0027re going to rebalance the stats on all their engines to counterbalance it, and keep the challenge of getting to LKO.

Take a LV-T45 for instance... it\u0027s Isp at 5 atm would be only 120 s. However, those engines are configured for use on Kerbin, not Eve. By having special purpose, low expansion ratio engines designed specifically for Eve, a respectable Isp could still be achieved, perhaps only 5-10% lower than the sea level performance of current engines. Of course, such an engine would have very poor vacuum performance. For example, an engine designed for Eve might have an Isp of 270 s at 5 atm, but it\u0027s vacuum Isp would barely be any better, say 280 s. These engines would only be used during the early stages of ascent.
