I\u0027ve landed my return rocket, empty of fuel, along with mining equipment to refill the tanks. Unfortunately, only one of my gigantors survived the landing. Oops. So I don\u0027t have enough power to run my mining rig continuously, even during daytime. I figured this wouldn\u0027t be a problem. It might take a long time to fill the tanks, but I\u0027ll just time warp it. Unfortunately, however, the drill shuts down when power is depleted, but does not automatically turn back on. So managing the mining will involve sitting at the ship, turning the drill back on, over, and over, and over. Sounds tedious. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips for walk away mining? So far the only options I\u0027ve thought of are not great:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Cheat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Send a rover with a bunch of gigantors and a klaw to give the ship a power boost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENick\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T17:33:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, well... if you can generate fuel faster than you consume it, you could fire up a booster on very low thrust and use it like a fuel cell. This would be a brilliant engineering solution, but I suspect it will cost you more fuel than you gain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T17:36:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWarp to nearly max (x1000, maybe x10000).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T01:04:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027ve pretty much answered your question.
