Smart parts are what is going to control the functionality of these things once they detach. The boosters will auto-detach when their fuel runs out, then auto-arm the chute charges. When they hit the right height the drogues will pop, then those detach at a certain height and pull out the main chutes which will then fully deploy at a set height. Then about 100m off the ground the gear open and 3-5m off the ground the retros fire. It all worked out great when I tested it with stock parts, so I\u0027m just making my own art now and integrating it all. The chutes brought the booster down to about 13m/s and the retro firing slowed it to right around 2-3m/s for a soft gear landing.\u003Cp\u003EI might have to take a break from this for a few weeks, though. I lost my job at Turn10 a few weeks ago (my contract ended) so I\u0027ve been unemployed since. I was contacted by Autodesk, recently, to help with a 3dsmax demo scene, which is supposed to be about 4 weeks of work. I\u0027ll let you all know if that contract gets signed or not.
