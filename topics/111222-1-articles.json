Updates to this thread will come as I make progress on things. If I think to do it, I\u0027ll occasionally stream work on [my twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/orbitusii) after announcing it here and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OrbitusII).\n\nCurrent Plan:\n\n*(Copied from my post in the release thread)*\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Models:\n\u003E \n\u003E Since Sauron\u0027s original concept rockets were inspired by Russian rocketry, I figured I\u0027d do the same and grabbed a bunch of Soyuz photos and diagrams. There\u0027s also a picture of the Falcon 9 (although it lacks greebles, which is contrary to the direction I want to go) and several images of rocket exhaust since I\u0027ll be doing custom effects and want them to be more accurate than the Stock ones.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/HFKcX)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Functionality:\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve been toying with plans for the parts since I am strongly leaning towards making this pack work both parallel to Stock and as an outright replacement. What that means (in theory) is you can roll with these AND Stock or remove the Stock parts altogether and still have a fully-functional rocketry program.\n\u003E \n\u003E - **Engines**\n\u003E - Liquid Fuel will stay the same and serve as the base fuel for all rocket engines\n\u003E - Oxidizer will be split into two resources: Oxidizer and Hy-Ox (short for Hypergolic Oxidizer)\n\u003E - *LFO is less efficient but more powerful than LFHO*\n\u003E - *LFHO will serve primarily in orbital engines while LFO is used in lifters*\n\u003E - Engines will therefore be split into two categories: standard and hypergolic\n\u003E - *Standard engines will use regular LFO, but have a limited throttle and cannot be shutdown*\n\u003E - *Hypergolic engines will behave like engines currently do with unlimited throttle and shutdown/restart capabilities, but will use the LFHO mix instead*\n\u003E - Monoprop engines will also become more significant. I like how the Orange\u0027s engines work so there\u0027ll be more of those, exclusively for orbital use\n\u003E - **Fuel tanks** will be split into Liquid Fuel, Oxidizer, and Hy-Ox sections\n\u003E - **Part Sizes** will become DX, DY, DZ, and DW (analogous, but not necessarily equal to, the Stock 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 3.75m standards)\n\u003E - **Solar Panels** will be available in two versions upon completion: stock-balanced and nerfed (since I feel the stock ones are overpowered for the amount of electric charge the average vessel uses)\n\u003E - **Crew Parts** will follow the style of the fuel tanks and Sauron\u0027s concepts with some aspects drawn from Russian space stations\n\u003E - **Aero Parts** will not be a part of this pack. Since the focus here is *rocketry,* they\u0027re a bit out of the scope of this mod\n\u003E - Disclaimer:\n\u003E \n\u003E I may reconsider this decision in the future, but for now there\u0027s no aero parts planned\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m pretty confident in the new sizes and some significant inline Monoprop engines. As for Hy-Ox, well... That\u0027ll require some testing if I decide to go that route. Let me know what you think!\n\nCurrent Progress: *(as of Thursday May 29, 2015)*\n\nA four-nozzle engine setup like the one seen in the images of the Soyuz rocket\u0027s upper stage.\n\n![23nEI4X.png](http://i.imgur.com/23nEI4X.png)\n\nThree of the nozzles are missing because the template (the one that is present) isn\u0027t yet complete. Most of the detail work (except that on the nozzles) is done, and soon I\u0027ll get to work on UV mapping and texturing. The equivalent section on the Soyuz is orange, but I might take some liberties and keep it a neutral gray for now. A Sketchfab preview of the model will come when I start UV mapping.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T06:29:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 06:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OrbitusII**"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitusII","CreatedById":57305,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T20:49:27Z","Content":"Got the engine body unwrapped and did a quick AO bake to see how it looks.\n\n![Nv0GgmD.png](http://i.imgur.com/Nv0GgmD.png)\n\nNozzles still need an unwrap but are done with assembly."},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitusII","CreatedById":57305,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T01:17:52Z","Content":"Two update photos for today:\n\n**#1:** Completed UV unwrap and AO bake\n\n![HY31YI8.png](http://i.imgur.com/HY31YI8.png)\n\nThis looks really good, I like how the AO turned out.\n\n**#2:** Started texture work\n\n![QI1eXNG.png](http://i.imgur.com/QI1eXNG.png)\n\nCompared to the reference photos the engine bells are quite dark; I\u0027ll probably lighten them up.
