This suggestion is mostly based on the Figaro GPS mod, which added GPS parts and functionality, but it hasn\u2019t been updated for a long time. Personally I would like Squad to implement this in game, but if other modders are interested it would be greatly appreciated. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14pt;\u0022\u003EWhat are your opinions and/or suggestions on this idea?

I think that in order for this to work in the game, the game would have to not show or tell you your exact positions in the first place. From the Tracking Station or even just map view, you can find your exact coordinates and see where you are in relation to everything even better than human GPS systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T01:25:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust because Figaro KerbalGPS has not had a recent update, doesnt mean it doesnt work...it definately worx in all 1.0.x versions, including 1.0.5... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as to GPS in KSP, sadly, there doesnt seem to be much interest in it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-10T01:51:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2016 01:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Delta_8930","CreatedById":152441,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T13:55:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know, but it would still be cool to have a GPS constellation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LorenLuke","CreatedById":9830,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T16:30:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA part that kind of works like the thermometer and barometer (no science though) which displays GPS coordinates when you turn it on would be nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StarManta","CreatedById":57805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T16:33:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you get upgrades to the Tracking Station not by just spending money on them, but by getting X number of GPS satellites in orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MagicFireCaster","CreatedById":149926,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T01:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222450886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133874\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457627424\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00229830\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LorenLuke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, LorenLuke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA part that kind of works like the thermometer and barometer (no science though) which displays GPS coordinates when you turn it on would be nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact there is a\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Surface_Scanning_Module\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESurface Scanning Module\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0that shows you your coordinates and the ore in the surface like the\u00A0thermometer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
