I will put it into my private gallery, certainly, Mr.President.\u0022, thanked the Emperor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh certainly, your excellency. I am very thankful. Let us continue with the banquet! The Medwedian Cheese is already on it\u0027s way!\u0022, answered the President as two men rolled a giant ball of cheese into the room, after which one of them raised a large sword and sliced the cheese into more manageable pieces to be picked up by the cooks. Several minutes later, several men in dark robes, fedora hats and with dark sunglasses entered the room and picked up the statue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I am heavily worried about this activity;\u0022, said the President to the commander of his lifeguard. \u0022Those people might be performing a masquerade and just might be robbers!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I am ordering my people to watch them closely;\u0022 answered the commander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alpha-Alpha, i see the people carrying the statue into an odd direction.

YOU ARE MURDERING MY SECURITY SERVICE!\u0022 yelled the emperor. \u0022Any Medwedian entering our country will be counted as an act of war.\u0022 The President heard when he and his commander started running into the direction of the port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022All life guard soldiers in!
