Aside from making the game \u0022feel\u0022 like a different game, my idea why mods exist is a player felt that a certain feature has been left out of a game, and thus he/she made that mod to augment a certain necessary function, to make it more convenient for a player to use such a function within the game. The recent changes/enhancements to the nav ball is a good example of what I mean. I\u0027ve always felt that the nav ball should have been like this since the very early versions, and I\u0027m very happy with the recent enhancements to it. I believe that if this wasn\u0027t implemented as a standard feature, someone would eventually make a mod that would feature functionality similar to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, I\u0027ve always wondered why some things that I felt were integral to KSP gameplay, are still only available as mods or an external \u0022app\u0022.

So in the early stages of the game, say, before you reach Duna or Eve (using \u0022standard\u0022 difficulty), you\u0027d be forced to figure out ejection ejection angles purely on your own. But later, once you get more science in, you can unlock parts that will allow you access to an internal, integrated ejection angle or launch window planner, in the same function and style as the navball or map view. I believe this will significantly improve playability, esp. when preventing player from having to rely on external apps to help with ejection planning and navigation chores.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-09T00:38:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2014 12:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by rodion_herrera\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T13:58:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am fine with the maneuver nodes tbh.

I suspect from reading around here that a large fraction of the player base rarely if ever leaves Kerbin\u0027s SoI, and I think part of the reason why is the lack of planning tools. Even Maxmaps asked for a phase angle when doing a Duna transfer in the Squadcast before last.
