In my opinion that may make it a viable approach to reward actually flying planes and driving rovers, which currently have no in-game purpose. Thus some time ago I made this plugin, which implements a new part module that checks a number of conditions on the current velocity, and gradually generates science if appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I have no skill or talent in any kind of graphics design, there are no parts; instead I just use Module Manager to add the module to manned pods, EVA seats and for good measure all parts that use the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46365-0-23-Hullcam-VDS-Added-new-cameras-by-Rubber-Ducky-Updated-30-Dec\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHull Camera\u003C/a\u003E module.

I tested this with Yargnit\u0027s tree however, so it may be too much science for stock tree. The plane must be in flight within 10 degrees of level, at subsonic speeds near ground, or lower supersonic at altitude. The science rate is different for Kerbin compared to other planets, so it hopefully does not produce an insane amount of points if you get a plane to somewhere else with atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cem\u003EGround Survey\u003C/em\u003E: Added to EVA seats and generates science when driving around at normal rover speeds. Doesn\u0027t handle Kerbin specially, so is rather useless there. The science is stored directly in the seated kerbal.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo use, activate the experiment via the right click menu. When conditions are right it will consume electric power and store science reports in the same part. Unlike some other mods, it immediately creates the report when entering a biome, but initially it contains zero data and thus science. Over time more data is added, until the full size is reached. The baseValue of the experiment definition thus specifies how much data can be stored before you have to recover or transmit to collect more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the transmit efficiency is controlled by the module generating the report, and not the experiment, the values in modules added to hullcam parts are changed so that they generate science slower, but it can be transmitted better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETechnical details:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe module requires the part to also contain either a stock ModuleScienceContainer or a KerbalSeat with a kerbal in it, because otherwise it won\u0027t have anywhere to store the science data. The intent was to keep it as simple as possible, and using the stock module to keep reports in helps with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManned pods are detected by the MM config by the presense of the container module: all stock manned ones have it, and unmanned ones don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFiles:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/angavrilov/ksp-surface-survey/releases/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownloads and source at GitHub\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELicense: GPL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncludes the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-Module-Manager-1-5-6-%28Jan-6%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EModule Manager\u003C/a\u003E dll, and a bit of code based on GPL code in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54774-0-22-Station-Science-%28third-alpha-Zoology-Bay-added%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStation Science\u003C/a\u003E.
