This is a megathread for posting pictures of your space stations and pictures of their module-by-module construction. So, in short, preferably post a picture of each module or section being docked (You can post launch pictures, orbit pictures, approach pictures, and final dock pictures.) If you dont have any pictures of your space station being built, just post a picture(s) of the station. List what its name is, what its primary function(s) is, how much crew space, how many crew members, and why you built it. You can also post video(s) of the station construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be posting a module by module picture contruction gallery of my newest space station, the \u0022Kosmos\u0022 Kerbin-International Space Station. It\u0027s basically just a more or less replica of the real ISS kerbal-style. This is to show how I made it. It\u0027s also part of a best with my freind as to who could build the larger space station with a design scheme. We have the exact same mods on. If anyone wants it I can post alist of the mods I used to build it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: Your space station does not have to be stock.
