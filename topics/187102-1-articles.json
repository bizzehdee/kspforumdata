Sorry, but actually landing a craft on the Mun is supposed to be harder than it is in the tutorial. The tutorial is just supposed to show you the basic technique that you should use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, when actually landing on the Mun, you have to do four\u00A0things. The first is to get to a fairly low altitude while still at almost orbital velocity. This minimizes the time that it takes to actually land. The more time you take, the more fuel you will have to burn -- because gravity pulls down the same amount every second, so the more seconds it takes, the more gravity you have to fight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second step is spotting a good landing site, as the terrain zooms past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third step is killing nearly all\u00A0your orbital velocity as fast as you can, by locking \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to \u0022Retrograde\u0022 in Surface mode on your Navball, and burning really hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the fourth step is to actually touch down gently. An advanced technique is to calculate and use something called a \u0022Suicide burn\u0022. Or, you can just make sure to keep your velocity down to something reasonable (like 60 m/s) and then burn hard just before you land. All that is still usually done while \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is in \u0022retrograde\u0022 mode -- but sometimes using \u0022Radial Out\u0022 mode is also good. If you use retrograde mode, make sure your downward velocity always stays higher than 1 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sturmovik","CreatedById":199350,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-11T04:40:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I was afraid it would require actual skill.

The latter has the advantage that it still works when your surface velocity is smaller than 1 m/s and it will use the reaction wheels to keep the vessel steady (or straighten it up) when the *bleeping* landing legs kick it around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoninFrog","CreatedById":203049,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-13T17:31:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re not as noob as I was on my first landing.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t even know what \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E was.\u00A0 Rest in pieces, lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bootsam","CreatedById":198563,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-14T08:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill relatively inexperienced ive made 3 landings now. I burn hard to get velocity down to 100m/s once i hit circa 12-14k elevation. This can take some time and occassionally I run outta time. From then onwards I do rapid quick burns to maintain 50-60m/s from 1k. As i near the surface I burn again to drop it to 10m/s, literally jogging between \u0027z\u0027 and \u0027x\u0027 keys, and then very quick bursts to get it to 5m/s on touchdown. Theres prob more efficient ways, but this has worked for me so far. Mostly. Ahem.

It has the tiny disadvantage that it leaves \u003Cstrong\u003Eno\u003C/strong\u003E margin for error. But knowing that this is the most efficient allows you to improve your method over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother suggestion is to not use full throttle (\u0027z\u0027 key) on the final tens of meters, but use a lower throttle setting. E.g. use just enough throttle to offset gravity and keep your speed constant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
