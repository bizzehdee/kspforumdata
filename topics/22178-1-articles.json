Whenever I time warp or go to the space center and back the pieces attached to joints and moving parts get all out of alignment. Is there something I\u0027m missing? I have the latest mumech.lib.

Not too bad for some things, but on others it can be killer. My space stations grappling arm for docking is nearly inoperable at this point.
