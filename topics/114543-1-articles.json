If you\u0027re on a slope, he\u0027ll just go sliding down and down for (possibly) several kilometers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a mod that will make kerbals more \u0027sticky\u0027 ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr one that will make them recover faster from being hit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Driving a 4-wheeled rover on Minmus (or other low-g worlds) is like driving on ice. Is there anything that will allow me to move around, break, turn etc at 10-20 m/s ? Apart from downward thrusting engines, that is.

It is possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a rover that you can belt along on at a great rate of knots. Unfortunately it does mean doing what you said you didn\u0027t want to - have a down-pointing engine. I found the lightest, smallest and longest lasting solution is to use an ion engine pointing down, located at the centre of mass. You\u0027ll need to coat your rover with solar panels but it will be satisfying to get it working. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also get something that will corner a bit better than the usual rover by making it very wide and very low.
