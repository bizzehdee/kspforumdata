If you\u0027re on a slope, he\u0027ll just go sliding down and down for (possibly) several kilometers. \n\nIs there a mod that will make kerbals more \u0027sticky\u0027 ?\n\nOr one that will make them recover faster from being hit?\n\n2) Driving a 4-wheeled rover on Minmus (or other low-g worlds) is like driving on ice. Is there anything that will allow me to move around, break, turn etc at 10-20 m/s ? Apart from downward thrusting engines, that is. A mod with sticky wheels/tracks ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T13:26:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 01:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tutike2000**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T15:15:06Z","Content":"Dunno about 1) but don\u0027t give up on 2)! It is possible. \n\nI have a rover that you can belt along on at a great rate of knots. Unfortunately it does mean doing what you said you didn\u0027t want to - have a down-pointing engine. I found the lightest, smallest and longest lasting solution is to use an ion engine pointing down, located at the centre of mass. You\u0027ll need to coat your rover with solar panels but it will be satisfying to get it working. \n\nYou can also get something that will corner a bit better than the usual rover by making it very wide and very low. So maybe try that first?"},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T15:48:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can also get something that will corner a bit better than the usual rover by making it very wide and very low.

It\u0027s like Tokyo Drift all day every day on Minmus.\n\nEither that, or it takes half a kilometer to break from 20 m/s.\n\nIs wheel traction directly proportional to the amount of weight on top of it? Or is it a fixed value, and you can \u0027cheat\u0027 by adding a whole bunch more wheels ?"},{"CreatedByName":"RW-1","CreatedById":107278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T15:52:38Z","Content":"My minmus rovers are ion powered, however for flying, not driving.

The wheels are there to keep you from breaking apart from fast movement. The RCS is for turning."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T19:20:01Z","Content":"Yes, rovers on low-g worlds like Minmus can be awkward, but I find that the real problem is not so much that they *skid*, as that they *flip*.\n\nFortunately, that\u0027s a fairly easy problem to solve: just give the rover a reasonably hefty torque from reaction wheels, turn on SAS, and you\u0027re set.\n\nIt does mean you have to get used to a slightly different style of rover steering-- it means that when you drive the rover, you need to use the rotation controls in addition to the wheel-steering controls, otherwise SAS keeps you pointing the same way. But I find that in practice this is no big deal (and in fact, I often just skip the steering controls and just muscle it around with pure torque.)\n\nIf I expect to be driving somewhere that has some steep slopes, then I\u0027ll usually equip the rover with some rocket power (e.g. an Oscar-B with Spark at the back end of the rover). I don\u0027t use it for holding the rover down on the ground; rather, it\u0027s for a boost (when going up) or emergency braking (when going down) on really steep hills."}]}
