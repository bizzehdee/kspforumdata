The burst is high and hard enough to make the g meter spike. This force spike applies enough energy to the vessel that it visibly and significantly changes velocity and/or direction. In space it will lead to a measurable change of orbit (apoapsis and periapsis values change). It\u0027s high enough to make vehicles flip over and high enough to exceed the kinematic limits of certain parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- After \u0022revert to launch\u0022 to the runway it sometimes leads to vessels flipping over or flipping sideways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- After \u0022revert to launch\u0022 to the launchpad it sometimes leads to the rocket - including the launch clamps (!) - to turn sideways. This usually means that vessel and launch clamps end up tilted 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 from normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In flight or in orbit it can lead to stuff breaking off. Especially parts that have a low threshold for breaking like solar panels, parachutes or decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Sometimes just rotating or turning a vessel via the reaction control systems is enough to break parts off. (I rotated one vessel with \u0027Q\u0027 and \u0027E\u0027 and my two main Gigantor solar panels snapped off)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When switching to a vessel the forces involved will lead to a sudden change in direction and/or speed and will also sometimes lead to stuff breaking off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two vessels - one landed on Eve and another splashed down on Laithe where the solar panels will fall off every time I switch to them and the physics simulation \u0022winds up\u0022. I\u0027ve lost parts in flight (atmospheric sensor inside a service bay for example) without it noticing because of that. Currently I have two identical vessels (same .craft file) with one missing an atmospheric sensor due to this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes when I switch to a vessel it just breaks apart mid flight even without any control input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 1.0.4 the same happens for energy flow. The craft is subjected to a short (nearly instant; \u0026lt; 1 second) burst of heat. The burst is high and hard enough to make overheat indicators appear all over the vessel - even on parts with a high temperature threshold (I\u0027ve seen it appear on parts that can sustain 2000\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 C). This seems to be an issue during \u0022wind-up\u0022 when the game switches from \u0022physics-less\u0022 to physics mode. So it can happen in the same situations as the other issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Sometimes when switching to a vessel it is subjected to a spike in temperature. This will make overheat indicators show up on all parts (haven\u0027t checked if it\u0027s really all parts but it\u0027s definitely a lot of indicators so it\u0027s safe to assume all).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Parts with a low temperature threshold will explode (batteries, science equipment etc.) usually taking the whole vessel with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Sometimes this only happens to a single part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This also happens to parts occluded and shielded by other parts.
