Basically everything I ever built explodes as soon as I switch to it due to the new heating system. Within seconds overheating indicators will show up on almost every part and then everything just explodes.\n\nSince I can\u0027t attach heatsinks to ships that are already in planetary orbit or in transit (even if I had KAS/KIS I\u0027d never get to do it in time) I\u0027ve lost basically all of my ships and probes, my space stations and months of gameplay.\n\nAlso since I bought the game on steam I can\u0027t revert back to version 1.0.2 which means that everything I achieved over the last two months is now irrevocably lost."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T20:54:26Z","Content":"Hi Nigeth, it\u0027s possible your Physics.cfg didn\u0027t get updated by Steam, try renaming it to force\\* KSP to make a new one when you start it.\n\n\\*bad typing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T23:16:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 11:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"Laethen","CreatedById":146856,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T23:10:21Z","Content":"I too am registering just to vent.

The burst is high and hard enough to make the g meter spike. This force spike applies enough energy to the vessel that it visibly and significantly changes velocity and/or direction. In space it will lead to a measurable change of orbit (apoapsis and periapsis values change). It\u0027s high enough to make vehicles flip over and high enough to exceed the kinematic limits of certain parts.\n\n- After \u0022revert to launch\u0022 to the runway it sometimes leads to vessels flipping over or flipping sideways.\n\n- After \u0022revert to launch\u0022 to the launchpad it sometimes leads to the rocket - including the launch clamps (!) - to turn sideways. This usually means that vessel and launch clamps end up tilted 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 from normal.\n\n- In flight or in orbit it can lead to stuff breaking off. Especially parts that have a low threshold for breaking like solar panels, parachutes or decouplers.\n\n- Sometimes just rotating or turning a vessel via the reaction control systems is enough to break parts off. (I rotated one vessel with \u0027Q\u0027 and \u0027E\u0027 and my two main Gigantor solar panels snapped off)\n\n- When switching to a vessel the forces involved will lead to a sudden change in direction and/or speed and will also sometimes lead to stuff breaking off.\n\nI have two vessels - one landed on Eve and another splashed down on Laithe where the solar panels will fall off every time I switch to them and the physics simulation \u0022winds up\u0022. I\u0027ve lost parts in flight (atmospheric sensor inside a service bay for example) without it noticing because of that. Currently I have two identical vessels (same .craft file) with one missing an atmospheric sensor due to this issue.\n\nSometimes when I switch to a vessel it just breaks apart mid flight even without any control input.\n\nWith 1.0.4 the same happens for energy flow. The craft is subjected to a short (nearly instant; \u003C 1 second) burst of heat. The burst is high and hard enough to make overheat indicators appear all over the vessel - even on parts with a high temperature threshold (I\u0027ve seen it appear on parts that can sustain 2000\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 C). This seems to be an issue during \u0022wind-up\u0022 when the game switches from \u0022physics-less\u0022 to physics mode. So it can happen in the same situations as the other issue.\n\n- Sometimes when switching to a vessel it is subjected to a spike in temperature. This will make overheat indicators show up on all parts (haven\u0027t checked if it\u0027s really all parts but it\u0027s definitely a lot of indicators so it\u0027s safe to assume all).\n\n- Parts with a low temperature threshold will explode (batteries, science equipment etc.) usually taking the whole vessel with them.\n\n- Sometimes this only happens to a single part.\n\n- This also happens to parts occluded and shielded by other parts. (Parts inside service bays for example)\n\nDeleting the physics.cfg has made the temperatuire problem appear a lot less often but has not affected the phantom force problem\n\nRe-Installing the game has not solved the problem\n\nThe problems appear with or without mods\n\nModule manager seems to make the phantom heating problem appear more often though. As soon as I install a mod that requires this things get more explodey."},{"CreatedByName":"Kiro","CreatedById":139123,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T15:26:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I -always- take a copy of my game before I let Steam update.
