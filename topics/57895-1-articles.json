With comparable graphics settings between .21, .22 and .23 I\u0027m now saddled 1:4 game versus real-time lag. It is frustrating to find that others have cleared the tech tree with three missions, while I\u0027m still trying to get my lander into orbit. Any time I use SRBs, large or small, as boosters around the central craft, the rocket starts keeling over before I reach 1000m, and on some flights I even get a roll that I can\u0027t seem to control. The WASD controls don\u0027t seem to respond at all, but that could be due to the lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve even tried to launch some of my designs from .22 and I\u0027m still having problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t modded .23 yet, and I had just picked up the batteries and landing gear on my .23 career.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zwer.ch","CreatedById":88958,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T14:00:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould you mind sharing some pictures of the craft which can\u0027t go beyond 1000m ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arran","CreatedById":64656,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T14:04:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBoosters have no Gimballing, and have such a high thrust it only go one directions, and that they go they are pointed at..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat means, they need to be perfectly aligned, radially and horizontally..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it means if your rocket it top heavy, the weight of the top is pulling onto the rocket and can make it turn, this happens alot at the first stages when you dont have reactions wheels to counter this available..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpinning around its axis, can mean your rocket isnt symmetrical, and without wheels to hold it in place, the rocket can start to turn around it axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue the fact riding on boosters without wheels, you have no control for the duration of the boosters, since the torque of the MK1 cockpit is not strong enough to push the boosters into an direction..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut keeping things Radially and Horizontally aligned and symmetrical should solve the issue, later on when you have acces to wheels, this comes a tat more foregiving.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liowen","CreatedById":94498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T14:07:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA couple of things come to mind: Are you using ASAS, control surfaces, or asparagus staging? I have found with asparagus staging as tanks get low the craft will have a tendency to want to rotate, but when the tank is almost dry it should balance back out. Control surfaces will sometimes reduce this effect, though not always from what I have experienced. Also ASAS is helpful to keep the bigger rockets steady. Pictures of the rocket in question would be helpful to see if there is an imbalance in the center of mass. As for lag issues it might just be a lack of control opposed to actual lag, especially if you are relying on just capsule torque to turn the rocket in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darkeldar","CreatedById":83293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T14:37:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried thrust limiting on both types of SRBs to 75%, 67%, 50%, 33% and 25% and at 25% the rocket sits on the pad. I don\u0027t have pictures available but the central vehicle is a simple lander on top of 4 or 5 LFO tanks and a \u002745 gimbaled engine and 4 winglets . I have tried both small and large SRBs radially attached, with either one or two decouplers (as needed), and even tried four \u002745s with fuel tanks as the boosters. The core flies okay by itself and I\u0027ve tried various throttling schemes, and if I make orbit, I don\u0027t have enough fuel to head towards the Mun, so that\u0027s why I started adding SRBs. Everything in the VAB looks symmetrical, and I patiently made sure that the SRB\u0027s were attached to the decouplers correctly. I checked and rechecked the staging, and I\u0027m just running out of things to try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may have to go back to .22, and hope that .24 works out for me when it is released.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T15:05:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s your box stats? I play KSP on an ultra-low end machine, and I too have found the lag to be horrific with 0.23.
