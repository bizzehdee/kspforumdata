I\u0027ll have to go somewhere else.\n\nEDIT: Ah, Moho! Of course. Intros, hi wassup, all the good stuff, let\u0027s get into it.\n\nI\u0027ve started circumnavigation on Moho, and that was a good idea. I even got an armed rover making circles. I\u0027ll update once every 11 images. Here\u0027s the first.\n\n**To note:** There may be a few inconsistencies during the challenge. I have a few issues with the way the clock works in the game because of how I do not use your standard time measurements.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
