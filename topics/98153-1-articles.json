The issue I\u0027m having is with adding payloads to the bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve created a test payload (basic satellite with solar panels, probe core, ion drive engine and RCS...), which I\u0027m trying to attach to docking ports inside the cargo bay. I saved the satellite itself as a subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, when I load the satellite from the subassembly menu, I have a node on the RCS fuel tank, but not on the docking port (see picture), so I\u0027m unable to load the satellite in to the bay in a way that I can later undock in space. The picture below is a result of some fiddling where I was trying to do it without the probe core on the subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ej34wyy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ej34wyy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a bug, or am I missing something obvious?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdam\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-29T13:14:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2015 01:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pope_Gregory_IX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnV","CreatedById":79006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T12:52:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESubassembly can have only one node on their root part, IIRC.

When constructing payloads, start with a \u0022dummy\u0022 docking port as the root. Then put your real docking port attached to that and build up from there. When it comes time to create a sub assembly, grab the real docking port and detach it from the dummy and drop it in the subassembly area. This will ensure the docking port has the node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pope_Gregory_IX","CreatedById":82244,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T13:03:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFantastic!
