It can play around with certain commands, gets a few bits of information (such as the navball, the altitude, etc.), but it doesn\u0027t know what those commands and pieces mean or what is an orbit or\u00A0gravity turn, as it should learn that all by itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way the AI gets information about how well it is doing is after each attempt, when it gets a score. So the AI starts with a completely random behaviour and gets a feedback in the form of a score. If the score is good, it will be more likely to attempt something similar in the future, if the score is bad, it will be less likely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor KSP, this is not the best idea, since there are well established concepts of going to orbit, but it is a school project about applying neural nets to playing KSP. So it is no problem, if it is completely pointless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere have been others before that let a similar AI (based on neural nets) learn how to play Super Mario,\u00A0or\u00A0Google that developed AlphaGo to beat even the best human Go players. Those two examples need a bit more \u0022creativity\u0022 by the AIs, since there are no well-established solutions for their respective problems, unlike KSP, where people have already written kOS scripts to fly rockets to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, besides the above, why should the AI fly east? You can achieve orbit in any direction, it is just a bit easier, if you go east. But the AI probably doesn\u0027t know that yet, and depending on the scoring, it might never learn it (if it is just about getting into orbit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-10T10:54:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2017 10:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Tullius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-12T04:26:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168049-tullius/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022168049\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168049-tullius/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Tullius\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0true as you told.
