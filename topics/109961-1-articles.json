Up until today, I used -force-opengl to make it bearable. However, I just recently learned that the flags \u0027-force -d3d11\u0027 give similar memory savings with none of the bad visuals of OPENGL.\n\nI tried using -force -d3d11 and it worked beautifully. It gave me the same memory savings as OPENGL. There is just one small issue, shown below.\n\nIt is not game breaking, but it is a little annoying. This is the only negative about my game right now; if somebody can help me figure out why the font is like this, it will be 100% playable and 100% stable with lots of mods... a goal I really want to get to!\n\n![A18tVNP.png](http://i.imgur.com/A18tVNP.png)\n\nAgain, thank you sincerely for any help you are able to provide. I would be lost without these forums!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n![bRg02O5.png](http://i.imgur.com/bRg02O5.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T15:50:04Z","Content":"I can tell you this isn\u0027t caused by addons, it has plagued the Linux and OSX versions of KSP for ages and there\u0027s still a few areas where we get uneven text.\n\nThe cause is Unity\u0027s sub-pixel rendering of fonts, it works fine on D3D9 but needs to be corrected for on OpenGL, and it looks like it needs it on D3D11 too.\n\nYou could try another screen resolution to see if that helps, or accept it as how Kerbals type, I don\u0027t know of any fixes outside the Unity editor."},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T17:20:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I can tell you this isn\u0027t caused by addons, it has plagued the Linux and OSX versions of KSP for ages and there\u0027s still a few areas where we get uneven text.\n\u003E The cause is Unity\u0027s sub-pixel rendering of fonts, it works fine on D3D9 but needs to be corrected for on OpenGL, and it looks like it needs it on D3D11 too.\n\u003E \n\u003E You could try another screen resolution to see if that helps, or accept it as how Kerbals type, I don\u0027t know of any fixes outside the Unity editor.\n\nWell thank you for the information.
