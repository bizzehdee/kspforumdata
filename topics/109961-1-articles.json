Up until today, I used -force-opengl to make it bearable. However, I just recently learned that the flags \u0027-force -d3d11\u0027 give similar memory savings with none of the bad visuals of OPENGL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried using -force -d3d11 and it worked beautifully. It gave me the same memory savings as OPENGL. There is just one small issue, shown below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not game breaking, but it is a little annoying. This is the only negative about my game right now; if somebody can help me figure out why the font is like this, it will be 100% playable and 100% stable with lots of mods... a goal I really want to get to!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A18tVNP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022A18tVNP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, thank you sincerely for any help you are able to provide.
