Starting with a Mk1-2 Pod the total Habitation is 90d, as expected. The Hitchhiker should add 480d (120d from crew cap of 4 \u002B 360d from ModuleHabitation with 12 KerbalMonths). Thus, a Mk1-2 Pod \u002B Hitchhiker should have a total Habitation rating of 560d (1y135d). Instead, as seen in the screenshot below, it has 2730d (6y180d).

For example, the Mk2 Crew Cabin lacks a ModuleHabitation, and thus, typically adds only 120d (30d x crew cap of 4). This is confirmed in the below screenshot, which shows a total Habitation value of 210d for the Mk1-2 Pod (90d) \u002B Mk2 Crew Cabin (120d), as expected.\n\n![33rVMZJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/33rVMZJ.jpg)\n\nGiven that the Mk1-2 Pod \u002B Hitchhiker was previously shown to have a Habitation rating of 2730d, we might expect that adding a Mk2 Crew Cabin (120d) would give a total of 2850d (6y300d). Instead, as seen below, the total is 4290d (10y40d). Clearly the Habitation rating of this craft is not additive, as it is greater than the sum of its parts (4290d for all 3 parts versus 120d for only Mk1-2 \u002B Cabin and 2730d for Mk1-2 \u002B Hitchhiker). Again, this result is consistent with my previously posted formula, as 11 (total crew cap) x 13 (1 \u002B 12KM) x 30d = 4290d (10y40d).\n\n![4OOojOi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4OOojOi.jpg)\n\nEDIT:\n\nIn retrospect, it\u0027s obvious that you meant that ModuleHabitation adds 12KM to the habitation rating of the vessel *at max crew*. This strikes me as an odd way to calculate the rating, though, as it means that the Hitchhiker adds 12KM *to every seat on the entire vessel*. Given that seats other than the Hitchhiker start with only a 1KM rating, the Hitchhiker basically increases the Habitation value of every seat by 1200%. This could be very powerful when applied to a vessel that already has a large number of seats (e.g., with a Mk3 Passenger Module), and I\u0027m not sure it makes a lot of sense either.

I understand exactly how the habitation values are calculated, I hear you that it is by design, and I see how it makes some sense from a certain perspective. I\u0027m trying to draw attention to to what I believe to be silly/counter-intuitive implications of the current system.\n\nPerhaps a more extreme in-game example would help. Imagine an enormous colonization ship with 10 Mk3 Passenger Modules. It can carry 160 Kerbals for 1 month. Seems reasonable. Add a single Hitchhiker, and now the ship can carry 164 Kerbals for 13 months. Thematically, the implication is that all 164 Kerbals onboard are somehow utilizing this single Hitchhiker in such a way that allows all 164 of them to remain comfortable 13x as long as they would without it. If we imagine that those 164 Kerbals are taking turns (in groups of 4) relaxing in the comfort of the Hitchhiker, each Kerbal would spend only ~8.8 minutes per day in the Hitchhiker, and yet those 8.8 minutes apparently allow them to tolerate 13 months of travel instead of only 1. That strikes me as rather incredible.\n\nMy point is simply that, as the size of a vessel and its crew increases, one would intuitively expect a greater number of Hitchhikers would be required in order to achieve the same benefit. One would expect a cap on the number of Kerbals that can benefit from a single Hitchhiker, or at least diminishing returns. Instead, a Hitchhiker is cabaple of providing the same benefit per total crew capacity *for any capacity*.\n\nThe silliness becomes more pronounced if viewed from the perspective of a single Kerbal (or with any low crew:capacity ratio) instead of max crew. With the above-described colony ship, the addition of the Hitchhiker takes the single-Kerbal habitation time from 160 months to 2132 months. That\u0027s an increase of 81.6 *years* resulting from the addition of a single Hitchhiker.\n\nIf that\u0027s how you want it to work, of course that\u0027s your prerogative - I\u0027m not trying to tell you what to do, and I don\u0027t mean to be a pain. I\u0027m merely trying to illustrate that there are some thematically counter-intuitive consequences of the current calculation method, which you may or may not want to address.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-23T02:30:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2016 02:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Fraz86**"},{"CreatedByName":"Brigadier","CreatedById":147109,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T19:15:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, RoverDude said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Stock has no idea what supplies are, nothing I can do about that.\n\u003E \n\nOk, thanks, that makes sense.

(164 / 160 \\* 30)\n\u003E \n\nI think the problem Fraz86 is pointing out, is that with that one part (and it might be one of only 3 or 4 parts configured like it) provides not only crew slots that work as you describe, but also provides a HabitationModule addition of 12 kerbal months which gets multiplies by the crew ratio.\n\nWith the way its currently setup it multiplies (crew ratio) \\* (KerbalMonths in part configurations \u002B 1)\n\nSo a Mk1-2 with 3 crew gets a total of (1) \\* (1 kerbal months) for a total of 30 days.\n\nAdd one hitchhiker and it goes to (2.33) \\* (1 \u002B 12 kerbal months) for a total of 909 days.  So its a huge step up for an increase of very little weight.\n\nMy suggestion would be to either remove the kerbalmonth modifer and only use the multiplier config option (and tune the hitchhiker to down to something like 1.5) or reserve HabitatModule multipliers to only components that do not themselves add crew slots  or do it like this:\n\nHave two ratios, one of crew to total seats of vessel (TtlCrwRatio) and a ratio of crew to seats in modules with KerbalMonth modifiers (KMCrewRatio).  Then modify the calculation to:\n\n(TtlCrwRatio \\* HabitationModule.Multiplier) \u002B (KMCrewRatio \\* HabitationModule.KerbalMonths)\n\nWith this change mk1-2 \u002B hitchhiker and a total of 3 crew wouldbe:\n\n (((7/3) \\* 1) \u002B ((4/3) \\* 12)) =~550  days versus 909 with current config.\n\nSame configuration with a full crew would be:\n\n(((7/7) \\* 1) \u002B ((4/7) \\* 12)) =~ 210\n\nVersus 361 with current.  So a good boost, still bigger than it probably should, but not huge.\n\nPersonally I don\u0027t have a problem with multiple kinds of habitation multipliers, its just with this specific low weight 4 seat part with a very larger multiplier seems a bit broken when it gets incorporated into big designs.  Using it to make a 1 or 2 man crew in a capsule be able to get to the edge of the system is one thing, being able to take a huge 60 crew ship add one hitchhiker container and have it marginally decrease their crew ratio but then multiply their range by 13 (versus 1) seems a touch over powered ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  especially one the hab parts specifically designed as colony parts increase the multiplier by less than 5.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 59 minutes ago, apocriva said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe I\u0027m understanding the hab modifiers incorrectly, but wouldn\u0027t going from 160 to 164 crew spots filled with 160 crew change the hab time from 30 days to 30.75 days?
