I noticed the landing carriage on one seemed to be the culprit, as it was missing. I assume it was that I had sent an empty orange tank, and transferred all of the extra fuel over there, messing with my CoM. This was just game breaking for me, I could have fixed it, but a majority of the landers were broken, each launch taking about 30 min. I have a video recording here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/maximumtech/b/501941127\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.twitch.tv/maximumtech/b/501941127\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighlight @ 53:30 - 55:00. I think I want to try the base again, except this time with wider modules, centered in a lake(on minmus), and with a tension multi-lander landing system, to make transit faster.

Sounds like it broke when the base loaded in.. its hard to say exactly what, but for starters avoid adding struts ( both KAS struts and hard struts ) to the containers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-09T21:53:21Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2014 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JavaProphet","CreatedById":98111,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T22:35:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll I added were pipes, no inter-craft struts, in fact no struts in the entire base.

I had to dock two ships together with a pipe. Had to eva a kerbal and make the connection before the two craft drifted too far apart. I failed.. reloaded.. boom. Kraken attack. I posted in the KAS forum, but it seems theres not much we can do. Im not sure what causes it. The only things that I KNOW cause it are struts and quick saving with a kerbal on EVA ( and I think I made the mistake of quick saving while I was linking pipes.. ) Sorry I know not much help, but im trying to narrow down what could cause this. Because like you id like to make a really nice base one day. But not if this is just going to keep happening. My last one suffered a fate similar to yours. It was pretty cool granted.. seeing hundreds of pieces of debris fall back down on the mun like rain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot cool a second time though. Is there ANYONE else with similar experiences? It always seems to happen on a quickload.. so theres something goin on there. Idk if its avoidable during construction or not.
