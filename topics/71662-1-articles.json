This will take a good chunk of Dv but the lander doesn\u0027t need to be very heavy so that Dv is easy to include, just 3 or 4 FL-T200s and 3 or 4 small engines should achieve it just attach them with radial decouplers so you can ditch the dead weight. Also remember to bring science, Expect this stage to take around 800m/s (that allows plenty of extra DV for targeted landings ect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 - before this you need to reach minmus and hopefully circularize, this takes about 1000Dv, and remember you\u0027re carrying a lander so you\u0027ll need a stage which can cover this, I recommend something like an FL-T800 and an LV45 (or if you dont mind the long burn times and LV909) engine. Watch out of you\u0027re using the LV909s though they don\u0027t produce electricity so you\u0027ll need a power supply or a bunch of batteries, and dont forget to turn off ASAS when your finished with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 - You need to get from the KSC into orbit. This will take about 4500 - 4800m/s of DV but since its your first stage and you\u0027re a new player you can afford a bit of overkill, aim for about 5200m/s the extra fuel can be used to get you on the way to minmus. The initial lifter can be designed in many ways, either in several stages or in a single stage, but the ultimate goal remains the same, get the payload into orbit. With a good initial lifter you should be able to get into orbit easily, Also you can try and incorporate your lifter and your TLI phase into the same stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you can tweek some values, check your T/W on the main stage, if its too low, (less than 1.5) then consider removing some surplus fuel from one of the upper stages, this can be useful but if you\u0027re using fuel lines on your upper stages you could bog up your mission phasing by running low on lander fuel before landing for example, as long as your DV values remain as (or slightly more than) I\u0027ve described you should be ok. If your T/W is too high, then consider removing some engines or limiting the thrust of the engines, but more importantly make sure you remain at terminal velocity during takeoff from kerbin, a T/W of 2 or more would be considered high but for your lander there is no such thing as too high. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few things to remember, if your science isn\u0027t attached to your return phase (ie it will never land on kerbin) you will need to collect the science in EVA before jettisoning it, I prefer to do this on the surface of minmus since the gravity helps me maneuver. Adding boosters to the lower stages does help a little, but only if you dont exceed terminal velocity, if you have to throttle back so much that your LOX engines are hardly providing control (only on engines with gimbals) they your potentially going to have problems. Avoid them if possible. Finally learn how to get to minmus in theory before you launch. I\u0027ve seen too many people wasting huge amounts of fuel by misunderstanding basic orbital mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T17:02:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB, with KER main display shown, it should show you the mass, cost (not important), deltaV and TWR of each stage of your rocket as you build it. It is confusing though - I didn\u0027t have a clue what it was telling me when I first got it. As I said before, the important things in there are your TWR at launch (the bottom stage) and the total deltaV. It all starts to make sense when you see the figures changing as you build, rather than just showing a \u0027snapshot\u0027 of an existing vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry this: start with a 1-man command pod. Stick a parachute on top of it (you never know, you might want to fly this thing!) and a decoupler beneath it. So far - no fuel, no engines. Pretty clearly this isn\u0027t going to space today and KER won\u0027t tell you anything useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut a fuel tank beneath the decoupler. Put an engine under that. Which tank and which engine don\u0027t matter at the moment but now you have a rocket! On the bottom-right of the screen there should be two (or three) stages - pod, parachute and decoupler in the top one (the decoupler may be on its own in a middle stage, that\u0027s fine), engine in the bottom one. KER will now tell you how viable this rocket is ... look along the column headings for \u0027TWR\u0027 - if it\u0027s less than 1 (preferably 1.5) the engine isn\u0027t powerful enough to lift the rocket. If it\u0027s over 2 the engine\u0027s too powerful but at least you know it\u0027ll work ^^.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry different engines to see how the TWR changes with more or less powerful ones. Try different size fuel tanks and look at how that affects, primarily, the mass of the rocket and therefore also the TWR. What you really want is the biggest fuel-tank you can get with an engine that can push it at 1.5\u002B TWR. Meanwhile ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, now I know what I\u0027m talking about instead of just trying to remember it: A capsule, parachute, decoupler, tank and engine will give you three stages at bottom-right; parachute (stage 0, top, last), decoupler (1, middle) and engine (stage 2, bottom, first). KER shows cost, mass, ISP, thrust, deltaV, TWR and time. Cost and mass speak for themselves. The ISP is the efficiency of the engine but isn\u0027t immediately important. Similarly the thrust shows how hard the engine can push and isn\u0027t, immediately, important. DeltaV and TWR are important; TWR tells you how fast the engine can accelerate a vehicle of this mass. A more powerful engine can accelerate a lighter vehicle more quickly, so that\u0027s simple enough. The tricky one to understand is deltaV which is a matter of fuel-efficiency and how much fuel you have. A more efficient engine will generally be able to deliver higher deltaV but may not have enough sheer power to give a high enough TWR. Lower-efficiency engines may have the punch for a high TWR but burn the fuel so quickly that the deltaV is low. Read up on this when you have time but for now just know you want a TWR between 1.6 and 1.8 and deltaV at least 4,500m/s to get to orbit. Adjust the fuel tank and engine to see what figures you get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to make a rocket (with the pod, parachute, decoupler above) that will get to orbit is to use an S3-14400 fuel tank with a \u0027mainsail\u0027 engine under it. It is not a good way, but it gives a TWR (according to KER) of 1.72 at launch and total deltaV of 5,361m/s; enough to orbit with a nice cushion for not getting the gravity turn perfect. KER also shows the time for this (single) stage as 2:35.4s, which just tells you that at full throttle the engine will burn all the fuel in just over 2 and a half minutes. In summary - this engine with this much fuel will push, starting at TWR 1.72, for 2 and a half minutes, accelerating the rocket from 0 to 5,361m/s (most of which will be spent climbing out of the gravity well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore conventionally you may prefer to ditch the \u0027big bang\u0027 above. Instead stick a two FL-T800 fuel tanks (one above the other) under the pod\u0027s decoupler and add an LV-T30 engine. Rather smaller, TWR 1.95 and deltaV 4,515m/s. The deltaV\u0027s a bit of a pinch for orbiting but the TWR\u0027s a bit high so all you need is to add a touch more fuel (=more deltaV). An FL-T400 does it quite nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is usually impossible to get a sensible single-stage rocket like this, however. In any case for landing on Minmus or anywhere else you\u0027ll need landing legs - which wouldn\u0027t reach the ground here!

Much better than fuel content, since the amount of fuel you have doesn\u0027t account for the weight of the vessel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good way to imagine DV is this, you have a ship in orbit with a DV of 1000m/s, and 500 units of fuel, if you add another 500 fuel, your DV will increase, if you then remove the 500 units of fuel your DV will drop to 1000 again, now you eject some weight from the vessel such as a lander or a few empty tanks, your DV will also increase even though the fuel qty is the same, this is because the vessel still holds the same amount of fuel but the net weight has reduced so you can accelerate a little easier. Its also worth considering that your original DV cannot be increased without either adding fuel or removing weight, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET/W or Thrust to Weight is how fast your ship can accelerate relative to a specific body. A T/W on kerbin of 1 would allow the ship to hold its own weight off the ground but not move up or down, a T/W of more than 1 would allow you to climb, a T/W of less than 1 would not allow you to move. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eie if your ship provides 1ton of thrust but weighs only 0.5tons, that ship would have a T/W of 2, which is thrust divided by weight,\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-07T17:18:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2014 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FREEFALL1984\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T17:16:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA downloadable sandbox ship and written/illustrated walkthrough for reaching the moons is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25029-A-moon-rocket-and-moon-trip-walkthrough-for-newbies-%2821-1%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.
