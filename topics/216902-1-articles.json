Unfortunately, there is a lot at stake when it comes to sense of civilization bragging rights. Considering that the Hindi Indians have the \u003Cem\u003Elongest unchanged cultural heritage\u003C/em\u003E since 3300 BCE is no small feat in human affairs.

Had three students that were constantly mad; two over how I rejected their views of religion and theology (an extremely hot and contested topic) and the third was upset because I refused to deviate from the \u0022standard\u0022 Mesopotamian view of human social order (for the most part, Mesopotamian civilizations did not care about race; slavery was not about race.

So for these prehistoric people who lived with systematic writing, it was more important to do more work in the tribe than to know how to draw those strange symbols. Secondly,\u00A0I\u0027m not sure if other civilisations have a legend that \u0027some god created writing\u0027, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangjie\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebut China does\u003C/a\u003E. For a long time, writing and even the object on which it was written were sacred. So, it is quite possible that these carriers of systematic writing were destroyed in various ways, for example by witchcraft fire divination. It is also possible that the carriers of systematic writing did not exist either before systematic writing came into existence - they drew the symbols on something that was not something easy to preserve for thousands of years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, at the recently excavated site of Sanxingdui, archaeologists have discovered their method of ritual sacrifice: after the sacrifice all the ritual objects were smashed and thrown into a pit and burned.

This is why there are so many examples of both oracle and dragon bones available\u00A0 along the early Huang He River settlements (Yellow River settlements for those of you outside China - this is the cradle of the earliest Chinese civilizations). But once again, it was these religions before Confucianism/Buddhism/Jainism and other late coming ancient belief systems appeared within the region. As wise men or shaman (those who were able to determine the will of the ancestors and interpret the dragon bones and oracle bones) passed their knowledge to the next generation, it is believed their symbols became standardized over time - how long, we do not know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut how they began (the precursor or proto-writing) we do not know this either. What we do know from the archeology is there is a standard set of symbols that appear in the historical record nearly the same time as a standardized set of writing appears in every other civilization cluster around the same time. Remember, there is no widespread literacy in any place in the world except for the Minoan/Mycenaean civilization of the late Ancient Era - but only because their system of writing was extremely easy to learn and was based on consonant sounds rather than concepts or syllables as most of the other ancient world systems were.\u00A0 Both what would develop in the Indus Valley and in the Huang He were unique - a written language concept that was a universal within its region - the symbol meant the same in every dialect of the spoken language family, no matter how remote.

Thing is, the recognized origin of the Chinese language is the oracle bone script. This is a script that originated in the Shang (\u5546) dynasty.\u00A0According to the Shang Shu (\u300A\u5C1A\u4E66\u300B), the first historical record of ancient China, \u0022the ancestors of Yin (\u6BB7, it\u0027s the name of the capital of the Shang dynasty) were already have booklets (\u60DF\u6BB7\u5148\u4EBA, \u6709\u5178\u6709\u518C).\u00A0\u00A0The Jiahu site originated around 8,000 years ago, and many experts believe that these symbols can only be proven to have been consciously carved at present, but are not fully conclusive as writing.\u00A0So I think that these symbols, along with knots and gradually simplified paintings, formed a systematic script during thousands of years of intermingling with various tribes and civilisations that followed. That is,\u00A0many Neolithic sites between the 8,000-year-old site of Jiahu and the Shang dynasty in the sixteenth century BC have been found with written symbols on pottery. Such as Peiligang (\u88F4\u674E\u5C97) culture, Yangshao (\u4EF0\u97F6) Culture and Liangzhu (\u826F\u6E1A) culture.

The only thing that slowed Japan\u0027s economic and industrial development down was the impact of scarcity of raw resources and what I call the \u0022geographical lottery.\u0022 This geographical lottery is why Japan and Russia soon found itself fighting over Chinese Manchuria and the Russian area surrounding Port Arthur. For the Russians, it was because of the need for a warm water Pacific port (extremely simplified by their primary reason). For the Japanese, it was for a stronghold into Manchuria and the access to raw materials - something the Japanese islands do not have an abundant supply of (coal, iron ore, chromium, nickel, copper, etc).

There are a lot of reasons why the ancient Japanese did outlast a lot of their contemporaries, such as the European Celts, the various Goths, and others. Sure, the Goths and Celts were absorbed into other cultures, but the isolation of the Japanese islands worked in Japan\u0027s favor for a while.

Since the mid-twentieth century (CE), this system has undergone tremendous revision as it has become widely recognized that not all civilizations transitioned from the ancient era to the classical era around the same time.

The Minoans collapsed after a series of natural disasters and an invasion by the Mycenaeans. And the Mycenaeans took over and adopted much of what the inoans were already doing. What we do know has mostly been discovered by accident or what has been preserved from other smaller islands where we know the two civilizations had other settlements also. However, when both of these civilizations entered their Dark Age, it lasted for a while - the only evidence we have of what happened then is the writings of Homer and a few other surviving Greek tragedies and plays that are based on mythology. So, unlike their Mesopotamian, Hindi, and Chinese counterparts, their dark age was lengthy and a lot of their development was lost.

Using this logic, one could say that any modern nation is still not \u0022modernized\u0022 since no nation is completely urban. Japan\u0027s modernization happened a lot faster than any western European nation. History shows that. The only thing that slowed Japan\u0027s economic and industrial development down was the impact of scarcity of raw resources and what I call the \u0022geographical lottery.\u0022 This geographical lottery is why Japan and Russia soon found itself fighting over Chinese Manchuria and the Russian area surrounding Port Arthur. For the Russians, it was because of the need for a warm water Pacific port (extremely simplified by their primary reason). For the Japanese, it was for a stronghold into Manchuria and the access to raw materials - something the Japanese islands do not have an abundant supply of (coal, iron ore, chromium, nickel, copper, etc). Scarcity is not something that helps industrialized nations - but that\u0027s not a topic for ancient history since the Twentieth Century can hardly be called ancient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll I\u0027m saying is that saying \u0022Japan was no longer rural farms everywhere\u0022, which is what that post implied, is incorrect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yeah, back to the ancient history.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-30T07:46:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas Rome\u0027s problem with incessant rebellions due to a repressive military, or just endemic to empires of the time?
