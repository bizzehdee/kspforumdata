I can still see my apoapsis and periapsis and can make nodes but i cant seem to get my icon back, not sure what i did. I backed out to the main menu and reloaded the save and it is still gone. Maybe i have to restart the whole game but i was curious if there was a button to toggle it, i hit a lot of the keys but didn\u0027t seem to do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T07:18:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most common reason for this problem is you\u0027ve filtered it out.
