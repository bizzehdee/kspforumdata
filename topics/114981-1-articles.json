As a stand alone mod. Recently a steam forced update has caused the whole game to reinstall with the new mod. Despite us already having it installed separately. If that new complete install has overwritten files provided by modders. It will break the mods. So far I have seen a major bug appear in my game where science instruments have lost some right click functions. Is really related to a steam forced install?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I am asking is if this happened a few mod creators might be off chasing silly bugs caused by bad installs and not the mod itself.
