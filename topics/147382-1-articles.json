I wouldn\u0027t want to see any overly complex robotics, but a few basic moving part options would be really great. I\u0027m thinking basic things like joints for trusses\u00A0and I-beams, as well as telescoping/extending versions of the same. Also, a part that works just like the Klaw, except with an attachment point at the end instead of a claw. I think this could open up a world of building possibilities without too much complexity.
