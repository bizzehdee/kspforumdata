I get contracts that want you to test X at Y conditions etc. and when that\u0027s a parachute or decoupler, the usual way to do it is to just place it somewhere (if it isn\u0027t functional to the craft) and just stage it when the conditions are met.\n\nHowever, many times already, I\u0027ve rearranged stages to satisfy the requirement of \u0022staging\u0022 the part rather than just activating it and most every time it results in the part\u0027s stage not working at all. I got it with the tiny stack decoupler, placed it on the mk1 module and when the conditions where met, I moved its stage to the bottom, pressed space and nothing happened. Spamming space didn\u0027t help because it staged everything else but left that stage intact, resulting in a kerbal dying.\n\nThe same thing happened now when I tried to stage the mk16 chute - it remained intact while pressing space once did nothing and the next time it activated the next stage.\n\nFor many of these contracts it\u0027s important to be able to stage something whenever you need to, rather than as part of a sequence, since you can\u0027t always explicitly design craft just to make sure they\u0027re in some exact point and speed so you won\u0027t have to change the staging at all.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? I thought that perhaps putting the stage at the bottom of the list makes it the \u0022current stage\u0022 somehow, so even if it isn\u0027t activated, the game just moves on to the next one, effectively skipping it. But this doesn\u0027t happen at launch (clearly) and it doesn\u0027t happen when I repeatedly swap stages on craft with only the parachutes left (I create an empty stage, place it at the bottom, stages properly - then do the same and place the chute stage at the bottom, again works properly).\n\nedit - just tested it at the launch pad, same craft - placing the chute\u0027s stage at the bottom and pressing space stages it properly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T01:56:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 01:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MechaLynx**"},{"CreatedByName":"g.koster","CreatedById":115794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T02:36:24Z","Content":"it is quite simple by rearanging the staging you reset all the staging so the first time you hit the space bar you activate the stage that you think is active"},{"CreatedByName":"MechaLynx","CreatedById":108866,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T02:39:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E it is quite simple by rearanging the staging you reset all the staging so the first time you hit the space bar you activate the stage that you think is active\n\nSo you\u0027re saying that whatever stage was previously active is the next one to be activated, whenever stages are re-arranged, no matter how they are re-arranged?\n\nNo offense, but the lack of punctuation in your sentence makes it hard to understand what you mean."},{"CreatedByName":"g.koster","CreatedById":115794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T02:50:09Z","Content":"This only become visible when doing parts testing.
