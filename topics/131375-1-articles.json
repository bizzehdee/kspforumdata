I\u0027ve been on and off these forums for help, answers, and mods but never posted or made an account. Recently I\u0027ve found myself coming to the forums more and more so I broke down and made an account. Even though I am new to the forums, I am by no means new to KSP. I have logged over 800 hours on my steam account but about 600 more on my friends account. I enjoy long walks on the beach, salsa music, and boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T19:48:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Mr Feather and welcome to the Forum! You have ~2 months on KSP if you have played for 1400 hours.
