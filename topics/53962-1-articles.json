But, if you use 1 fuel unit = 1 liter, you end up with fuel densities that are very high and the fraction of tanks actually occupied by fuel is very low. If you assume instead that 1 fuel unit = 5 liters, you get fuel densities that correspond more closely to real-life rocket fuels and the volume of fuel in the fuel tanks is much more sensible. I would guess that the devs used 1 unit = 5 liters when setting up fuel properties and tanks, but since they\u0027ve never said so explicitly (as far as I know, and I don\u0027t think the wiki is definitive) it\u0027s only my guess. I like the name \u0027fuel cubit\u0027 for the unit of fuel, which I saw in a thread some time back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
