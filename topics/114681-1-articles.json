Although I may be mistaken.\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I feel that all the pods should be balanced against their relative parts that don\u0027t have guidance or control systems on board. For example, the Mk1-2 Pod could be weighted against the Hitchhiker \u002B SAS \u002B Battery \u002B Monoprop. The mass of the two should be relatively similar. While the pod should be \u003Cem\u003Esomewhat\u003C/em\u003E heavier, this shouldn\u0027t be much of a difference. Heat shields are now a secondary part adding even more mass to the pod. We don\u0027t need to add mass to pods themselves anymore since the old argument was that they were heavy to withstand the rigors or re-entry. Therefore the pods should all have their mass\u0027 reduced and vise-versa for the heat shields. I will leave my opinion on where the numbers should be out, balancing is Squads job. I think these are fair assessments to make however.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T05:09:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 05:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonik\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seshins","CreatedById":71258,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T05:21:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei like the idea of the keeping the current 3 man capsule as a low tech, maybe low distance (if life support was added) option, and adding Orion and/or Dragon as a top tier capsule.
