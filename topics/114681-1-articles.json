First the size 1 parts are available, then the size 0 and size 2 parts, and finally the size 3 parts. But with rare exceptions, we don\u0027t see earlier (less sophisticated, less efficient, heavier) parts of the same size get replaced by later (more sophisticated, more efficient, lighter) parts. In fact, there seems to be an effort to balance all the parts across size, which undercuts the idea that later parts might be better than earlier parts."},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T02:22:48Z","Content":"**5** letters: Orion\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T04:13:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 04:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laythe Dweller**"},{"CreatedByName":"Retread","CreatedById":89946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T02:27:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 4 letters: Orion\n\nUm...\n\nHuh..."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T02:49:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Um...\n\u003E Huh...\n\nIs \u0022UmHuh\u0022 also four letters?

Although I may be mistaken.\nPersonally I feel that all the pods should be balanced against their relative parts that don\u0027t have guidance or control systems on board. For example, the Mk1-2 Pod could be weighted against the Hitchhiker \u002B SAS \u002B Battery \u002B Monoprop. The mass of the two should be relatively similar. While the pod should be *somewhat* heavier, this shouldn\u0027t be much of a difference. Heat shields are now a secondary part adding even more mass to the pod. We don\u0027t need to add mass to pods themselves anymore since the old argument was that they were heavy to withstand the rigors or re-entry. Therefore the pods should all have their mass\u0027 reduced and vise-versa for the heat shields. I will leave my opinion on where the numbers should be out, balancing is Squads job. I think these are fair assessments to make however.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T05:09:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 05:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonik**"},{"CreatedByName":"Seshins","CreatedById":71258,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T05:21:28Z","Content":"i like the idea of the keeping the current 3 man capsule as a low tech, maybe low distance (if life support was added) option, and adding Orion and/or Dragon as a top tier capsule.

With the Mk1-2 command pod, the center of mass of the reentry capsule will be close to the heat shield. You can also attach parachutes and other radial parts to the command pod, and they will be protected by the heat shield during reentry."}]}
