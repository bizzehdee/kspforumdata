In interplanetary space, the proportions are supposed to be roughly split with most of the atoms being hydrogen, and the rest being other types of stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso- you can turn kethane into both RCS fuel and liquid rocket fuel. Both are chemically different. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, I expect kethane to be some sort of form of hydrogen, or a form of water that is unique to the kerbal universe as it is highly destructive when changing states, and therefore must be either a radioactive material, and since all fuel is equivalent types of that, the change/refuel part of the mod must be able to remove or stabilize it, otherwise there would be engines that used kethane (Please make those, by the way), or the kethane is a slurry of different chemicals that are equivalent the the universe\u0027s primordial soup just after the big bang, with the possibility to be any atom at all, with the converter acting as a quantum manipulator, allowing light-speed transmission of the kethane while allowing the kethane to be transmuted through some nuclear witchrafty mathematics into a different fuel type. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, to answer your question, I would guess that maybe, of those ten atoms, 1 might be kethane, or all 10. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the answer was that kethane is radioactive, I would assume that there would be more radioactive atoms in space due to the massive radioactivity of the sun, than in almost any planet\u0027s atmosphere, save Jool (pressure and heat would make convection currents bring kethane up from the core) or Eve (like venus has a hazerdous sulfuric atmosphere, there should be a percentage of kethane in Eve\u0027s atmosphere as well).

Then, the kethane would be prominent, as the whole sun would be made out of the super-explosive materiel. Also, jool would have a high concentration, like you stated Majiir, but the moons would pull large filaments of gas off the planet, and would therefore have a relatively high concentration on kethane just in the orbit within jool\u0027s muns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
