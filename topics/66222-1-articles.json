And the problem is, so long as the air intake system allows any intake at any location to feed air to any jet, realistic intakes aren\u0027t going to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, why not have an intake air crossfeed system, very much like how we currently have a fuel crossfeed system to keep those Mainsails going? It\u0027s worked for the rockets so far, so I don\u0027t see any problems adapting this to jets and intake air. Except, of course, no \u0022air-lines\u0022. That\u0027d be ridiculous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe system would basically make use of a \u0022fuel-tank\u0022 like intake-air storage device, in the form of the existing Engine Nacelles, or tweakable settings that convert certain parts (jet fuselages, structural fuselages, NOT struts) into air-storage canisters but remove their initial functions (i.e. Jet fuselages no longer store fuel if used to store air). The storage capacity would probably be quite low, on the level of 0.1 intake air, to prevent ppl from spamming large canisters of air to power their jets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly intakes attached directly or via air-crossfeed-capable structures (i.e. converted fuel tanks/various multicouplers, no struts or plates) would be able to feed air into air-tanks, and only engines attached to air tanks via air-crossfeed-capable structures would be able to draw air from the air-tanks. Intake and jet placement would actually begin to make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T13:52:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think what is really needed is another overhaul of resource consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts which consume distributed resources (air, electricity, monopropellant, xenon) should not be evaluated separately, instead the system should first collect the sum of demand of all such parts, then if there is not enough resources to cover the demand, distribute the available amount proportionally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027d get rid of not only asymmetric flameout, but also asymmetric ion engine failures and some other, subtle effects such as a probe getting a kick when it runs out of monopropellant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-19T13:54:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2014 01:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
