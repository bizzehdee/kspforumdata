You want it to be a chemical element that is so stable that it doesn\u0027t want to be aggressive, not a random mix of elements that will happily react with everything it touches.\n\nAlso, xenon is a very large element. The largest stable noble gas, in fact. That means it has a huge number of electrons in its shell, and stealing one to ionize it is very easy. By contrast, a small element like helium has only two electrons. Stealing one equals to taking 50% of what there is to take, and the atom is going to fight this process hard. It takes much, much more energy to ionize a small element than it takes to ionize xenon. So if your energy budget is finite, using xenon means you can spend the largest part of your energy budget on accelerating the propellant, thereby getting the best efficiency for the energy invested.\n\nThe problem with proposals like the rock vaporization thing is always that of efficiency. Sure, xenon is expensive. But your rock vaporizer is going to be relatively big, heavy, and take an absurd amount of power just to prepare propellant for consumption. You could just as well toss the rock vaporizer and feed all of that power direction into a classical electric engine with xenon propellant and get better thrust, better Isp, less upmass to be placed into orbit and a simpler, longer-lived and more reliable vehicle overall.\n\nAs far as fuel-agnostic electric engines go, there are a bunch that can theoretically eat almost anything. Just nobody does it because using xenon is simply better, and when you\u0027re dropping three-digit millions on construction and launch, the price of a few hundred kgs of xenon starts to be pretty insignificant.\n\nThen there are proposals like the VASIMR, which is supposed to run on argon (another noble gas). Argon is flat-out worse than xenon in every respect, but it\u0027s much more common and thus much cheaper. And since the production model VASIMR is expected to start at 200kW and scale up from there - which is orders of magnitude higher than any electric engine in space today - fuel consumption is going to be higher and the company thinks that it starts making sense paying attention to the price tag of the fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"Woksaus","CreatedById":148764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T19:12:36Z","Content":"I\u0027m currently working in a lab where they did research on using metal propellants for Hall thrusters.

However, this effect has its downsides. For starters, because it takes more energy to ionize the smaller element (because it clings harder to its electrons), that means that out of a finite energy budget, you have less energy remaining to spend on accelerating the propellant after ionization, even if you ionize the same number of atoms. Thus you get less than the full benefit out of argon being smaller.\n\nAdditionally, this comes at a reduction in thrust, because if you accelerate the same amount of argon atoms per time as you would xenon atoms, you accelerate less mass. Vastly less - throwing the argon faster will not compensate it. If on the other hand you wanted to have parity in thrust, you need to accelerate more argon atoms, which means each one is going to have less energy for itself, meaning it\u0027s going to not go as fast, meaning the Isp is not as high as you\u0027d hope for. And of course, the extra argon must also be ionized, which again takes away energy that would otherwise go into accelerating propellant.\n\nI\u0027ll admit that I don\u0027t know how exactly the numbers play out here, and would love to see some proper, hard math on it.\n\nFinally (fourth point), thruster architecture has a far, far larger impact on thrust and Isp than the fuel choice. Two thrusters that are often compared are the VX-200 VASIMR and the Dual-Stage 4-Grid ion thruster, because they both run in similar power envelopes (~200 kW vs ~250 kW) yet represent drastically different engineering solutions. The former achieves 5 N thrust with 5,000s Isp with argon, the latter achieves 2.5 N thrust at 19,300s Isp with xenon. Argon is clearly the high thrust, low Isp option in this pairing; the argon engine gives you more than twice the thrust of the xenon engine for the same power investment, while the xenon engine is leaps and bounds ahead in terms of Isp. How does that fit together with the story that argon is better at producing high Isp? It clearly doesn\u0027t, which underlines that the choice between the two is largely unimportant in designing an electric engine for a specific performance target, and the differences are not nearly as big as they seem. I\u0027m pretty sure Ad Astra could have used xenon as well and hit a very similar performance target. It\u0027s just that the VX-200, with its intended performance being what it is, has a significantly greater throughput of reaction mass per second than the DS4G, or indeed any other electric engine ever fired. You really don\u0027t want an expensive fuel for this kind of throughput, because the cost of filling up the tanks will get into regions that can no longer be as easily written off / ignored. This counts double if the vessel in question is supposed to be refueled and reused, like many VASIMR utilization ideas are.\n\n(Your third point, while technically true, is not practically relevant to the discussion at hand.)"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T13:53:55Z","Content":"Hmm, that hipep does sound pretty good, and yes, I acknoweldge that argon is going to get you much less thrust than Xenon for the same Isp, untill you start getting really really really high Isps - then the difference in thrust will be smaller.\n\n\u0022For starters, because it takes more energy to ionize the smaller element (because it clings harder to its electrons), that means that out of a finite energy budget,\u0022\n\nThis is true, but You need to ionize 3.3x as much argon to have the same mass of ionized argon as Xenon. It takes more energy to ionize the argon, but this is minor relative to the mass difference. Argon\u0027s ionization energy is 15.75, xenon\u0027s is 12.13 -\u003E nearly 1.3x more per atom, doesn\u0027t really compare much to the 3.3x number of atoms needed.\n\nIf you were to accelerate argon or Xenon atoms to .99C, you wouldn\u0027t really care about the ionization energy at that point.\n\nAlso, argon gives you more charge per mass, which should help you accelerate particles in a shorter distance, no?\n\nIt should also aid in reaching a higher maximum Isp... even if the thrust production at that maximum Isp is not very useful, a higher maximum Isp is an advantage... just not a very practical one.\n\n\u0022out of a finite energy budget, you have less energy remaining to spend on accelerating the propellant after ionization\u0022\n\nYes, which is why Xenon is preferred.\n\nI\u0027m just saying, hypothetically, if you are spending the vast majority of your energy accelerating the propellant (such as the unreasonable case of .99c exhaust velocity), then argon should be better.\n\nIn general, as required Isp goes up, the relative advantage of Xenon gets smaller.\n\n\u0022if you accelerate the same amount of argon atoms per time as you would xenon atoms, you accelerate less mass. Vastly less - throwing the argon faster will not compensate it\u0022\n\nWell, it could, but you\u0027d need to throw them 3.3x faster, for 3.3x the energy (1/2(m/3.3)\\*(3.3V)^2 = 3.3\\*1/2\\*MV^2\n\nYou\u0027d get 3.3x the Isp at the same time.\n\nObviously, higher Isps come with proportionately higher power demands.\n\nIn the same mass flow\u002B exhaust velocity(Isp) scenario, Argon loses due mainly to needing to ionize more atoms.\n\nThe question of how badly it loses is simply a matter of what % of your energy is going to ionization.\n\nThis % gets arbitrarily low as your Isp gets arbitrarily high.\n\nFor a very very high Isp engine, argon should work fine.\n\nIf that Dual-Stage 4-Grid ion thruster really does get 2.5N at 19,300 Isp... then it would seem to be preferred to argon and the Vasmir.\n\nYes Xenon is expensive, but \\*any\\* mass in orbit is expensive.\n\nYou can take the price of anything on Earth, and add about $4,300/kg to it in orbit.\n\nXenon is then only 30% more expensive, if you get more than 30% more Isp at useful thrust due to ionization energy savings, it is cheaper to use Xenon.\n\nBut 19,300 Isp is getting quite high...

I wonder how much thrust loss it would suffer from switching to argon, it may not be so bad.\n\nWe probably won\u0027t find out anytime soon... ESA shelved the DS4G after initial technology validation testing because there is no usecase for it, and it never went anywhere near flight hardware. Nothing has been done with it in a decade or so. I saw a short mention that some university work managed to preserve performance while removing the fourth grid, creating a simplified dual-stage 3-grid thruster (normal gridded ion thrusters only have three grids and a single stage) but that may well have been a theoretical exercise as a PhD thesis.\n\nThere\u0027s a complex relationship between power density and Isp and desired mission profile that I don\u0027t personally understand fully (in fact I may even screw up this small description of it), which states that for a given power supply and a certain dV requirement and a certain payload, there exists an optimal engine Isp to fly this mission. And for typical applications in the Earth-Moon system, these optimal Isp numbers are only around 3,000-6,000 seconds. Ad Astra knows well what they\u0027re doing with the VX-200 being targeted at 5,000s, because that is what customers will actually want to buy. The DS4G is an impressive demonstration of technology, but it\u0027s impractical for actual usage in the near term.\n\nThe optimal Isp values go up for missions that require more dV (obviously), but also for improved power solutions. So as time goes by and solar panels improve and perhaps new non-solar power sources make an appearance, there will be demand for higher Isp engines. Something like a small onboard reactor would be a good argument to dig the DS4G back out - it would lend itself to high Isp\u0027s both through a better power density and through enabling high dV mission profiles into remote areas of the solar system where we traditionally have not been able to generate sufficient power for electric engines."},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy12","CreatedById":103022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T16:11:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s a complex relationship between power density and Isp and desired mission profile that I don\u0027t personally understand fully (in fact I may even screw up this small description of it), which states that for a given power supply and a certain dV requirement and a certain payload, there exists an optimal engine Isp to fly this mission. And for typical applications in the Earth-Moon system, these optimal Isp numbers are only around 3,000-6,000 seconds. Ad Astra knows well what they\u0027re doing with the VX-200 being targeted at 5,000s, because that is what customers will actually want to buy. The DS4G is an impressive demonstration of technology, but it\u0027s impractical for actual usage in the near term.\n\u003E \n\u003E .\n\nThat complex relationship is any of these engines are sending a continuous stream of mass in a line out the back. The mass \\* velocity of this line = momentum change of the spacecraft. Momentum change is also known as \u0022impulse\u0022. so, the effect of the engine you care about is just the equation impulse = mass\\_propellant \\* velocity\\_exhaust.\n\nWell, the energy you need to accelerate the propellant to that velocity is just :\n\nEnergy\\_Required = (1/efficiency\\_engine) \\* (1/2 \\* mass\\_propellant \\* velocity\\_exhaust^2)\n\nSee the problem? Let\u0027s say you have 2 electric engines, and they are 50% efficient. One has double the ISP of the other. Since ISP is double, impulse is double, and therefore exhaust velocity is double. This means that Energy\\_required = (1/0.5) \\* 1/2 \\* (1/2)mass\\_propellant \\* 2\\*velocity\\_1^2. Or, energy requirements double for the same impulse.\n\nThat\u0027s all it is. A dual stage 4 grid, by this fundamental equation, means that since it has about 3 times the ISP, will require 3 times the energy for the same change in velocity. \n\nCurrently, that energy has to come from solar panels. Since you need 3 times the energy, but your panels haven\u0027t gotten any larger, you accelerate 3 times slower with a more efficient engine. As you know, the Dawn probe Ion engine is already crap for thrust, cutting it back by a factor of 3 (or even 6) isn\u0027t helping you any.\n\nSolutions : if it\u0027s an inner planets probe, you could launch a bigger rocket from the ground, and basically pack in a much larger solar panel. If half the mass of the probe is a solar panel, it would be a much better power:weight ratio.\n\nIf it\u0027s outer planets, you need high power nuclear. None of this \u0022SAFE-400\u0022 crap, I suspect the quoted 100 kilowatts/500 kilograms for that reactor is not an adequate power:mass ratio. You\u0027d need something really pushing it, and minimal to no shielding to slow you down.\n\nAnyways, if you had such a reactor, some of the older electric thruster designs like MPD would have been fine.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T16:15:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 04:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy12**"},{"CreatedByName":"Andersenman","CreatedById":61273,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T14:29:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The ELF thruster is supposed to be able to operate on many different propellants.\n\nNote that it says \u0022any type of propellant\u0022, not \u0022anything as propellant\u0022.
