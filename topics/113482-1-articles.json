This is why we need to send people back to the moon, to answer proper science questions like this.\n\nEDIT: NASA disagrees with me:\n\n*\u0022Lunar dust has some interesting qualities, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s clearly not play material for children or adults. Building a sandcastle on the moon would be dangerous and impossible. No liquid water puts a stop to sandcastle creations. On Earth, water sticks to the sand, and causes sand particles to stick to each other. On the moon, because there is no water, lunar dust cannot stick to itself. You could never build a sandcastle on the moon.*\n\nSource: [http://education.jsc.nasa.gov/explorers/p10.html\u0022](http://education.jsc.nasa.gov/explorers/p10.html)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T13:47:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 01:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deddly**"},{"CreatedByName":"RandomRyan","CreatedById":142844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T13:49:32Z","Content":"This happened before i exit a game:\n\nplayin my save,sent Lodzer to Minmus,land on the Mint-ish planet\n\nand went back home.(not sure if this helps or not)"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T15:01:42Z","Content":"I\u0027ve seen it 3 times, and it is still a huge suprise!\n\nIncredibly, two of the times were right after each other!"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T16:19:47Z","Content":"I\u0027ve always wanted there to be a \u0027build sandcastle\u0027 action on the right-click menu"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T16:40:56Z","Content":"I\u0027ve seen it once"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T16:45:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s right there in the first post.\n\u003E ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nHaha, Shapget, I meant in my game! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T17:20:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I read the KSwiki, it says you only have 1/40 chance to make this happen.\n\u003E (i must be really lucky:cool:)\n\nIf you\u0027ve played less than 40 times, yeah, but if you\u0027ve amassed hundreds of hours like me and so many others in this forum... ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nBut yeah, I enjoy seeing that sand castle every time."}]}
