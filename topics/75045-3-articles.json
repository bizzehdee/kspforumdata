CANDU\u0027s calandria refueling system enables you to put whatever you want inside while the thing is working. That way, you can get your matter of choice irradiated in the intense neutron flux. This is exactly how RBMK produced plutonium.\u003Cp\u003EYes, there are more efficient ways to do it, but this is way more easier than messing with spent LWR fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept the CANDU design is very sensitive to fuel balancing. I\u0027ve never seen any credible evidence that trying to stick any old fissile material in one of the fuel tubes would even work; in fact everything I\u0027ve read on them suggests the opposite. It\u0027s more likely that it\u0027d prevent itself and the surrounding fuel from reaching criticality. The CANDU design has very little in the way of excess reactivity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/Whitlock_IAEA_conf_Oct_2009.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nuclearfaq.ca/Whitlock_IAEA_conf_Oct_2009.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause of these features (low excess reactivity and constraints of fuelling machine operation), it is not credible that a CANDU reactor core could be operated for significant durations at low core burnup for the purpose of high-purity fissile plutonium production. The fuelling machines are not capable of the sustained duty cycle this would require and hence the reactor would not be able to maintain safety margins, nor remain critical.\u003Cp\u003EThe CANDU core as a whole is sensitive to fuel management decisions, and regional reactivity must be monitored and balanced as an integral part of steady-state operation. The flux throughout the core is measured with an array of in-core flux detectors, and this information would clearly indicate any deviations in fuel management from nominal operation. As this information is available to the IAEA for verification of declared operation parameters, this provides an additional level of oversight of the operation of CANDU, and confidence that it is being operated within its design envelope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also affects the capability for rapid refuelling of selected channels, but also the capability to maintain regional overpower margins, and ultimately core reactivity. Thus the inherently low excess reactivity of the CANDU core, the highly complex and mission-oriented nature of the fuelling machines designed to maintain steady core power under these restrictive conditions, and the requirement to fully characterize the core flux distribution on a continuous basis, combine to discourage misuse of the core for the purposes of weapons-grade material production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGotta love that one of the arguments against trying to use a CANDU reactor for plutonium production is that you\u0027d probably break the refuelling machines and the reactor too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you are still concerned, you can always email the guy.

I\u0027m talking about a timescale starting at the present day. Why? For one because that\u0027s what\u0027s most relevant. How long it took for a technology to finally be developed to a level ready for practical use is immaterial to its practical applications. Let\u0027s take the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_battery\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehistory of the battery\u003C/a\u003E. If you go back to the very first battery, one could say that the battery has been in development for over a thousand years! Why on earth should we expect anything more to come out of battery technology in a mere decade, when it took over a thousand years just to get from the most basic voltaic cell to the rechargeable batteries we use today? I hope you can see the problem with this reasoning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApplied to fusion power, we could easily go back and say \u0022Well, fusion requires nuclear physics.

Just like nuclear fission, fusion isn\u0027t so simple.

These designs have the very real possibility of reaching net power output within a decade. The tokamak design, as I\u0027ve said before on these forums numerous times lately, is something of a giant drain we\u0027re throwing money into. There\u0027s little to no reason to expect that the tokamak will ever produce a net energy output. Why have we been slaving over this doomed design for so long? Bad policy. The US DoE decided, against the advice of many, many experts in the field of plasma physics (including proponents of the tokamak design) to pursue the tokamak design exclusively. It was a very stupid, very narrow-minded decision that prevented other far more promising fusion designs from ever being funded to anywhere near the levels that JET and ITER now enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr what?

Jumping the gun, aren\u0027t we? If I didn\u0027t care about climate change, why would I even bother arguing for nuclear power? Coal is a far cheaper source of power, and if we simply deregulated it entirely we could even burn it without those pesky limestone filters.
