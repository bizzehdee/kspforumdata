It comes off as completely lazy and unprofessional when the opening screen contains a grievously obvious misspelled word, hint: it was miscellaneous. The second part is ... MechJeb? I\u0027m sure its was so you could focus on recording instead of flying, but personally I would\u0027ve suggested hiding its presence. This is just a personal thing, but it undermines the whole \u0027first Kerbal in space\u0027. MechJeb has an immediate, permanent, negative impact on the impressiveness of any activity in KSP. But, I\u0027m sure that varies from viewer to viewer so your mileage may vary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now, the positive: the music worked really well. At first I didn\u0027t like some of its off-notes, but it has a driving tempo which you utilized well for scene transitions. It also matched with the subject matter nicely and helped the whole video \u0027pop\u0027. I enjoyed your use of fades between the ship and the orbital map, it helped cement the position of the ship in the mission timeline. And most importantly, unlike your previous Duna video, this one has a very coherent sequence of events, avoids abrupt jumps and tells a complete story that is easy to understand and follow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
