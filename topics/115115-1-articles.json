From your video it doesn\u0027t appear that there are any phantom control inputs. Can you repeat the problem creating a new save? Do the first run, putting the ship in orbit and after you quit take a copy of the whole save folder and the output_log.txt file in KSP_Data. Then do the next run where the ship spins and after leaving it spinning for at least several seconds, quit back out of the game and copy the output_log.txt file again (as a different name). Then zip up all of that and upload it to a file sharing site (e.g. dropbox) and post a link. Then, we can take a look in the logs to see if there is any indication of a problem and we can try loading your save and see if we also get the spin...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T18:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Targa\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Targa\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMk16 parachute\u003Cp\u003EMk1 Command Pod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T45 engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETR-18A Stack Decoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you put an engine in without a fuel tank?
