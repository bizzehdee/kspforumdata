Some quick Internet searching shows me that there are some \u0022working\u0022 telescope mods, but I didn\u0027t see any that would detect Kethane deposits. (I\u0027m talking kerbin orbit for the telescope and it detecting on whatever body is in its sights). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone heard of such a mod??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T21:33:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that\u0027s possible without additional plugins.
