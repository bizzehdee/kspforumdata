If you\u2019re going for a fairly stock-like set of mods, this is probably the one you want as it\u2019s the simplest to use and even adds the same cooling abilities to\u00A0stock fuel tanks and those from some other mods too,\u00A0however that electric cost starts stacking up with larger tanks and when you\u2019re far from the Sun you\u2019ll need nuclear reactors to cool all those tanks, or you can switch the cooling off and watch your fuel slowly disappear...\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRealism Overhaul and the various mods that power it use a different, and realistic, approach- you can add insulation to your tanks which reduces (but never totally prevents) cryogenic fuels (hydrogen, methane, fluorine, oxygen and so on) from boiling off, but the downside is that these add mass and if you expose them to air heating during launch they \u003Ci\u003Ewill\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0catch fire and explode.
