I don\u0027t know if this has been done before but I\u0027ve been thinking lately of a challenge that would be rather difficult. Getting 100% science (by 100% science I mean running each science experiment in each biome, not necessarily getting full science points from each biome, however that would beef up your score)\u00A0\u00A0from all Kerbin System bodies. This may take some time so Maybe we can start with Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and work out to the edge of the system. Im looking to develop this challenge with some feed back from y\u0027all \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0I imagine the challenge working something like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere would be a minimum number of nodes you would be required to unlock in the STOCK tech tree that unlock all of the science gizmos. From that point it would to see how far, how much science you collect with out unlocking anymore tech tree nodes. Each tech tree node you unlocked in addition to the science nodes would limit the available science left in the universe and thus limit what your maximum score could be. Lets say\u00A0each node cost 50 science for example and the Kerbin universe contains 10000 science and there are 5 science nodes in the tech tree that means that the maximum score you could obtain would be 9750 science. and each additional node would be -50. But as we know the tech gets more expensive the more we unlock! in addition to the game being 100% stock for consistency, the mobile processing lab is prohibited. Each experiment must be returned via a manned mission\u00A0at least one time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me know you thoughts,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeafy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
