In KSP it takes less time because we usually thrust around and burn a lot of fuel, because fuel is cheap and the distances are much smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe usual technique in real life is to inject into an orbit as close as possible to the target, but slightly lower, and to take time to catch up with it slowly. This saves fuel (which allows more payload), and prevents coming in on the target at high speeds and doing last-minute decelerations KSP-style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in March, the Russians actually performed the first ever direct rendez-vous where they took 6 hours instead of several days.
