That way you\u0027d have things were you \u0027need\u0027 to bring a Kerbal and that would make a difference between Probe and Manned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have an Idea, what about a compromise, let me explain:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets implement a Life Support System but not in a way of a Ressource. Lets pretend every command module would\u0027ve implemented Life support things in there directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike some plancton-cleaner converting CO2 back to O2 and producing new snacks with the Carbon and other extracted things and Recycler converting Urine to Water. Lets pretend such a thing is implemented in every Pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now you\u0027d have some sort of Timer how long you can stay on EVA , so no Command Seat missions anymore. And every Pod would consume an amount of Electricity per Second. So Life support would be a \u0027balancing out energy supply\u0027 problem rather than a \u0027we need 10t more snacks on the ship\u0027 problem. And if it runs we would still save the Kerbalish way of doing missions. If a Pod runs out of Energy for Life support another timer would start how long this Pod can provide support while unpowered, so with the assumed left snacks until their empty and until the Kerbals will die due to CO2. A bigger Pod can provide a bigger Time unpowered with the Hitchiker and the Lab being the best. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother useful thing in such a scenario would be a generator producing electricity from fuel and oxidizer as your last hope in the night, but such a generator was already announced to come so no problem there. A Manned mission would need much more electric charge per second than a probe mission, which is the same way in real but not in KSP right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would implement Life support in a believable way while keeping it a balancing and not a more fuel problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat doya think?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-09T20:36:11Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2014 08:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRex94\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T20:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Levelord\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Levelord\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis still doesn\u0027t answer my question of why SQUAD has refused to implement this.

Look at using a maneuver node. You do the actual piloting, which is planning the burn. Then you have to execute it within whatever slop you can on the navball (assuming you are not using some mod to do this with 100% accuracy). You can elect to do it yourself, or you could let jeb do it. He would start the burn \u002B-the ideal start time based upon his skill. He would point the ship \u002B-his skill.
