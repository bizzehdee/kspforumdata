It will also be beneficial to increase the angle of incidence on your main wings. With four RAPIERS, you will only need one shock cone intake.\u00A0 Looking at your mass, you can probably also remove a couple of the RAPIERS.

To keep drag down, angle your wings by a few degrees so the front (leading) edge is higher than the rear (trailing) edge- this will make the wings generate lift when the fuselage is level and so generating minimal lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRapiers work better the faster you go so build up speed before climbing, you can easily hit 1500m/s in air-breathing mode and then climb to space. Four Rapiers are a bit overkill for a plane that size and you definitely don\u2019t need four shock cones, try two engines and a single shock cone on the nose- switch to the in-line Mk2 cockpit for that- and ditch the wingtip nacelles to save weight and reduce drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCanards near the nose might make the plane handle a bit better by giving it more pitch authority and would also balance the increased lift from angling the main wings. Removing two engines would also move the centre of mass forwards though which might mean canards are less useful. You should also look at any parts you don\u2019t absolutely need (the docking port perhaps? and/or swap to an unscrewed design using the Mk2 drone core and a mk2-1.25m adapter instead of a cockpit) and remove them to reduce mass and so increase delta-V; even removing any unnecessary propellants can help, with the NERV running solely on liquid fuel you only need enough oxidiser to boost your way out of the atmosphere and unless you\u2019re docking you don\u2019t need any monopropellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
