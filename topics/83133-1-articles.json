Now after getting back into the game to check out all the great things that have changed, I finally WANT to go to space. But I have a few issues in that area I\u0027m trying to figure out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI absolutely NEED to have FAR, but I didn\u0027t realize how serious the \u0022horror stories\u0022 were when they said how easy it is to get to orbit. So I thought I\u0027d embrace RealFuel, RftS Engines, and KIDS(FAR to Real Adj setting). This is more like it... but I\u0027m having a monster of a time trying to control the speeds of my contraptions. I either end up with a rediculous Apoapsis near the Mun, or I break apart trying to pitch down a bit. This is made extremely more difficult because of the engines pack having limits on throttling down. The early engines especially have little to no throttling down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I just give up and go big with RSS? Or is there some combo of realism that works and makes sense with stock Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T02:22:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you know what my *first* answer will be \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I take that back: a good first answer is actually to try out the 6.4x scaleup. If you\u0027re using FAR and RF, then likely it will \u0022feel\u0022 about as easy to get into orbit as stock KSP does with stock aero and parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to say Kerbol-sized, then you\u0027re going to have to pitch over very quickly, do reasonably flat ascents, and use very-high-thrust upper stages (so you can leave a lot of the burn for circularization).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wrexecute","CreatedById":75580,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T04:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI will try out both the 6.4 and the full sized RSS.

You don\u0027t need to be pulling 2G at liftoff. Cut back to where your rocket lifts off fairly slowly initially, maybe 1.2 to 1.5 G max. While you burn a bit more fuel initially fighting gravity, you may save some fuel from the reduced drag by not exceeding terminal velocity. And as your altitude increases and fuel is expended your TWR will go up. It sounds like your TWR is way too high by the time you break atmo, so cutting the initial thrust back will help there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I\u0027m guessing you have one big beefy stage to get you into space? If so, the increase in TWR/acceleration from launch to space will be huge as your rocket\u0027s mass will drop to a fraction of its initial as all that fuel is expended. Look at adding a stage or boosters to get you about half way to space and then drop them. Then your second stage should be designed to take you the rest of the way out of atmo and then circularize. Or better, drop off just before you completely circularize so that it falls back into atmosphere so you don\u0027t have orbital debris build up. Then circularize with the next stage and use it to complete your mission, transfer burn or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you try the 6.4x rescale (my personal choice for best mix of challenge and playability) you will need a lot more rocket to get into space - about 7500 dV to orbit. If you are playing campaign that will mean your rockets will cost several times as much as stock Kerbin. In that case, I recommend you look at the Stage Recovery mod and design your lower rocket stages and boosters to be recoverable because you will need to recover those funds. Or do a lot of very efficient contracts to make up the extra money.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T15:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs NathanKell points out 6.4x is a great place to get started with the Real Mods. I recommend using Real Fuels \u002B the engine config of your choice, RSS \u002B 6.4x Kerbin config, FAR, DRE \u002B RSS-class heatshields, Procedural Parts (trust me you\u0027ll want the tanks), and anything else you want to slap on. If you\u0027re using 6.4x Kerbin I recommend NOT using Realism Overhaul for the simple fact that 6.4x Kerbin is 6.4x as big as stock for a reason, that being parts in KSP stock are 64% as large as their real counterparts. This also means you can continue to use your favorite parts packs without worrying whether they have an RO config yet. As EatVacuum says, you\u0027ll need around 7~7.5km/s to get to orbit which, with Real Fuels and engines and tanks, will give you a payload fraction of somewhere around 7% or better. This, IMO, is a good way to ease into the KSP \u0022Realism scene\u0022 while avoiding a lot of possible \u0022culture shock\u0022.

It was way too powerful, and I built a lifelike R7 to compare. The R7 slowly inches up the launch clamps, beautiful star-shaped separation with no heat or flipping issues, and gets into a nice parking orbit. My other one by contrast, took off like a bottle-rocket, sometimes losing structural integrity on the way up.
