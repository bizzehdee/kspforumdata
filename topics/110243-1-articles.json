Either an on/off tweakable or a slider, adds mass and cost and switches textures, but improves the ability of the part to deal with heat. Not sure which parameters to tweak, I haven\u0027t played around with the new heat system beyond figuring out what works for reentry, so I don\u0027t know if just bumping up the heat limit of the part would produce reasonable results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

I\u0027ve had several rockets CATO due to severe overheating caused by sepatrons. Usually it means I have to find angles where the rocket motors still have enough oomph to push the booster away but aren\u0027t pointing at the core of the rocket, but real rockets use patches of ablative material around the exhaust of verniers, retro rockets and the like to protect the rest of the rocket from the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T18:32:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Capt.
