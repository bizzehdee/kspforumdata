The first is that design choices are trivialized because you just use whatever you most recently unlocked because its better.

What i mean is this: In most games with a tech-tree you know exactly what the tech you choose will give you and how long it will take to research it and the exact cost of researching it. That\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s like Oppenheimer stating in 1942 that by summer 45 3 bombs will be ready for use and each will have a yield of xx kT, a weight of y and... you get the idea. It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s quite unrealistic and imho also kind of boring gameplay wise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d prefer to have general fields.

A certain level of one or more of these fields could then open up prototype research for the actual parts. So, say, you got nuclear physics level 3, but no electronics, yet. This may allow you to research some sort of nuclear solid booster thingie (not throttlable nuclear thruster). You can invest into researching that, or skip it, get into electronics instead, and when you reached a certain level there the prototype-research for the actual nerva (throttable) becomes avaiable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cost for each new level in any field, as well as for the prototypes, should only be given as a vague string.

Have a few different major categories to work on: command pods, engine power, fuel capacity, control, science, structural, and utility (almost all of these being existing categories, of course). Each type would be limited in what you can develop depending on how much of the current level\u0027s options you\u0027ve unlocked for that particular tier and category. If the player wants to advance their Kerbals from simple orbiters to interplanetary missions in 3 launches flat, I say give them the option through a flexible tech tree like this.
