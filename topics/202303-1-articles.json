The only contract I could hope to complete was the one to investigate the crashed vessel in the arctic (from Anomaly Surveyor) and so I built a tiny plane to take me to the north pole. But, I made a couple of design errors, and the plane could barely stay aloft. Knowing that I couldn\u0027t afford to abort the mission, I toughed it out, and this is the result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/bA-XrNLYrtU?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-13T20:41:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPiffle.
