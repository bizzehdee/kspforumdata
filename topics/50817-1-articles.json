Why not make each kerbal have a \u0022science skill\u0022 just like their stupidity or courage and make it so that you can conduct an experiment and then as well as \u0022transmit findings\u0022 have a \u0022send to kerbal\u0022 option that allows you to get more science presuming the capsule that the kerbal is in survives?
