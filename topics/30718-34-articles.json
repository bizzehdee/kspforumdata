Thousands more watched the recovery ship\u2019s triumphant return to port, scorched reentry capsule lashed to it\u2019s deck. They lined the streets, a clamorous, worshipful multitude jostling for a view of the three M\u00FCn voyagers. Three of their own, two of them born and raised in nearby Groves, ordinary kerbals-in-the-street to look at \u2013 but only to look at.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree kerbonauts, hair still damp and smelling faintly of disinfectant, waved at the crowds through their car windows. Although the very idea had been roundly dismissed by most reputable scholars, the persistent fears of something living on the M\u00FCn and being brought back to Kerbin had proved hard to dispel. As a result, after a slow tour of the busiest streets, Jeb, Jondun and Malmy were whisked away to the Barkton medical centre for a week under observation, the medical centre staff keeping a close eye on the crowds of well-wishers waiting outside. Amusement turned to surprise which segued into disbelief followed by exasperation as the days dragged on, but eventually the few still remaining were rewarded for their patience. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E car drove away leaving behind a group of excited kerbals clutching signed posters and other crowning additions to their collections of space memorabilia.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time the car pulled up at the Space Centre, Kerbol was setting behind the Vehicle Assembly Building, casting long shadows over the stands and smaller buildings. Geneney unlocked the museum doors and waved the three kerbonauts inside. He flicked the lights on and stood quietly to one side, letting them take in the refurbished exhibits in their own time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u2019s eyes flicked over the first exhibit with it\u2019s familar \u003Cem\u003EKerbal\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EMoho\u003C/em\u003E capsules on their stands. Behind them, sets of photographs gleamed in new frames: Bill\u2019s original snaps of Kerbin taken from \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E, Geneney, Wernher and Lucan riding out to the launchpad and the waiting \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E, photographs of half built capsules and ascending \u003Cem\u003EMoho\u003C/em\u003E boosters. He smiled faintly at the large \u2018First Steps to the Unknown\u2019 signboard suspended overhead before turning his attention to the second exhibit: \u2018Working Together in Space.\u2019\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere, the \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E capsule sat side by side with their borrowed Rockomax docking adaptor, still mounted on its mysteriously acquired dolly and facing an engineering mockup of the \u003Cem\u003EEve\u003C/em\u003E docking ring on its stand. Photographs of the \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003ENext Step\u003C/em\u003E spacecraft joined nose-to-nose in orbit adorned the wall behind them, together with pictures of their crews floating together inside.

Above the first of three large display boards, a plainly printed banner simply read: \u2018We, voyagers from the planet Kerbin\u2026\u2019 Below it, pictures of the Munar far side taken from the \u003Cem\u003EMuna 2\u003C/em\u003E probe sat side by side with pictures of Kerbin framed in \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E\u2019s rendezvous window, and the first pictures of Kerbin rising over the M\u00FCn. Next to them, \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 2\u003C/em\u003E floated high above the Great Tranquil Sea and Barrie stood atop \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 3\u2019\u003C/em\u003Es service module, circling the M\u00FCn with Seanan\u2019s signpost clutched across her chest.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second display board labelled: \u2018First set foot upon the M\u00FCn\u2026\u2019 showed pictures of himself and Jondun working on the Munar surface arranged around a huge blown-up photograph of the two of them shaking hands in front of the flag of all Kerbin. Then Jeb turned to the third board and a shiver ran down his back. Labelled: \u2019We came in peace for Kerm and Kerbal\u2019 , it didn\u2019t have any pictures of space or spacecraft. Instead it was full of kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Kerbals packed into village halls. Winding queues of kerbals waiting patiently outside cinemas. A great ocean of green figures surrounding the Capital building and its seven huge screens. The Council of Twelve Pillars themselves, seated in front of one of the screens, watching two space-suited figures walking against a backdrop of grey. And one blurry, pixellated photograph of a group of uniformed kerbals sitting beneath a pair of flags.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe got that one in the post.\u201D\u00A0 Jeb jumped, head snapping round to see a sombre Geneney standing beside him. \u201CSent anonymously but with a letter inside.

Sure it takes djo\u2026 it takes confidence to strap yourself to the top of a rocket, but going in circles \u2018round Kerbin just looked like sightseeing to me. Landing on the M\u00FCn though - now that was different. That was laying everything on the line. A lot of\u2026stuff to go wrong and if it did go wrong?\u201D He spread his hands. \u201CGame over.

Obrick\u2019s voice turned suddenly serious. \u201CMake no mistake my friends - this will not be easy\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAnd that has to be the biggest understatement of all time.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026Engineers and agronomists, young and old, kerman and kermol. Volunteers to forge our new path and lead us to our new home on another world\u2026 Volunteers for Project Starseed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWell at least they picked a proper name for their madness.\u003C/em\u003E Al stared at a picture of himself sitting in a prototype \u003Cem\u003ECloudrunner\u003C/em\u003E single seat racer, remembering newspaper photographs of the same jets on the runway at Humilisia, torpedoes slung under their fuselages. His gaze turned bleak at the other memories. At television footage of Kerm saplings in grotesquely oversized planters being hoisted off a ship whilst armed guards escorted sullen villagers and frightened kerblets down the gangplanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAlthough their madness beats\u003C/em\u003E that \u003Cem\u003Emadness every which way. And its going to take a whole lot of flying to pull off - they\u2019ll be looking for any pilots they can lay their hands on\u003C/em\u003E. Al picked up a pen and tapped it thoughtfully against his teeth. \u003Cem\u003EHah. Maybe they\u2019ll even need flight-qualified desk jockeys, even if they\u2019re not going to stick me in a Munar lander anytime soon\u003C/em\u003E. He shook his head. \u00A0\u003Cem\u003EA thousand metres off the floor, barrelling in at Kerm knows what speed, radar crapping out and rocks all over the runway. Yeah, their flight director wasn\u2019t messing. That was good flying.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAl put his pen down, pulled over his card index and began flipping through it. \u003Cem\u003EAnd the President got one thing dead right. They\u2019re\u2026 no\u003C/em\u003E we\u2019re \u003Cem\u003Egoing to need better spacecraft\u003C/em\u003E.\u003Cem\u003E We ain\u2019t going to be lifting everyone to orbit three-by-three in a bunch of tin cans.\u003C/em\u003E He grunted. \u003Cem\u003EThere it is. And I\u2019ll just bet that Mr Lodan is gonna be interested in an air breathing rocket engine right now\u003C/em\u003E. He picked up his phone and dialled a number.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKerbin Space Agency. Director Lodan\u2019s office. How can I help you?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bomb exploded with a sharp, firecracker retort.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe torrent of flame pouring out of the SK2-G rocket engine flickered for a barely discernible instant before recovering. Thirty seconds later the engine shut down with a vast, sooty orange belch, leaving nothing but a dissipating cloud of steam and smoke and the pinking of slowly cooling metal.\u00A0Hanbal turned to the engineers seated at the consoles beside him. \u201CDamping time?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLess than point one seconds.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal pursed his lips. \u201CConsistent with the rest of the test series then?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCompletely.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal nodded at Danfen, who was standing quietly by the door, then turned to face his test team. \u201CIn that case, I think we\u2019ve got ourselves a new rocket engine.\u201D He bowed his head in thought before straightening up with a smile. \u201CGood kerbals, I give you the SK2-M \u2018Mainsail\u2019!\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a brief patter of applause and more than a few sighs of relief. Groups of serious looking kerbals nodded in satisfaction at a job well done, before congregating around the test consoles to study the data. Later, Hanbal knew, there would be time to celebrate, but for the moment, there were reports to fill in and numbers to double check before any kerbal in the room would declare him or herself satisfied. \u003Cem\u003ENo quibbles about the name though\u003C/em\u003E. He walked over to join Danfen. \u201CWe did it,\u201D he said softly. \u201COver twice the thrust of a Skipper and only a little less efficient in atmosphere.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen was a picture of barely contained excitement. \u201CThe thrust assembly and tankage for the KDSS test flights are on schedule. We\u2019re recruiting heavily for the surface exploration teams - Bob\u2019s crew are busy with the landers for Pioneers 5 and 6 but we\u2019ll finally have the resources to build the Mark 2 - and rover - in parallel!\u201D His eyes shone. \u201CKDSS will be plenty for the new Endurance modules too. We\u2019re finally getting there, Han - bigger and better!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal looked around and then shot Danfen a quick grin. \u201CAbout that,\u201D he said. \u201CStep into my office for a minute?\u201D Danfen nodded eagerly and followed him inside. Hanbal closed the door behind them and turned to find Danfen already staring open mouthed at the diagrams pinned to the wall. \u201CThey other two are just rough obviously,\u201D he said. \u201Cbut based on the numbers for the KDS and KDS Stretch, I think we can make them work.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe gestured at the wall. \u201CThe KDS Stretch. Extended tankage, bulked up thrust frame and central Mainsail engine but otherwise similar to the KDS. Four Skippers on lateral boosters, Poodle for the second stage.\u201D He spotted Danfen\u2019s raised eyebrows. \u201CSorry - team joke. But compared to the SK2-M, the 1G \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E a bit of a poodle.\u201D He cleared his throat. \u201CAnyhow - the Stretch got me thinking - what if we replaced all five Skippers with Mainsails? We\u2019d only need a pair of lateral Mainsails rather than four Skippers, which should make the thing simpler and lighter. Roncott actuators should be able to handle the extra weight on the decouplers.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal gestured at the third diagram. \u201CBut then I wondered if we should bother with lateral decouplers at all? Why not go back to an inline design and put all the engines on a single thrust frame. Simpler and stronger, although a five Mainsail first stage would be massively overpowered for a Poodle upper stage. So I figured we could go with a three stage design. Five Mainsails on the first stage, four, maybe five Skippers on the second stage and Kerm knows what on the third stage. Same expanded nozzle Poodle as the KDS most likely - it makes a decent enough vacuum engine.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWith the rest of the Mark 2 Pioneer stack on top,\u201D said Danfen, \u201CLander, rover, CSM - the lot.\u201D He shook his head. \u201CKerm - we could probably strap one of Ademone\u2019s habitation modules on there too and fire the whole lot off to Minmus!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal chuckled. \u201CIt might struggle with the CSM but actually, I think it \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E handle the rest.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney gestured at the door. \u201CAnyway, the rest of the team should be waiting in my office.\u201D He turned to Jondun. \u201CI expect you\u2019ll get all this from Ademone in a couple of days but you\u2019re welcome to join us anyway.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJondun nodded. \u201CI\u2019d appreciate that, Gene.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside, it was beginning to get dark. Small, low-set lamps glowed in the dusk, marking the paths between the warehouses. Geneney led the way over to the old vehicle assembly building, ushering them inside and locking the door behind them. Jondun fell into step beside Malmy as they crossed the factory floor, both letting Jeb go on ahead by unspoken agreement. Light spilled out of Geneney\u2019s office windows and Jondun saw a group of kerbals inside, sitting around a table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob and Wernher leapt to their feet, closely followed by Richlin and Ornie and for a moment, Jeb was mobbed by eager friends. Bill and Lucan stayed in their seats, Lucan beaming happily at everyone and, Jondun noticed, even Bill seeming to forget his normal reserve. Ribory and Seelan came over to congratulate her, Ribory\u2019s eyes shining brightly and a huge grin splitting Seelan\u2019s face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a long time, the conversation soared\u00A0thousands of kilometres from Kerbin. The veteran kerbonauts in the room listened intently to details of the flight, occasionally nodding in agreement. Those that had yet to fly a \u003Cem\u003EPioneer\u003C/em\u003E capsule paid particularly close attention, Lucan pulling out a notebook for a minute before grinning sheepishly and putting it back in his pocket. Bob and Geneney were most interested in the lander and how it handled, whilst Bill\u2019s questions were all about the radar and computer systems. But whatever their speciality, they all sat spellbound at Jeb and Jondun\u2019s pilots-eye description of the descent to the surface and the first M\u00FCnwalk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt last, Geneney tapped on the table for attention. \u201CMuch as I hate to break up the party,\u201D he said, \u201CI have some news from closer to home.\u201D He paused. \u201CSort of. Depends if you count the Koluclaw mountains as close to home.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u2019s mouth snapped shut. Ornie looked over at Geneney. \u201CAhh,\u201D he said, \u201CGot a plan for us have they?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUs and Rockomax both,\u201D said Geneney. \u003Cem\u003EEventually to be called the Kerballed Spaceflight Division,\u003C/em\u003E he added silently, \u003Cem\u003Ebut I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite ready for that old friend. Nor me for that matter\u003C/em\u003E. \u201CProbably easiest to think of it as Pioneer Plus. We\u2019re both getting a significant injection of funds to ramp up our manufacturing capabilities. He glanced at Wernher. \u201CI gather we\u2019ll be getting a second \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E in time but for now the money is primarily to upgrade and expand our facilities here. That includes the machine shop, Assembly and Fitting, Propulsion and Testing, Kerbonaut training - everything. Rockomax are to focus on expanding their heavy lift capabilities, starting with more KDS boosters and moving onwards and upwards from there.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb narrowed his eyes. \u0022Upwards?\u0022 he said. \u0022What exactly does Lodan have in mind?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If you\u0027d give me a minute,\u0022 said Geneney patiently. \u0022Basically a complete M\u00FCn - and Minmus,\u0022 he paused to let the words sink in, \u0022prospecting programme. Enhanced satellite networks around both muns for remote sensing and communications. Extended surface expeditions for geological surveys. Trips to the Munar poles to search for usable ice deposits. In short, we\u0027re going to be the exploration and survey teams for Project Starseed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob\u0027s eyes lit up. \u0022Minmus,\u0022 he said softly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s going to take more than a Pioneer capsule,\u0022 said Ornie. \u201C\u2018Less you \u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E the crew to get a bad case of cabin fever on the way?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney shook his head. \u0022Ademone suggested adding an Endurance sized habitation module to the Pioneer stack,\u0022 he said. \u0022I\u0027m not sure I like the idea of juggling four modules around but it should work in principle. Anyhow, it\u0027s not tonight\u0027s problem.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why though?\u0022 asked Jondun. \u0022I thought we were going to Duna? Why so much effort on the muns?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Partly for practice,\u0022 said Geneney. \u0022We\u0027re gonna need a lot of trained kerbonauts for the Duna flights and munar flights are as good as it gets for that. Then there\u0027s hardware development - Minmus isn\u0027t much more than a short hop away compared to Duna but it\u0027s a sight further out than the M\u00FCn and gives us somewhere to figure out the details of interplanetary flights.\u0022 He stopped at the look on Jondun\u0027s face. \u0022Are you OK?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m fine, Gene,\u0022 said Jondun slowly. \u0022Just the way you\u0027re suddenly talking about interplanetary flights when we\u0027ve only just been to the M\u00FCn. It\u0027s going to take some getting used to.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tell me about it, \u0022 said Geneney dryly. \u0022Anyhow - the main reason we\u0027re going to be putting so much time into the M\u00FCn and Minmus is for resources. Fuel at first but maybe metals and the basics of off-world industry later on. Sounds far-fetched I know but the KSA have been studying this for a while.\u0022 He grinned at Jeb. \u0022According to Lodan, after Moho 1, the Twelve Pillars were worried about the damage to Kerbin\u0027s environment caused by hordes of kerbals following your example.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb blinked. \u0022And their solution was \u0027go big or go home?\u0027 he asked incredulously.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Apparently so, \u0022 said Geneney. \u0022I believe the exact phrase involved gronneks and bags but either way, they realised that if we could do it then other groups were probably going to try too - whether they liked it or not.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So they decided to try for damage limitation rather than excess legislation,\u0022 said Ribory. \u0022That was...unusually enlightened.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not to mention lucky,\u0022 agreed Geneney. \u0022But on a serious note, Starseed is going to need a lot of propellant one way or another. The less of it we have to haul all the way up from Kerbin the better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s going to mean getting a lot of kerbals to orbit too,\u0022 Jeb pointed out. \u0022Which is going to take a lot of rockets anyway - a couple of fuel haulers won\u0027t make a lot of difference.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s what Ademone and I thought,\u0022 said Geneney, \u0022but Lodan seemed almost cheerful about that part - for Lodan. He didn\u0027t say anything but we got the distinct impression that he has a plan in mind.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe might even tell us about it one day,\u201D muttered Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie coughed. \u201CI\u2019m wondering,\u201D he said, \u201Cwhat we\u2019re actually going to use as fuel? Ice\u2019ll be useful for plenty other things but it doesn\u2019t burn very well.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CElectrolyse it into hydrogen and oxygen.\u201D said Malmy. \u201CHydrogen is about the best fuel we could ask for.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf we can keep it cold enough,\u201D said Ornie. \u201CWhich won\u2019t be easy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Wernher slowly. \u201CBetter if we could just use the water. Which I think we can do but\u2026 Kerm. It\u2019s going to need Council permission at the very least.\u201D He looked at Jeb. \u201CAnd even then, a nuclear engine is going to be a tough sell.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMalmy choked. \u201C\u003Cem\u003ENuclear\u003C/em\u003E engines?\u201D he spluttered. Jondun and Lucan stared at Wernher in disbelief and even Ornie looked taken aback. Jeb however, burst out laughing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo big, go home or go nuclear! I can\u2019t wait to see the look on our dear Director\u2019s face when we tell hime about this!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, it makes sense,\u201D said Wernher\u00A0defensively, \u201CDepending how hot we can run the reactor, it should be more efficient than the LV-T30 or the SK1-G, even if we\u2019re only using water for the propellant. If we do work out a way of using hydrogen, a nuclear engine should be about twice as efficient as anything else that we have right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSaving the world with steam powered rockets!\u201D said Bob cheerfully. \u201CJoking apart though, I think you\u2019re right, Wernher. Being able to use water as fuel would be a huge advantage - if we can find any water to use.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike I said,\u201D said Geneney, \u201Cthat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been given our next job.\u201D He looked at Wernher thoughtfully. \u201CIf you can give me the rough numbers - and outline designs if you have them - I\u2019ll have a word with Lodan and Ademone about using nuclear engines. We\u2019re very definitely going to need Council permission to work on fissiles though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA rack of beaten-bronze watering cans stood by the open cemetery gate, next to a square stone pillar carved with sweetblossom vines. The taps jutting from each face of the pillar and the drain grates set into the simple stone trough around its base were also cast from bronze. Head bowed, Lodan filled his can and walked down into the grassy hollow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeatly trimmed, living sweetblossom vines swathed the memorial poles, anchored securely to the, now hidden, trelliswork underneath. Lodan sprinkled water around the base of the nearest pole, before stepping back to contemplate the plainly carved Kerm wood plaque, standing in front of the grave marker on its slender pedestal. He sighed and walked over to the next pole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAl watched him from the gate. The other markers received their sprinkling of water and a suitably respectful pause by their name plaques, but weren\u2019t given the lengthier contemplation accorded to the first grave. \u003Cem\u003EPoor fool - no kerbal\u2019s got shoulders broad enough for that load. Enley\u2019s death wasn\u2019t his fault - and there\u2019ll be more than one Kerm wood marker standing in for absent friends by the time we\u2019re through with this.\u003C/em\u003E He looked up at the sudden clink of a watering can being put back on its rack. \u201CDirector.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan checked his watch. \u201CDirector. I trust I\u2019m not too early?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot at all. Security were a little surprised but that\u2019s what we pay them for. You\u2019re looking well, Director - surprisingly so in view of your recently expanded responsibilities.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan looked at him. \u201CTo the general public perhaps. In practice, President Obrick\u2019s - dramatic - lifting of the secrecy surrounding Part 3 has made the KSA\u2019s task considerably easier.\u201D He smiled faintly. \u201CI much prefer Project Starseed as a name too. Far more evocative than \u2018Part 3\u2019.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAl frowned. \u201CYou knew about the President\u2019s announcement?\u201D He stopped. \u201COf course you did. \u201CWe have mapped our world from orbit and taken the measure of the Kerm challenge in full.\u201D\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIndeed,\u201D said Lodan.\u00A0 \u201CAnd not just Kerbin. We have adequate maps of Duna and intend to map Laythe too, assuming the probes arrive safely.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Hope probes?\u201D said Al. \u201CAn appropriate choice of\u2026 Oh, great Kerm.\u201D He gave Lodan a look of grudging respect. \u201CHow long have you been quietly planning this under everyone\u2019s nose?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell before we first met,\u201D said Lodan. \u201Cand I believe the Council have been making plans for even longer, although I\u2019m not sure precisely how long. The KSA was originally tasked with understanding the obstacles to expanded kerballed spaceflight in any case, so our new instructions were easily accommodated. The Kerbin mapping project was the first obvious departure from the KSA\u2019s goals at the time and at that point the Council didn\u2019t really have any choice but to give me the full story.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAl snorted. \u201CHard to get somebody to make a map for you if they don\u2019t understand what the map\u2019s for. But you mentioned an adequate map of Duna, Director. Is that where we\u2019re going - Duna?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan nodded. \u201CIt\u2019s closer than most of the alternatives and certainly closer than any of the reasonable alternatives. The atmosphere isn\u2019t as thick as we\u2019d hoped for and the soil isn\u2019t much more than mineral dust but the Berelgan team think it has potential for supporting plants and eventually crops. It\u2019s not ideal,\u201D he added dryly, \u201Cbut under the circumstances, we\u2019ll take what we can get. Then of course we need to get everyone there -\u00A0 but I presume you have some news for me on that topic?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI do,\u201D said Al. \u201CWe\u2019ve made a substantial amount of progress since you were here last. No flight hardware yet but I think you\u2019ll be interested in what we do have.\u201D He led the way up the shallow rise leading out of the graveyard. \u201CInfrastructure mainly and that was a headache all by itself. I didn\u2019t think our head of engineering even knew how to swear but faced with using liquid hydrogen as a fuel, he soon became remarkably proficient. Not that I blame him. Just making enough of the damn stuff was, to use his phrase, a non-trivial challenge. Finding alloys that could handle it without leaking or shattering was another one. Then we had to building moving parts that stayed moving after they\u2019d been soaked in it.\u201D The corner of Al\u2019s mouth twitched upwards. \u201CHis language got \u003Cem\u003Ecreative\u003C/em\u003E at that point.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan followed him towards C7\u2019s main hanger. \u201CHydrogen for your heat exchanger too I presume?\u201D he said. \u201CI remember that you were using cryogenics for that and I\u2019m struggling to think of another fuel that would be cold enough.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIndirectly,\u201D said Al. \u201CWe use a helium loop between the hydrogen lines, the intake cooler and the compressor. High temperature helium from the preburner\u2026 never mind, you\u2019ll see it all for yourself in a moment.\u201D He unclipped his name card from his jacket and unlocked the hanger door.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan remembered the heavy security door and the harshly lit, stripped concrete corridor inside. The test yard through the second security door however, looked very different. The cryogenic apparatus was gone, heavily insulated pipes emerged directly from the thick concrete wall and disappeared into various access ports in the\u2026 apparatus, mounted on the test stand.\u00A0He stared. From the front, the thing did look like a high performance jet engine, with a shock cone intake leading smoothly into a streamlined nacelle. At the back, two rocket engine bells sat side by side, surrounded by a shroud that itself appeared to consist of four curved exhaust nozzles arranged around the rockets. And in the middle, jet engine met rocket engine in a bewildering tangle of turbines and plumbing. He tried his best to follow Al\u2019s explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026secondary hydrogen lines here supply the pre-burner, which drives the compressor, hydrogen pump and LOX pump via the helium loop. Exhaust from the pre-burner is vented through the four bypass ramjet nozzles here. They\u2019re more of a safety measure than anything else for the test unit but\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA foolish grin spread across Lodan\u2019s face. \u201CBypass \u003Cem\u003Eramjets\u003C/em\u003E?\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYep. The intake cooler can only deal with so much volume - the rest is just bypass, like in a normal turbofan. The intake also needs more hydrogen for cooling than the rockets can burn off in atmospheric flight. So we put \u2018em both to good use. We figure it should help lift the service ceiling we can reach before switching over to internal oxidiser.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EDear Kerm above. If they can get this thing into the air without it exploding, they\u003C/em\u003E might \u003Cem\u003Ejust be able to build a spaceplane around it after all\u003C/em\u003E. Lodan fought to keep the eagerness out of his voice. \u201CIt certainly looks the part. Would it be possible to see it working before I leave?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAl offered him a rare grin. \u201CNaturally. I wouldn\u2019t expect the famously skeptical KSA Director to be satisfied with anything less. The test team should be here in a moment to set up. We\u2019ll be watching the whole thing from the observation room.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last technician gave the camera a quick thumbs up before shutting the heavy test bay door behind him. Lodan saw a pair of red flashing lights came on over the door frame, before the camera switched to a view across the test stand, zooming in on the back of the engine. To their left, the two stand operators sat in front of a bank of monitors displaying telemetry readouts and close up views of different parts of the engine. Al conferred with them briefly before turning to Lodan. \u201COkay. We\u2019ll run the MACE through a standard test routine. Startup, throttle up to take-off thrust and shutdown.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrivately, Lodan rolled his eyes. \u003Cem\u003EWhat\u003C/em\u003E is \u003Cem\u003Eit with engineers and acronyms?\u003C/em\u003E \u201CMACE?\u201D he asked neutrally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMulti-aspect combination engine,\u201D replied Al. \u201CAlthough in truth, we\u2019re still working on the multi-aspect part. Getting a smooth handover from external to internal oxidiser with the engine running is turning out to be yet another non-trivial challenge, but we can show you the MACE running in air-breathing mode.\u201D He nodded to the stand operators. \u201CCould we get some sound please?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe room suddenly filled with the scream of a high volume compressor, making Lodan jump. Al winced and made a sharp chopping gesture with one hand. One of the stand operators hastily twisted a dial, bringing the noise down to a level where Lodan could hear himself think.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAl raised his voice. \u201C\u2026standard start-cart\u00A0 Once we have a steady airflow through the cooler we open the secondary hydrogen valves to the pre-burner and coolant loop!\u201D A brief gust of flame spurted from the ramjets, which swiftly faded to a hazy shimmer around the exhaust nozzles. \u201CPre-burner ignition opens the helium feed to the intake cooler. As soon as the coolant loop is stable, the turbine spins up, the start-cart disconnects and the the primary hydrogen valves open\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFire exploded from the main engine bells, glowing baleful orange and then settling into a watery, blue-white flame that seemed to start in front of the engines and taper to a brilliantly sharp point. The camera shook violently and even with the sound turned down, the roar of burning hydrogen sent thrills racing along Lodan\u2019s spine. The glare from the screen sparkled off his eyes and he found himself grinning fiercely at Al.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe MACE shut off in a cloud of superheated steam and a final judder from the camera. Al pretended not to notice the KSA director shake his head and retreat behind his usual impassive mask. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou mentioned something about problems with the transition from air-breathing mode?\u201D Lodan said at last. \u201CWhat do you need to get through that problem?\u201D He lifted a finger warningly. \u201CYour honest evaluation please. The KSA is still answerable to the Council and its budget needs to cover a great deal more than transport to orbit, however vital that transport is.\u201D He raised an eyebrow at Al. \u201CBesides - any funds that you spend on engine development are funds that you can\u2019t then spend on airframe integration and flight testing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022text-align:left;text-transform:none;text-indent:0px;letter-spacing:normal;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:underline;word-spacing:0px;white-space:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2348006\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 57\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022text-align:left;text-transform:none;text-indent:0px;letter-spacing:normal;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:underline;word-spacing:0px;white-space:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2455395\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 59\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-01T14:23:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2020 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
