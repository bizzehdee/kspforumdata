It will involve the orbital construction of two interplanetary tugs, which shall carry across enough housing and supplies for a manned mission on the red planet that will last indefinitely provided our funding can continue \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first part of this mission will be to scout the red planet for a suitable location for our outpost, as well as scanning the planet for deposits of useful resources. For this purpose, we have designed Scout Probe Alpha. This small probe will be designed to fly to Duna and use its scanners to give an accurate map of the Duna surface, and correlate that map with a scan for minerals to select a suitable base location. Once that is completed, the probe will then detach a rover, which will deorbit and then land at the selected location to confirm its usefulness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second part of the mission will involve construction of the first interplanetary ship: Hinnus 1. This ship will be sent up in 4 parts (due to lifter restrictions discussed below), which will include a main body (with habitat for 5 kerbals for the duration of the transfer), 2 separate fuel tanks, and an engine block. This ship will run on a single NERVA engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the Hinnus 1 is completed, the first mission will require a further six launches before transferring to Duna. These launches will include a Command Centre for the base, a habitat unit, a supply storage unit, a Kethane refinery, as well as two vehicles: a short-range 1 man rover, and a prototype Kethane powered Jet. The goal of the first mission will be to scout the Duna surface surrounding the base, collect Kethane for production into fuel, and to test the prototype jet. If this jet proves useful, the design will be refined into an SSTO for tranfer of crew to and from orbiting ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresuming all goes as planned, the first mission to Duna should arrive at the Red Planet on day 359 of this year. In the meantime, work on the second mission will begin, with the construction of a second interplanetary ship, the Hinnus 2. This ship will work in the exact same way as the Hinnus 1, and will be carrying similar parts to Duna including a lander ship, which will ferry crew and resources down to Duna, and then transfer the old crew back to Hinnus 1 once their mission time is complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921266941115502349/B11E55550577D6C74956DFE900807FC4FA356A8E/1024x576.resizedimage\u0022 alt=\u00221024x576.resizedimage\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScout Probe Alpha under construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921266941115605249/DAE9DD215A43FB5A02A9C7E6C458C4DF506C2AFA/1024x576.resizedimage\u0022 alt=\u00221024x576.resizedimage\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHinnus 1 Core under construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReentry\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo protect craft from the heat of reentry, we have developed a heat shield (dubbed \u0027huskarl shield\u0027 by the workers) that will work by deflecting the heat from reentry away from the craft.

I now have an outpost and mission concept in place. I have a Launch Schedule developed for the first 700 odd days, and a common launch vehicle.

My launch profile starts off very similar to you sturmstiger in that I will be flicking over to Duna an initial supply dump and DAV in one package. I will also be making extensive use of IPT\u0027s throughout the mission plan. I am obligated by the DAKSCMDOCBSD to use hideously long acronyms for everything which I will get to later \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 it\u0027s actually caused some administrative problems in that no one is actually sure any more what stands for what, and when it should be launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the initial DAV\u002BIPT, each 26T lift is made up of two modules joined together ready for transport by an IPT. The mission will develop across two fronts: Duna surface, and Duna orbit. The idea is to simultaneously build up a large mobile surface base and a functional space port in operation around the planet. This plan should realise efficiencies in the long term in terms of crew mass transits, forward operating missions from Duna etc. as well as provide added redundancy and safety in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that in mind each space station segment will either contain emergency 65 day supplies for the maximum occupancy, or a large supply tank with long term habitation in mind. Each ground based module is independently fully mobile with 4 wheel steering and massive articulation for rough ground. Each ground module also has individual levelling systems which can be used to make sure the Kermans enjoy a safe, stable place to live instead of walking around everywhere on a slant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will also be making use of spare launch slots for \u0027hole shot missions\u0027 (HSM). These use the superior lifting capability of the main launch vehicle to boost small packages straight to Duna without the need for an IPT. They can also be used to send supplies in a high energy off window mission in emergency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the resource shift grows within Duna\u0027s sphere of influence, the idea is to extend the mission plan long term, moving from infrastructure boosts, through population and supply and into ease of access for any Kerman to have a go. If the plan is successful then mirror missions to other bodies could be a consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a way to go yet, but in terms of equipment this is what I am working with thanks to an outrageous budget compared to GKP (Gross Kerbin Product):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Lifter: 26 ton to 75km LKO.

I\u0027m going to keep a copy of 0.20.2 just for this challenge I think. Right now the engineers are going through the planning process and design stage. Plan isn\u0027t finalized but incorporates Kethane for refueling (haven\u0027t decided whether to use ioncross yet. Never tried it before), and sends a probe/kethane miner first to fuel up an outpost until the crewed launch vehicle arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne detail I\u0027ve considered is to wait the launch delay time for the first mission, and to wait double time between missions, and say that the construction crews have doubled their work efforts. IE launch two ships at once, but with double the wait between launches. Managing two launch windows at the same time might be rather awkward (especially arriving at Duna) but could be helpful. One alternate is to have an initial launch for scanning/mining, then after that do double launches with double waits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial design phase planned for a huge launch vehicle capable of lifting about 70tons to orbit each go... the design was a success but... well... it was so laggy even with half texturing and limiting to using very few mods with models that we had to scale things back. Current plan seems to lift approximately thirty tons to orbit, but the design is still undergoing testing and finalizing and the safe value may drop. It\u0027s fully reusable at present and two stage... though that may change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent plans are to do with without Mechjeb, but instead use Protractor and Kerbal Engineer. Since most of what I\u0027ve used Mechjeb for in the past was the info screens (Yes, and precision landing! But I do landings myself too) I think this is doable... but I have been somewhat spoiled with Mechjeb. I just want to be able to prove I can manage something like this without that crutch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne reason I\u0027m doing this mission is, for some reason, I haven\u0027t done much with Duna. I think when I first started playing KSP I attempting a landing there, but I can\u0027t remember. I know I\u0027ve flown by it and done orbits there, but certainly haven\u0027t landed there in a long time. Odd since I\u0027ve done missions to most worlds except Eeloo and Dres. I did consider using the Extraplanetary Launch Pad mod as I\u0027ve used it a lot in the past, but in the end decided against it. I almost decided against kethane but it does add an initial phase of scanning and mining and limits the profile to finding an appropriate landing site with both good surface conditions and kethane present so I went with it for challenge sake... plus it mirrors the current profile of making fuel onsite that NASA is going with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s hoping I get a proper mission profile set up soon if I have enough time to hand!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-25T08:39:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2013 08:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Patupi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho529","CreatedById":68105,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T12:01:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/GNiQ4#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/GNiQ4#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy DHV-1 LV in it\u0027s testing phase... one exploded on the launchpad, one exploded during flight (the second picture), and the other FINALLY got into orbit, only a bit higher than I would have liked it to...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
