He was an amateur scientist. He did not have access to any tools, methods or processes that properly funded research labs do not have. Rather, it would be much the other way around. Whatever he did must have been extremely easy to replicate when knowing the recipe. That would also explain (in part) his paranoid fear of reverse-engineering.\n\nIf he did not stumble on it by accident, but rather actively developed a hypothesis and produced the material to confirm it, then it is even harder to believe that it hasn\u0027t been duplicated, because it implies that it was a perfectly reasonable hypothesis to make based on the scientific knowledge of the 1970\u0027s. It\u0027s been 45 years since then, and these 45 years have seen the advent of digital material science - in lockstep with Moore\u0027s Law. This formula simply should have been independently confirmed ages ago.\n\nI don\u0027t have an answer for what material was used in those public demonstrations and the few tests he allowed to be conducted on it. But the onus of proof rests on the shoulders of the person making the claim, and Mr Ward decided to not provide this proof - and nobody, not even his family, has since stepped up to reinforce the claim. Therefore the only sensible assumption, for a layman like me, is that this Starlite material, and the properties it advertised, does not exist and has never existed. Whatever he found was not what he claimed it to be."},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T09:14:33Z","Content":"What\u0027s so miraculous about this material?
