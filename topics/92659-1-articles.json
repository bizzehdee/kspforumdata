In order for humanity to move to become the first known extra-terrestrial inhabitants on another celestial bodies, we have to be able to utilize resources on other planets, or moons. One problem with this is that we have to be on the surface first to get these resources, and we currently do not have the money/budget to sustain or properly build an extra-terrestrial base. We are stuck in LEO, and the problem is: Oxygen (O2). Once oxygen is used up in the human bodies, it is replaced by Carbon Dioxide (CO2), which is routed through the extensive CDRA system on the Destiny module. This gives a slight return on oxygen, but it is not 100%. Eventually, without periodic refueling from Earth, the ISS can run out of oxygen. This can be a significant problem for deep space missions to Mars and other planets in our solar system, and we can\u0027t just stop at a gas station to refuel millions of miles from Earth. So what can humans do to counteract this problem? I have listed one below, and the pros and cons of it. Feel free to discuss your own theories as well, and maybe add to mine.
