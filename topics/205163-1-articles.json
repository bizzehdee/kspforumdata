There is no doubt we have such developers there. So that\u0027s just a matter of amount. The new project should not be full of references, easter eggs, and retrospectives in general, but why we would not have some nostalgic stuff? I feel that we definitely will have some.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-07T10:20:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019d expect to see at least some of the original anomalies- the monolith near \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, maybe a Mun arch or the Duna \u201Cface\u201D, but probably not all of them; I\u2019d be pretty surprised if the 10th anniversary anomalies that were added in 1.12 appeared in KSP2, as well as things like the Kerbin and Mun UFOs, the Duna pyramid and its SSTV signal or the dead Kraken on Bop. There will probably be new anomalies to find in the new solar system(s) too, but what they\u2019ll be is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newgame space program","CreatedById":216630,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-07T21:42:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks everyone for your answers, I really appreciate them!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
