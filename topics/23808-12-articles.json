I\u0027ve pressed every button in the GUI I could find, and can\u0027t figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, it seems there\u0027s a resize-thingy in the bottom-right of the window, but it doesn\u0027t resize via dragging. Dragging only makes it move the window. A single click (no drag) does seem to resize it by one-pixal\u0027s distance though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: Also getting a lot of errors. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oudaDjo.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/oudaDjo.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-13T22:35:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2014 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Entropius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
