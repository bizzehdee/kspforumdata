Every attempt so far at moving a full sized aircraft carrier over land has failed, so I started to look for a way to make canals. I thought of editing the heightmap of Kerbin, but I couldn\u0027t find one anywhere in the game files. I looked for a mod that could do it,\u00A0but I can\u0027t find any. Kerbal Konstructs doesn\u0027t have an item that changes terrrain as far as I can tell, and I tried using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Mover with multiple\u00A0PQSMod_MapDecalTangent, but that didn\u0027t work either. (Even if it did, that would be so tedious putting in a bunch of coordinates over and over.)\u00A0Can Module Manager replace\u00A0heightmaps, and if it can, how would I get Kerbin\u0027s original hieghtmap so I could\u00A0edit it? Or is there maybe a different mod out there that I missed?
