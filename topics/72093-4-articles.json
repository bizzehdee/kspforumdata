A minimum acceptable for most rockets should be 10% payload-ratio (those in Chapter 3 are awful, but there to demonstrate staging rather than performance), with 15% being a reasonable design expectation. With practice you should be aiming for 17-18%, although the practical maximum is about 20%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsparagus is a matter of taste that has caused many (genteel) rows in the forums. If you are trying to optimise payload ratio it is provably the way to go. That said, I rarely use it now because I prefer part-count optimisation (I have an old computer). Bear in mind that there are many things you\u0027ll need to avoid in KSP if you care about realism - any sort of spaceplane, jet, nuclear and ion engines, etc. Stock KSP technology, physics and aerodynamics are only \u0027like\u0027 Earth things; you may want to try the FAR, KIDS and DRE mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the launch vehicles I\u0027m currently using for my own missions are SSTOs; mainly VTVL-jet or rocket based because fuel is cheap and I can\u0027t be bothered to mess around in the atmosphere for ages with spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use variations of the Tractor Light design almost all the time in space - if you\u0027re only getting 969m/s deltaV have you got the fuel lines attached, the right way around (from the central tank to the ones on the outriggers)? As listed it should give 3.5\u003Cstrong\u003Ek\u003C/strong\u003Em/s! Here\u0027s the thing about engines; ISP. The LV-Ns have an ISP of 800, the T30 has 370. What that means is that for the same total deltaV of the LV-Ns you\u0027ll need to carry twice as much fuel for the T30 so, for longer burns and/or heavier payloads, (LV-N \u002B fuel) \u0026lt; (T30 \u002B fuel \u002B fuel). Worse than that the fuel has mass too, which takes deltaV to push so you need \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E fuel, to push the double-load of fuel, making it more like (T30 \u002B fuel \u002B fuel \u002B (fuel/nnnn)). Four LV-Ns \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E a big mass to haul around, performance would be best with just one - or even just one Ion engine! - but TWR would be minute and burn-times very, very long (which brings a whole new set of problems).

When you want to go further though attaching a jumbo orange fuel tank to the LV-N version gives 8.7km/s deltaV and Mun TWR of 2.42. With the T30s I ran out of height in the VAB after attaching 7 jumbo tubes - for a paltry 7.3km/s (Mun TWR 0.99). Put that together with the \u003Cem\u003Epurpose\u003C/em\u003E of the tractor - which is to haul other stuff around - and you are saving an awful lot by using the efficiency of the LV-Ns. Looking at the same thing from the payload point of view - Tractor Light with 4 LV-Ns can take a full orange tank to Mun orbit as it is, with 2 T30s it requires additional X-200 8 AND X-200 16 fuel tanks for approximately the same deltaV.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-17T19:35:28Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2014 07:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kip336","CreatedById":131629,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T23:41:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat answer is a lot better then I was expecting!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst things first then; I will stand corrected on your tractor light - It turns out that KER had the \u0027atmospheric\u0027 setting on.
