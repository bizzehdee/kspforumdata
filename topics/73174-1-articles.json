Then adjust the values in the yellow cells by changing the dates in the green cells, until the pairs of yellow cells are roughly equal to each other. So cell K9 should equal K10, and if you have a 2nd flyby cell K17 should equal K18 and if a 3rd flyby K25 should equal K26. You are making the incoming and outgoing speeds relative to the planet you are flying by the same-the key requirement for a coasting flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen check that the flyby altitudes are above the atmosphere of the planet if so, you have a legitimate flyby. The green cells labeled \u0027double flyby ratio\u0027 are only used if 2 consecutive flybys are of the same planet- for instance a Kerbin-Eve-Kerbin-Kerbin-Jool flight would use the double flyby ratio between the 2nd and 3rd flybys. In that case you must make sure that the time between the 2 flybys are an integer multiple of the planet\u0027s period- for instance 2 Kerbal flybys must be 106.5, or 213,etc. days apart. Then adjust the flyby ratio until the relevant \u0022Transit T.. over period\u0022 is an integer. Check again that the flyby altitudes are above the atmosphere.

I will add this to 0.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I haven\u0027t tried any of the alternate systems yet though some of them look quite interesting. My one issue with making it easy to use this with other systems is that I took some shortcuts to make this program as fast as possible with Kerbol system, and things might become inaccurate with other planets. In particular the 5th-order equation of center starts to become rapidly more inaccurate if a planet has an eccentricity over around .25 -.3. The other is my cutting out of most hyperbolic trajectories, if some system has a planet very far out from the sun then paths to that planet will often not work. So for now I prefer to keep the parameters locked into the program. Though if I wind up using one of those alternate systems and the planet orbits look safe, it would not take long to make a version for that system. Can you recommend one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I thought about Jool\u0027s moons quite a bit. I decided not to do them because of the huge SOI of those moons relative to their orbits. It\u0027s another shortcut- I use a linked conic method to hitch the paths between planets together rather than a patched conic method. This works fine with Kerbol\u0027s planets because the SOI\u0027s are so small compared to their orbits. The errors in timing and velocity that my approach causes are smaller than the errors naturally generated in KSP from switching between one SOI and another, and the fact that one can\u0027t perform a thrust with more accuracy than about \u002B/-0.1m/s. One can verify my accuracy estimates with Alexmun\u0027s superb porkchop plotter, he has a button \u0027refine transfer\u0027 that takes the SOI\u0027s into account and updates your chosen transfer\u0027s data. My philosophy for this program has been if the total errors are less than 10m/s over the whole transfer then it\u0027s acceptable.

The Lambert can\u0027t do that, since it can\u0027t handle any orbit where the start and finish are 0 degrees or 180 degrees apart. The trouble is that there are an infinite number of possible orbits for those conditions (for instance an orbit with the same SMA but of any inclination would work) so the algorithm can\u0027t settle on one. I have a plan to deal with this though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick Answer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Flyby Finder version 0.60 will implement this function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong Answer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my \u0027LambertE\u0027 spreadsheet I have a method to handle a \u0027double flyby\u0027 where I take the vector you first approach the double planet with, and the vector you go from it to the next planet with, and \u0027draw\u0027 a line between those two vector\u0027s directions. I then assume the intermediate vector that you leave the double flyby planet with the first time will be on this line. I determine where on the line you would have to go in order to have an orbit around the sun that gets back to the double planet when the planet is back there, so an orbit who\u0027s period is an integer multiple of the double planet\u0027s period. If I find one then I check that both flybys can be above the double-planet\u0027s surface. It works in the spreadsheet but it is tricky. My development plan for Flyby Finder is that version 0.60 will implement this function. It will be the hardest part of the whole project and might take a while but I\u0027m sure it can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You mention triple flybys in your question. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m going to tackle that. Depends how the double flyby goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that neither the 1st not the last planet in the chain can be a double-flyby planet. That should be OK though, if your only thrusting is done at the beginning of the flight and at the final arrival (and FF only deals with this kind of flight) then there is no advantage to flying past the start planet twice. Multiple consecutive flybys of the same planet do not change your speed relative to the sun or the flyby planet, they only change the direction. If you do a large thrust between the flybys, or flyby another planet, then your arrival energy back at the planet can change by a lot, but if you just coast around back to the same planet you can only change your direction. Changing direction can be very useful though, check my flight to\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80455-How-To-Go-From-Low-Kerbin-Orbit-to-Jool-Orbit-for-1051-m-s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E Jool from LKO for 1051m/s\u003C/a\u003E to see what the double flyby of Kerbin does. At the speeds I\u0027m moving after the Eve flyby Kerbin can\u0027t change my direction enough to throw me to Jool in just one pass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou bring up a good issue about how FF does dates and times. I use 24-hour days as the basic unit of time measurement, with Year 1 Day 1 as UT day 1, since it makes for one number to adjust up and down as needed. For translating from days to KSP time I have the detail box which converts the 24-hour day times to the Y: D: H format (365-day years only for now) so you can see when to launch or when you have to flyby a planet. The detail box also gives the UT seconds of the start thrust, I give this because if a flyby I want to test occurs several years into the game I start a new game, quit it, then go into the persistent.sfs file and find the entry for UT seconds and change it to a little before I want to launch, then go back and run the game. This way I don\u0027t have to sit there at maximum timewarp for many minutes waiting to get to the launch date. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But this does not help when you know a KSP time and want to search for the next flyby. I could put a little calculator in FF that allows you to enter Y: D: H and gives you the 24-hour days equivalent. The formula is (Y-1)*365 \u002B D = UT days. So year 11 day 170 would be UT day (10*365)\u002B170= 3820. You have to subtract 1 from the year because KSP calls the first day \u0027Year 1 Day 1\u0027, not \u0027Year 0 day 1\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m looking at your other questions now. One thing is that FF does not allow you to run it with less than the first 3 bodies entered, if you only enter Kerbin as the start and Duna as the 1st encounter, but nothing else, it will automatically put a second encounter in when you run it, by default it\u0027s Kerbin. I should probably switch to an error message and refuse to run in that circumstance. It doesn\u0027t prevent double entries either, and right now that can cause a bad results. I admit I\u0027ve been putting off input checking until I manage the double-flyby part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the questions, they help me decide what needs to be done next.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-15T18:52:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2014 06:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PLAD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PLAD","CreatedById":104158,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T19:04:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DarthVader\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DarthVader\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould this work on Mac?
