The graphene is then cleared by heating up Martian atmosphere (rich in carbon dioxide) to high temperatures and blasting it across the graphene to oxidize the carbon to carbon monoxide (\u003Cstrong\u003ECO2 \u002B C --\u0026gt; 2 CO\u003C/strong\u003E). In the case of the ISS, the graphene is manually removed (it is made to collect in a removable steel pipe) and disposed of with the next resupply vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to see this functionality added to KSP-I? (LiquidFuel recovery from LiquidMethane- no need to add the complexities of a graphene resource...) This enables recovery of (almost) all hydrogen from the Sabatier, and essentially allows it to be utilized as a means to perform the net reaction \u003Cstrong\u003E2 CO2 \u002B Energy --\u0026gt; 2 CO \u002B O2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LiquidFuel/Oxidiser recovery is already implemented in Interstellar, you\u0027ll notice that the Sabatier reaction produces Oxidiser as well as LqdMethane. The power that is consumed is supposed to represent the electrolysis of water, the LiquidFuel part which is then fed back into the reaction. The reaction that you describe at the bottom isn\u0027t quite correct because only half the Hydrogen goes into water in the end product, the rest of it becomes bound up in the methane, so you do still need a supply of hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou therefore see in Interstellar the reaction Hydrogen\u002BCarbon Dioxide\u002BEnergy -\u0026gt; Oxygen and Methane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI potentially want to allow an option to go the other way and decompose the methane into pyrolytic graphite, giving you to your hydrogen back.
