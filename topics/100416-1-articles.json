I had escaped Kerbins gravity and was heading off towards the orbit of Urlum, all I had to do was make a course correction to make sure I was getting a close approach. When I got to the maneuver node I slowed down time so I could perform it when, without warning, the kraken bore down on my craft and it was in pieces. I was very disappointed but being the youthful space program I am I proceeded to try again. The same thing happened again, and again, and again. It doesn\u0027t matter where in the orbit the craft is, as long as its outside Kerbins SOI it may or may not randomly explode. I pressed F3 to see what had caused the damage and the logs say my craft either crashed into the VAB, SPH or launch pad.

It also happens when you reload the craft outside of Kerbin\u0027s SOI and if you quicksave outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI. I also tested to see if it was an altitude problem by modding the save folder and putting the craft on a 500000000000km orbit around the Sun and it didn\u0027t explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way to stop this bug from happening is if you don\u0027t go to full time accelleration. With these mods installed ksp (for some reason) invents a super fast timewarp thats really useful for getting to far away planets. This however is causing the destruction. To stop this from happening just don\u0027t use the max time warp but use the one just before it. If you accidentally use the super time warp then your mission is doomed unfortunately. It may take some time to get to your planets (especially if you are going interstellar) but use MechJeb\u0027s warpto feature and go and bake some cookies or something while you wait. Much better than getting destroyed by the kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T10:11:45Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 10:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RatchetinSpace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFound a solution\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
