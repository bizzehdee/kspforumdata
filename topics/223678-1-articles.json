However, the biggest thing standing in the way of any actual planet packs (containing new planets, not just modifying the properties of the existing ones, like the rescale mod) is that we have no clue how to do it. There have been multiple people trying to get it to work and we just haven\u0027t been able to figure out everything without some kind of documentation or guidance from the developers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
