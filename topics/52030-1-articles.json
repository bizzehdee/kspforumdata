If we started to migrate outward at an average speed of just 0.1% of c today we would\u0027ve filled half the milky way in just 50 million years. That\u0027s the blink of an eye in cosmological terms. So we only have the following options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - There are a lot of alien civilizations out there, but not one of the millions of civilizations has ever managed to migrate outward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - We are alone, or at least one of the very first sapient species.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - They are out there and have spread among the stars. But they\u0027re either actively or accidentally avoiding or ignoring us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all of them have problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - It\u0027s sensible to avoid colonies and migrations from an economics perspective. We all love space travel on this forum, but lets be honest: it is very resource intensive to send living things anywhere, let alone in large numbers. However, it seems unlikely that not one of the thousands of species that should\u0027ve existed was ever faced with extinction. If your choice is \u0022Migrate or die!\u0022 because your sun is going nova the choice seems rather easy. And if your entire species is spaceborne anyway it seems like a shame to settle down permanently. You\u0027ve got resources galore from asteroids and you\u0027ve solved any problems you might have with long term 0G. Why make yourself vulnerable again by all settling down on a single planet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Well someone has to be the first right? And we seem to have either a second generation or 3th generation star, so on a universal scale we\u0027re about as early as can be. But on earth it took 3 billion years before we even got multicellular life, let alone intelligence. If there is intelligent life on thousands of other planets they have a lot of leeway in terms of time. And as said before, if someone decides to migrate outward they\u0027ll be everywhere in the blink of an eye.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - This seems the likely scenario to me. Our radio signals are indistinguishable from background radiation within a few lightyears. Also, it seems that birthrates tend to go down as technology progresses. If the same applies to aliens then they wouldn\u0027t spread across the galaxy, just settle on a few planets around long lived stars and enjoy life without population pressure forcing you outward. If there are a thousand species all with 20 or so planets then the milky way will still seem completely void of intelligent life. It\u0027d be 100s of lightyears to the nearest civilization. Since pumping out extremely strong radiosignals isn\u0027t exactly an efficient usage of resources they\u0027d be just as invisible to us as we are to them. However, it is dangerous to assume that observations made on humans apply to aliens. It seems kinda unlikely that thousands of civilizations behave the same as ours...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T14:47:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESuppose that Fusion power is achievable and practical (I\u0027m very optimistic about Dense Plasma focus designs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA spacecraft with a Propellant: total mass ratio similar to the Saturn V, propelled by a fusion powered design, would be able to achieve speeds of a significant fraction of the speed of light (like 20% !!!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe galaxy is only 100,000 light years across... if you can get a spacecraft going 20% of the speed of light... suppose they save some delta V, and average 10%.... thats across the galaxy in a Million years.... life has been here on Earth for roughly 4,000 million years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuppose during that time that they get bussard ramjets (at least for braking after accelerating using fusion propellant, allowing them to use more to accelerate and less to decelerate)... they\u0027d likely get even faster speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, speed to traverse the galaxy is not the speed it takes to colonize it.... lets assume that they spend roughly 10x as much time developing a colonies, as they do traveling to establish new ones (not unreasonable when traveling even at 10% the speed of light means voyages of hundreds of years)... 10 million years for a space faring civilization with fusion power to colonize the galaxy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering how easy it would be to move about a solar system with fusion, they may prefer asteroid belts and small moons to planets with large gravity wells - a completely space faring civilization - They could be everywhere, and they wouldn\u0027t need to hide their presence... like a single planet species might want to ensure its not discovered (as another single planet species may decide to kill it with a KE impactor to eliminate the threat, before the same thing happens to them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s plenty of time for aliens to visit, and there\u0027s little reason to hide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso consider:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The first generation stars, and their planetary systems would be deficient in the heavier elements needed for life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The conditions at which life can exist, are not necessarily the same as those which allow for abiogenesis to occur (indeed, if the \u0022radioactive beach\u0022 hypothesis is correct, and the major contributor, life could be very rare)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The conditions that allow for life are not the same as the conditions that allow for complex life possessing high metabolisms (Ie, even if Europa is habitable, no space faring life will evolve there\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Life may not necessarily evolve in the direction of intelligence. There wasn\u0027t really any major evolutionary innovation between the end of the Permian, and now, as far as I can tell (ie, high metabolism, limbs that could be easily adapted to manipulate objects, brain structures), yet 300 million years passed before we have a species that has a chance at achieving fusion powered (or better, ie, antimatter) space flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The \u0022habitable zone\u0022 around red dwarfs (by far the most common star type) means any planet there would be tidally locked... meaning no thermal cycling from day and night cycles (may have been important in abiogenesis). It also means that the atmosphere will need to be pretty thick, or almost entirely absent .... the night side will be extremely cold, and the atmosphere will freeze on the night side, and be locked away in icy deposits... or the atmosphere will need to be thick enough for sufficient heat transfer/insulation to prevent this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The emission spectrum of red dwarfs is primarily in the infra red, combined with the requisite thick atmospheres, and absorption spectra of gasses, there will be little opportunity for direct photosynthesis, which will limit the complexity of life there, and its not unreasonable to think that these conditions preclude space faring life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*larger stars burn out faster... for 3.5 out of nearly 4 billion years of life on earth, we didn\u0027t even have macroscopic multicellular life.
