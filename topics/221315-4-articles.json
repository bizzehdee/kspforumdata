I still don\u0027t expect KSP2 to compare to my KSP1 modded runs in so far as keeping attention and engagement, but the fact its going from being seething frustration bad to simply being lagged behind in a relatively positive light is a big win for me.

I\u2019ve only played for about an hour and a half so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot that I haven\u2019t seen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have done 2 suborbital launches and 1 orbital w/return.

No sign of it so far. Yet I see some people have commented on it. Hmmm\u2026maybe I\u2019ll try a clean reinstall and see if I can get it too. Or maybe the parameters for when it kicks in are different than KSP1 and my crafts just haven\u2019t qualified. Dunno.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst mission- launch first rocket. I go up to 110km and return safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond mission- get to space. Briefing says that so-and-so doesn\u2019t believe KSP can get to space. Got to get there to prove them wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEr\u2026didn\u2019t we just get back from space? In KSP1 career mode if you completed a \u201Cworlds first milestone\u201D out of order, you would get credit for it and mission control would direct you to the next thing. KSP2 isn\u2019t that smart yet I guess.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3rd mission- go to orbit. Yep, yep. I noticed you can\u2019t refuse missions like you could in KSP1. Not a big deal but when you combine that with not recognizing milestones already completed, I worry that the exploration mode progression is currently too linear. You should be able to skip missions or complete a number of milestones in a single launch without having to go back and forth to mission control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4th mission-go to Mun. The pacing of this seems excessively fast. This is like 45 minutes in at most. Right now exploration mode seems to be career mode, but with only the \u2018worlds first milestone\u2019 missions, none of the commercial missions. I feel like it needs more meat on the bone. Give us some reasons to explore kerbin for a few hours before turning our attention to the Mun. Or if I choose to go to Minmus first instead, or Duna or Bop or something, pick that plotline up and adapt without a hitch,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience collection- It\u2019s a little unclear when I\u2019m actually collecting science. Most of the time when I try to, it tells me I\u2019m in an invalid location or something. But then after the mission I\u2019ve got some science so I guess it is doing something right after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther thoughts- KSP2 kerbals still seem to have no sense of personality. I feel like individual skill progression for Kerbals in KSP1, as well as cost to hire them, results in a greater sense of investment in them, whereas in KSP2 your crew choice is like pulling names out of a hat. It\u2019s very unsatisfying. I want to have favorite kerbals, or kerbals who are better suited to particular missions. Hopefully this will come.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tstein","CreatedById":223854,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-21T14:21:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am happy with\u00A0 having a proper game now and it can nwo run on my computer.

Didn\u2019t really have that issue before.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had a weird issue doing one of the side task on laythe, as soon as I exited to Eva for the task \u00A0and touched the ground I stopped being able to move the kerbal. \u00A0 \u00A0Reloading , and even reloading even earlyier didn\u2019t seem to fix it. \u00A0I ended up just moving my lander closer to the object and was able todo the science holding onto the craft. \u00A0This happen one other time randomly in orbit of kerbal with the craft . Could no longer rotate the craft etc even with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0A reload worked to fix it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never saw the issue with flight path lines disappearing till this update .
