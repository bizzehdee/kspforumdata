Anyways, the forum post about Duna being survivable with only an O2 mask got me to thinking: what if humans lived in the kerbal solar system? How many planets would we have colonized? Duna with its 0.2atm atmospheric pressure, and Eve with its 5atm are both much more survivable than Mars and Venus, with .006atm and 92atm respectively. Not to mention Laythe, which is positively Earthlike. And to top it all off, delta-v costs are much lower than on Earth. However, to offset this, Kerbin has a much smaller surface area, which probably means a much smaller population and industrial base. Would that be enough to keep humans as grounded as they have been on Earth?

Not to mention that since getting to orbit would be so cheap, we would probably have a lot more space infrastucture, which means getting to space is even cheaper. SSTOs would also be much more viable. I mean, the Blackbird could get up to 980m/s (almost half of orbital velocity) on pure turbojet, no fancy RAM or SABRE technology or anthing.
