That would them evaporate and consequently oxygenate the intake air. This would allow jet engines to burn. Now, I am not 100% sure how to make the intake actually consume my planned resource, OxFreeIntakeAir, and produce normal intake air. If anyone knows the coding for that (I don\u0027t want to use an engine module to do it), it\u0027d be nice if you\u0027d lemme know how. In the mean time, the plan is to also model an engine (and I really like this plan better because of all I can do with it) that uses OxFreeIntakeAir, Oxidiser, and LiquidFuel. I also wanna do some cool stuff with consuming power while spooling up and producing power when running at speed as well as a power curve that works better at higher speeds and lower altitudes (ramjet style almost).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my intake model so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mushroomman","CreatedById":236,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T01:26:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJeeze.
