If so is there a way to disable hab or overide this function as I do not want hab to kill my kerbals but still want them to die if they run out of food even if they had previously ran out of hab?\n\nEDIT No.3...\n\nOk sorry for all the edits, setting the hab to no effect or \u0022none\u0022 in game now seems to have solved the problem, although I would have thought is should have been set to this anyway given the edits i made to the config file.\n\nAnyway it seems I have a configuration I am happy with for now but will post again if I have any further problems. Just want to say thanks to roverdude for creating these brilliant mods... The modding community for this game is brilliant and I love how I can tailor KSP to my liking thanks to all the modders hard work. Thanks guys.\n\nPS: dont know if anyone has been bothered to read this far but if you do know of a way to have the kerbals become tourists when they run out of hab and then remain vulnerable to death by starvation after this - so kerbals can go crazy and stop piloting, then starve to death - Please do let me know, and please do reply if you can help in anyway or tell me what i\u0027ve been doing wrong) Also please forgive all the grammar errors and typos...

That\u0027s the way I already think about it anyway.\n\u003E \n\nI think this makes a lot of sense.  Supplies isn\u0027t just food, it\u0027s water and oxygen too, and you can\u0027t survive 15 days without those.  That implies that there\u0027s a small reserve within the cabin itself, even after the supply containers are empty."},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-19T02:46:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7/17/2017 at 11:13 AM, Woollt\\_Owl said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E yup so i edited the config file then made a new game after editing... its almost as if it hasnt recognised my edit.\n\u003E \n\nDouble-check to make sure you don\u0027t have any other config files (for instance, in MKS) for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS; it will take the most pessimistic config setting it can find."},{"CreatedByName":"canisin","CreatedById":144481,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-19T07:24:35Z","Content":"[@Woollt_Owl](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179879-woollt_owl/)\u0027s testing is very interesting.

It would also be interesting to check whether tourists continue to consume supplies, and also to check the opposite: In a ship with less supplies than hab time but with the result of starvation being grouchiness, and a more severe result for homesickness, does becoming a tourist due to a lack of supplies protect the kerbals from the effects of homesickness?
