With all the flight data, TAC Monitor, IR controls...Let\u0027s says sometimes I don\u0027t even see my own ship ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI am considering doing a \u0022mod\u0022 that should allow to move reasonable amount of that info out of the main game windows. It will be based on the amazing [KRPC](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69313-WIP-1-0-2-kRPC-Remote-Procedure-Call-Server-v0-1-9-14th-May-2015/) from djungelorm. The main program will later load \u0022modules\u0022 that will be draw in the second screen (this will be something in Windows.Forms or GTK#, not unity). With enough dev effort, many things can be done, both to the game and to addons. Not only request data, but also control the game/addons\n\nThe problem is that it requires quite some work (many already done, many still pending). In my mind, the kind of things I would love to be able to do are:\n\n- Control my RT antennas\n\n- Have a copy of TAC Life Monitor\n\n- Be able to use TAC FB in that screen\n\n- Set the KAC alarms\n\nWil you people be interested in something like that?"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T15:42:52Z","Content":"I would be more interested in a map view on the second screen.
