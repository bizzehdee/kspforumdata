In the interests of fairness that while the LBP parts are indeed large the part count can still get stupidly high, as my 3 290 plus part WW2 builds prove all of which use LBP hull and superstructures.( The superstructure on the Lizzy class is 15 parts just for the basic)\u00A0 When combined with it\u0027s partner mod SM marine the potential for variety is limitless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously if you want to assemble 40 parts just to make a box to stand another box on, all power to you. It\u0027s not my way though.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are to my knowledge 5 ship/boat parts mods available .\u00A0 LBP of course, SM Marine, fengists maritime pack and Azimechs Real Ships and WW2 warships\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
