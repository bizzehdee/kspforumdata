I have done the first few successfully but the asteroid ones seem either broken or I\u0027m doing something wrong. I\u0027ve searched high and low to find some definitive information and thus far I\u0027ve found a few threads that indicate that at the very least that asteroid mission 1 is broken in that the fuel lines aren\u0027t connected causing you to run out of fuel on the burn to slow to the speed of the asteroid. I\u0027ve verified this to be the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I haven\u0027t found anything referring to mission 2 but it also seems to be broken(or the somewhat ambiguous instructions leave something out). I have successfully been able to dock with the asteroid while targeting its center of mass to prevent spinning(information woefully excluded from the training mission text). As instructed, I\u0027ve successfully set a maneuver node opposite that of where Kerbin(my target) and my craft orbit is the closest to each other. I have successfully tweaked the maneuver node so that my intersection with Kerbin is as close as I can get it(84,000km), I presume the intent is to, like the first asteroid mission, use several maneuver nodes to get within Kerbin\u0027s SOI. I have successfully set my level indicator on the Manuever(blue) indicator which resulted in a 3 minute burn, which met the criteria of being doable, i.e. less than 10 minutes according to the training mission text for this step of the mission. Lastly once I was within the appropriate distance of the maneuver node I started my 3 minute prograde burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll is going well when about 2 minutes into the burn, the fuel conks out and I left floating with only my RCS to do anything. I\u0027ve tried this mission about 10 times and have had similar results each time. Like mission 1 this seems to be broken as well, or there\u0027s a chance I\u0027m not doing something even though I am following the mission text to the letter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone please give me a hint as to where I am going wrong? I really want to enjoy this game, and I realize its beta so maybe that\u0027s part of the problem. Am I wasting my time doing the asteroid training missions and expecting to take them to completion? If so, where is a better place to start?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running the Steam version which is currently v0.90.0.705 Beta.
