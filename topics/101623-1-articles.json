The main vessel is the Scarlet Horizon and an unnamed Karbonite Drill and Processing Module that is funded primarily from the corporate sector and private donations. The name will be chosen in an online contest.\n\nScarlet Horizon construction:\n\nThe craft is designed to function as a ship and will be stripped of its propulsion and then function as an orbital station\n\nSCHC: Ship/Station Commend and Habitation Core\n\n- Modified Tymark Crew Module (my name for the 6 kerbal near future command pod) with linkage to the after habitation core\n- The Porch airlock and external stowage (the best thing about the station IMO)\n- 2 docking ports on the hab core for the Kerves\n- Station core with 4 docking ports for the pressurized extension arms which will hold the forward thrusters\n- Science lab mounted with 8 orbital surveying satellites (4 for Duna and 4 for Ike)\n- Sr. docking port\n\nForward Thrusters x4 (they are in the forward section of the ship, they don\u0027t thruster forward)\n\n- Autonomous crafts that couple to the extension arms to provide propulsion from the stern of the ship\n- Fuel tanks, monoprop outfitted with 4 nuclear engines\n\nKRV:\n\n- Mk2 command pod\n- Hitchhiker\n- Service and life support\n- Fuel tanks (this will be locked for crossfeed during the trip and stay at Duna so that they are ready to depart at any time\n- The forward thrusters will dock to the sides of the KRV to provide propulsion the Kerbin\n\nMSS: Main Service Structure\n\n- Near Future mission girder with monoprop and batteries fitted with 6 RTG\u0027s\n- Fixed solar panels\n- Extending solar panels\n- Near future LFO girder surrounded by additional fuel tanks\n- 2 Sr. docking ports for the Duna Habitation Module Landers\n- 2 regular docking ports for the Arties\n\nAPro KSAR:\n\n- Science lab\n- Probe core\n- Fuel tanks, 4 nuclear engines\n- Radial fuel tanks with 4 more nuclear engines\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The first version of the Mega N4 was being developed for this program. I had some serious stability issues during the first trials and this made me outfit the rocket with a lot of RSC thrusters for attitude control. I also had an issue with separation of the first stage. I eventually worked these out these out and you can see some of the dramatic fails above.\n\nConstruction and testing was completed on the SCHC and it was launched approximately 2 months prior to the window with Duna. The core was placed in a 100km equatorial orbit.\n\nSH-Phase 1-Mission 2:\n\nA 4 Kerbal crew was in launch preparation to dock with the ship, complete diagnostic testing and begin construction. I realized when it was in orbit that I forgot to put ANY lights on it which is heartbreaking. I\u0027m looking for information how make my small surface lights capable of beng picked up using KAS sooo some help there would be great. This crew with eventually strut the heck out of the ship using preplaced strut end points. The Porch needs to be corrected and tested as well.\n\nThe Tymark MPV successfully docked and completed those mission requirements. The lag was surprising OK. We\u0027ll see as construction continues.\n\nNext update with go over the crew for the main mission and continuation of construction. The next pieces will be the extension arms and forward thrusters.\n\nDelrey\n\nPS. I use my own phonetic alphabet so its Ajax and Bingo as opposed to Alpha and Bravo\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T18:39:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 06:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Delrey**"},{"CreatedByName":"Delrey","CreatedById":131343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T23:13:12Z","Content":"SH-Phase 1-Mission 3\n\nAboard the Scarlet Horizon\n\nSherson: I\u0027m at the CO2 runoff exhaust vent. Looks to be frozen over. Am I go to attempt a repair process 1262?\n\nJeb: Sherson, you are a go to smack the crap out of the ice.\n\nA deep pitched clanging sound reverberates through the hull of the Scarlet Horizon; barely audible aboard the docked service vessel. In the suit of Sherson Kerman it creates and crunching sound heavily dampened by the fabric of a suit.\n\nSherson: Scarlet Horizon, do you want to perform functionality test of the CO2 exhaust vent?\n\nShelcas: Shers, where are you relative to the vent?\n\nSherson: I am directly in front of it using the forward handrail.\n\nShelcas: That pressurized CO2 will blow out in to space. You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to want to move.\n\nSherson: Actually Kerbin is to my back so I might make to the planet.\n\nJeb: Move to your right, Sherson.\n\nSherson: Copy all. Moving to the second forward handrail.\n\nJeb: We have exhaust of built up CO2. Shers, your reminaing catch-up task is to check that connection on the Duna atmospheric sat. You have 22 minutes before you have to be in the Porch.\n\nAfter Sherson completed his final task he returned to the Scarlet Horizon command center. The crew snacks and begins to relax before the call with Gene Kerman at KSC.\n\nJeb: I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m still not excited about this mission. I want to be on that main trip.\n\nShelcas: We all do, Jeb. Just stay on ship.\n\nJeb: Someone has to pilot the Ty back to Kerbin.\n\nSherson: These things basically fly themselves. We can handle it.\n\nJebediah delivers a long solemn stare towards Sherson. The stare directly through as if gazing into the vast distance of space. Before things became to uncomfortable the monitor sounds and Gene Kerman comes on.\n\nGene: Scarlet Horizon, this is KSC.\n\nJeb: We see and copy you, Gene.\n\nGene: Are you prepared for the arrival of Phase1-M3?\n\nJeb: Functionality of the life support systems is confirmed and we are a go for receipt of Phase1-M3 Extension Arm Thruster assemblies.\n\nGene: Good. EAT\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s 1 and 3 will be installed at the 45 and 225 degree pressurizing docking adapters.\n\nSherson: When do we eat?\n\nGene: Sherson, I think you should pay more attention. There has been an issue at KSC. Aldfield Kerman has failed his medical exam and has been grounded. Sherson, as the next most experienced with the ships functionality we are going to need you to replace him on the SH. We are going to replace you ASAP for SH Phase 1.\n\nThe following day Jeb and Sherson monitor as P1-M3 approaches the Scarlet Horizon and positions itself in a parking orbit. The autonomous tug docks with and transports the extension arm for the 45 degree PDA.\n\nJeb: Confirming docking sequence complete. Shel, give me the readings on the alignment indicators.\n\nShelcas: We are at 0.14 degrees. Looks good, Commander.\n\nJeb: Bartfrod, get Shers ready for EVA to connect these up when the final thruster block is docked. Shel and I will head up the tube to perform the work on the fuel lines. Bart, we are going to need you back here keeping in touch with Shers.\n\nAfter the final thruster block was docked Sherson stepped out on his 3 EVA within 8 days. He knew this mission was ambitious but now he was heading back before completing the full objective. He would have new orders. As he connected support strut after support strut he wondered how would he tell his wife. It was at this time he realized he didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have a wife and wondered where all the women are.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

You\u0027re heading back."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T01:23:49Z","Content":"That\u0027s...a lot of ship! I\u0027m unfamiliar with TAC, do you need all that extra space and mass to carry the snacks and oxygen etc? In any case a very ambitious mission, clearly with a lot of planning behind it."},{"CreatedByName":"Delrey","CreatedById":131343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T22:20:45Z","Content":"Yeah you need food, water and oxygen. There is also carbon scrubbers and water purifiers, which I have installed on the ship. There is nothing a long the lines of a greenhouse to make food though. It adds a lot of stuff I\u0027ve got to take for this extended mission\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nFollowing the disqualification of Aldfield Kerman, the next best option for ship support was clearly Sherson. Involved with development of its life support and one of the lead designers of the ARTEV 6D, Sherson knew the equipment better than anyone. KASEA dispatched a XKA-3 Prositos spaceplane to retrieve him.\n\nNote: Prositos means accessible in Greek.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

We are T-minus 13 minutes to takeoff\n\nGercal: I\u0027ve finished inputting the assent profile straight to the Scarlet Horizon.\n\nDesdorf: KSC can you confirm trajectory.\n\nTower: Des, you are go to proceed on the assent profile.\n\nDesdorf: Obney, are you prepared for launch.\n\nObney: Des, let\u0027s do it.\n\nFollowing the assent the XKA-3 makes a straight shot to the Scarlet Horizon. Sitting in a parking orbit it allowed Obney to board the SH while Sherson returned to the ship. Completion of the mission was nearly flawless; the landing proved to be slightly off.\n\nPhase-1 M-4\n\nLaunch of EAT2 and EAT4 was a success. Honestly (this is me talking now) docking these thrusters was some of the hardest stuff I\u0027ve done in KSP. They do not have a balanced center of mass, the RSC jets were installed for use on the completed craft, controlling from docking port translated the controls and they have to aligned perfectly. The hardest part of construction is done.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I\u0027m think I\u0027m going to do a breakdown of the ships that have been used so far with some of the features.\n\nDel\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T22:29:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Delrey**"},{"CreatedByName":"Delrey","CreatedById":131343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T19:36:01Z","Content":"Phase 1 Mission 5\n\nLaunch of the Main Service Structure. This large module contains nearly all of the fuel for the trip to Duna as well as the main power systems. I used a near future mission supplies girder with batteries and monoprop. This is outfitted with fixed solar panels, extendable solar panels and 6 RTG\u0027s. The connecting girder is the main fuel module. Once in orbit around Dune this will serve as fuel storage for extended missions. The fuel return rocket will shuttle processed Karbonite to the SH.\n\nI added 2 3.75m liquid boosters to the standard launch system. This had issues resulting in probably the largest explosion I have seen. I did another staging test on the next launch which lead to that nice pic of the pieces shooting off in random directions. I modified to 4 2.5 boosters and this worked out. Direct from surface rendezvous and docking went without incident once the heavy lifter was worked out.\n\nI included an image with a breakdown of the current ship components. I also did a test of the just forward propulsion system. This thing is actually pretty maneuverable and it flies straight. The throttle just needs to be brought up slowly. The thrusters do flare out which is going to limit the efficiency, unfortunately. Now you can get a feel for how this ship is going to look.\n\nAfter docking the crew of the Tymark commissioned the electrical systems and loaded the station with life support supplies, topped off the monoprop tanks and returned to Kerbin. The next launch will be the Aft Propulsion and Kerbin Science and Analysis Return Vessel.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The forward articulating rocket thruster is extended on girders. This allows all 4 engines to fire in forward direction. The basic design has been used for Munar and Mino operations but the 6D Class is mission specific.
