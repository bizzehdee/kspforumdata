This time I had to use a different station/docked vessel and so the routine was a little different. I undocked the ship, fiddled with RPM, docked, and switched back to the vessel. It consistently through an error with the release version and no error was thrown with the dev version. The reference part of the target selection was pretty sensitive to changes and I had to keep resetting it while trying to re-dock. However, I think the reference part function has always been a little weird and I am not the best judge of whether it has changed.
