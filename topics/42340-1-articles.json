So now I wanted to go to Laythe, as I got into a nice orbit of jool, with a decent amount of fuel left. I just couldn\u0027t get into orbit of laythe, I got Laythe capture, but when I was passing it in like 150k periapis, I was going 6,000m/s and was unable to orbit. I tried this multiple times and it never worked. Does anyone know a way to get a capture then orbit without going 6,000m/s when you are passing it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond problem is that I was gonna test a rover on Duna, testing Mun slingshot for the first time, but I noticed I got alot of spare fuel, so I thought I maybe could get to Eve. So I tried to go there, got an capture! But when I burnt retrograde to get into a orbit, I noticed I was in a polar orbit. And how much time I spent, I couldn\u0027t go into a normal orbit ( Don\u0027t know what they are called ) As I tired of failing I activated cheats, got into a fairly good orbit. And then when I was about to land. *sigh* My unmanned rover had lost two of it\u0027s wheel. So how do I get into a good orbit from a polar orbit without using so much fuel? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if my english is not that great since it\u0027s not my first language.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-16T00:00:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2013 12:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Knas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T15:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor your first problem, you probably were in a retrograde orbit around Jool, so you\u0027re relative velocity would be massive.
