The monoprop i removed, the thrust should be massively in my favor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea behind this rocket is, that the biggest starter stage is dropped while still in the atmosphere so that it would return to the surface to be recovered or at least not trash my orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second stage is the orbital \u002B travel stage with the 909 engine with max efficiency and slim/short design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third stage, the lander, lands on mun, gets back up and back to kerbin and lands there without the need for a parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked in 21.1 ! But now, the best i can manage is to get to a 100 km munar orbit with about 1300 m/s left. The latest mechjeb version that i have and use does some really weird things for munar landing, constantly burning with 1/3 thrust and stopping in a height of about 30m then drops and brakes again... wasting 800 m/s. And even if i start manually, with 400 m/s or so i cant make it back into space \u002B munar escape! It once worked and there the lander had less thrust! The 20 to 30 increase in thrust should make the escape a cakewalk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any ideas what could be the problem ?

I\u0027m guessing that the picture you have is of the rocket in 0.23. Mechjeb says you have a dV of 7073 m/s.

Now, most dV maps include a safety factor, so that ship MIGHT pull off the mission if flown absolutely perfectly. However, I don\u0027t think the maps account for the time when your engines are running in atmosphere and have lower ISP. Also, your ship has no parachute, so you\u0027d have to do a powered landing on Kerbin, which is \u003Cstrong\u003Eat least\u003C/strong\u003E another 100 m/s (atmospheric) with a suicide burn.
