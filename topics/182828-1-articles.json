You and DEPORTED agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Agreement and/or Licensed Application must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. You agree that the provisions in this paragraph will survive any termination of your account(s) or the Agreement and/or Licensed Application.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy your access to and use of the Agreement and/or Licensed Application you hereby specifically acknowledge, agree and consent that you waive your right to a trial, by jury or otherwise, and that you agree that any suit, action, proceeding, dispute, controversy or claim (\u201CDispute\u201D) arising out of or relating to the Agreement, Licensed Application or any of the transactions contemplated herein or related to the Agreement and/or Licensed Application or any contests or services thereon (including without limitation, statutory, equitable or tort claims) will be dealt with in accordance with the following procedures. All parties shall first attempt to negotiate all Disputes informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration. Such informal negotiations shall commence following the receipt of a notice in writing by one of the parties sent to the other. DEPORTED will send its notice to your billing address and forward a copy to the email address you have provided to DEPORTED (if any). You may send any notice to DEPORTED to the address listed below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the Dispute is not resolved through informal negotiations the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. If you are a resident of the United States, any arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you or anywhere DEPORTED is located. For residents outside the United States, any arbitration shall be initiated in the Netherlands\u00A0using the English language in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the American Arbitration Association (\u201CAAA\u201D) then in effect, by one arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of AAA arbitrators. Any arbitration shall be completed within 30 days from the appointment of the arbitrator unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by an arbitrator rather than a court. The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding arising under these Terms of Service shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. Use of the Licensed Application is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of this Agreement, including without limitation, this section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between you and DEPORTED individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.\u003Cbr\u003E\n17. SUPPORT SERVICES.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDEPORTED may provide you with support services (e.g., KSP Software Development Kit) related to the Licensed Application (\u201CSupport Services\u201D). Any supplemental software code or other materials provided to you as part of the Support Services shall be considered part of the Licensed Application and subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.\u003Cbr\u003E\n18. MISCELLANEOUS.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou must comply with all applicable laws regarding use of the Licensed Application. This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is hereby expressly excluded. This Agreement represents the complete agreement concerning this license between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between them. It may be amended only by a writing executed by both parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected. Whether or not a Dispute is subject to arbitration, this Agreement shall be construed under The Netherlands law as such law is applied to agreements between The Netherlands residents entered into and to be performed within The Netherlands, except as governed by federal law.\u003Cbr\u003E\n19.

INDEMNITY.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou agree to indemnify, defend and hold DEPORTED, its partners, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from all damages, losses and expenses arising directly or indirectly from your acts and omissions to act in using the Licensed Application pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.\u003Cbr\u003E\n15. ASSIGNMENT.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDEPORTED may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time. Notwithstanding, you may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under the Agreement and/or Licensed Application without DEPORTED\u2019s express prior written consent.\u003Cbr\u003E\n16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA printed version of the Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You and DEPORTED agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Agreement and/or Licensed Application must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. You agree that the provisions in this paragraph will survive any termination of your account(s) or the Agreement and/or Licensed Application.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy your access to and use of the Agreement and/or Licensed Application you hereby specifically acknowledge, agree and consent that you waive your right to a trial, by jury or otherwise, and that you agree that any suit, action, proceeding, dispute, controversy or claim (\u201CDispute\u201D) arising out of or relating to the Agreement, Licensed Application or any of the transactions contemplated herein or related to the Agreement and/or Licensed Application or any contests or services thereon (including without limitation, statutory, equitable or tort claims) will be dealt with in accordance with the following procedures. All parties shall first attempt to negotiate all Disputes informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration. Such informal negotiations shall commence following the receipt of a notice in writing by one of the parties sent to the other. DEPORTED will send its notice to your billing address and forward a copy to the email address you have provided to DEPORTED (if any). You may send any notice to DEPORTED to the address listed below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the Dispute is not resolved through informal negotiations the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. If you are a resident of the United States, any arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you or anywhere DEPORTED is located. For residents outside the United States, any arbitration shall be initiated in the Netherlands\u00A0using the English language in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the American Arbitration Association (\u201CAAA\u201D) then in effect, by one arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of AAA arbitrators. Any arbitration shall be completed within 30 days from the appointment of the arbitrator unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by an arbitrator rather than a court. The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding arising under these Terms of Service shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. Use of the Licensed Application is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of this Agreement, including without limitation, this section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between you and DEPORTED individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.\u003Cbr\u003E\n17. SUPPORT SERVICES.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDEPORTED may provide you with support services (e.g., KSP Software Development Kit) related to the Licensed Application (\u201CSupport Services\u201D). Any supplemental software code or other materials provided to you as part of the Support Services shall be considered part of the Licensed Application and subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.\u003Cbr\u003E\n18. MISCELLANEOUS.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou must comply with all applicable laws regarding use of the Licensed Application. This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is hereby expressly excluded. This Agreement represents the complete agreement concerning this license between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between them. It may be amended only by a writing executed by both parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected. Whether or not a Dispute is subject to arbitration, this Agreement shall be construed under The Netherlands law as such law is applied to agreements between The Netherlands residents entered into and to be performed within The Netherlands, except as governed by federal law.\u003Cbr\u003E\n19.

thumb drive wearout is far less predictable and much less extended than SSD wearout).\u00A0 You have only one copy of the software, but it\u0027s in a form you can use one any one computer (at a time) wherever you might happen to be.\u00A0 I\u0027m pretty sure this would \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E work for the Windows version (because installers almost always put files into the Windows folder tree), and virtually certain it \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E work for the Linux version (because installers virtually always install in a self-contained chunk to avoid issues with different Linux flavors).\u00A0 Can\u0027t say for certain what MacOS does, I\u0027ve never been a Mac user.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, installing to Dropbox would violate the letter of this clause, because Dropbox\u0027s installed software makes a copy of the Dropbox cloud storage on each local computer connected to a particular Dropbox account (for access time reasons, I presume).\u00A0 So, moving my desktop system\u0027s install to my Dropbox would amount to making a copy of that install on my laptop (but not on my phone or Android tablet; the Android app for Dropbox doesn\u0027t create a local mirror of the cloud), thus violating the \u0022one copy\u0022 clause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit to add: I just noticed, however, that the EULA I quoted from probably isn\u0027t the one for KSP -- first, it references a company called Deported B.V., rather than either Squad or Take2, and second, it doesn\u0027t mention any Windows version newer than Win7 (or Linux in any flavor or version, but many EULAs ignore Linux even when the software has a Linux version).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-25T22:23:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2017 10:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Zeiss Ikon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdd note about the posted EULA\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-25T22:22:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust read through it\u0027s entirety.\u00A0 I\u0027m not an expert on these matters since I\u0027m not a lawyer, but can\u003Cstrong\u003E anyone\u003C/strong\u003E identify \u003Cstrong\u003Eanything\u003C/strong\u003E specific in the current KSP EULA that is \u003Cem\u003Eany more restrictive\u003C/em\u003E than any other major-selling game?\u00A0 To that end, KSP utilizes (at this time)\u00A0no setup/install program, nor any security features identified in the EULA that is quite prevalent in the rest of the gaming industry (serial number entry upon install, online verification, etc).\u00A0 If anything, there are EULA clauses that are present in the EULA itself, but not even implemented.\u00A0 This would allow these devices to be implemented at a later date without legality issues, but again, is no more restrictive than any security methods currently in use by the gaming industry at large.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223180101\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165782\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221506375833\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022178055\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerBlitz Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n29 minutes ago, KerBlitz Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might be right \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/111697-tc/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022111697\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/111697-tc/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@T.C.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould you care to share what you\u0027ve identified?\u00A0 Specifically what points in the EULA are you in agreement\u00A0with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/111697-tc/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022111697\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/111697-tc/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@T.C.\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0with?\u00A0 Maybe I\u0027m missing something, but I haven\u0027t seen anyone in this thread identify anything in the KSP EULA that is \u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003Eis an insult to the customers\u0022\u00A0to quote the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
