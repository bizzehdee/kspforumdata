As rockets have infinite strength resistance, even if the rocket bend, you cloud safely perform non-sensical in flight man\u0153uvres... Of course when I tried that in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E ended up with my rocket in pieces xD... My brain learned that fast, and now is intuitive for me to just try a nice gravity turn, and let the dance between aerodynamics and gravity to bring my rocket to orbit...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother nice thing I learned with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E is that drag force is a thing!, at least for rocket ascension stability... That means, if you try to go too fast during rocket take off (something like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E 3-5) ... Your rocket get unstable, flips and brakes into tiny pieces... That I learnt fast and forgot it existed too xD...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I would summarize, for the aero forces in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, for rockets have the following impact:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0- Brake your rocket into pieces of flying sideways at high speed in the atmosphere\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Make your rocket turn around (unstable) at high acceleration during take-off (as result of high drag)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope you find my experience useful \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pauver","CreatedById":209137,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-11T08:29:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s great if you want a realistic simulation of your crafts, especially airplanes. However, there are some sacrifices you must be willing to make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most important one, in my opinion, is the water. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E completely messes it up. Makes it behave like some sort of viscous goo, and it also messes with crafts\u0027 buoyancy. If you also have Scatterer\u0027s waves enabled, be prepared for your craft to jump up and down in the water uncontrollably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that, great mod, but I wish they\u0027d fix all the issues I\u0027ve mentioned.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
