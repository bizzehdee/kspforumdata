Derpiness as in retardation (for the mods - ......: a slowness or limitation in intellectual understanding and awareness, emotional development, academic progress, etc.).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, a trait which all Kerbals share. Except some of them are geniuses in their specific area of research. For instance, even Bill, who\u0027s so stupid he just keeps walking into walls and doesn\u0027t quite understand why he stopped moving forwards, he\u0027s great at engineering. But Bob is a genius. He knows how to use beakers and science instruments and he can even figure out why walls stop him! But when you try and pit him against trees, he\u0027ll run away screaming that \u0022we\u0027ve been invaded!!!\u0022 Jeb meanwhile is truly badS at piloting, flying, jetpacking, fighting, and being a badass, but he really can not see danger when danger is obvious. A rocket with moar boosters but no struts? He\u0027s the first one aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb is derpy in intellectual understanding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill is derpy in awareness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob is derpy in emotional development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina therefore is probably derpy in academic progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina knows things. She knows how to tie a shoe, for instance, something that has baffled every single Kerbal engineer and scientist that she\u0027s met. She knows how to fold that one really really cool paper airplane that flies really far. She knows how to catch and fry a candied cockroach with her bare hands (and a grill). But she doesn\u0027t know what F=M/A or E=MC^2 means. She never paid attention. She can fly a rocket into space just as you tell her, fly it back down, and she\u0027ll know how orbital mechanics works intuitively. But, she still has no idea what delta-v means, or any of the math behind orbits whatsoever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess for Val\u0027s stats:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBadS=True\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourage=70%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStupidity=50%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProfession=Pilot\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T14:30:20Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 02:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T14:25:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know about the other stats, but she\u0027s definitely a pilot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.facebook.com/kerbalspaceprogram/photos/a.240767269275838.66315.240760572609841/944305588921999/?type=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.facebook.com/kerbalspaceprogram/photos/a.240767269275838.66315.240760572609841/944305588921999/?type=1\u003C/a\u003E, about the third or fourth comment down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T14:27:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheMoonRover\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheMoonRover\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know about the other stats, but she\u0027s definitely a pilot\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.facebook.com/kerbalspaceprogram/photos/a.240767269275838.66315.240760572609841/944305588921999/?type=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.facebook.com/kerbalspaceprogram/photos/a.240767269275838.66315.240760572609841/944305588921999/?type=1\u003C/a\u003E, about the third or fourth comment down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComments change on facebook.
