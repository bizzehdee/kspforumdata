In a perfect world I\u0027d want all the realism mods integrated, but things like reentry heating, life support and communications are all a bit out-of-scope for the default KSP experience really (although I\u0027ve still got no clue what the bitrate nonsense is all about with the communications parts). I\u0027ve been saying for a long time that the career/science modes are lacking, largely because the science collection becomes boring (seriously, there are so many small ways to improve this), but this could easily be expanded on post-1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeeping that in mind... I think the following is what is stopping KSP being ready for 1.0 (not in any particular order):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Cstrong\u003EPerformance.\u003C/strong\u003E Memory usage is too high and desperately needs optimising, the low FPS in atmospheres needs to be fixed (even my powerful PC struggles to maintain 30FPS at times) and the Mac version needs some love as just getting stock KSP running is a pain (have a config with a decent processor and Nvidia graphics).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Cstrong\u003EBug fixes and testing.\u003C/strong\u003E They\u0027re going to fix all the bugs apparently, but as a developer myself (websites and recently games) I\u0027d say you should always do one more round of testing than you actually think you need. I got too excited when releasing my first game and messed up the performance. I patched it soon after release, but it took almost a year to recover from those first bad reviews... There should be at least one more beta.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Cstrong\u003EAssist and explain.\u003C/strong\u003E Some aspects of KSP need to be simplified or explained better. I mentioned above the communication bitrates... I really have no idea what they mean. Nor do I know what the difference in colours on the transmit and keep report bars of the science screen mean (darker/lighter green/blue). If I hadn\u0027t watch some videos I\u0027d have never have figured out how to get to orbit. Without the Engineer mod I\u0027d have no idea how much power is in my rocket. I\u0027d have never gotten to the Mun without Scott Manley\u0027s help and who knows how you figure out inter-planetary travel without a mod or a physics degree. I\u0027ve made my point - KSP needs really good tutorials, and more in-built tools to help with these aspects. Maybe tie them into the tech tree to add some variation to science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Cstrong\u003EPart variation.\u003C/strong\u003E KSP needs some more part variation to help keep things fresh and flesh out the tech tree. Fairings are a must with the new aerodynamics (not seen these mentioned), but more parts on the whole would help make the game feel more complete. Another command pod, some additional engine options, more varied communication parts, some alternative escape towers, etc. To achieve this quicker Squad could look at integrating some choice mods or perhaps have a community competition to create these parts (the best ones getting into the game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Cstrong\u003EMod dependance.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDon\u0027t\u003C/span\u003E depend on modders to complete the game. I\u0027m very worried this is why Squad are rushing to release - because of the wealth of mods out there that \u0022complete\u0022 the game. I used to play Trainz Simulator and the thing that killed it was the developers basically releasing an engine with a bunch of community developed content included on the disc. Mods and modders are good, but don\u0027t use them as a crutch. You still have to make the game as good as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Cstrong\u003EImprove visuals.\u003C/strong\u003E KSP is not a bad looking game, but it isn\u0027t good either. Many of the parts don\u0027t visually fit (especially with the new plane parts), the atmosphere looks boring without EVE/Better Atmospheres, the default skybox is a horrendously blurry mess, terrain scatter is still \u0022WIP\u0022, and I believe (from others) that there are easter eggs now buried beneath the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Cstrong\u003EWishes.\u003C/strong\u003E While not necessary, a few minor improvements to various systems could help complete the game. I\u0027ve repeatedly mentioned science and it\u0027d be a whole lot more interesting if some of the experiments required you to gather data from multiple locations \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E you get the science (e.g. gather geology samples from 3 locations on the Mun). And what about something like KSPI\u0027s \u0022crash-a-thing-into-the-planet-and-get-science\u0022 device (the name escapes me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E )? Non-science wise, perhaps have a powerful engine that can only be powered by a resource obtained from outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI? Maybe a satellite part to help in discovering the easter eggs? Small things like this could make the whole career mode more motivating, involving and interesting, while helping to fill the tech tree and add variation, without too much development on new systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-25T11:19:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2015 11:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fourjays\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T11:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo which is it (Squad or the large group of beta testers) who let a memory leak through that makes many players have to restart the game after an hour or so of playing?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EYeah, I\u0027m with you on that bug.

Here\u0027s why:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s really easy for us, to not see the forest for all these trees in our way. I truly understand why people are saying no, it\u0027s not ready. They\u0027re worried that out there in the \u0022regular world\u0022 current issues with Unity, with Tutorials, with whatever issues are most important to them are such a big deal, that they will derail development and bring about an end to something they love and/or care about. The problem with this point of view however, is that you\u0027ve become inured to the qualities and highlights of the game, and aren\u0027t realizing that for each and every standing issue, there is so much more quality and in-general \u0022good things\u0022 backing it up. It\u0027s easy to panic at a possible threat, when you lose sight of how good something objectively is, because you\u0027re so used to looking at it, that all you can see are the imperfections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other side of the coin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a dream of Harvester\u0027s come to life. This is his baby, and has been a project that has essentially consumed him for years now. Try to imagine, if something this important, and this personal to you, if you could point at it say \u0022This is my vision made real. This is everything that I thought of years ago, and now, there it is. I am absolutely going to take what I\u0027ve learned, and the goals I\u0027ve also picked up along the way, and continue to try to make it better, but, as far as the inception goes? There it is.\u0022 Can you imagine how much he cares about this game? Try to picture it, even for a second. Can you really find yourself believing that he\u0027d just flippantly do anything to bring harm to his creation? Remember that SQUAD was not a game development company. They were/are an ADVERTISING firm. Do you really believe that an advertising company cannot grasp the notion of the review, and word of mouth?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why did yes win out for me? Truly, because of this forum, not the game. Because of this community. I\u0027ve played a LOT of games in my life. I\u0027ve seen a LOT of game communities, and still the community for KSP surprised me with their positivity, and general sense of cheer. I\u0027m not a cheerful person, by nature. That said, people here are genuinely friendly, with a unique interest that unites us, and gives us common ground with which to put those good things on display. I truly believe that Harvester and SQUAD with this announcement were expecting some upset, and some fear, but also for the note of positivity in this community to carry us all forward. The only problem that comes with that, is it\u0027s very easy to panic, and so much harder to just trust someone when you have not put as much thought into it as they have. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started playing KSP in .18, far from the earliest, but also just as far from where we are now with KSP now. Back then, I couldn\u0027t have imagined the actual gameplay beyond the sandbox, but the developers were doing just exactly that. They have been thinking about this, and working towards this milestone for several years now. Knowing that, when Harvester asks for us to trust in a decision like this? I may be inclined to panic, but I\u0027m going to try to keep a handle on that, and let trust win out. All the hours of work that they\u0027ve done, and all the fun and good times that KSP have brought me from .18 to now have earned that from me. I won\u0027t let panic over something that might happen, maybe, possibly, cause me to forget that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo: Yes, Harvester.

Now make some in-game ones.

They discovered rockets while trying to make a new kind of soda, but it kept exploding and flying away when they mixed the mentos in. Or whatever.) Then there should be a small movie explaining a bit about the space program and why YOU became its manager, welcoming you. And after that, small, short movies when reaching a milestone. Seeing the Kerbal walking out on the launchpad (in slow-mo) before the first manned flight. And exiting to a crowds cheers after the first successful landing. And then getting your supervisor congratulating you. Etc... Maybe a small film about the first moon-landing... or hearing a small speech the first time the Kerbals EVA on a new planet/moon.
