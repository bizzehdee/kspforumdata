I have eliminated the wobbliness and my test planes are almost scary steady now. It will keep the plane steady in all 3 directions. And it will change direction based on numerical, keyboard and mouse input, separately or all at once ;D. It also comes with a damping function that basically changes the input scheme for airplanes, in stead of full flaps when you hit a direction, this will make the movement start at almost no effect and the longer you hold the button the more effect it gets. And when the desired rotation is reached, the plane will keep that position. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night i was doing some test flights where i was flying few meters above the ground between the KSP buildings.
