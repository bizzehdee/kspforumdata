My guess is either bad KSP installation, or a rare bug that I\u0027ve encountered with OSX where the graphics subsystem half dies (a problem with the kernel\u0027s Quartz module, if memory serves), simple desktop stuff continues to work and the machine seems like it\u0027s running ok, but advanced graphics either fail to operate or have strange breakage. In the case of that obscure OSX bug, rebooting usually fixes it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T20:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI fixed the thread title, so you can all stop getting mad at each other about it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
