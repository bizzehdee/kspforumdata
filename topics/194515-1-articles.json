You may not realize it, but building the thing you fly later is just as important (or maybe even more important!) than actually flying it. Steering a rocket into orbit is good and all, but did you understand why this rocket made it into orbit while another did not?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s quite daunting to get into the physics part of a physics simulator - to look at the alien numbers and units that are listed in the stats of the parts, and to try and figure them out. But the further you get into the game, the less you will be able to achieve without learning this part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how about this? You already have rockets that make it into orbit, right? Well then. Try to put \u0022more stuff\u0022 into orbit. Not just a pod, but something with an engine and a fuel tank. One that still has fuel in it when you reach orbit. Ideally, one that\u0027s completely full of fuel. Can you figure out what you need to do - to build - in order to have a lot of fuel left in orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, see if you can reach the Mun with that. You might be surprised. There is a saying in spaceflight that goes \u0022once you\u0027ve made it into orbit, you\u0027re halfway to anywhere\u0022, and you\u0027ll find it very true. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-07T09:22:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2020 09:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ADKGuy","CreatedById":205205,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-07T10:26:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223798550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194515\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591487023\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums, you\u0027ll find a lot of good info here, sometimes a lot easier to read how to do something rather than waiting through an hour long video.\u00A0 Check out our tutorials subforum for a lot of these.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see the publish date on the video was 2017.\u00A0 The parts have gone through some cosmetic work since then, so your rocket will probably not look like the video at all.\u00A0\u00A0 But also, one of the joys of KSP is doing things your own way.\u00A0 Somebody here will be able to tell you exactly which parts he used, but why not try your own?\u00A0 Build your rocket, have it fail, figure out where the failure point is, and try again.\u00A0 To me, learning by trial and error is far more rewarding than following a set script.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve tried a few\u00A0designs of my own and they all have the same issue.

It\u0027s a nifty way to get a bit more range out of your first stage and as they\u0027re on top of the boosters there\u0027s no penalty in terms of drag and very little in terms of mass. Bigger boosters can handle bigger fuel tanks, but just remember to use the move tool to shift the boosters down on their decouplers or else the extra weight of the fuel tanks can cause them to collide with your central rocket and potentially damage it or use sepratrons to push them away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a lander probe I just made; it\u0027s small, light and cheap but it can land on the Mun and return to Kerbin with fuel to spare.

Alright then, here\u0027s some very basic rocketry tips:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Train your pilots. If you are playing with the Kerbal level-up experience system enabled (meaning, Kerbals are not five-star by default), then you want to send a few pilots into Kerbin orbit and back before you head anywhere else. Orbit around Kerbin is enough to get them to level 1, at which point they learn \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Hold Prograde\u0022. That means you can tell your Kerbal pilot to help you fly by trying to always keep the nose pointed in the direction of travel. You will find this \u003Cem\u003Einvaluable\u003C/em\u003E while launching. There are also probe cores that have this ability, but unless you are playing sandbox mode, you have to put in some research effort to unlock them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) \u0022The golden rule of rocketry\u0022: heavy stuff at the front, draggy stuff at the back. Think of an arrow. The compact, pointy metal head is right at the tip. The light feathers that catch a lot of air are at the back. In technical terms, the \u003Cem\u003Ecenter of mass\u003C/em\u003E is ahead of the \u003Cem\u003Ecenter of pressure\u003C/em\u003E. This causes \u003Cem\u003Epassive stability\u003C/em\u003E. A well-built, passively stable rocket can fly to orbit without turning on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and without touching the steering keys - only via managing the throttle. Though admittedly, in practical application not many player-built ships will be quite that stable, because payloads tend to be light and fuel tends to be heavy, which makes it hard to achieve this perfect distribution. Rather than taking this rule too far, take its opposite, and keep it in your mind as what not to do. Do not put wings or fins on the nose of your rocket, for example. And when you find yourself with a rocket that will not fly straight no matter what, then think of this rule when trying to find the reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) Single-size designs. A major source of instability is flexing joints, and few joints flex more than stepping down to a smaller part size in the middle of a stack and then stepping up again. This also causes drag, by the way, which (as we just learned) is bad if it happens towards the front of the rocket. As you progress in the game, you will gain parts (service bays, fairings, and engine plates) that allow you to shield smaller parts in the envelope of a larger one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) Single-stack designs. Another thing that wants to flex like Dwayne Johnson hopped up on caffeine is a small radial decoupler carrying a large side booster producing massive thrust. You can use struts to try and fortify such boosters, or you can turn on advanced tweakables and simply magick away joint flexing via rigid attachment and autostrutting (if you do not feel cheaty by doing so), but you can also simply not have the problem in the first place by building your rocket without large radially attached boosters. The main limitation you have here is the thrust output of the launch stage engine. However, it is still easily possible to reach orbit on a single-stack, 1.25m size rocket. It is also possible to perform a Mun flyby and return to Kerbin on a single-stack, 1.25m rocket. Though to pull that off, you may need to get some practice in the next item on this list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.) Downsizing. Contrary to what you may think, bigger isn\u0027t always better. You will learn about this as you get deeper into the game (the keyword is \u0022Delta-V\u0022), but for now, what you need to understand is: how far a rocket can go does not directly scale with its size. The only thing that counts is the mass of the fuel you carry compared to the mass of \u0022not-fuel\u0022 you carry. And no matter if your rocket is 10 meters in diameter or just 1 meter - if this ratio is the same, then both rockets will fly the same distance. So the takeaway should be: you must minimize everything that is \u0022not-fuel\u0022. Take the fewest number of parts that are not fuel tanks as is possible. And if you have multiple parts that can fulfill a certain job you need done, pick the one that weighs the least - unless this causes other problems, such as having the wrong size. Besides helping with going further, this also helps with rocket building in general - if your rocket is light enough, you do not need extra boosters to make it move! And without extra boosters, you don\u0027t get flexing decoupler joints, which means your rocket won\u0027t go out of control on ascent...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo illustrate my point, let me show you the rocket I used for my initial Mun flyby the last time I played Career (well, Science mode, actually):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KpvxNtk.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KpvxNtk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022piTd85N.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/piTd85N.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFrom the top down, that is: a MK-16 parachute, a MK1 command pod, a 1.25m service bay, a TD-12 decoupler, two SC-9001 \u0022Sciene Jr.\u0022 bays, a FL-T200 tank, a FL-T400 tank, a LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022 engine, another decoupler, another four FL-T400 tanks, and finally a LV-T30 \u0022Reliant\u0022 engine.

You may also want to try\u00A0rotating the crew pod by 90 degrees to face either away from or towards the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E doors in the editor and thus point west/east on the launchpad; you might find pitching is more intuitive than yawing during your ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnable advanced tweakables in the main menu settings and use autostruts between the SRBs and their grandparent part, and between the nose cones and the root part, to keep them still and stabilise the rocket. You could also try turning the boosters\u0027\u00A0thrust limiter down to 50% which will decrease your raw acceleration- a thrust to weight ratio (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E) of 1.5 to 1.8 is optimal, any lower and your rocket will waste fuel fighting against gravity, any higher and you\u0027ll lose speed to atmospheric drag especially if you go supersonic (~330m/s) at low altitudes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a point tenuously related to the original but directly related to boosters- stick small fuel tanks e.g. FL-T100 or T200 on top of your solid boosters and enable crossfeed on the radial decouplers; the extra fuel will feed the main engine before the tanks in the central stack and are then dropped with the boosters to save weight. It\u0027s a nifty way to get a bit more range out of your first stage and as they\u0027re on top of the boosters there\u0027s no penalty in terms of drag and very little in terms of mass. Bigger boosters can handle bigger fuel tanks, but just remember to use the move tool to shift the boosters down on their decouplers or else the extra weight of the fuel tanks can cause them to collide with your central rocket and potentially damage it or use sepratrons to push them away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a lander probe I just made; it\u0027s small, light and cheap but it can land on the Mun and return to Kerbin with fuel to spare.

I see. Alright then, here\u0027s some very basic rocketry tips:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Train your pilots. If you are playing with the Kerbal level-up experience system enabled (meaning, Kerbals are not five-star by default), then you want to send a few pilots into Kerbin orbit and back before you head anywhere else. Orbit around Kerbin is enough to get them to level 1, at which point they learn \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Hold Prograde\u0022. That means you can tell your Kerbal pilot to help you fly by trying to always keep the nose pointed in the direction of travel. You will find this \u003Cem\u003Einvaluable\u003C/em\u003E while launching. There are also probe cores that have this ability, but unless you are playing sandbox mode, you have to put in some research effort to unlock them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) \u0022The golden rule of rocketry\u0022: heavy stuff at the front, draggy stuff at the back. Think of an arrow. The compact, pointy metal head is right at the tip. The light feathers that catch a lot of air are at the back. In technical terms, the \u003Cem\u003Ecenter of mass\u003C/em\u003E is ahead of the \u003Cem\u003Ecenter of pressure\u003C/em\u003E. This causes \u003Cem\u003Epassive stability\u003C/em\u003E. A well-built, passively stable rocket can fly to orbit without turning on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and without touching the steering keys - only via managing the throttle. Though admittedly, in practical application not many player-built ships will be quite that stable, because payloads tend to be light and fuel tends to be heavy, which makes it hard to achieve this perfect distribution. Rather than taking this rule too far, take its opposite, and keep it in your mind as what not to do. Do not put wings or fins on the nose of your rocket, for example. And when you find yourself with a rocket that will not fly straight no matter what, then think of this rule when trying to find the reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) Single-size designs. A major source of instability is flexing joints, and few joints flex more than stepping down to a smaller part size in the middle of a stack and then stepping up again. This also causes drag, by the way, which (as we just learned) is bad if it happens towards the front of the rocket. As you progress in the game, you will gain parts (service bays, fairings, and engine plates) that allow you to shield smaller parts in the envelope of a larger one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) Single-stack designs. Another thing that wants to flex like Dwayne Johnson hopped up on caffeine is a small radial decoupler carrying a large side booster producing massive thrust. You can use struts to try and fortify such boosters, or you can turn on advanced tweakables and simply magick away joint flexing via rigid attachment and autostrutting (if you do not feel cheaty by doing so), but you can also simply not have the problem in the first place by building your rocket without large radially attached boosters. The main limitation you have here is the thrust output of the launch stage engine. However, it is still easily possible to reach orbit on a single-stack, 1.25m size rocket. It is also possible to perform a Mun flyby and return to Kerbin on a single-stack, 1.25m rocket. Though to pull that off, you may need to get some practice in the next item on this list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.) Downsizing. Contrary to what you may think, bigger isn\u0027t always better. You will learn about this as you get deeper into the game (the keyword is \u0022Delta-V\u0022), but for now, what you need to understand is: how far a rocket can go does not directly scale with its size. The only thing that counts is the mass of the fuel you carry compared to the mass of \u0022not-fuel\u0022 you carry. And no matter if your rocket is 10 meters in diameter or just 1 meter - if this ratio is the same, then both rockets will fly the same distance. So the takeaway should be: you must minimize everything that is \u0022not-fuel\u0022. Take the fewest number of parts that are not fuel tanks as is possible. And if you have multiple parts that can fulfill a certain job you need done, pick the one that weighs the least - unless this causes other problems, such as having the wrong size. Besides helping with going further, this also helps with rocket building in general - if your rocket is light enough, you do not need extra boosters to make it move! And without extra boosters, you don\u0027t get flexing decoupler joints, which means your rocket won\u0027t go out of control on ascent...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo illustrate my point, let me show you the rocket I used for my initial Mun flyby the last time I played Career (well, Science mode, actually):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022#\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EReveal hidden contents\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KpvxNtk.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KpvxNtk.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KpvxNtk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/piTd85N.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022piTd85N.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/piTd85N.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFrom the top down, that is: a MK-16 parachute, a MK1 command pod, a 1.25m service bay, a TD-12 decoupler, two SC-9001 \u0022Sciene Jr.\u0022 bays, a FL-T200 tank, a FL-T400 tank, a LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022 engine, another decoupler, another four FL-T400 tanks, and finally a LV-T30 \u0022Reliant\u0022 engine.
