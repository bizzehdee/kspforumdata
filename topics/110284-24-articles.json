It explains how to use the TERRAIN. Basically the terrain sat is equal to stock m700 orbital scanner. After scanning you can use it to generate science via resource monitoring.

Perhaps also you could have a \u0027NPK\u0027 supply that would work better than Ore which you could bring along for mid length expeditions.\n\u003E \n\nGlad you like the mod. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) Actually, Pathfinder does have a greenhouse. Simply right-click on any Chuckwagon and convert it into a greenhouse. You\u0027ll lose whatever you have currently stored in the module. The Chuckwagon converts into the Prairie, and it\u0027ll take 90 days to grow crops- unless you have a skilled Scientist staffing the module.\n\nAnd for those not on the release thread:\n\n[Get 0.9.7 here](https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/releases/tag/0.9.7)\n\nPonderosa/Casa IVA\n\n- You can now click on a screen to change its image, provided that your scene loaded with a kerbal in the part. See KNOWN ISSUES below.\n\nBuffalo Command Cab\n\n- Added support for TAC-LS\n\nBuffalo Crew Cab\n\n- Added support for TAC-LS\n\nPrairie\n\n- To help with part count at the base, the Prairie now produces enough Snacks/Supplies/Food for 3 kerbals for 90 days.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n- Updated required Organics in the Prairie to match rebalanced max resource storage amounts.\n- Fixed an issue where the Prairie wouldn\u0027t start running the Snacks greenhouse even though it had a full load of required resources.\n- Kerbals won\u0027t fall over if trying to strap a Casa/Ponderosa onto their back.\n- Ponderosa/Casa won\u0027t explode when attached to another part.\n- Kerbals will now sit properly in the Buffalo ATV Seat.\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n\n- The monitors in the Ponderosa/Casa will retain their default image if the scene loads without a kerbal in the part. WORKAROUND: Put a kerbal in the part, and reload the scene."},{"CreatedByName":"Dr.LoveJoy","CreatedById":147729,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-13T21:32:01Z","Content":"Oh!

Right now, deflated parts have a crew capacity so that KIS knows to add a ModuleKISInventory to the part. But the problem is that by claiming to have crew capacity when deflated, you have the opportunity to stuff kerbals inside. And the module code I made doesn\u0027t like that situation. So what I want to do is, if possible, manually add the KISModuleInventory to the part that KIS adds automagically. I think that if I do that then I can specify a 0-crew capacity for the VAB/SPH. That will take some research though."}]}
