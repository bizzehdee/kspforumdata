I updated RPM (I use CKAN for all the mods) but it remained the same. I looked into other capsules, and I found out that it only happens with customized screens beacuse it was black too in the Near Future Ships, but, when using the MK3 Capsule, it worked perfectly. What could it be? it is black but I can see the Prograde/Retrogade etc. Markers. - Maybe it\u0027s a NavBall screen problem? I recently installed Enhanced NavBall... That might be it... \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EImage below:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AP9LYSd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AP9LYSd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EWhat do you think?
