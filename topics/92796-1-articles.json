This isn\u0027t so much about the flight as it is about the tension of doing everything in real time with limited information and emerging crises. The challenge is simple. Land on the Mun, plant the flag, and return safely to Kerbin. The catch? Everything is to be done in first person and in real time. How? By relying on the crew of flight controllers back on Kerbin, of course!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a team challenge. I don\u0027t know if we\u0027d even have more than one team, but one is all we really need to make it fun. Either way, I\u0027d like to involve as many people at different stages through this as is reasonable. At some point we will need to select the best pilot we could find. Preferably, someone who can record and stream the entire thing. We will need several flight controllers. I will volunteer as one, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to be a one man job. But before any of this becomes reasonable, we need to find a rocket. So that shall be the first stage of the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChallenge Stage I: Rocket.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo mods. Three stage rocket must deliver Command Module and Mun Module to a free-return Mun Transfer Orbit. Mun Module must be a two stage lander capable of bringing two Kerbals down to the Mun from low orbit and bringing them back. Command module must be able to enter Mun orbit with MM attached and then return to Kerbin unladen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll else being the same, smaller, simpler ship is better. Points for looking like Saturn V. Best ship to be decided by community vote once we have a few things to chose from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would propose submitting ships via \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal X\u003C/a\u003E, unless someone has better suggestion. Please, don\u0027t submit other people\u0027s ships. But feel free to ping them via PM if you think their ship would be perfect for this. I know I\u0027ve seen some gorgeous Saturn V replicas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last question I\u0027d like people to comment on is which additional restrictions we should apply to make it more realistic? The flight controllers will receive numerical data about ship\u0027s progress. It\u0027s going to be a bit more precise than Huston had on Apollo\u0027s flight, but it doesn\u0027t feel like there is a need to intentionally clobber the numbers. Speed of light delay also feels like it would be insignificant, and I don\u0027t want to bother with it. Flight controllers will use these numbers to come up with angles and burn times relayed to the pilot. Should we be limited to specific tools? I think it might be fun to limit it to slide rules, since physics is so much simpler than real world. But that can be annoying to some people. Controllers will talk to each other and the pilot via a voice chat. (Skype? Mumble? Team Speak? Can be decided when we have a team.) Again, speed of light delay seems insignificant. Pilot will only have access to instruments and gauges visible in first person. Should these be further limited? Please, suggest specific mods if so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort list of questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Which tools can flight controllers be limited to? Slide rules? Calculators? Or anything they could find?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Should there be any additional mods limiting pilot\u0027s information?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Should there be any additional ship physics mods?

That means it will probably take up a full weekend. I would like to do this some time early on January. If you feel like you\u0027d make a good pilot for the mission or would like to be on the flight controller crew, shout out in this thread. If we manage to find enough people to do several runs, maybe we can make a competition of it. (Ideas for rules/scoring?) Any other ways you think you can make this better or more entertaining for everyone?

I wonder if we could make this on a DMP Server, and that we use kOS. So, for example, every mission controler has his own small kOS command module. Some guys are launch control, the other control speed, velocity etc with kOS.

Pilot can effect all changes to the ship that are meaningful. And the only information flight controllers need are the location and velocity. Knowing fuel reserves and/or ship mass would be useful as well, but not quite critical. Everything else will be done old school way. The ships in KSP simply aren\u0027t complex enough to require any significant data downloads, or ability to send instructions to the ship. Besides, doing it old school way is plain more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, DMP or similar might be cool to try and have both CM and MM piloted throughout the mission. Plus, having a backup pilot can never be a bad thing. I\u0027ve designed all of the above with assumption that this will run purely single player, and the only critical mod is a server that reports location of the ship. The reason for that is stability. It would suck really bad to run through half of the mission and then call it quits because CM blew up while docking with MM. But if you can convince me that DMP is stable enough, and I can grab all the necessary data from it, then I\u0027d be happy to include it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T10:42:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know you say no mods but there are some mods out there that will not affect craft performance or piloting but would enhance this sort of mission.

We\u0027ll have to run at very least a mod for tracking rocket\u0027s position, and I\u0027m happy to consider mods for IVA enhancements. RasterPropMonitors is definitely worth considering. I\u0027ll have to take a look at how configurable it is, but I\u0027m liking what I\u0027m seeing so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll also take a closer look at Telemachus, but I feel like I want to have a bit more control over data flow. I was planning to, basically, write a small HTTP server that would allow any number of flight controllers, as well as anyone who just wants to see what\u0027s happening, to connect to it and get all of the relevant data on the flight. Rich does provide source code, however, so the server for the mod might be a good candidate for the actual plugin that will do the tracking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the pointers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: The camera placement of RasterPropMonitors is particularly useful. I was a bit worried about having pilot do first person landing with obstructed visibility and no way to get external views. Ditto docking. This would resolve these issues. And it is entirely customizable. So it\u0027s starting to sound like it will have to be on the list.
