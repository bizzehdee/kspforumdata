What would we see? If the above is true we would see it just hover near the black hole getting more red at first and then fading out of view as the spectrum of this image gets out of our visible spectrum (IR machines would still see it). Finally the star \u0022afterimage\u0022 would output just a \u0022nearly straight\u0022 light with close to 0 frequency/infinite wavelength (sorry for those terms).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question is would we really see the star just disappear like a ghost? And if so how long would it approximately take? If this process takes a long time or if I\u0027m completely wrong and nothing like that happens would a black hole lucky enough to meet a few stars appear like the lot of them are just moving together, sitting each next to each other? Is that what\u0027s happening in the galactic core?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T10:42:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll see it red-shifted and its luminosity will be weaker and weaker closing to zero. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, it will disappear. I may be wrong, but as soon as its core passes through the event horizon, you\u0027ll see residual radiation from its center (where fusion reactions are taking place) and then, as the last escaping photon reaches you you would see nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T12:46:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt won\u0027t be a whole star, tho, since it would probably be torn apart by tidal forces and some of the remains would be accelerated and ejected in polar jets long before you see it near the horizon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027d see then is a ring of remaining gas swirling around the black hole, slowly redshifting its way in.
