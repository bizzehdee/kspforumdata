There are all kinds of problems I can imagine with either of these. Think about an ant under a magnifying glass in the sun. I recall simcity 4 and the possible disaster with the microwave power plants. Had to do with a satellite misalignment and the microwave beam misses the power plants receiver and bakes a section of the city.

The power plant and disaster was in SimCity 3000, not SimCity 4 (which cut out all futuristic power technologies, and had a \u003Cstrong\u003Ehighly inaccurate\u003C/strong\u003E cost-model where Wind and Solar cost \u003Cstrong\u003EMORE\u003C/strong\u003E in running-costs than Coal, and were cheap to build), by the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a long-beam MICROWAVE transmission misses its target, it\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Ealmost\u003C/strong\u003E completely harmless- long beam microwaves like those proposed for use in power transmission systems don\u0027t interact strongly with everyday matter- only metals to a weak extent, kind of like X-rays. It takes large, specially-designed rectenna device to intercept them- if they missed their target, and hit somewhere else in a city, they might fry a few radios and other devices with antennas, but they certainly wouldn\u0027t cause fires or explode sections of a city like in the game...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the rectennas to intercept long-beam microwaves, such as those that would be used for powering cities, are roughly a kilometer in diameter. While they \u003Cstrong\u003Ecan\u003C/strong\u003E be built in folding layers into a hull, kind of like internal antennas, they are still are going to have much lower efficiencies with spacecraft use than the ones seen in KSP-Interstellar (think 5-10% efficiency with dishes at least four times the size of the ones currently used). Long-beam arrays also experience greater power-loss over transmission distance (but almost negligible atmospheric interference).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore likely, the Microwave Power system in KSP-Interstellar represents short-beam arrays, such as you can generate with magnetrons (the devices in your microwave ovens) instead of gyrotrons (much more expensive devices currently used in high-tech applications and heavy industries such as metallurgy). While THIS wavelength is short enough, and experiences enough interaction with everyday matter, that a mis-targeted beam could cause fires in a city in the dozen-Gigawatt power range or above (though devastation on the level of the SimCity disaster would take a beam in at least the hundreds of Gigawatts- \u003Cstrong\u003EMUCH\u003C/strong\u003E more powerful than what that power plant provides in-game), it can be reasonably used with transmitter and receiver dishes on the kind of scale seen in KSP-Interstellar...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with short-wavelength microwave beams like that is that they also have relatively strong interaction with the atmosphere- which is why you experience such strong power-loss when transmitting through Kerbin\u0027s (or worse, Eve or Jool\u0027s) atmosphere. Not nearly as bad as a laser-based system on a cloudy day (which can reach over 99% power-loss), but still nothing to sneeze at- especially if clouds get in the way...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rosenkranz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rosenkranz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs to the air rockets, I think my comments still stand. The 15% improvement you quote doesn\u0027t even come close to justifing the extra cost and complexity it adds to the rocket.

I think a 15% improvement is worth the cost and effort- SRB\u0027s are still MUCH cheaper than liquid-fuel rockets per ton of propellant, and I would be perfectly willing to use air-augmented SRB\u0027s for the ISP levels (500\u002B) that actually exceed that (400\u002B) of LHX/LOX rocketry (even if the extra ducting weight means that the performance is still inferior to LH2/LOX). It would be especially useful once budgets come out- as a middle ground in terms of cost-effectiveness between traditional SRB\u0027s and liquid-fuel rockets (if they get the cost-relation between LFO and SRB\u0027s right with Budgets, which is unlikely- more likely the cost difference between the two will be MUCH less than in real-life in the game...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir-augmented liquid-fuel rockets also outperform their traditional liquid-fuel counterparts in ISP by a large margin, and, despite their extra weight, have a significant niche in potential spaceplane design (which is where they have received the most focus IRL). While heavier than rockets (which are MUCH lighter IRL compared to jet engines IRL than in KSP), they are still lighter than jet engines, and have an ISP intermediate between the two. Their main utility is, as stated, spaceplanes- where extra mass is less of a penalty because wings/lift are used to counteract gravity instead of thrust, the engines can be reused after recovery of the spaceplane (lowering the impact of initial engine cost), and the plane spends a much longer period of time in the atmosphere than a rocket- to build up speed. And, like I said, their TWR is still better than a jet engine (which is abysmal IRL, but great in KSP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECome to think of it, maybe LFO air-augmented rockets \u003Cstrong\u003EDON\u0027T\u003C/strong\u003E have much of a use in KSP, because the niche they would fill is already occupied by jet engines (which are \u003Cstrong\u003EFAR TOO POWERFUL\u003C/strong\u003E, and have an effective ISP roughly 15-16 times their listed ISP, due to the game incorrectly accounting IntakeAir in the fuel-consumption calculations...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still stand by the potential utility of air-augmented SRB\u0027s (intermediate performance between \u0022normal\u0022 SRB\u0027s and the LFO engines) once budgets comes out, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-21T14:26:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2014 02:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aghanim","CreatedById":76587,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T14:37:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rosenkranz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rosenkranz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the air rockets, I think my comments still stand.

The technology could/should act as an alternative (upgraded) configuration for the Thermal Receiver, in the same way as Direct Conversion Generators are alternative configurations for generators:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECW Plasma Receiver\u003C/strong\u003E (Based on the CW Plasma Thruster described at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_propulsion#CW_plasma_propulsion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_propulsion#CW_plasma_propulsion\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, this in an alternative way to turn beamed power into ThermalPower for Thermal Rockets and Thermal Turbojets (the described technology is for a thermal rocket using internal propellant- but with a little engineering you could definitely use air as the working mass instead).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than simply heating up a Heat Exchanger to heat the propellant, the propellant is exposed to a very intense laser beam to heat it up into a plasma as it passes through the device. This allows MUCH higher temperatures to be reached than with a Heat Exchanger (the technology in current Thermal Receivers), and thus much higher ISP ratings can be achieved (approximately 50% higher- an ISP of 1000s for hydrogen).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could act as a higher-ISP variant of the normal Thermal Receiver, possibly requiring electricity (or perhaps the rectennas to turn Microwave Beamed Power into electricity could be built right into the upgraded Thermal Receiver), but producing relatively less thrust for the power (per E = 1/2 * m * v^2) as well as engendering a certain level of inefficiency and WasteHeat production- much like a Plasma Thruster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has some similarities to a plasma thruster, in that electricity is required to run the laser- but its internal workings, conceptual basis, and TWR/ISP are \u003Cstrong\u003E*MUCH*\u003C/strong\u003E more similar to a Thermal Rocket. And, like any other thermal rocket, it can be used on virtually any propellant- including atmosphere in a Thermal Turbojet- not just those propellants which are easily ionized, like in a Plasma Thruster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest for simplicity\u0027 sake it just be an alternative form of the Thermal Receiver, that should become available at the same time as Gas/Plasma Core Fission Reactors (the technologies and conceptual basis are HIGHLY similar), and simply produces ThermalPower from Microwave Beamed Power at a much higher \u0022Core Temperature\u0022 (for Thermal Rocketry ISP calculations- normalized to an ISP 50% greater than with traditional Thermal Receivers) than a normal Thermal Receiver, but much less efficiently than a standard Thermal Receiver (the laser could be assumed to produce WasteHeat, at a constant % of total power usage), and with possible issues of needing to dissipate WasteHeat production (though, then again, maybe not to a great extent- the heat from the laser could possibly be shunted to pre-heat the gas before it passes through the laser focus...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe main reason for this suggestion is that it would fill a gap\u003C/strong\u003E- Beamed Power Thermal Rocketry becomes increasingly inefficient as you develop better and better reactors that leave its (relatively low) ISP values in the dust, despite just being another type of thermal rocketry that is theoretically capable of just as high ISP values with appropriate technologies (like this one), and an increasing availability of greater and greater levels of Beamed Power as players develop infrastructure based on the improved reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect it would also be relatively easy to adapt existing code modules from the Thermal Receiver and Plasma Thruster to provide all the needed functions for this new (upgraded) variant of the Thermal Receiver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T22:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI spent the day today finishing up a 3D model and learning how to add it as a part into KSP.

If he dislikes it, it\u0027s very easy for him to ignore it- he can\u0027t even see my posts, so all he has to do is ignore the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if he *likes* the idea, maybe it\u0027ll even make its way into a future Release, and maybe he\u0027ll even consider un-blocking me so he can ask me more questions or to obtain more research on the idea for him (which I would be happy to do).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
