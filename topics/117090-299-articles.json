And since there is new user looking at SSTU I trough about sharing my new project. I think its a good showcase of SSTU unique functionality. Before doing the showcase, keep in mind that I have my own 6.4x scale balance config wish is very easy to do with SSTU. So my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E and cost might be a bit weird for stock user.  \n\nThis is my 10t 40k. No nice name yet, it just mean 10t to LEO at 40 000 credit. The full cost is 67 000 credits but the main stage is reused, saving me 26k. Basically, its a bit of a up side down staging. The main advantage of this setup is that it concentrate all engine into a single stage. The only thing that is staged is solid rocket, tanks and fairing.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![NWPCTms.png?1](https://i.imgur.com/NWPCTms.png?1)\n\nAt the bottom is main stage with the only fuel engine. It will do the full trip to space and land back near \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.  It has a RS-25, MUS tank with Oxidizer with its Integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, Un-cryogenised LH2 tanks, and on top, a up side down MUS with cryogenised LH2 and Integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. To save weight, the Un-cryogenised LH2 is used on the ascend and the cryogenised for the landing. At the bottom there is the landing legs and fins. Placing them at the bottom make them generate more lift during reentry and remove the need for wings.\n\n![WXP1Kza.png?1](https://i.imgur.com/WXP1Kza.png?1)\n\nIn the middle is the cargo bay, a up side down IPA petal adapter. Why up side down? because that way the base is jettisoned with the top fuel tank, wish is staged upward and left using the powerful ISDC rocket decoupler. ( the small striped extrusion seen in the middle) The small red fuel tank is used as a bridge for the external pipe that carry the fuel to the main stage.\n\n![E05Mnj5.png?1](https://i.imgur.com/E05Mnj5.png?1)"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-20T01:03:45Z","Content":"Neat design!

I think it took me three good attempts at learning Blender before I started making any headway.

I\u0027m trying to learn SP where they\u0027ve switched up all the mouse controls.  So every time I swap between KSP/Blender/GIMP/SubstancePainter/UnityEditor, I have to spend ~5mins re-adjusting to the mouse control scheme.

The idea behind the design is: Something like the shuttle, but without crew and wings. It worked well, at start I had the playload on top and top fuel tank in a radial arrangement. But it generated too much drag. So I placed it on top, I would never had been able to do that in stock. The funny part is that ISDC sepratron-decoupler is strong enough to stage without shutting down the main engine!  \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@RedParadize](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129285-redparadize/)   I see you still place mechjeb units.
