Do you go north or south? Both would end in a polar orbit but in two different directions. What really gets mind boggling is if you wait an in-game hour and then launch you have yet another two possible orbits because the planet rotated. The game only gives us inclination based on a reference, such as the Mun, but in the real world we have \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOrbital elements\u003C/a\u003E which allow us to pinpoint specific orbits in a 3 dimensional space where all possible reference objects themselves orbit and rotate.
