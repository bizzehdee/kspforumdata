The memory issues on my install are brutal lol. Even with things like DX11 and ATM. Texture optimization of this pack would greatly help that. Resources and EVE are also going to make this pack even greater.\n\nWhat I like most about this pack so far (besides the planets) is that you didn\u0027t mess with the stock system very much, just expanded on it.
