If he\u0027s not on the planet, he can\u0027t be prosecuted, right? Help him out by getting him to escape velocity as fast as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoal: Reach escape velocity in the least time since launch.

In order to keep in the spirit of the challenge, if you exceed escape velocity below 70k, the timer stops when you turn the engines off - if you have enough momentum to actually escape. So, for instance, if your last stage burns out at 50k, you may stop counting then as long as you\u0027re still over escape velocity when you get to 70k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figure this ought to be an interesting challenge in part because of the air-resistance factor - the best approach might not be to peg the throttle the whole way, but to save precious fuel until higher up.
