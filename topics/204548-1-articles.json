Even 4x physical time warp won\u0027t really cut into the time I need that much, because with the number of parts I have on the mission\u0027s lander and mining vessel and then the mothership itself, I\u0027m up around 500 parts so 4x physical time warp is basically taking the (already red) MET timer and going \u0022What if it wasn\u0027t any faster, but instead it was CHOPPIER?, wouldn\u0027t that just be GREAT?\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeck, the long Hohmann transfers to the outer planets already take long enough in 100k-x on-rails time warp\u003Cbr\u003E\nDouble heck, that\u0027s what an entirely different genre of games is for (I think they\u0027re called \u0022idle/AFK games\u0022 and I\u0027m utterly disinterested in them)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I go in and I edit it so that it produces zero \u0022extra\u0022 heat that needs radiators to get rid of (as an IRL well-engineered NTR would, being entirely cooled by the propellant flowing thru it).\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also cut the mass in half so it\u0027s not not \u0022denser than a black hole\u0022 (it doesn\u0027t need shielding in all 360 degrees of all 3 rotational axes because the crew should be in the pointy end of the vessel, far far away from the radioactive bit)\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen I change it so instead of an \u0022alternator\u0022 that only produces power when the engine\u0027s producing thrust, it just produces a steady 5EC/s (it\u0027s basically a \u0022big \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.

The IRL NERVA was designed for use on the 3rd stage of a modified Saturn-V rocket, for sending missions to Mars and further out. It was designed to do that with A SINGLE ENGINE. Not 40.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen, because that\u0027s still not enough to make my computer not lag (needing still around 20 of the now-buffed Nervs to get an acceptable-to-me \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and delta-V for a Jool-V mothership), I also go in and make a 2.5m and 3.75m version, based on just re-scaling the existing part model and boosting the max thrust (by a factor of 8 for the 2.5m version, and 27 for the 3.75m version, because square cube law, but not changing anything else). That gets me to being able to actually FLY a Jool-V mothership on its intended mission, instead of being stuck watching time flow by at 0.25x real speed because the game can\u0027t handle it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s not my computer being potato, my CPU is a desktop-spec (not laptop-spec) i7-9700k (water cooled, always at full turbo speed of 3.9GHZ on all 8 cores no matter how much load it\u0027s under), I have 32GB of 3200mhz DDR4 RAM, and a RTX 3070ti which is also soon to be water cooled when I get around to installing the water cooling heatsink for it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou would think that it\u0027s vastly overkill for KSP (and most other non-AAA games running on Unity), but no. I can start to see my MET timer flashing yellow at only ~about 275 parts, and red 100% of the time at 350, and you can just forget about physical time warp (nothing explodes, but the game doesn\u0027t seem to run any faster no matter what physical time warp I\u0027m at).\u003Cbr\u003E\nTrying to do that with a LV-N (or a bunch of LV-N\u0027s) is an entirely useless waste of time, because not only are you saddled with the dead weight of unneeded reactor shielding in the engine itself, you\u0027re saddled with the equally useless weight of delicate heat radiators that might just glitch out and suddenly every part on your ship has a thermal gauge on it because somehow a part that\u0027s designed to GET RID of heat magically generated EXACTLY enough heat to heat the ENTIRETY of your ship up to almost the point that parts start blowing up (if you use certain parts on it, you WILL get parts blowing up due to overheating). And the only way to solve THAT problem (the heat glitch) is to shut down all the radiators on the ship (every last one), and then rely on normal parts passive radiation stats to cool the entire ship to below some \u0022critical\u0022 temperature below which the radiators will work as designed. Oh and those radiators also add to the part count, and you\u0027ll need A LOT of them to cool the Nervs, so have fun with your extra 50 parts just because \u0022we don\u0027t want this to be the engine to replace all other engines\u0022 or something. I really don\u0027t get that objection to making the LV-N a good engine. Not every part NEEDS to be useful. But the ones at the end of the tech tree branches DO need to be useful, or else people (like me) are going to basically not bother unlocking and using them, and then you get this whole issue with the progression system where there\u0027s not a good enough reward at the end of it so people never finish your game (tho I\u0027m aware that \u0022finishing\u0022 a \u0022sandbox\u0022 game isn\u0027t exactly possible by the classic statistics, I think you get what I\u0027m trying to say).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor similar reasons, I also cut the mass of the ion engine in half, because I\u0027m still not using these engines for landers with only 2kn thrust, and the solar panels already weigh down the probes I use ion engines on enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThankfully in KSP 2 we\u0027ll have the ability to have vessels burning their engines while we do something else, or while in (in ksp 1 terms) \u0022on rails\u0022 time-warp (and even when they\u0027re not the focused vessel!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo they can make the engine as \u0022bad\u0022 as they want, people will just \u0022time warp around the problem\u0022. You can\u0027t stop that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and the fact that ANY engine has a \u0022tendency to overheat\u0022 in general is a really really horribly bad way to \u0022balance\u0022 an otherwise (you think) \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

Back then I didn\u0027t know about how to mess with the engine part module, but I could mess with other things. I modified the config of the Mainsail to allow me to attach parts to the surface of it, because you could solve the overheating issue if you were able to START a single strut part on the Mainsail, and then attach the other end of the strut to the Jumbo-64 fuel tank.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThankfully I don\u0027t have to do that anymore, but for I think about 5 versions of KSP I had to make that change.

The same can be said about the structural parts too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, it would be advantageous to add fuel/resource switching and part scaling from the very start of the project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HyperDraco","CreatedById":188993,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-04T07:26:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTweakScale, Interstellar Fuel Switch, KJR, MechJeb and all of the Near Future family of mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikenike","CreatedById":196142,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-08T17:11:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechjeb, Tweakscale, and maybe BDA for fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-09T14:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224029513\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204548\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221631121090\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022196142\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mikenike\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Mikenike said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBDA\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m perfectly happy for things like this to be available in mods, but please, no weapons of any kind in the stock game, ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is one of a relatively rare breed of games that contains no violence of any kind, and I\u0027d prefer for it to stay that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HyperDraco","CreatedById":188993,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-12T15:59:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224029818\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204548\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221631198722\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022183830\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RealKerbal3x\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/9/2021 at 5:45 PM, RealKerbal3x said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m perfectly happy for things like this to be available in mods, but please, no weapons of any kind in the stock game, ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is one of a relatively rare breed of games that contains no violence of any kind, and I\u0027d prefer for it to stay that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbold of you to assume I don\u0027t massacre kerbals in stock KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-12T16:06:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224025238\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204548\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221630160709\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022202966\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WelshSteW\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/28/2021 at 3:25 PM, WelshSteW said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven the absolute horror show that is the stock alarm clock, I hope they don\u0027t put any mods into the stock game.
