Prepare to be amazed by the awesome solar power of the Apollo Solar powered Flying tonne of solar powers. With about 550 solar panels you could easily put a couple more ion engines on and get it off before the end of the runway. It actually flies but requires an extremely fast computer to run well. Instructions for take-off. Fly off the cliff that runs in to the sea. thats how I got it off the ground it slight yawed to the left off the run way so i\u0027m sure you could take it off the very end of the run-way. when it is moving forward the nav ball says it is moving backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bXIS1bI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bXIS1bI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VedRG0F.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VedRG0F.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?20f32kd9c3c2zpo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?20f32kd9c3c2zpo\u003C/a\u003E link to download the plane\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-02T17:50:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2013 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 79robb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Killenger","CreatedById":68850,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T18:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice but the part count does look high.
