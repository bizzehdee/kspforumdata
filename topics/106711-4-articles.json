But so does the amount of intake air your engines burn in order to operate in the same timeframe. All warping really does is show you that you have more intake air in the resources, which might be a bug.\n\nAs air breathing engines operate more based on altitude and speed than amount of intake air and speed now, I somehow doubt it could be exploited to gain a *significant* advantage, if any at all."},{"CreatedByName":"EladDv","CreatedById":118368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:51:21Z","Content":"well i have an SSTO that can lift 46 mT to a 75x75 orbit with enough to come back but it\u0027s original goal was to go to duna with the same payload...so it\u0027s half a failure"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T20:07:18Z","Content":"\\*shameless plug\\*\n\n This is how to make an effective SSTO spaceplane in 1.02.
