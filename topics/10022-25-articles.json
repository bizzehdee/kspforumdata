H(CHB11Cl11) is the only acid known to protonate C60 fullerene without decomposing it.[4][5] Additionally, it is the only known anion capable of forming a stable, isolable salt with protonated benzene, C6H7\u002B. In coordination chemistry carboranes can be used as unique bulky ligand scaffolds. It was recently demonstrated that the same carboranyl moiety can act either as strongly electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituent, depending on the positional attachment of the cluster to the heteroatom.[6]\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 WIKIPEDIA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHA.
