So, as the title says, how many patches does module manager apply in your install? Obviously patches don\u0027t mean as much, because they\u0027re just small config edits, but as the amounts start to grow it almost always indicates a heavy mod presence in any given install.\n\nAs you can see below, my current Stockalike focused install applies over 16 thousand patches with a little under 90 different mods installed. \n\n![444B4E625CE814A4E20C874E628C9FFDC9A6EB34](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/621843625271807761/444B4E625CE814A4E20C874E628C9FFDC9A6EB34/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bloody_looser","CreatedById":95664,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T08:40:56Z","Content":"Six.\n\n(10char)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T08:46:38Z","Content":"Hi\n\n122.
