If I had to pick a runner-up, it\u0027d be Pol. The problem is that Tylo, Bop, and Vall are just BORING. They\u0027re fundamentally the same as all of the other airless moons out there, so the experience of landing on them is just not worth the effort to get to them. Yes, Tylo is a challenge because its high gravity requires a large delta-V expenditure, but once you\u0027ve got a hang of the basics of landing on airless moons, it\u0027s just not interesting any more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe is the only moon with an atmosphere, the only non-Kerbin atmosphere that can use jet engines. To make things worse, Duna\u0027s atmosphere is too thin to do the fun parts of flying, and Eve\u0027s is just too thick, so Laythe is really the only one that allows for entertaining flight. Laythe\u0027s terrain is also significant, with oceans and steep landmasses; landing on Tylo, for instance, you\u0027re likely going to land on some place that\u0027s mostly flat even if you put no effort into choosing a landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I\u0027d put Pol as the second favorite is that it\u0027s got interesting terrain; it\u0027s a very lumpy moon, a la Gilly. That makes it interesting to land on, while still having a low enough gravity to be fuel-efficient as a refinery site and a high enough gravity to avoid the Minmus/Gilly bouncing issues. Ike\u0027s in a similar situation; they\u0027re great places to explore with a rover.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T22:14:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPol is the best\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Holo","CreatedById":39606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T22:16:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPol is best moon.
