When a mod is \u0022unsupported\u0022 by a mod, does that mean it straight up does not work right with x64?

A mod being unsupported generally means that you wont get any support from the mod author if you have problems (though some will explicitly disable themselves if you try to use them with the Windows x64 version of KSP). This is usually because the mod author is unable to test the mod with the windows x64 version of KSP because it (KSP) doesn\u0027t work well enough, if at all. You should not post about problems in the mod\u0027s forum thread or any other support channel that may exist (e.g. github issues etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
