Something in \u0022quotes\u0022 means it was directly said, though I frequently don\u0027t bother with that. [brackets] are those rare times where the accent barrier keeps me from understanding something, and *italics are descriptions of what Max is doing in the game, with asides and commentary by me where I feel the desire*.\n\n0:00\n\n*The video started with Max in the tracking station, waiting for a Duna transfer window. He\u0027s eyeballing the transfer window.*\n\n*He uses the default staging the VAB gave him, which releases his rocket from the launch clamps, crashing into the pad. He reverts.*\n\n*He launches again, notices Bill is flying it instead of a pilot.*\n\n*He tries to... land? Back on the launch pad. He realizes that\u0027s a really bad idea, so throttles up to go to Duna without a pilot anyway. The rocket flips, and he eventually gives up.*\n\n*He does not revert, though. He lands, and is totally broke. Which is honorable, at least.*\n\n10:00\n\n*Then he takes a ton of rep-hurting loans, geting a total of about $140k*\n\n*He launches again, remembering to bring his pilot. He also follows what the chat says and removes 2 of his 5 engines, making his rocket only 2x more powerful than it needs to be, not 3x. He spends a decent amount of time fiddling with fins and engines and whatnot.*\n\n*The rocket has \u003C 1.0 TWR with the throttle at 50%. Which is great, if he throttled up to max.*\n\n*He of course throttles up to 2/3*\n\n*He gets to space...*\n\n20:00\n\n*...and then to orbit.*\n\n*He realizes that his ship has no RCS jets, so docking at Duna to come home will be fun.*\n\n*He ejects to Duna with little problems. Quite a well done all-eyeballed transfer.*\n\n*He expects he will not have the fuel to return. I agree with that.* \n\nQ: Atmospheric scattering?\n\nA: There are \u0022doors that are opening with Unity 5. We can\u0027t share what the end result will be because we don\u0027t know what the end result will be.\u0022\n\n\u0022The way we feel about the game curently is that it\u0027s a fun game - it\u0027s a good game. But it still is missing a bit regarding the artistic and visual quality of it. So we are going to do stuff about it... after 1.1.\u0022\n\n*He uses all of his \u0022return trip\u0022 fuel getting the Kerbin ejection burn. Too bad there isn\u0027t some sort of readout to find out how far a given ship can expect to go...* ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n*He gets an encounter with Duna, with a small burn in the Sun\u0027s SOI.*\n\n30:00\n\n*Midway to Duna, he plans another node to get his encounter periapsis close.*\n\n*He uses the mouse scroll wheel to pretty good effect, doing what I would normally use PreciseNode for.*\n\n*I think I\u0027m going to actually try it next time I play.*\n\n*He ends up with a periapsis over the North pole. He then burns south for a collision course, and in the SOI corrects it.*\n\n*\u0022We have... 28 cups of fuel.\u0022 (In the \u0022return\u0022 stage)*\n\n*He asks the chat where Duna\u0027s atmosphere starts.*\n\n*Chat tells him to put his periapsis at 15km. Sounds good to me.*\n\n*He has 9 cups of fuel left. He ditches his \u0022return\u0022 stage to be lost forever. He\u0027s committed to a rescue mission. Assuming he lands and gets back to space.*\n\n*He totally, completely, and surprisingly fails to time warp past the Periapsis.*\n\n*He suddenly panics. He\u0027s accepted NO contracts!*\n\n*Back to the space center, he takes the \u0022Explore Duna\u0022 contract and no others.*\n\n*Problem: That requires you to orbit before landing, which he was not planning to do. Though I think a 15km periapsis will get you into orbit.*\n\n40:00\n\n*Chat says to put periapsis at 30km, 20km, and 35km. He opts for 25km.*\n\nSquad HQ news:\n\nRemodeling is almost done. Huge pain, but the office will be fantastic.\n\nHe\u0027ll do a video tour of the studio when it\u0027s all done.\n\nU5 going forward. PS4 is going great. Taking longer than originally thought. No release date.\n\n\u0022I believe the Unity 5 upgrade is just about ready to go to QA, but don\u0027t quote me on that.\u0022\n\n[Oops!]\n\nHe thinks next week for QA of U5. Then they will do analysis to see if it should be its own update, or it should be rolled into 1.1.\n\nAlso, Filipe has been working deep into multiplayer.\n\n\u0022Multiplayer KSP is going to be fantastic.\u0022\n\nBackend works great. Communication works great. Mechanics are being worked on now.\n\nSandbox is simple, but they want to set up rule sets, and have career work as well.\n\nQ: Performance Increases?\n\nA: Yes, but Max is \u0022very uncomfortable\u0022 saying any numbers. He\u0027d love to, but it would be \u0022super irresponsible\u0022 until a lot of people have tested it. But it is \u0022certainly performing better.\u0022\n\n*His aerocapture periapsis is too high, but he gets a VERY fortunate Ike encounter that will totally get him into a nice and circular - if high and retrograde - orbit.*\n\n*He complains that Ike is getting in the way, so burns a bunch to avoid it.*\n\n*He almost time warps into the surface, then burns to get a full orbit, getting the 2nd part of the Duna contract. All that\u0027s left is landing, and transmitting space and surface science.*\n\n*He burns down to get a circular orbit, then puts his periapsis down on the sunny side.*\n\n*He jokes that this is Hilisa\u0027s retirement trip. As in, she\u0027s retiring on the surface of Duna* ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n*He transmits space science from Duna, nailing that part of the contract.*\n\nHe discusses the seams in Duna as he\u0027s coming down. \u0022Part of the overall visual upgrade that we want to do with the game.\u0022 But first, U5. He\u0027s excited to have it done, becasue then he can go back teasing fun stuff.\n\n50:00\n\n*He\u0027s comign down way low, and not really slowing much, so he kickes the engines on.*\n\n\u0022And yes 64 bit is something we definitely definitely definitely want to dig our fangs into as soon as Unity 5 is out.\u0022\n\n*Chutes deployed, engine off, he\u0027s coming down onto a slope at 15m/s.*\n\nQ: Planned enhancements like EVE to stock?\n\nA: Currently the memory limit is a problem. But if U5 goes great AND 64 bit works, then it can happen.\n\n*He burns, to slow under 7m/s... 2m/s... and he lands without falling over.*\n\nQ: Will you have to buy U5/64 bit?\n\nA: Yes. Kidding! No.\n\n*He transmits from the surface, completing all of the contract.*\n\n*And yes, as I suspected last week, the hatch is obscured by the solar panel. However, Max explains, it doesn\u0027t matter because he hasn\u0027t upgraded the Astronaut Complex so she can\u0027t go EVA anyway.*\n\n*However, with no EVA there is no repacking chutes, so even if the ship COULD get back to Kerbin, it\u0027d never be able to land there.*\n\n*He throttles up. I have no idea why. It may have just been a mistake, but he was talking about how he\u0027d missed the goo reading from space around Duna, so maybe he thought... I don\u0027t know.*\n\n*The ship goes sideways (possibly becuase of landigng gear stuck in the ground) and he panics like we\u0027ve all done, hits the gas, hits the ground, and everything explodes. The lander can survives somehow, but not much else.*\n\n*\u0022Okay so we\u0027re probably not going to get that goo data from space around Duna.\u0022*\n\n*The lander can rolls and slides down the longest, gentlest slope on Duna. It finally stops.*\n\nQ: Will the 32 bit version have clouds? (I think this means, \u0022assuming the 64 bit version gets them\u0022)\n\nA: Sure, but if it can\u0027t, then it would \u0022not be wise\u0022 to be held back by it. (I read this as, if 32 bit can\u0027t have them, then 64 bit will get them anyway).\n\n*Back to the space center, all the contracts are 1 star becasue the rep is so bad.*\n\n*He upgrades the Astronaut Complex.*\n\n*He wonders if she can EVA now. She can.*\n\n*So the solar panel does NOT block the door. Though it gets in the way.*\n\n*He plants a flag, does an EVA report, getgs back in the pod, transmits the data.*\n\n*R\u0026D, he has 217 science, enough for a single tech node. He opts for \u0022Fuel Systems\u0022 so that next time, he can get nukes.*"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T02:31:31Z","Content":"Oh god, this is bad.
