Make sure you\u0027ve downloaded the lastest version (linked in the post right above yours) Any further questions refer to the new thread. \n\n2. You can transport Civies in the apartment complexes, but other than that, thats it. Now if you are in kerbin SOI, And using the Civilian Contractor dock, the Civies will come out quicker, (transported to you in civilian transports) Outside of the SOI, they only grow through Reproduction."},{"CreatedByName":"TheReadPanda","CreatedById":142617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T23:23:33Z","Content":"Two issues. One the reactor is WAY too big. Either need a much smaller version or shrink the current version.

I will see what i can do though! \n\nOn another note, Post in the new thread with any future issues. (wish i could get this old one closed to avoid confusion, but since i didn\u0027t start it, don\u0027t believe i Can. \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124162-1-0-2-Civilian-Population-1-5-1-%28update-6-4-15%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124162-1-0-2-Civilian-Population-1-5-1-%28update-6-4-15%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T01:04:30Z","Content":"As this thread is now for an old version of the mod, it has been closed, but can be reopened by request."}]}
