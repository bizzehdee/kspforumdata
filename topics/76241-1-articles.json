this was an idea i had well playing with the tracking station. theories on why ksp planets are like they are!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emoho:\u003Cimg

kerbol ( most possible moons get melted) combined with its low gravity make moons ether melt or not intercept its soi \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eholes on many planets and moons: many moons and small planets have holes on there poles ( a glitch but this is kinda scientific fiction) it is probably caused by the MASSIVE density of ksp planets ( each planet and moon in ksp is ten times denser then they would be in real life to have similar gravity ( no moon gravity on kerbin)) and the poles then collapse and dissolves into dust via the massive pressure then over millions of years volcanoes form at the bottom and shoot the dust into orbit or deep space ( probably colliding into the parent planet if it is a moon)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egilly:\u003Cimg

giving it its super eccentric orbit then perhaps it mas hit by much space derbies sucked into eves soi by its massive sphere of influence giving gilly its bumpy shape and then maybe it was hit by another meteor witch sped it into orbit or maybe its surface was broken by the gs caused by the aerobrake and its core spilled out and acted as a rocket engine ( probably the asteroid)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejool:\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/3/35/TinyJool.png/100px-TinyJool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022100px-TinyJool.png\u0022\u003E maybe it has no surface because it was originally a massive meteor that scooped though another solar systems gas giant and picked up a tenth of its atmosphere ( maybe Jupiter?) and then went through a inter dimensional portal in witch it sucked in the kracken and went into the kerbal universe then colliding into another massive asteroid and exploded along with the other asteroid leaving a massive cloud of dust and gas in space some of the gas absorbed some of the asteroid dust ( don\u0027t breath this!) and then all the other gasses were pulled in by its gravitation pull creating a circle the extremly heavy remaining gas floated off and were picked up by eve witch at the time had no atmosphere ( no water=no bacteria to create o2 and super high gravity and density stopped volcanoes from erupting back at jool a small asteroid ( the same one that brought life to kerbin) went into jools atmosphere and some of it broke off leaving green microscopic kerbals in jools atmosphere ( HA) and gave it its kerbal like tint\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeve:\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/0/03/TinyEve.png/100px-TinyEve.png\u0022 alt=\u0022100px-TinyEve.png\u0022\u003E ( how it got its atmosphere above) was one of the planets that formed from derbies orbiting kerbol it was the first planet that formed in a MASSIVE asteroid belt building up its mass rather quickly sucking up other planets that formed around it one of the planets was a massive ball of mostly mercury crashed onto one of eves mountains creating a huge basin for the mercury to flow into ( along with a big splash that sent mercury all over eve witch then flowed into craters) ( remember there was no atmosphere at the time!) and after it formed a atmosphere a red duna like planet disintegrated into the planets at the time blue atmosphere mixing into purple and making the atmosphere denser still!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edres:\u003Cimg

planet in another solar system that had an atmosphere and massive clouds covering most of the planet then it went into deep space after being hit by an asteroid that also threw off some of the planets mass then when it reached kerbol it thawed a little and was captured into a highly eccentric orbit every now and then it passes close to jool and gets re-heated by jools heat making its core heat up a little bit and the core is covered in a layer of carbon dioxide that traps the heat so that the planet never reaches freezing temperatures leaving it forever covered in a layer of snow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethats all i can think of for now!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E i
