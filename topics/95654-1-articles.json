In an effort to make KSC much like NASA\u0027s attempt at making space travel more affordable with their shuttle program, I have done the same. I\u0027ve finally unlocked the parts (career) to build a shuttle, with an actual payload, namely small sats (Real Tech enabled, and no comm sat up, thats partly what the shuttle is for) and some affordable exploration around Minmus and in orbit of the mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my creation, may I present the Kingfisher STS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/536258467576167105/F7A6D08B23B8C3EFC78E98F44780B0B348F33A28/\u0022 alt=\u0022F7A6D08B23B8C3EFC78E98F44780B0B348F33A28\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem? I cant get her into orbit. I tried the whole classic space shuttle thing, but I couldn\u0027t get the thrust right even with the SSME mod pack, and lack of custom action groups prevents easy trimming of the gimbals to prevent it from spinning out of control, plus the T:W was horrid so I scrapped that idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I placed 2 and 4 LFBs around the plane, see if I could get the dV that way, the answer is no.
