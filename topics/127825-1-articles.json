Of course, I figured it had to do with the \u003Cstrong\u003E37 mods, patches and plugins\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ve downloaded; Interstellar, to KW and SpaceY, bunch of utility mods, the usual I suppose. They have all been downloaded via CKAN, so I don\u0027t think it has anything to do with improper installations of the mods, and I\u0027m currently in the process of uninstalling them one by one to see when it starts working again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is, really, \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhat happened?\u003C/strong\u003E As far as I understand, the game is preparing all of the assets and lines of code for the game, and yet I wouldn\u0027t understand why the game would crash at the same time during the same part of the boot-up. So, does anyone know what\u0027s happening when you start up the game, and why having so many mods might be the reason for the crash (Keep in mind I\u0027m not 100% sure if it\u0027s because of all of those mods). Just some closure, trying to understand why this is happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: One time I tried it again for the sake of insanity, finally got a freeze frame of when it breaksdown and crashes.

If my guesstimations\u00A0and general observations of the game so far are correct, 64bit support has been long in the works, so what would normally be just \u0022used 64 and not 32 version of the game\u0022 just simply can\u0027t be the case. So, as I understand the problem, 32bit only allows me to use 4 of my 16 gb of RAM, and with the butt-load of mods, including Outer Solar System and the Ultra version of the Beautification mod, just push it right over that edge and the game shuts down before it gets past that limit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I see it so far, solutions are both limited and not progressive; primarily, chill out on the mods, or at least prioritize what mods are necessary and what aren\u0027t, and try to keep content low so i don\u0027t run our of memory. If I\u0027m not mistaken, this would probably be the reason why I\u0027ve had multiple crashes periodically during the game when it used to work, and, just shooting from the hip here, the issues with the limited memory use that comes with the 32bit game led to the unique issue of the old thermal system that was referred to as \u0022memory leak\u0022. I digress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn reading the bug report thread, it dawned on me that I perhaps am better off filing this issue under \u002232bit game cant handle what I want it to do, just chill on the mods\u0022, and while I will most likely file a report to get more closure on what exactly happened, it does not seem to be of immediate concern to me as of now as I\u0027ve largely identified the root problem.
