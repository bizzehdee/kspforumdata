C\u0027mon, it\u0027s just a video game, right? Then, I stayed over at a friends house. He got me to play the prologue in Nightmare House 2.

The Dark Descent is at a ridiculous price on Steam and the new one who came out last week, A Machine for Pigs, is also there, pretty cheap too. Played both and they are both great. The Dark Descent is a bit more dark, is slightly more scary, and has more puzzle elements. However, A Machine for Pigs has a much, \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E, better story. It depends on what you\u0027re the most into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut really, both are great.

Not a game I have played, or you could pay me to play, but I am having a lot of fun watching Gopher play it on youtube (he was the first person I found who actually got into the game, is legitimately being scared by it, and by extension, his audience gets to feel a lot of the same tension and atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom personal experience, I suppose the Deadspace games fall into that category, though I think the feer might lose something when you can always back into a corner and panic fire until everything dies (the fully upgraded pulse rifle in the second game is amazing for this, and I have totally had moments with various guns where I just started shooting blindly until the bad things were vaporized).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen slender as well (EatMyDiction), a more casual one, but definitely tense (like Amnesia, you can\u0027t really defend yourself, just try to run).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mercy","CreatedById":69034,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T17:17:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDed Spess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmnesia and Slender are overrated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T17:21:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClose the door, turn off the lights, and watch the complete \u0022Salad Fingers\u0022 series.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T17:23:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say Amnesia, for a complete horror experience.
