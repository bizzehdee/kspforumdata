Audio helps with immersion, yes (example from another game would be the audio overhaul in Terraria v1.3), but that can wait (the Terraria example I used took about 4 years, from v1.0.6.1 to the current v1.3.0.x.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can wait on most of the visual as well, as long as what I see on my screen correlates to what I expect of the game\u0027s functionality. If anything, I\u0027m more concerned with the models than the textures and eye-candy. Though last I recall, PorkJet is doing a pass on the rocket part\u00A0as well this time around, no? The stock FLT-800 tank (really,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E of the stock 1.25m tanks) irks me to no end with the its model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the game is a LEGO-ish vehicle-building space-exploration sim: some things will have to be simplified for the sake of actual gameplay. As many others have noted, real life logic and physics does not necessarily translate into \u0022fun\u0022 for a game. Yes, there are some things that make me go \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022what\u0022\u003EWTF\u003C/abbr\u003E? Why...? How...?\u0022 but then I remember this is a game. If I want real-life engineering problems to solve, I\u0027d go and try to solve real-life engineering problems instead of wasting time playing a \u0022game\u0022. A lot of small details you mention I usually attribute to already being consolidated and included with a part and paid for in mass (and money if you\u0027re in career). If I\u0027m using modular parts (the LEGO-ishness of this building system), I would assume all the parts have the necessary hardware and connections to function together as a whole: wiring, plumbing, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will admit I would like the functionality of some parts to have more use and meaning, but the metagame for KSP isn\u0027t all that developed yet... Though there\u0027s plenty of mods for the game to make up for that, though they are (mostly) at the mercy of the underlying game and engine. I would LOVE that ability to build, launch, and then recover a craft\u00A0with it having (and keeping) a record of missions and re-using that EXACT SAME craft, kinda like Kerbal Construction Time. I get attached to craft designs I make, but not the actual crafts themselves since they aren\u0027t completely persistent. To approximate this in stock KSP would mean never actually recovering craft like SSTOs and/or Spaceplanes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, one person\u0027s \u0022illogical\u0022 is another person\u0027s \u0022creative\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo really, as soon as 1.1 hits, SQUAD should get cracking on the things the player-base finds and reports. Once that dies down and they are satisfied with the game, THEN they should focus on putting on the flourishes to it. (Really, how many people bought this game just for the graphics? I got it for the gameplay...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, I wonder if SQUAD would consider a 2D version of KSP. I was recently reminded of a series of\u00A0Flash games I used to play, \u0022Into Space\u0022.

The sound is at its loudest at launch and while near the ground because the launch installation structures and ground reflect sound towards the cabin. That, of course, drops rapidly! As a rocket gets higher astronauts have reported hearing wind noise.\u00A0There is, of course,\u00A0a sonic boom - after which engine noise drops somewhat because the crew no longer hear engine noise carried up through outside air. The changes in SRB thrust (where appropriate) and jettison also contribute to a reduction in engine noise. There is a further\u00A0drop in audible engine noise with reducing air density and loss of fuel, as air and fuel within the rocket structures both act to transmit sound up to the cabin. Shuttle crew have reported that wind noise becomes quite significant compared to engine noise at high altitude, though that dies off as altitude increases further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StahnAileron","CreatedById":139783,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T04:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe funny thing is there is a sound mod that simulates proper sound effect at speed and in space. (Sorta very vaguely and indirectly alluding to in my \u0022there are mods\u0022 statement.) Now, I know there are the diehard IVA players, but many people play external view. Mainly because it\u0027s the default view, but also because it\u0027s practical. (IVA mode is essentially useless without mods: ASET and/or RPM.) Assuming sound effects are based on where the camera (a.k.a. the player) is located, you will get no sound for the majority of situations. Space cannot conduct sound. In air, if you\u0027re supersonic, you have to be outside the shock cone to hear anything externally (uh, do correct me if I\u0027m wrong about that last one...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Realistic sound\u0022 is almost an oxymoron in relation to typical KSP gameplay (sound in space?).
