I play in career mode, and was pretty successful thanks to all the amazing guides you can find around this place (Really thanks for them!), made several trips to Mun and Minmus, planted flags where I could etc. Also did some interplanetary travel with success and even one touchdown on Ike (now waiting 150d for transfer window). But to my problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI created a separate lander that I will use as last stage for my ship. The lander carries a rover, that is docked to him. When I try to undock it thou it doesn\u0027t fall down but pushes itself upwards. Also when I go on EVA even my kerbonaut is pushed upwards slowly. All tested on Kerbin KSC launch pad. Any possible advices? Here is the ship in question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.filedropper.com/landulineki\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.filedropper.com/landulineki\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for answer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-18T17:04:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2014 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Korthag\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GamerMitch","CreatedById":83492,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T16:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe the rover might be re-docking.
