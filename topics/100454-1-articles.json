I accept all the surface and low-orbit science contracts I can (gravity and temperature scans, surface sampling, etc) and then do them all in one go with this very simple rover. It has enough deltaV on board to make several suborbital hops on its ion engine, can drive a good distance on the surface, and when it\u0027s low on xenon it returns to orbit to replenish from the service module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the rover separating from the service module. There are four xenon tanks attached radially, but one could certainly bring lots more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/riBjRwP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022riBjRwP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus gravity is low enough that a small inline reaction wheel is enough to save the vehicle from almost any flip, or cause one if you\u0027re not careful. I disable the reaction wheel when in \u0027rover\u0027 mode to avoid SAS interfering with the driving controls. In flight mode, I control from the small probe core under the seats which is in line with the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EiH2OyU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EiH2OyU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft is completely stock, and includes a full non-atmospheric science suite.
