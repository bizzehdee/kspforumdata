With the new big docking ports you just have to build a propulsion\u002Bcommand module with a sufficient ammount of fuel and dock a standard lander to it. Don\u0027t forget to use the atomic rocket engines for they have a very high specific impuls.

In short I advice people to start from the other end of the journey and plan backwards. What do you need to get home from said location\u0027s orbit? What do you need to get off the surface? What do you need to land? What do you need to get into its orbit? What do you need to transfer there? What do you need to get into Kerbin orbit? Then turning it all around, you can get into kerbin orbit, you can transfer, you can get into orbit of said location, you can land on it, get back up and get back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiple launches and docking helps quite a bit but with some careful planning you can do quite amazing stuff even with a single launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"haltux","CreatedById":29407,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T12:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven if you want to use a single launch, I strongly suggest you to use a separate lander which, once its mission is over, go back to its orbiter before going back home. On the Mun, it is not really helpful (going back to Kerbin from Mun orbit being very cheap), but from other planets it helps a lot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, after having spent quite some time playing KSP, I think orbital assembling is both more fun and more satisfying.

My own tug design incorporates a large RCS fuel tank, either one or five X200-32 tanks and a group of five LV-Ns (one attached directly to the center fuel tank, the other four attached to the same end of the fuel tank via BZ-52s). For longer range missions (i.e. to the moons of Jool), I have an attachable five X200-32 tank service module available - so far I\u0027ve used that to resupply a mission to Eve and Gilly. I have yet to experiment with the seniors - so far I\u0027ve been using a \u0022heavy docking port\u0022 which utilizes a quad of standard clamp-o-trons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting fuel for interplanetary missions up into orbit is tricky - the heavy tug I mentioned (the one that uses five tanks) weighs 117 tonnes by itself. You\u0027ll need a pretty hefty booster to get something like that into orbit. I have a TSTO booster rated for 130 tonnes - but she\u0027s an ugly beast of a ship (and has never flown as intended - discarding the second stage while the third stage is lit usually results in catastrophic mission failure, though leaving it attached works for some reason...).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T16:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGetting a rocket into space requires a lot of thrust and the minimum fuel-weight that will get the ship up there, but travel once you\u0027re already in space is VERY different. There, fuel efficiency is the critical factor, so you want a lot of fuel and the minimum thrust that will get the ship to the destination. Build your mission payload, dock it in orbit to some fuel tanks, and add just a few LV-Ns, because those are the most fuel-efficient engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snooze","CreatedById":67712,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T17:12:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wjH6G06.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wjH6G06.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModular ships, built in orbit, are very handy for this kind of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander and the drive stage were sent up in different launches and docked in orbit.
