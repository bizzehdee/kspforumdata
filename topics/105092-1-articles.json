The only thing I don\u0027t like about them is that he redesigned the models - meaning you\u0027re *technically* building with attach nodes in non-stock places. These are purely redesigning the textures so the attach nodes aren\u0027t changed at all. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
