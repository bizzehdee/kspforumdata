It\u0027s the only mod I have installed. I load up a Sandbox game and go into the Tracking Station... no new planets. \n\nI validated my local cache in Steam just to make sure. It all checked out. I can see it loading a bunch of content from KerbolPlus during the loading screen. I then opened the Debug toolbar with Alt\u002BF12. Under the Database tab: All the loaded Configs are from Squad. There is one Kopernicus Assembly loaded. All the loaded models are from Squad.

That did it.\n\nI usually have ModuleManager installed, but was trying to test this against a clean install with KerbolPlus. If I can make a suggestion for the devs of this one - if ModuleManager is a dependency, it should be either listed in the installation instructions or included in the download.\n\nOther than that, now that I\u0027ve got it loaded this mod looks fantastic!
