It\u0027s now Year 1, Day 70 again in this save, so\u00A0time to go more ambitious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had an unoccupied space station already in Kerbin orbit which I built for a contract. Living quarters, science lab and power- perfect.\u00A0So the crew was launched in a command ship to dock with the station and reclaim it as the Mohoship! Add fuel, and the intrepid crew of four are on their way to the inner planets. Hopefully Kerlington won\u0027t notice I stole their station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can get an Eve intercept after flying by Moho- will have to see if the crew can get directly back to Kerbin or if they\u0027ll have to fallback on the option of entering orbit of Eve. If we have to use this option, they\u0027ll have to rendezvous with a second mission at Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-22T18:02:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2018 06:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by FlyingPete\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
