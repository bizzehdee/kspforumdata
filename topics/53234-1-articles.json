The simple fact that my computer can run it, combined with its relatively incredible stability for a game not yet officially released and the level of freedom of the game, all this makes for a grand title.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even games as great as this one can be improved sligthly and I have a small idea of a feature that would make the whole game a lot better:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Trajectory planning before take-off\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, being able to tweak a predicted trajectory out of orbit with the estimated burn and all that you normally can only do in flight. This would help greatly achieve orbit with the most basic rockets at the beginning of the campaign but also WAY easier to reach a target efficiently. You could plan your take-off to reach a target directly instead of going approximately in the right direction and then, using a lot of fuel, adjust you vector. Also, it would make it easier to make contact between a craft and a refueling space station in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is y grain of salt on the only feature I thought was missing from the game thus far. And before anyone blasts me comment, this is a point of view and the game is already incredible but i think this small feature is technically easier than most to implement and would yield a very high \u0022satisfaction from players\u0022 to \u0022effort from Devs\u0022 ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-15T21:30:28Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2013 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Specialist290\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarifying thread title to include the nature of the suggestion\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElJugador","CreatedById":18783,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T22:12:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had a similar idea to this before. \u003Csub\u003EAnd Protractor and Kerbal Engineer should be stock features, not mods.\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Just to clarify - I agree\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T22:38:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 I\u0027d love to be able to launch directly into a Mun-intercept, or hell, an Eeloo intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Arial Narrow\u0027;\u0022\u003EI\u0027m not asking for the game to setup those encounters automagically, just for the ability to actually plan them out before launch!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T22:51:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought this was on the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Planned_features\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOfficial Planned Features List\u003C/a\u003E, but it seems \u0022Create flight plans\u0022 is marked as citation needed.
