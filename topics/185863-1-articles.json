Try copying your KSP folder, zipping it, and emailing it to a computer without Steam. You can download it and it\u0027ll run.\u00A0So you\u0027ll be able to download it for a very, very long time even if Squad is hit by an asteroid and nobody pays their hosting costs, since doubtless if that happened people would be uploading archived folders of every version they had (not just the current update) to the web for safekeeping. Peer to peer downloads of KSP will probably exist for centuries to come. Probably until there is very low demand for them or the internet is no longer extant (post-apocalyptic societies probably don\u0027t care about IP law though so you can probably get it on a USB at your neighborhood electronics store) So depending on technological progress, the survival of complex networked society,\u00A0and interest in old games that could be a very long time.
