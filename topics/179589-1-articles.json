I get it wrong too often. I just landed a base segment on Minmus with literally 10 times the Delta-V it needed. I ended up just throwing away all that fuel because it was late at night and I had to get to bed. It would also help if the resource you supply me with also listed optimal acceleration figures for landings. That\u0027s been on of my problems in these 155 years too.

The latest versions of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E even give you a big red target and the exact countdown and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirements to do it. Still, I find it much more satisfactory to do it all manually. So here goes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, get into a low-ish orbit. Look at your orbital speed. That speed will rise the lower your orbit is, so just add a bit and you have essentially the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirement to come to a stop down on the surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom that, your requirement to come to a dead stop on the surface of Minmus should be obvious: somewhere in the 170 to 190m/s range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, start a quarter orbit ahead of your landing zone. Plot a node to hit the surface. Plot another node where you hit the surface and drag the retrograde vector until the resulting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E starts to move back up your trajectory.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen burn that first node at full power. Don\u0027t try to get it exact, just watch the map and cut off the engines when it\u0027s more or less right. Delete the node. Look at the node on the surface and make sure it\u0027s just above the surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou should now have a time to that surface node, plus a number which should be in the ballpark figure of 170-190 m/s, plus a burn time. If you did the last burn at full power, that burn time will be exact (if you have the latest version of KSP, that burn time should be exact even if you didn\u0027t burn at full power, but I prefer to be safe than sorry).\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen you are about 2/3 of that time away from the node, point retrograde (with retrograde hold) and burn at full power. When under 10m/s, stop and let the craft swing towards the vertical - the ground should be just a few dozens of metres below. Ramp up power slowly until you fall at 3-5 m/s constant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy 2/3? Well, that comes from the basic relationship between distance and acceleration. Under constant acceleration from 0 to x m/s, you will travel exactly half the distance that you would travel if you were going at x m/s to start with. S = ut \u002B \u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E/\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E at\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E and all that. On deceleration it\u0027s exactly the same thing, you\u0027ll travel half the distance that you would have travelled if you stayed at the same speed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo basically you could wait to exactly half the time to your surface-striking node and burn, but the problem is that as you slow down, you start heading towards the ground as gravity kicks in. Therefore you need to add a bit of time to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eavoid\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E hitting the ground. But any additional time will be time that you need to hover and waste fuel. Therefore 2/3 is roughly the right amount: if gravity is strong, you survive with minimal gravity losses; if gravity is weak, you hover for longer but you don\u0027t need to care so much about it since gravity losses will be small.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that technique, your total \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirements to land from low orbit will be just a few percent more than the classic \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E map\u0022 figures. My hardest landing was on Moho when I had no other refuelling options and about 950 m/s left on my mining ship. It took a few tries but I made it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-07T07:55:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding with precision is more important than minimizing your deltaV ... it\u0027s necessary to trade some deltaV to be accurate.
