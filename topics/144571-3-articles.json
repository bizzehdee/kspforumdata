If such vehicles were auto-piloted, would they be autonomously controlled or through some centralized local traffic control system? Maybe a combination of both?

Right now, we see Japan, France, and China investing a lot of money in new high speed rail projects that will be able to transport people from the rural areas into the major metropolitan hubs. Within the United States, we see similar trends in the American northeast and California. As these become readily available, efficient, and the public sees them as being safe, the hinterlands of the major metropolitan areas will expand to match the new developments in technology. Eventually, as the human population grows, we may see buildings like the ones seen in Star Wars - up to a mile or more high, and even archologies, much like the ones featured in SimCity 2K.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222693293\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144571\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469634513\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103726\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZooNamedGames\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, ZooNamedGames said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHydrogen power is very effective...

This would mean you would have to spend more energy than conventional transportation means just to produce enough thrust to maintain lift. This defeats the argument that it would benefit because of it being more economical. A better fuel source is fusion power; and I will bring up the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov. We are already witnessing development of micro-technology in nuclear reactor design (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.engadget.com/2007/12/19/toshibas-building-a-micro-nuclear-reactor-for-your-garage/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.engadget.com/2007/12/19/toshibas-building-a-micro-nuclear-reactor-for-your-garage/)\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E where Toshiba is making one that measures 20\u0027 x 6\u0027; within thirty years, it is predicted that we could have reactors the size of a small igloo cooler - that you can literally take with you for an unlimited power supply. Asimov wrote about this very development in the 1950s and 1960s.

the idea of \u0022everyone has a flying car\u0022 and there are millions of the things everywhere:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s unavoidably going to generate a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003ELOT\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of noise.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s unavoidably going to consume a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003ELOT\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of energy.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s unavoidably going to be a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003ELOT\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E riskier than ground transportation.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n...There\u0027s not really any way to argue, there.\u00A0 You can claim \u0022well, we can improve the noise and the energy and the risk with technology\u0022-- but ground transportation will benefit from those, too, and will come out the winner.\u00A0 So unless you can come up with a really convincing technical solution to all three of the above \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E(which you certainly can\u0027t, if you don\u0027t have a solid engineering background)\u003C/span\u003E, then it\u0027s a non-starter from the get-go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing to flying cars is a step \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebackwards\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnergy is a problem.\u00A0 Humans use far too much of it.\u00A0 We spend it profligately, and we\u0027re already paying the price for a century of irresponsible squandering of resources.\u00A0 Energy is a scarce resource that needs to be spent wisely.\u00A0 Wasting it is a really bad idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe progress of technology lets us do more and more with less energy.\u00A0 We get more efficient.\u00A0 Take a car from 60 years ago:\u00A0 giant steel behemoths with engines that are appallingly thirsty by today\u0027s standards.\u00A0 Now I drive a trim little hybrid that gets 50 MPG.\u00A0 That\u0027s progress.\u00A0 I\u0027ve got a phone in my pocket that runs off a little battery... to get that much computing power would have taken \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ekilowatts\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E just a few decades ago.\u00A0 That\u0027s progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least in the US, our cars are a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehuge\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E percentage of our energy usage, and it\u0027s a real problem.\u00A0 The solution needs to involve getting better at using energy-- not squandering it.\u00A0 And flying cars are going to spend energy like a drunken sailor; there\u0027s simply no way to avoid it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo from a macroeconomic / environmental perspective, it simply makes no sense at all.\u00A0 If you could find a way to generate many times our current energy output... without emitting carbon... without generating dangerous waste... without producing excessive waste heat or other deleterious impacts... and do it all \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Echeaply\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E... then maybe that would be a starting point.\u00A0 But people have been trying to do that for decades, and there\u0027s no sign it\u0027ll get solved any time soon.\u00A0 So if you\u0027re waiting on that in order to enable your flying-cars-for-everyone, you\u0027ll have a long wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, 2040 doesn\u0027t mean \u0022flying cars\u0022.\u00A0 It means widespread, efficient mass transit.\u00A0 And extremely energy-efficient ground transportation.\u00A0 And really good data communication and telepresence so that people can do stuff from where they \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eare\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, rather than having to haul their carcasses miles back and forth each day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLots and lots of reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, hydrogen is not an energy \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esource\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, it\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Estorage mechanism\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 You have to get the energy from somewhere in order to make it-- thus the macroeconomic issues discussed above.\u00A0 Saying \u0022we\u0027ll run things on hydrogen\u0022 is like saying \u0022we\u0027ll run things on batteries\u0022-- sure, but what do you charge the batteries with?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, it has crappy energy density.\u00A0 Liquid hydrogen has a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edensity of 70.85 g/L\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 Gasoline is around 750 g/L.\u00A0 Combine that with their \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/encyclopedia/index.php/Heat_of_Combustion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eheats of combustion\u003C/a\u003E, and we find that gasoline stores 3.5 times the energy per volume that liquid hydrogen does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.5 times, and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efar\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E more practical.\u00A0 Liquid hydrogen needs heavy pressure vessels, lots of thermal insulation, is extraordinarily explosion-prone, and can\u0027t be stored long-term.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact of the matter is... gasoline is an \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eextraordinarily\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E effective high-density power source.\u00A0 It\u0027s why our vehicles run on it, despite its many disadvantages.\u00A0 It\u0027s simply too good at what it does.\u00A0 You want a power-hungry flying car, you\u0027ll either have a really short range, or else you\u0027ll need to come up with something a lot more high-density than gasoline.\u00A0 In other words, magic technology that doesn\u0027t exist and likely won\u0027t for the foreseeable future\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^ This sums it up pretty well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^ This.\u00A0 It\u0027s how innovations happen and get turned into technology for the masses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, yes, obviously.\u00A0 Nobody\u0027s going to want build anything unless there\u0027s a prospect of making money.\u00A0 It\u0027s how the world works.\u00A0 What\u0027s your point?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly!\u00A0 You\u0027ve put your finger on it precisely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBear in mind that what you\u0027ve just described is simply an \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eidea\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, which of itself is worthless.\u00A0 Ideas are a dime a dozen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat actually has value is not some nebulous \u0022idea\u0022, but rather a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eplan\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Something that has actual, hard scientific and engineering thought put into it.\u00A0 Nobody\u0027s going to just hand you money without having some idea that you\u0027re even vaguely credible.\u00A0 Unless you can back up your \u0022idea\u0022 with good hard engineering and economic analysis, you might as well just be one more crackpot trying to sell a perpetual motion machine, as far as potential investors are concerned.\u00A0 If they\u0027re going to be putting money into something, they need to be convinced that you know what you\u0027re talking about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo:\u00A0 you have an idea?\u00A0 And you want to make it happen?\u00A0 Then you need to do lots and lots and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elots\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of hard work, with all the detailed and rigorous engineering analysis that entails.\u00A0 Until and unless you do that, there\u0027s no reason for anyone to believe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^ This, exactly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the reason it\u0027s \u0022only an idea\u0022 is that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eyou, personally, haven\u0027t made it into something more than that\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 In other words:\u00A0 you have provided no real value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebuilding\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E flying cars would take millions of dollars.\u00A0 But doing enough engineering analysis to demonstrate (\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Econvincingly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E) the technical feasibility on \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epaper\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E is something that you don\u0027t need megabucks for.\u00A0 All you need is scientific/engineering know-how and a \u003Cem\u003Ewhole lot of hard work\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course we disregard \u0022some old

7500kn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso we know what we need to lift it. so what can we get, lets start with ebay. whats the biggest bldc motor we can get? i found a 50kw motor that can spin at 6600 rpm and weighs just short of 6kg. how many of those do i need?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nuse one of those static force propeller calculators, lets stick a 3 foot prop on there and i get 965 newtons of thrust, drawing 55kw of power. but lets assume 875 so that it doesnt burn out our motor. i need 8.5 of those to fly. lets carry 12 instead for redundancy, you can loose 3 and not die. our power requirements are now 600kw. these motors surprisingly only weigh in at 72kg. now lets find an apu that can carry all this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis is where i hit problems, i did find the numbers 4.4kw/kg and 8Mw/m^3 to give us an idea of weight and size for a gas turbine apu. i dont think anyone manufactures a 600kw apu, so you are gonna have to build it. were looking at 136kg for this system and it will fairly small. that gives us plenty of mass left over for structure, fuel and pilot. though if you want a backup you are going to have to start at square one and redesign it all over again with a 700kg craft in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthats just the basic rundown done over the course of about 15 minutes. but the devil is in the details. im confident that the gas turbine-electric design i proposed earlier would work. engineering is making it work well. i think a good \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and

doesnt make any sense. so you want to be able to transition into plane mode and rely on airfoils for lift while letting the motors run low and cool, that way when you want to land you dont need to rely on a bunch of overheated coils and bearings to not die and fire up the backup apu while you are at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset

I have brain damage from an accident while in the military. Twice my heart stopped beating for over three minutes, but here I am (both incidents were a week apart). I lost my math ability and when I am tired, I slur my speech as if I am intoxicated. I tell you this for one reason - it\u0027s not a disability and I refuse to let others tell me it is. It is simply obstacles to overcome. Sometimes I do and sometimes I dont, but I never give up. I\u0027m getting back into music composition, something that I was once a natural at; I am also relearning and self-teaching upper maths (trigonometry and calculus) to myself.

Well, that\u0027s what dreamers do...you find a problem, you create a workable solution to that problem. Physical skills are learned behavior, speaking from a psychological point of view. Did you know that if a cat or dog loses a limb, within three to ten days, they will adapt and overcome by learning the skills needed to balance on three limbs? You\u0027re in high school - get serious about your studies, do the best you can. Seek help or visit your local community college and take advantage of the free tutoring services...

unsolved issue with nuclear fission is the production of nuclear waste. \u00A0Thus, compared to all other means of energy production, one form concentrates its pollution into a controllable means while the rest spew thiers forth hither and yon to the winds (and seas\u00A0and ground). \u00A0At some point we should ask ourselves if it is really all that much better to litter all your trash into the wilderness or simply collect it all in a trash can for disposal. \u00A0And right now we should know the answer to that. \u00A0It used to be said that \u0022diffusion solves pollution\u0022, but that was before \u00A0somebody checked the chemistry of those pollutants and demanded scrubbing, and then found out that the levels of CO2 were an issue when\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eevenly dispersed\u00A0across the entire globe. \u00A0\u003C/em\u003EAt some point we have to give up our bias for diffusion and understand that nuclear waste might be a better case of pollution and not a worse one. \u00A0PS: don\u0027t even ask what\u00A0Fukushima would have been like if the tsunami swept through the dozens of heaps of coal ash that would have been there without a nuclear

dense cities (and presumably fission reactors. \u00A0I suppose you could have huge solar plantations out in rural areas and use high voltage lines to bring power in, but expect a ton of losses not included in usual expectations of a solar future. \u00A0It also might work well if users kept \u0022electric smart/kei/whatever\u0022 cars near the \u0022work destination\u0022 to improve mobility (and reduce the feeling of lack of independence from the mass transit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHydrogen: \u00A0Launching stuff into orbit happens to be hydrogen\u0027s absolute best case. \u00A0Its extreme light weight gives it a huge advantage over everything else. \u00A0Now look up recent launches and check how many of them use hydrogen-oxygen (especially for more than just the last stage). \u00A0Tell you something? \u00A0That the weight issue (which is a tiny advantage to anyone else) doesn\u0027t overcome hydrogen\u0027s huge disadvantages? \u00A0How about air transport?\u00A0 In aerospace mass is everything. \u00A0Ok, in aircraft it isn\u0027t quite as overbearing as in space, but it is still huge: the latest big jets can takeoff with 55% or so of their weight in fuel (presumably UK-Down Under flights). \u00A0Now try to buy hydrogen-powered aircraft. \u00A0Remember, you should be able to double the available mass for tickets/cargo fees by using your favorite fuel (after lengthening the fuselage by a large multiple to carry all that hydrogen), but you still can\u0027t find one for sale. \u00A0Now ask why anyone else who doesn\u0027t obsess over weight all day should be remotely willing to put up with the awfulness that is hydrogen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMedical/trauma transport: presumably this would be to lower the cost of helicopter transport and reduce the time that land based transport takes. \u00A0Assuming an autopilot would throw a ton of political fuel into a fire that already has an overabundance (in the US) of political issues (pilots, drivers, and the entire helicopter business chain would suffer). \u00A0There is also the question if cold sleep/hibernation might be a better solution to the \u0022golden hour\u0022 problem than hurrying as fast as possible (\u0022you aren\u0027t dead until you are warm and

\u00A0Loud and long. \u00A0While mufflers on planes might be unthinkable now, I suspect they were nearly as unthinkable in the days of the model-T (and they had to avoid spooking

to a landing strip (the \u0022car\u0022 isn\u0027t remotely\u00A0optimized for ground travel) beyond the simple issue of extra distance. \u00A0You use aerodynamic lift, you suddenly lose a ton of issues like noise (be prepared to include mufflers on planes). \u00A0You might also gain huge issues like stalling, but there are ways about that (note that the only way to get the previously mentioned freewing scorpion to stall was by extremely slow travel: it was even less possible to stall than the vari-eze, and this typically happened only when the propeller was pointing nearly up).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComplexity: \u00A0A \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E aircraft capable of maintaining flight via aerodynamic lift sounds like a recipe for disaster. \u00A0Certainly the Osprey (the only high volume example I can think of)\u00A0is most famous for crashing and killing marines. \u00A0On the other hand, the example I keep bringing up didn\u0027t have all those issues (of course, it couldn\u0027t *quite* manage vertical takeoff/landing)\u00A0. \u00A0See\u00A0\u003Ca

internet/possibly vapor\u00A0form. \u00A0I thought the company had died 20 years ago, but these new pages are copyright 2016). \u00A0Note that there did exist a variant that supposedly flew straight up, but I was under the impression that it needed more development and was never designed to land that way. \u00A0One possible modification to the design would be to let the engines (presumably plural, possibly single in an asymmetric craft that moved the engine between the fuselage and the wing but remain aligned with center of mass/center of pressure) rotate as freely as the wings, and be angled by a tail (think aircraft tailwing) that would pull the engine horizontal as speed (and drag) increased. \u00A0Presumably this would let the engines (and propellers) point straight down during launch and land and nearly horizontal during the main flight without introducing a mechanism that would allow this to fail (if the tail structure broke, it would almost certainly fail in the \u0022launch/land\u0022 configuration, but that doesn\u0027t compare to actuator failure).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose that four or five motors would work to maintain flight in \u0022quadcopter\u0022 configuration, and eventually bring the safety it needs. \u00A0The transition priod between post-prototype low volume and high volume would be horrific (lots of ways to kill that don\u0027t rely on single motor failure). \u00A0There is only so much testing you can do, and the public will do crazy things no test pilot would dare. \u00A0Using an extra rotor should allow for redundancy (using four *should* work, but expect a lot of stress on the two motors\u00A0besides the failed motors. \u00A0Using five should let you rate the motors much closer to 1/5 the thrust you need. \u00A0You still would have all the noise and efficiency issues, and likely not get much faster than land transportation for longer distances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: this is part of the point of my previous example upthread about\u00A0using a \u0022corvette engine in a \u00A0cessna-massed airplane\u0022. \u00A0You should be able to lower mass so that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0026gt;1.0, but if you try to maintain those power levels for very long, you will die (especially if the engine is the only thing holding the plane up, or possibly if you take the plane into flutter). \u00A0That engine can pull hundreds of horsepower for long enough to frighten most owners into slowing down, but only tens of horsepower for hours on end (which might work well for a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E craft that could also act as a regular aircraft, assuming that the power wasn\u0027t abused). \u00A0Presumably \u0022hundreds of horsepower for hours on end\u0022 requires modifications at least as expensive as buying a flight-rated aircraft engine of similar power (and I suspect is close to where aircraft just upgrade to
