Randomly generated names are random.\n\nThat doesn\u0027t nullify my point as much as you\u0027d like to believe it does. There is still a pool of names to choose from and Mildred is one of those names.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As anyone who actually lives in a country like the US or Canada (can\u0027t speak for the UK) knows, many popular girls names in North America are in fact male. Madison became popular, for example. They made up a new definition, but it really means \u0022Matthew\u0027s son.\u0022 Not a girl name.\n\nGive me one example.\n\nNot to mention that it doesn\u0027t apply here, wikipedia says it\u0027s predominantly female given to girls in English speaking countries. That point only takes you so far.\n\nAnd if so, then there are no qualms with adding in simply female names to the generator correct? No need to create an entire new character over it, it would be smarter to just add the model and let it be. No need to appease the politically correct masses further."},{"CreatedByName":"zxczxczbfg","CreatedById":74636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T03:31:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Oh you KNOW every chance Jeb, Bill and Bob and other Kerbals are going to hit on her every chance they got. poor girl is going to have a nervous breakdown...\n\nJeb, Bill, and Bob are too professional for that.\n\nPlus, there\u0027ll be other female Kerbals."},{"CreatedByName":"Melfice","CreatedById":3143,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T08:49:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That doesn\u0027t nullify my point as much as you\u0027d like to believe it does.
