I was just on a \u0022Kethane Scanning Tutorial\u0022. I had clicked on the resources and i wanted to close it but when i clicked it, i couldn\u0027t. That was the same when i right clicked the scanner and tried to deactivate it. Even the esc button didn\u0027t pause the game. I could only press the brakes and gear and space center and stuff. When i clicked space center, i spammed the esc key and it brung me to the pause menu, i clicked quit to main menu, I was at the menu where you could load or start a new save or go to a scenario. In the background was kerbin with the grids from kethane. You know those buttons I was talking about on the menu, they were grayed out and un-clickable. I have 0.90,Mods are Kethane, B9 aerospace, DEMV 4, texture replacer, mechjeb, procedural fairings, KW rocketry , kerbal foundries, KAS , Hull camera thing, BD armoury, and chatterer. Pls answer ASAP, I really want to start playing again.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T00:19:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 12:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Djslime6764**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T00:15:20Z","Content":"Moved to modded support."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T00:50:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E are you going to help me? or are you looking into it or do you not care? just askin\n\nSimmer down bro.
