Subtract 0.5-1.5k dV for solid boosters, and 0.5k because the interplanetary stage can take up the slack in achieving orbit (don\u0027t need 2.0 TWR to circularize...), and you have ~3k dV in liquid fuel, where at 2 TWR the aero has 2.77 fuel/payload and 48-7S has 2.35, and you need 4.6 of them to match the aero\u0027s payload. The LV-T30 is at 2.50 ratio and replaces 6.5 tiny rockos. Thus, you can safely build a \u0022normal\u0022 rocket by achieving 2.0 TWR and 3k dV with fewest engines without worrying about min-maxing that last 5 drops of fuel in exchange for 300 more parts. Some concrete numbers at these parameters, starting with an interplanetary stage capable of landing on the mun and returning (0.75 TWR and 4k dV), given payload = 5 (big command pod and some other junk like science pod, goo pods, parachutes, batteries, etc.):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(note that mass is only additional mass of fuel and engines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/N5Uvpij.png\u0022 alt=\u0022N5Uvpij.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LV-N costs too much, and the aero can\u0027t have stuff connect to it, so the LV-T30 wins the job of interplanetary and lander stage.

But I don\u0027t want to use 57 engines, 9 engines, nor 12 engines, and in any case, the mainsail is cheapest. Since the payload exceeds 1 mainsail but isn\u0027t enough for 2, I had to use 8 BACCs to get to round trip Mun dV = ~8k. The mainsail only puts out 2350 at 1.91 if it burns through the BACC stage which would be slightly aerodynamically inefficient, so it will go a bit farther in dV but then lose a bit in underpoweredness...I suspect it\u0027s more or less enough to get to the moon though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/xtdmUf9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xtdmUf9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option if we consider cost in any way accurate is 3 skippers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/dUzQG2H.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dUzQG2H.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E24-77s are cheap but the fuel cost is too high, so going back to the lower fuel options, 9 or 12 isn\u0027t too bad but T30s are way cheaper than aeros, so here\u0027s a setup with what was going to be 8-9 T30s, but in practice one needs control of one\u0027s ship so I went with 4 T45s and 6 radial T30s, each with 2 BACCs (!).

That\u0027s what I\u0027m showing. I believe my chart to be more useful, if less pretty... The mass of the engine is not important to its efficiency rating, though the text before tavert\u0027s suggests otherwise: \u0022The question is for a given delta-V and payload, which engine gives the lowest total craft mass?\u0022. I don\u0027t care what the craft mass is! I care what the payload mass is and how much fuel it takes! (therefore I care about fuel per payload). If it takes a 70 teragram engine to lift it, so be it, provided it pulls that off with 1 gram of fuel (thus having extremely high Isp...suggesting that Isp is the be-all end-all of #s, except for that TINY constraint of TWR to actually reach orbit...this is why the nuke is a good choice in space but the aerospike is better on the ground).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m in turn somehow misunderstanding tavert\u0027s data, my apologies...but at the moment I have to disagree that the tiny rocko beats the aero...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: And to respond to Dispatcher, the fuel of solid boosters is fixed, so those entries would be sort of meaningless. You get a set wet fuel and a variable TWR depending on what the deltaV goal is (and there is therefore a cap since deltaV is proportional to the log of wet/dry of solids (at an infinite number of them, otherwise you come up short from mass being wasted on payload, decreasing the overall wet/dry ratio)), which is especially bad because say you end up at TWR 1 then your deltaV is effectively 0-ish (it goes up as fuel burns off, but basically if you are in a hover you aren\u0027t really adding to your velocity which is supposed to be the interpretation of deltaV...you\u0027ll burn out the booster and be no closer to Mun). In practice, these high-powered (high TWR using their own weight, thereby bringing up the entire ship\u0027s TWR) boosters will fire WITH other engines, so you might find an efficient aerospike setup at 1.5 liquid TWR that nearly makes your dV, then just slap on some boosters to raise it to a take off of at least 2 or more TWR and some additional dV, and by the time the boosters burn off the aeros will have less fuel to lift bringing their own TWR up so it will all naturally kind of work out efficiently. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a more involved approach to solve for best liquid \u002B solid usage but I don\u0027t have that at this time... Luckily it\u0027s kind of simple in practice =\u0026gt; \u0022need more dV and TWR\u0022 =\u0026gt; booster\u002B\u002B (I think I\u0027ve seen this in someone\u0027s signature..). Just going off the current listed costs, BACC\u0027s will outperform anything...so perhaps the algorithm is sort of reversed: given enough BACCs to get to TWR \u0026gt; 2, what did I get for dV and how many liquids do I need to provide the remaining dV beyond what the boosters are providing? Basically start with expendable engines and then figure out what kind of expensive \u0022staying power\u0022 you need to reach orbit after they burn out.
