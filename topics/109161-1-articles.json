However, depending on the rest of the rocket (how aerodynamic it already is, how much control authority you have over it, the speed you\u0027re going to operate at), you can sometimes get away with the opposite: balancing them, but leaving them exposed. Once again, it depends on your design."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T07:48:46Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been wondering about the strange logic in that.
