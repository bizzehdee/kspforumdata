I think there\u0027s 2 major things that should be looked at in the case of both the Ares I/V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Stability, both of these rockets are incredibly wobbly (far far worse than the Proton and Soyuz as both are completely stable aside from some payload wobble) but these things have major part stability issues and I think it comes down to the lack of useful gimbaling on the SRB\u0027s (causes HUGE stress on the rocket trying to move it at all with them still burning in anything but a 90 degree angle to the point where sometimes the things explode). Although I kind of like the \u0027pop-in\u0027 fairings I think they add to these stability issues and sometimes they refuse to function/jettison properly, not to mention you can\u0027t attach anything to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. There\u0027s still lots of bugs/errors in the craft files such as staging issues, control group errors, and some parts missing (solar panels). Of course any diligent user can accommodate for these but I just thought I\u0027d let you know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will say that, as usual, your attention to the details is amazing and I love how you added separation rockets and in-flight control motors on the exterior just like the plans. One thing I\u0027d like to see added is the very important \u0027Loiter Skirt\u0027 that contained some solar panels for power on the unmanned Ares V EDS such as for the Cargo Altair that would be jettisoned after the TLI. Currently I\u0027ve been slapping on two of Orion\u0027s panels as shown in some versions of the EDS but it would be a cool addition. In addition to that it would be cool if you added the seperation rockets to the SRB for the Ares I, but I guess they\u0027d have to be separate parts or you\u0027d have to make a different SRB since it wouldn\u0027t work for the Ares V...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img253.imageshack.us/img253/8841/aresv20080226tt6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aresv20080226tt6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13492.0;attach=83799;image\u0022 alt=\u0022index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13492.0;attach=83799;image\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/NtL5k_iKtr4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E There\u0027s so many damn versions of these systems though so I have no idea what you\u0027ve been using as reference, or if you forgot and planned to add stuff like this later, or just thought it was unnecessary.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure you\u0027ll polish this into a perfect beast though so I\u0027m not worried.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-19T00:28:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2013 12:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Good_Apollo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T01:12:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seem to also be using the EDS to get into 100km final orbit.
