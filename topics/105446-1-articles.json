I made a planet surveyor satellite and launcher, put it in the wrong orbit, and reverted back to launch. \n\nEnd result is this: \n\n[http://i.gyazo.com/97397e39aa9ff12fb0a1c64f960586eb.mp4](http://i.gyazo.com/97397e39aa9ff12fb0a1c64f960586eb.mp4)\n\nEvery revert to launch causes this so long as a vessel within physics distance containing a planet surveyor loads. Reverting to hanger solves this.\n\nAnother issue occurred when I successfully launched the satellite into polar orbit. I detached the satellite in a polar orbit, then deorbited the launcher. I successfully landed it and recovered it, then went back to the satellite via the Tracking Station.\n\nEnd result is this:\n\n[http://i.gyazo.com/753b0f9c46347f139a71e55b6b007bb8.mp4](http://i.gyazo.com/753b0f9c46347f139a71e55b6b007bb8.mp4)\n\nIt seems like whenever a vessel enters physics distance and loads a craft with this part, this world deletion bug occurs.\n\n[Here\u0027s my output_log.txt](http://www./view/na36okfozdmqjrh/output_log.txt)\n\n[And here\u0027s my DxDiag system information.](http://www./view/rdcbf6io62xko1m/DxDiag.txt)"},{"CreatedByName":"Quantum Kitty","CreatedById":141924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T01:16:37Z","Content":"I have experienced exactly the same issue with this part even got it in right orbit on first go but as soon as I switch to the space center and then return to the ship the world is destroyed and only the planet surveyor part exists! Please fix this one I really liked the visualization of resources via a heat map"}]}
