First being its completely unsustainable especial since it needs LFO and while resupply missions are cool at first especially unplanned ones a constant stream of launches and interplanetary transfers to the same place gets tedious after a while and the the part count from the adding all those supply craft to your base is going to add up it should be possible to achieve some degree of sustainability before the novelty of the mod begins to wear off. Second if you make the surface sample yield to few snacks even if you make the warm up take a short period of time with will become horribly tedious to resupply a base by baking your own snacks especially if the lab is in orbit and not docked to an asteroid because a crew pod can only carry one sample from a given biome at a time and no one wants to see some one stack lander cans or spam command seats to make some sort of surface sample ferry. Finally without KAS attaching craft to make surface bases is tricky, and given you presently have to jump through hoops to get kAS to work it shouldn\u0027t be required or relied on.(admittedly easy hoops yes but still hoops)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T19:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tgruetzm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tgruetzm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy current thought on this is somewhere between yours and passinglurker\u0027s.

I think a self sufficient colony should be possible but not be as simple as it seems with randomized yields you can\u0027t always rely on your harvests to always pull you through without sending up a serious amount of hardware (in which case why not reward the player for their dedication to colonization?) that way players don\u0027t need to focus their whole routine around constantly supplying a duna base beyond running the farms but it will make them come back to it from time to time when there is a crop failure and making the choice between resupplying sending more labs or taking the rep hit.
