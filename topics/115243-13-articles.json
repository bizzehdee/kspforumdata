KSP is about much more than just the piloting challenges - there\u0026#39;s the engineering of the spacecraft themselves, setup and management of any infrastructure you may want/need (i.e. life support, EPL, RemoteTech, or any of the colonization mods), the actual exploration when you finally get to your destination, and for Career and Science modes, some management decisions over contracts and R\u0026D.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would compare playing with MechJeb to playing a RTS game - You\u0026#39;re controlling your units and telling them where to go (and how to get there), but the decisions of what to do and how you do it are entirely up to you. I wouldn\u0026#39;t ever brag about, say, completing a suicide burn safely that, in reality, was done by MechJeb, or abuse MechJeb to complete piloting contests.

I dont use a whole lot of mods to begin with but I am starting to think that it might be time to consider it later on in my career.

What Mechjeb simulates is what it would have been like if that software didn\u0026#39;t have to be specially made custom for the space program and could be just bought off the shelf. Programming the AGC for Apollo was just as much of a major effort as making the rockets was.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain - we cannot simulate the actual construction of physical computer components, and the subsequent individual base programming of them in the game. What you have left over, is a universal tool for the effect of having done just that - each ship with it\u0026#39;s own build. Each ship with it\u0026#39;s own computers and programming. That\u0026#39;s what the VAB is for. If you wanted to simulate that correctly, you\u0026#39;d download Kerbal Construction Time, and actually wait the months or years it would take to physically build the craft. Instead, we magically build a craft and launch in minutes, [I]suspending our disbelief [/I]for the sake of playing the game. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause every craft you build would likely have these controls, Mechjeb, in my opinion, bridges the gap of having to hard-code in your own user interface and binary code to the game in order to properly simulate how a craft is actually flown. Currently, there is no micro-challenge in game that allows you the challenge of doing AGC programming. Whether you fly by stick on every manuever also doesn\u0026#39;t address AGC programming. The point of Mechjeb is that those controls would have been programmed in, regardless what they look like, where they were on the dashboard, or how much power the computer had to use to do the calculations. So to claim that Mechjeb simulates a simpler solution of shelf-buying misses the argument everyone else is making: Mechjeb introduces controls and mechanics that would have been purpose-built for each craft, in a format that allows it to be in the game in the first place. It\u0026#39;s no more store-bought than any other part you use in the VAB.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T00:29:52Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Bosun\u0027]So to claim that Mechjeb simulates a simpler solution of shelf-buying misses the argument everyone else is making: Mechjeb introduces controls and mechanics that would have been purpose-built for each craft, in a format that allows it to be in the game in the first place.

But you also keep implying that it\u0026#39;s closer to the game\u0026#39;s attitude with assembling craft in the VAB than the [i]other autopilots[/i] I mentioned, and that\u0026#39;s where we don\u0026#39;t agree.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere\u0026#39;s nothing wrong with stating that you don\u0026#39;t find the notion of roleplaying the autopilot programming part of a space agency fun at all and don\u0026#39;t want to bother, and want to abstract all that away and just install a working one out of the box. There\u0026#39;s plenty of good reasons to make that argument, all revolving around it not being fun, not being worth the time investment for just a game, etc. The majority of people are definitely going to fall into this category of not finding it fun or worth the time to do it. But the argument that doing so is roleplaying the software side of the space agency to the same detail as the way you play at being a rocket engineer in the VAB, that\u0026#39;s just false. Mechjeb is definitely a much broader abstraction of autopilot design than the VAB is of rocket building, for the following very important reason:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHardware rocket design in the VAB: You can make mistakes both when building it, and later when using it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAutopilot design with kOS or kRPC: You can make mistakes both when building it, and later when using it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAutopilot design with Mechjeb: You cannot make mistakes when building it ( * ) , only when using it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n( * ) - Unless you\u0026#39;re one of the programmers of the mod itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere\u0026#39;s no player agency in the making of Mechjeb\u0026#39;s autopilot. Thus you\u0026#39;re not roleplaying the making of it like you are the making of the rocket. It\u0026#39;s not the same thing at all. Sure, the VAB abstracts away an enormous amount of detail, but it still lets you make the final assembly and lets you play at being a pretend engineer, and that ability to fail at it is vital to that experience. If you can\u0026#39;t get it wrong, then there\u0026#39;s no sense of accomplishment when you get it right. If you want to roleplay at that part of the space program that makes the mission software, in the same exact way that the game lets you roleplay at being that part of the space program that designs the mission hardware, you don\u0026#39;t get that from Mechjeb. Stock KSP lets you roleplay at being both the spaceship pilot and the spaceship maker.
