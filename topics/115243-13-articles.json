KSP is about much more than just the piloting challenges - there\u0027s the engineering of the spacecraft themselves, setup and management of any infrastructure you may want/need (i.e. life support, EPL, RemoteTech, or any of the colonization mods), the actual exploration when you finally get to your destination, and for Career and Science modes, some management decisions over contracts and R\u0026D.  \n\nI would compare playing with MechJeb to playing a RTS game - You\u0027re controlling your units and telling them where to go (and how to get there), but the decisions of what to do and how you do it are entirely up to you. I wouldn\u0027t ever brag about, say, completing a suicide burn safely that, in reality, was done by MechJeb, or abuse MechJeb to complete piloting contests. I design and test the craft I build, oversee production of individual units, and monitor them as they move to their objectives. Once there, I complete whatever task I set out to do, then recall that mission back to its home base.  \n\nThis isn\u0027t to say I don\u0027t enjoy piloting - in particular, I love flying atmospheric craft and I find orbital rendezvous and docking (which I do without MJ\u0027s assistance) to be really fun. If you enjoy the challenge of piloting ascents and executing maneuvers manually, by all means go ahead. But I\u0027m not interested in manually following the exact same ascent profile for every single launch like some mechanical pilot, so I have an actual mechanical pilot do it for me.[/QUOTE]  \n\nSame for me, challenge is to design and do complex missions not to do burns.   \n\nThen doing accent with troublesome payloads I don\u0027t use mechjeb as its tend to mess it up else I use it.   \n\nI also prefer smartass over the hold on node as its more smooth.   \n\nIn some settings, mostly then things go wrong I tend to use mechjeb as pilot and works as an flight engineer, balancing fuel around or at one eve landing letting mechjeb keeping the lander retrograde while I did rotations and minor tweaks to keep temperature down."},{"CreatedByName":"Kevin Kyle","CreatedById":110492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T15:47:48Z","Content":"I have mixed feelings on this one. I have never used mechjeb but I do use engineer. I just do all the flying myself. One side of me says this is the way it was meant to be played. The other side of me says that astronauts quit doing the flying at some point in history and I wish it was just built stock. I dont use a whole lot of mods to begin with but I am starting to think that it might be time to consider it later on in my career. One thing about not using it, I have learned to fly my stuff by the seat of my pants which allowed me to get into orbit way early in my current career. No nodes required.

What Mechjeb simulates is what it would have been like if that software didn\u0027t have to be specially made custom for the space program and could be just bought off the shelf. Programming the AGC for Apollo was just as much of a major effort as making the rockets was.[/QUOTE]  \n\nAgain - we cannot simulate the actual construction of physical computer components, and the subsequent individual base programming of them in the game. What you have left over, is a universal tool for the effect of having done just that - each ship with it\u0027s own build. Each ship with it\u0027s own computers and programming. That\u0027s what the VAB is for. If you wanted to simulate that correctly, you\u0027d download Kerbal Construction Time, and actually wait the months or years it would take to physically build the craft. Instead, we magically build a craft and launch in minutes, [I]suspending our disbelief [/I]for the sake of playing the game.   \n\nBecause every craft you build would likely have these controls, Mechjeb, in my opinion, bridges the gap of having to hard-code in your own user interface and binary code to the game in order to properly simulate how a craft is actually flown. Currently, there is no micro-challenge in game that allows you the challenge of doing AGC programming. Whether you fly by stick on every manuever also doesn\u0027t address AGC programming. The point of Mechjeb is that those controls would have been programmed in, regardless what they look like, where they were on the dashboard, or how much power the computer had to use to do the calculations. So to claim that Mechjeb simulates a simpler solution of shelf-buying misses the argument everyone else is making: Mechjeb introduces controls and mechanics that would have been purpose-built for each craft, in a format that allows it to be in the game in the first place. It\u0027s no more store-bought than any other part you use in the VAB."},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T00:29:52Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027Bosun\u0027]So to claim that Mechjeb simulates a simpler solution of shelf-buying misses the argument everyone else is making: Mechjeb introduces controls and mechanics that would have been purpose-built for each craft, in a format that allows it to be in the game in the first place. It\u0027s no more store-bought than any other part you use in the VAB.[/QUOTE]  \n\nYour argument seems predicated on the notion that the only two choices are Mechjeb or no autopilot at all.  \n\nIf you were just arguing that Mechjeb is more realistic than flying manually, I\u0027d agree with you. But you also keep implying that it\u0027s closer to the game\u0027s attitude with assembling craft in the VAB than the [i]other autopilots[/i] I mentioned, and that\u0027s where we don\u0027t agree.  \n\nThere\u0027s nothing wrong with stating that you don\u0027t find the notion of roleplaying the autopilot programming part of a space agency fun at all and don\u0027t want to bother, and want to abstract all that away and just install a working one out of the box. There\u0027s plenty of good reasons to make that argument, all revolving around it not being fun, not being worth the time investment for just a game, etc. The majority of people are definitely going to fall into this category of not finding it fun or worth the time to do it. But the argument that doing so is roleplaying the software side of the space agency to the same detail as the way you play at being a rocket engineer in the VAB, that\u0027s just false. Mechjeb is definitely a much broader abstraction of autopilot design than the VAB is of rocket building, for the following very important reason:  \n\nHardware rocket design in the VAB: You can make mistakes both when building it, and later when using it.  \n\nAutopilot design with kOS or kRPC: You can make mistakes both when building it, and later when using it.  \n\nAutopilot design with Mechjeb: You cannot make mistakes when building it ( \\* ) , only when using it.  \n\n( \\* ) - Unless you\u0027re one of the programmers of the mod itself.  \n\nThere\u0027s no player agency in the making of Mechjeb\u0027s autopilot. Thus you\u0027re not roleplaying the making of it like you are the making of the rocket. It\u0027s not the same thing at all. Sure, the VAB abstracts away an enormous amount of detail, but it still lets you make the final assembly and lets you play at being a pretend engineer, and that ability to fail at it is vital to that experience. If you can\u0027t get it wrong, then there\u0027s no sense of accomplishment when you get it right. If you want to roleplay at that part of the space program that makes the mission software, in the same exact way that the game lets you roleplay at being that part of the space program that designs the mission hardware, you don\u0027t get that from Mechjeb. Stock KSP lets you roleplay at being both the spaceship pilot and the spaceship maker. But Mechjeb only lets you roleplay being the autopilot user, not the autopilot maker.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-24T01:21:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2015 01:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading**"},{"CreatedByName":"livefree75","CreatedById":111756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T02:08:41Z","Content":"I use mechjeb for learning how to do stuff.

No. Most of the times they just provided me with readouts, or \u0027fixed\u0027 little annoyances or missing things from the stock experience.

Hundreds (thousands?) of hours spent on KSP before 1.0.5 had me mostly build rockets, hardly ever visiting the SPH, and I now surprisingly find myself having a great time building all kinds of concept craft in the SPH and flying and landing planes. Coincidence? Maybe. I will however soon install the mods again, to have my conceniences at hand. And rockets will be built again.. too many projects still awaiting.  \n\nI guess my vote is really a vote for CHOICE, more than anything.
