Nothing but LT-2 landing legs touching the ground when the jittering starts. The problem was, my base was built around horizontal components, designed in the SPH. LT-2 landing legs needed to be rotated 90 degrees to point at the ground, and they Do Not Like Doing That. It took huge amount of tweaking with the rotation tool to get them aligned right, and even then, it wasn\u0027t perfect. I think it was this that caused the start of my problems. Then I took to using KIS pylons, which kept the base from sliding, but increased the structural stress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would note, this jittering/sliding was on Minmus\u0027 flats, so it\u0027s not like I was sliding down a hill. Some kind of phantom forces were at play. The first pylon, I literally had to run to catch my sliding base, attaching the pylon ahead of it and linking it as it slid past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T04:58:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is also an answer that you do not need to hear/does not help/does not solve the problem -- forget the landing legs completely until version 1.2.0. Just use wings. Or wings that have been modified to have no lift and less drag. If you have 3 symmetry-mounted wings, and one is pointed straight up, then the other two will make most excellent landing legs when sitting horizontally. I like the type A swept wings for landing legs, myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
