There\u0027s an old submarine mod that uses monopropellant as balast. The guy modified 2 RCS ports to expel large volumes of monopropellent and to create large volumes of monopropellant.\n\nHis theory was, mass causes things to sink, and his mod did work.\n\nI\u0027m attempting to recreate what he did using a custom resource with a huge density. Instead of using rcs thrusters, I was thinking to use an engine that could be toggled on an off to expel, and create the resource.\n\nSo far, the only way I can get rid of the resource is by giving the engine thrust. (coincidentally, I can create the resource with negative thrust) If you have another idea that doesn\u0027t require me to learn C#, I\u0027m all ears.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T04:28:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 04:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T04:37:39Z","Content":"I would suggest trying ModuleResourceConverter using the same resource in/out but with different ratios rather than engines\n\nIf you want to do it with an engine, the best way I can think of is to set the vac ISP to something very high and sea level ISP to something very close to zero. Use max thrust to change the rate at which it drains fuel. It will produce thrust, but not on a noticeable level because of thrust scaling with ISP, but the fuel usage will be constant."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T04:42:07Z","Content":"Well the problem you have there is the water, I\u0027m pretty sure don\u0027t act like water and there was a couple of mods that did that one was HooliganLabs [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53961-0-22-Hooligan-Labs-%28now-under-new-managment%29-Featuring-Airships-Subs-and-more](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53961-0-22-Hooligan-Labs-%28now-under-new-managment%29-Featuring-Airships-Subs-and-more) and boatparts [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24845-Boat-Parts-SubmarineParts-R4-NEW](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24845-Boat-Parts-SubmarineParts-R4-NEW)!

AH HA... Thank you. I\u0027ll give that a shot.\n\nI do have it working with engines. I modded an RCS tank and two \u0022Puff\u0022 RCS engines. One to use the resource, one to create it but again, it generates some thrust. Not that what little thrust it does create matters under water. The bad news, at a density of 1.00 the image below has over 64 tons... of ballast. Not the ultimate solution but it works.\n\nI shall try the generator next.\n\nThanks Cripp, I looked at those two mods long ago and wished they worked. The sub parts... well it sorta works. The problem with it is you can only really build subs with his parts. Trying to turn anything else into a sub doesn\u0027t work well. As for Hooligan, apparently the guys who took over that mod decided to focus on the airships. I\u0027ve seen nobody doing the subs. And I wasn\u0027t crazy about his weird shaped parts either. But thanks for pointing them out.\n\nEdit:\n\nHere\u0027s the module code for generating the resource:\n\n    MODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleEngines\t\texhaustDamage = False\t\tignitionThreshold = 0.1\t\tminThrust = 0\t\tmaxThrust = -10\t\theatProduction = 0\t\tfxOffset = 0, 0, 0.02\t\tPROPELLANT\t\t{\t\t\tname = CompressedWater\t\t\tratio = 1\t\t\tDrawGauge = True\t\t}\t\tatmosphereCurve\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 1\t\t\tkey = 1 1\t\t}\t}\n\n![Sub1.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Sub1.jpg)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAnd, thanks, ModuleGenerator works. Plus, I can \u0027charge\u0027 the user electricity to run it and if I remove the output key, it simply gets rid of the resource without generating anything. That\u0027ll work!
