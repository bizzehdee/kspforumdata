First of all, you\u0027re assuming that people are asking for the new parts to be removed, and no one has suggested that. The concept of the new engines is perfectly valid. So valid in fact, that they have been implemented by various mods, some of them over 2 years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBigger engines are perfectly fine. And it is fairly simple to implement them in a way that is balanced against the rest of the game, so that the GAMEPLAY provided by them is consistent and logical. I have spent more time in a single day working on this sort of balance than most of you have spent thinking about engine and part balance \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAT ALL.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you can take all of that hooey about \u0022don\u0027t like it, don\u0027t use it\u0022 and shove it. The way the parts are balanced against the physical world inside of KSP is where all of the compelling gameplay of KSP starts. If the numbers didn\u0027t matter, if an engines power can be whatever you like then you\u0027re just playing a dumb mobile game where you tap a button to put a ship \u0022in orbit\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has precision physics based on real life. its not 100% accurate, but it IS what determines whether that ship you launch goes to the Mun or crashes in a heap halfway around Kerbin.

There is NO doubt that the stock KSP parts will someday need an extensive re-balance, especially when real aerodynamics are introduced.

The new engines need some balance tweaks to not invalidate a lot of the basic KSP gameplay, to not cheapen it.

I\u0027m one of those people who don\u0027t give a damn about career. I like to mess around in games. All I need is a buns of options, and I deiced what to do with it. I don\u0027t like the fact that I have to \u0022earn\u0022 science before I unlock some next parts. It has nothing to do with each other. Space exploration = science. Science. The understanding of it all. The knowing part is the whole reason why we do it. That is my twisted point of view. I look at it at some weird angle I can never really enjoy career mode. Cause In my point of view.. Career sucks. Cause Science is nothing more that a currency that unlocks parts. I doesn\u0027t mean anything more then that inside the Kerbal world. That bothers me. Science is the main reason why we launch a rocket in the first place..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I believe this same thing is happening with this engine thing. Kerbal Space Program was a fun, goofy kind of reflection to real space stuff. People related to that. Kerbal made a huge different in understanding Orbital knowledge. The fact that they did, make a huge impact now. Cause people, (including me) start to feel or have mixed feelings cause they suddenly care more about the game factor, first players etc etc then they do about the fact that they made a huge change in the Space stuff. The ARM update had a good feeling. A good excuse for happening. Teach people what NASA does with Asteroids. But to be honest, that is looking from a starting point off view. An update that should made much more sense in the KSP education version of the game. I think that Kerbal already grown beyond that starting point. Even I have no idea what I am doing most of the times. And that is the part I like. Let me figure it out. It\u0027s not about the overpowered engine. It about the fact that they toyed or played with the experience of most people out there that already knew that they where doing, or liked that way what they did. People don\u0027t like change. KSP made that connection with how real space stuff works.
