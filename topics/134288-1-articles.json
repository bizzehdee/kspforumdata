quote.\u00A0 I often want to quote the entire message but have it split into 5 or more parts and having to do each part using a mouse driven interface is slow and cumbersome, especially when the post is a way up the page and you have to keep scrolling back up to it to\u00A0quote the next bit\u00A0(and the editor sometimes sticks the quote in a stupid place that requires more mouse work to correct).\u00A0 The old BBCode system was much easier, quote whole post, easily delete chunks of the quote using just the keyboard, split the quote using just the keyboard by copying and pasting the quote tag, edit content of quotes using just the keyboard (this editor doesn\u0027t reliably let you move the caret into and out of quotes with the keyboard forcing you to click with the mouse instead).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you can\u0027t edit a post and add new quotes to it, they get added to the \u0022thread reply\u0022 editor rather than the \u0022edit post\u0022 editor.\u00A0 This makes it more trouble than it\u0027s worth to avoid double positing, e.g. if I post a reply to someone\u0027s message and another message is posted while I was typing, then it is much easier to post a new quoted reply to the new post than try to get a quote from it into the original reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCreating a decent WYSIWYG text editor on the web is difficult and most of them out there aren\u0027t really worth using.\u00A0 This is especially true since the shift towards\u00A0making things more usable on touch devices.\u00A0\u00A0If there is a

The fact is that it doesn\u0027t seem to be possible to implement full BBCode under IPS4 (there are some editor plugins that allow output of BBCode but that\u0027s not what we\u0027re looking for). Currently the only option is to allow raw HTML source editing, which is highly undesirable for reasons which I hope are obvious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that is the case, and if no solution that will support BBCode is acceptable for technical/administrative reasons, then I *strongly* believe that it would be preferable to go with a solution that forgoes formatting and just does plain text with \u0022\u0026gt;\u0022 at the beginning of every line in a quote (like mail clients often do with plain text e-mails). The WYSIWYG editor for the current software is unusable, and often even enter and backspace don\u0027t always behave as expected. In fact, I am trying to insert a couple of newlines for a paragraph break as I type, and every time I press enter it just moves the cursor to the beginning of the quote (*up* the page from where I\u0027m typing). So I\u0027ll have to insert a poor man\u0027s paragraph break to separate thoughts. ======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================== I seem to recall (please correct me if I\u0027m misremembering) that when the forums first switched over and we were all first reacting to the new software, one of the justifications given for the switch was that the old software was no longer supported, with consequent security implications. It is thus understandable, and, indeed, professionally to be expected that you would look for something that was still supported by its vendor. But regarding this particular software I would like to say that if the vendor\u0027s quality control is so lax that such blatant UI bugs are getting through, it is likely letting security bugs through in droves. If the obvious and incredibly annoying problems aren\u0027t being caught, the sneaky, insidious ones certainly won\u0027t be (and that\u0027s ignoring that the possibility that some of the UI bugs could also have security implications). So this software, at best, is almost certainly not any better, security-wise than what we had previously and may be worse. From a UI perspective this software is solidly worse. Now, I\u0027m not saying \u0022you must go back to the old software immediately\u0022, I\u0027m more saying \u0022there is as much, if not more, of a case for abandoning this software as there was for the old software\u0022. And in saying that, I\u0027m not even saying \u0022we have to find something else immediately\u0022, because we\u0027ll certainly want the new-new solution to be thoroughly vetted to insure it isn\u0027t just as much of a fiasco as the current software. But something certainly needs to be done about finding an alternative.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
