Looks a bit bland. Not exactly out there. But you\u0027re not flying this for looks. This thing is perhaps the funnest little grocery go-getter I\u0027ve ever built. I don\u0027t know why it makes me so happy to toodle around in it... It\u0027s a training aircraft, has things like drogue chutes and an airbrake - just like bigger planes do. Flies like a dream.\n\n[Get yours here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xjctndyhkcgi4y4/PV-PR1%20%27Pico%27.craft?dl=0)\n\nHere\u0027s a list of somethings it can do: \n\nShort Take-off. \n\nLoops straight from take off. \n\nMach 1 13G Turns. \n\nKnife edges. \n\nFlying. \n\nLanding. \n\nCrashing. \n\nEndos. \n\nVTOL landings.\n\nSustained 5.5G turns\n\n![fHwJezY.png](http://i.imgur.com/fHwJezY.png)\n\n![vLC3sFD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vLC3sFD.jpg)\n\n![keIE5Hb.png](http://i.imgur.com/keIE5Hb.png)\n\n![ZiS6UFx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZiS6UFx.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikecraft","CreatedById":142067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T19:11:28Z","Content":"That\u0027s a pretty cool Pygmy jet, looks like it handles well. is it ok if i use your design?

Although, now that 1.02 is here, warranty void... Haven\u0027t tested it with the changes to drag/aero now."},{"CreatedByName":"spaceman1999","CreatedById":68861,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:30:40Z","Content":"Changes? Since when?"}]}
