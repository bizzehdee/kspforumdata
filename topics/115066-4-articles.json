(i.e. Delete ModuleManager.ConfigCache, ModuleManager.Physics, ModuleManager.TechTree and ModuleManager.ConfigSHA - obviously the very first two are the one\u0027s that are really important to nuke but nuke them all from orbit - it\u0027s the only way to be sure)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit #2: Somewhere along the way, things changed in your configs and the MM caches didn\u0027t get cleared. Generally, what\u0027s in ModuleManager.ConfigCache/PhysicsGlobals should match up with what\u0027s in ModuleManager.Physics, and in your case they do not. When I spliced in the contents of your cached PhysicsGlobals into my ModuleManager.Physics file and loaded it from the debug menu, my temps started climbing.
