I was thinking that I could build a refueler and have mechjeb keep it on a heading then bring a plane under it, dock refuel, then undock. Im not sure if mechjeb will continue to fly the plane though. Ive seen it continue to to a RCS docking after switching vehicles, but ive never tried engines. does it work?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T20:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, it is not possible because you would need to keep both planes within 2 km of each other, and even if you do that, midair docking is incredibly difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"White Rider","CreatedById":66087,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T20:01:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnically if you had both MechJeb and one of romfarers plugins yes its possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot possible stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A Fat Pokemon","CreatedById":29245,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T20:06:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen someone do it once, just slow flying planes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uocjat","CreatedById":43780,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T20:10:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eone main problem i\u0027m seeing with this is that you as far as I remember can\u0027t leave a plane and go back to the space center while you\u0027re still in the atmosphere \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethough there might be a way around that by dropping something like a fule tank and then switching to that and ending it\u0027s flight but I haven\u0027t tried \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027m not sure about mechjeb but i\u0027d imagine that it wouldn\u0027t work unless your other ship/plane was within physics range (2km ?) but if you were to manage to build something that just hovers by the power of SAS/RCS then it should be able to stay there\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebeyond that it\u0027s just going to be pretty damn hard to get lined up right and come in slow enough that you dock rather then just smash through your refueling station\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"duncan1297","CreatedById":57230,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T20:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif it is possible it would be pretty awesome.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T20:18:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIT\u0027S EASY....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously... you just need one mod. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/hooligan-labs-airship-parts-and-plugin/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/hooligan-labs-airship-parts-and-plugin/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mihara","CreatedById":59752,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T21:01:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrivial with airships, indeed.
