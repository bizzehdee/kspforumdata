Reaction Wheels require 18/minute PER AXIS being rotated on. Command pods vary with the amount of torque they provide. The worst case is the mk1-2 command pod, which uses 1.2 per second PER AXIS. A mk2 lander can uses 45/minute (the full output of an RTG) per axis, the mk1 command pod is only 14.4 per second per axis. Cupola is 54/min/axis. Mk 1 lander can is 18/min/axis. You can see it varies a lot, but a small number of RTGs is only going to be sufficient in all cases if you\u0027re either only rotating on one axis at a time, or sticking to small command pods and probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA single, deployable solar panel array provides 2/sec if locked onto the sun properly. Two of them (the minimum realistic amount) would provide 4/sec, and weigh only 0.035 T. A single RTG weighs 0.08 T, and produces less than a fifth of the power of two arrays. Batteries weigh 0.005 per 100 charge stored. This means, potentially, for the weight of a single RTG you can get two solar panel arrays and enough batteries to store up to an additional 900 charge. More likely is storing 800 via a pair of Z-400s. So for less than the weight of 1 RTG (0.75 power per second) you can get 2 solar arrays (4 power per second), and two large radial batteries (800 power storage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you go by power production, to match two solar arrays you\u0027d need 5 1/3 RTGs, but let\u0027s just go with 5. That would provide 3.75 power per second. It would also weigh 0.4 tons, which would mean that with two solar arrays you can now fit up to 7300 power worth of batteries while still matching the weight. You\u0027re probably not going to fit anywhere near that much, so it\u0027s most likely a net weight savings almost regardless of what you DO fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if we consider your example of 2 RTGs, providing 1.5 power per second. That would weigh 0.16 tons. For that weight, you could fit two solar panels and 2500 worth of battery storage. So 2 Z-1000s and 5 Z-100s, for 2500 charge and 4 power per second (versus 1.5), at the same weight. Or at a lower partcount, 1 Z-1000 and 3 Z-400s, storing 2200 charge at 0.015 tons less weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ahh but solar panels produce less power as you get further away\u0022 you say. Well, the scale factor isn\u0027t set up particularly realistically, so Solar Panels produce half power at a distance roughly equal to Jool\u0027s semi-major axis. So at Jool, those two solar panels would produce 2 power per second. STILL more than two RTGs. The \u00270x\u0027 point is set to \u0027almost 3 times Jool\u0027s Orbit\u0027. In my game, right now, Eeloo is just a bit past its apoapsis and at a distance of 1.65 times the 0.5x distance. I\u0027d guess based on the appearance that its apopasis is probably at or below 1.75 times the 0.5x point based on that number (it\u0027s really not that far past apopasis). I\u0027m not sure exactly how the math works (the wiki says the falloff \u0022follow\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E a spline curve of 3 piecewise cubics defined from 4 points\u0022.) Based on that, I\u0027d guess that a small solar panel array probably produces less power than an RTG on Eeloo only while it\u0027s on the furthest parts of its orbit. But then, I wouldn\u0027t generally advocate a solar rover anyway, because they spend so much time in the dark, so that mostly only applies to things orbiting Eeloo.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EThe point is, for most purposes, almost no matter where you go, RTGs weigh so much more than solar panels that you can AFFORD to fit enough batteries for normal operations, and still end up lighter.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-07T08:57:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2013 08:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T15:18:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tiron\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tiron\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe point is, for most purposes, almost no matter where you go, RTGs weigh so much more than solar panels that you can AFFORD to fit enough batteries for normal operations, and still end up lighter.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s more to it than that. RTGs never run completely dry. Because they always provide at least a little bit of juice, you can get by with fewer of them than you might think. For example, built a small rover and put 1 RTG on it as its only source of electricity. You start out with your electric charge bar on the resource tab 100%. Now hold down W. The rover will accelerate to a high speed and will maintain this speed as long as there\u0027s anything showing in the resource bar. But the bar goes down fairly rapidly until it gets to zero. Still, if you keep holding down W, the rover will merely slow down to a lower speed, but will never stop. You\u0027ll see a tiny amount of bar flickering just above zero. This is providing the wheels with less juice than their full-power draw so they don\u0027t turn as fast as possible, but they still turn. And if you release the W key the charge bar will shoot back up to 100% and you can go fast again. Meanwhile, the lights never even flicker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the same thing with reaction wheels. Maybe on paper using them would suck the charge down very quickly, but because the charge level is effectively never zero, they keep on spinning, although perhaps slower. But with rockets, you\u0027re not holding the control over constantly during a turn, you\u0027re just tapping it in the direction you want to go, releasing and drifting to where you want to be, then tapping again to stop the swing. Between these taps, the charge bar will refill entirely so each tap has the full power available. And for whatever reason, SAS never seems to lack for power when using reaction wheels to keep the rocket stable. This is probably also due to the fact that it\u0027s not using them constantly, but just doing a series of gentle taps, none of which use much juice and are far enough apart for the charge to rebuild anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, at the bottom line, 2 RTGs are enough, all by themselves, to keep probe brains alive forever, run however many lights 24/7 with no flickering, control the vehicle with reaction wheels, and keep it stable with SAS, all at the same time. No matter what the numbers say on paper, this is how it actually works. Could be this is an exploit, but I think it\u0027s really that reaction wheels and SAS don\u0027t need to draw their full load most of the time, and when they do it\u0027s only for very brief periods allowing recovery in between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the normal domestic electrical needs (probe brain, lights, SAS, and torque) of an airplane, a station module, or a rocket, therefore, all you need is 2 RTGs and could probably survive on 1. Thus, your argument of needing as many as 5 RTGs for such purposes is moot. It\u0027s only when you start doing things that impose high electrical loads for long periods (rovers going fast over long distances, messing with Kethane, using ion or electrical airplane/helicopter engines, etc.) that RTGs become inadequate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I should note that solar panels without batteries can do the same thing as RTGs, always providing some non-zero amount of juice even if the momentary demand exceeds their output. But only while the sun\u0027s on them. So, if your only source of power is solar, you\u0027ll need enough batteries to meet the station\u0027s domestic needs all night long. Figuring out the number of batteries can be a chore because it depends on which planet your station\u0027s at and how you\u0027re orbiting it, and some combinations entail very long nights. You also have to remember to open the solar panels as soon as possible after launch, and retract them before aerobraking and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, 2 RTGs weigh more than solar panels and batteries making the same juice, but for domestic needs the total of either is very small and the difference is just a fraction of a ton. This isn\u0027t enough to change the size of the rocket needed to move the station module wherever you\u0027re going with it so is a non-factor. But RTGs are low-polygon models with small, simple textures and no animations, and you generally need fewer parts with them than with panels and batteries. Plus they require zero intervention on your part. So for simplicity and less load on the computer, RTGs (for domestic use), seem the best bet. In which case there\u0027s no need for batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
