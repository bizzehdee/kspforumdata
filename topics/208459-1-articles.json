This is the best way to mod KSP as you can have different copies, on different versions of KSP, with different mods in each. Unfortunately, Steam likes to stick its oar in and can often cause game corruption when mods are installed. If you\u0027re going to mod KSP then it\u0027s best to copy KSP out of the Steam folders and use that copy instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Right click KSP in Steam library \u0026gt; browse local files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Copy KSP/saves/\u0026lt;your save name\u0026gt; and paste that on the desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 If you used \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E to install your mods (and you should!), click File \u0026gt; export modpack and save that to your desktop too.
