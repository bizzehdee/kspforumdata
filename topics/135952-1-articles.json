So, the scanner should have a stable polar orbit, which I thought I have. Inclination is close to 90 degrees, apoapsis and periapsis are both larger than 32 km and smaller than the max. altitude. The only thing which might be of is that my apoapsis and periapsis sometimes wobble a few hundred meters (SAS is already off). Is my craft too light or what could I do to further stabilize my orbit if this would be the problem?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s9.postimg.org/hkc8ecf1b/flight_data.png\u0022 alt=\u0022flight_data.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s9.postimg.org/gw3dvegbj/duna_sat.png\u0022 alt=\u0022duna_sat.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s9.postimg.org/g7ujcghlr/orbit.png\u0022 alt=\u0022orbit.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T15:49:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck again, your Apoapse and periapse are 40,298km and 34,700km respectively.
