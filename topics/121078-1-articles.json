I would hope that at least 1 or 2 people here are interested in the science of Space and not just space travel. Doesn\u0027t KSP have a major science gathering theme in it. Gravitoli detector, does it not sense gravimetric waves, and what was the articles conclusion, that when the two BH smash together they will generate waves that throw stars out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow is this not appropriate for KSP (better not to answer)? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP IMHO needs more science, better telescopes, more elaborate science that reflects what space agencies actually do, not just what armchair astronauts wish that they would do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T16:42:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcept that as the devs have said, KSP is not a space simulator meant to include all the minutia of a space program, it is a game with a space theme.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T16:58:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EExcept that as the devs have said, KSP is not a space simulator meant to include all the minutia of a space program, it is a game with a space theme.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, that has been improving, so we can suggest improvement or add improved parts.
