Additionally, but seemingly unrelated, I feel as though the science and actions that can be obtained and undertaken on an EVA are too limited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was reading up on the Apollo program not long ago and discovered the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Surface_Experiments_Package\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EALSEP\u003C/a\u003E. Why not have something analogous as a set of man portable experiments that can be done on EVA. The device i itself can only carry one of a given experimental package and can be done for a set amount of science. To compensate, reduce the science scaling on farther bodies, and perhaps have certain nodes require a particular experiment on a particular planet/biome to unlock (1 barometer and 1 spectro-variometer analysis from high atmosphere to unlock a high-altitude flight, etc.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, allow for fitting of a particular type of experiment in the goo container/science Jr., which is selectable via a tweakable option in the VAB/SPH.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-11T22:43:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2016 10:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by LorenLuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T22:55:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes. I agree. It\u0027s a way better idea than gathering science points. Also better experiments, which by \u0027better\u0027 I mean actual experiments where you have to click stuff and interact with it. Simple widgets (after clicking the \u0027run experiment\u0027 button) with buttons and levers would be great to have. Also with different outcomes. Add this, sprinkle it with that and bam!
