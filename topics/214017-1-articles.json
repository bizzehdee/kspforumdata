According to him, data miners have discovered entire elements/features have been hidden for the public release. Add to that the fact that Nate, in his interview with Matt Lowne (which GBG mentions but I also saw/heard/watched myself), claims he has already played KSP2 multiplayer (a feature which is one of the later features intended on being implemented) - so there\u0027s clearly an early build of it over at Intercept Games, which means there\u0027s potentially more to KSP2 than we\u0027re being allowed to access/see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m still not happy with some of the parts/features missing/changed and the bugs we\u0027re all encountering (even if there are entire features that have been developed but are being hidden) but, with that being said I don\u0027t think your theory (nor mine) is entirely without merit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T09:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are features locked out because those features exist, just aren\u0027t finished yet.

We are too in playing the game. The comparison of errors is an attempt to communicate and explain and gain our sympathy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts true the only way this comes right is if they do keep going and debug the game. They did give us notice of this intent before the launch if you read between the lines, by saying it was going to be like KSP1 development so I am waiting to see the proof of this with their first patches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said at the time this is kind of a tradition with KSP. We had a huge number of bugs to deal with during KSP development. Unfortunately we still do, in both KSP and KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not happy with the way unmodded KSP plays at the moment, mostly to do with map, maneuvers and intercept predictions. I dont want to waste development focus on that though and would rather they got KSP2 working as that is what we will be playing for the next decade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy message to the devs would be to please make the current version more playable before adding new features, like curing the tank draining issues, both across stages and in timewarp/reload when there is no throttle but the game adds phantom throttle and drains tanks. Those are gamebreaking bugs. Also the severe Kraken shoving which is going on in low orbits increasing or decreasing AP and PE at alarming rates. This kind of thing is beneath minimum playability and IMHO these have to be fixed before trying to advance as the game needs to stay playable to succeed in EA. 2c\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr.phees","CreatedById":32383,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T11:42:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould someone re-render this trailer in 3fps?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T12:41:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes a rose is just a rose.\u00A0 They\u0027re using that agency because it\u0027s probably T2\u0027s go-to agency for trailers.

Forethought is design. the more you have the more you can get done and avoid traps like redoing work. Or you make a tool to make it easy to redo work. Or you take it all the way and correctly automate the work. Software is farther behind than people understand. All old game genres should be drop in automated bits with full working old game genres generated as standard. We are not really trying and software and game design are all retrogressing.

That is the same definition as what it takes to do work correctly and to automate something in a computer. These things should go a certain way. That is not happening. The cycle is broken and hanging like a broken bike chain. The only thing closed to automation were old 80\u0027s tools for older games before they were used to make 90\u0027s games. It did not progress after that. This applies to all software development. If you can\u0027t define it, you don\u0027t know it. If you know it you can automate it. The object is to be able to automate it. This is the same standard for education(although not in practice at this point in time.). No one will undstand this, but emotions are a part of the brains data gathering functions. you have data use mode and data gather. If you have feelings, it\u0027s data gather. Put more info in and it will revert to data use until out of data. This is what makes feelings. If it\u0027s hard it\u0027s a feeling. It\u0027s the brain tricking you to argue partial data sets in your brain to try to learn.(argument is part of a data feedback system.) It\u0027s a trick of the brain.
