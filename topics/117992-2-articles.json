That equates to 22.5% and 8.5% structural fractions Clearly I was getting confused between the LH2 tank\u0027s structural fraction alone (which is very high) and the sum of 5.5:1 or 6:1 LOX/LH2\u0027s structural fraction...(which is on the order of 1.5x compared to LOX/kero)\n\u003E \n\u003E sorry...\n\u003E \n\u003E You might want to check the Volumes page here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/lz2ntsqhwe192xv/Calcs.xls?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lz2ntsqhwe192xv/Calcs.xls?dl=0)\n\u003E \n\u003E It has all the data RF uses to mass tanks.\n\nThanks for the spreadsheet! Are its values sourced/developed for \u0022generic\u0022 tanks? I ask because, plugging in the numbers for the External Tank (6:1 ratio, 100% utilization, 735 tons of propellant), I get a tank mass that\u0027s heavier than even the initial Standard Weight Tank (43 tons = 5.5% vs. 35 tons for the SWT, 30 tons for the LWT, 26.5 tons for the SLWT)."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T16:16:54Z","Content":"The numbers are designed to end up with reasonable stage structural fractions; the ET it best simulated as a BalloonCryo tank with a bit of leadballast, since the regular Cryo tank is modeled more on Delta IV CCB, DCSS, and the like, rather heavier than the ET.

The ET is quite close to the Ariane V EPC in terms of dry mass, and EPC is a balloon tank.\n\nI see. In that case, it looks like my comparison of the ET to Near Future Propulsion\u0027s tanks wasn\u0027t very fair, since the ET only needed to hold fuel for a few minutes while NFP\u0027s tanks are more intended for long-term storage for ion and nuclear thermal rockets. (FreeThinker, this means that your tanks would have a -log(0.16) vs. -log(.22) = 21% advantage over Near Future Prop\u0027s LH2 tanks.) I don\u0027t think the next version of SMURFF (KSP-RishA) will patch LH2 tanks at all. I\u0027ll still provide an alternate Cryogenic Engines patch, since the one that Nertea ships inherits the stock tank mass fraction penalties.\n\nThe next version won\u0027t patch argon tanks, either, because it turns out that argon just doesn\u0027t store efficiently. For the interested, according to [**this paper**](http://erps.spacegrant.org/uploads/images/images/iepc_articledownload_1988-2007/1991index/IEPC1991-107.pdf), tank mass needs to be at least 31% of fuel mass, or 62% with a 2x factor of safety, and NFP\u0027s tanks weigh 50% as the fuel they hold, which is fine by me. It\u0027s a gas properties issue -- argon is much lighter than xenon, which means its pressure vessel is going to be heavier relative to its contents, and there\u0027s also the matter that supercritical gas effects mean that the optimal storage pressure for argon is almost twice that of xenon. (The reason that we\u0027re still thinking about argon is that it\u0027s more common and thus cheaper at large quantities than xenon, which may be overcome the storage difficulties for large-scale ion and plasma thrusters.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-17T01:32:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2015 01:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbas\\_ad\\_astra**"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T02:37:36Z","Content":"Makes sense to me!\n\nFor your applications you might be able to get away with lower tank masses, because as mentioned RF tries to arrive at reasonable stage structural fractions, rather than tank masses alone, so some of the thrust structure and some of the interstage may be baked into the tank mass.

I\u0027ll mull LH2 some more, but unless I have an epiphany (or I hear some suitably convincing argument), I probably still won\u0027t buff pure LH2 tanks at all, since the ones in NFP are doing about as well as a real tank could. That said, I\u0027ll probably keep the LH2 tank mass improvement in the modified Cryogenic Engines fuel-switcher patch, since that uses a worse tank mass fraction. I am also definitely making a pull-request to get the FTT LH2 tanks to be as efficient as Nertea\u0027s, since those tanks are heavier than the fuel right now. It\u0027s been raised as an issue in the FTT thread before, but a PR will hopefully stay on RoverDude\u0027s radar better.\n\nSpeaking of engines, I wasn\u0027t being entirely fair to them, either -- RP-1 engines get about twice the TWR of LH2 engines, so I shouldn\u0027t have used the SSME as a baseline for comparison. The next version will make engines even lighter (by 62.5% instead of 50%) and give them a 50% boost (heh!) to thrust.\n\nThe ultimate test of all of this figuring will be my \u0022Sarnus VII\u0022 mission to the Mun **Moon**. It weighs almost 2500 tons and stands over 78 meters tall, which is about right for a moon rocket, and after I\u0027m done adding control hardware, if the flight goes well, I\u0027ll consider it ready for release.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Spoiler\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![r8JOor7.png](http://i.imgur.com/r8JOor7.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **WE BRAKE FOR NOBODY**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nOne more question, for the whole group this time. In the current patch, I don\u0027t give switchable fuel tanks as much of a buff as their regular counterparts (50% dry mass reduction vs. 75% = 94% fuel mass fraction instead of 97%). I had justified this by supposing that the parts have extra hardware to accommodate the exchanging -- rails and brackets and such. However, in-flight fuel switching is disabled by default, and I\u0027m not aware of any parts that use it (Cryogenic Engines doesn\u0027t, nor does any USI stuff). Do you all think of parts with Interstellar or FS Fuel Switcher as being one part with multiple contents, or multiple parts in the same \u0022inventory pile\u0022?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-18T01:36:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2015 01:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbas\\_ad\\_astra**\n  \nSpoiler was so effective I forgot to include the picture!"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T21:52:49Z","Content":"I see it as multiple parts.\n\nRegarding engine TWR, if you look on the Isps page of Calcs.xls, it shows what I\u0027ve calculated (based on a disturbing amount of analysis) should be the goal TWR of an engine at any given tech level, where 0 is Redstone, 1 is Atlas, 2 is Titan II, 3 is Saturn V, 4 is AAP, 5 is Shuttle, 6 is 90s, and 7 is present.

Since SpaceY and Behemoth engines have TWRs in the 30s, a 4x improvement feels about right (vs. my initial comparison to the SSME at 54 which lead to a 2x improvement). I allocated some of that improvement to increasing thrust to let engines support taller stacks and reduce the need for boosters. SpaceY Expanded\u0027s big lifter engine has a thrust value that is close to (7.5/10)^2 times the total Saturn V first-stage thrust, and the 2.5m engines have Merlin-like thrusts, so I don\u0027t want to increase thrust too much; the 50% improvement lets me get that Sarnus VII to have a sufficient TWR without needing SRBs. (According to Kerbal Engineer, anyway -- pending revision if the test goes poorly.)\n\nEDIT: And I see that I can look for the variable that sets whether a switchable tank can be switched in flight and use that to decide which buff to apply.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-18T01:48:45Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2015 01:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbas\\_ad\\_astra**"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T02:37:55Z","Content":"4x does indeed sound right, although you may need to try to discern which are upper and lower stage engines....the high-tech NASA/ARM engines in stock are in the 22-30 range themselves."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T03:16:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E NathanKell said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4x does indeed sound right, although you may need to try to discern which are upper and lower stage engines....the high-tech NASA/ARM engines in stock are in the 22-30 range themselves.\n\u003E \n\nThe only stock upper-stage motor that gets a crazy TWR is the Rhino, and even then, Wikipedia says that the upper-stage RD-118 gets similar TWRs (Rhino = 68-92, RD-118 = 76-86 -- their other parameters are also in the ballpark with each other), so I\u0027m not too worried.\n\nAlso, here\u0027s one small step for some Kerbals, and one giant leap for SMURFF:\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Kj9hb/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIt\u0027s definitely a challenge to launch moon missions with (mostly) stock parts, but I really wouldn\u0027t want to try it with stock mass fractions and TWRs!\n\nI\u0027ve still got some corner-cases to chase out, but I\u0027m satisfied with the balancing.

You could adjust some of the values yourself to get lesser improvements to fuel mass fraction, but I\u0027m not sure it would be worth your time to do. Delta-V to get into LK64O is about 7.5 km/s, which the \u0022Kerbal X Heavy\u0022 (i.e. one pair of boosters) can achieve with stock parts. That would put almost 7 tons in space with a 207-ton rocket (i.e. 30x as much rocket as payload), which is about what real rockets achieve. In other words, building rockets with stock parts in 6.4x KSP is about as hard as building real rockets (with realistic performance) in the real solar system is. Using SMURFF would make it possible to get that payload into orbit without boosters (possibly requiring a further extension to the upper stage), which would only be about 15-20x as much rocket as payload (which is still harder than the stock game, ~5-7x as much rocket as payload), which doesn\u0027t leave a whole lot of room for an intermediate buff.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-18T01:09:49Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2015 01:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbas\\_ad\\_astra**\n  \nFixed formatting."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T04:26:31Z","Content":"Version 1.1.1 is here!\n\n- 2015 11 20 (1.1.1): Minor bug fixes.\n    - Fixed Procedural Parts patch (thanks to speedwaystar).\n    - Excluded air-breathing jets, nuclear thermal rockets, monopropellant engines, and ion engines from TWR buffs.

Speaking of mind-scrambling, I\u0027ve recently found another adjustment that needs making -- some of SpaceY\u0027s engines are not getting their masses improved because they\u0027re using the multi-mode module to simulate center-out or center-only modes (rather than having a jet plus a rocket engine, which is what I meant to exclude).  Adjusting the logic isn\u0027t hard, but the testing and packaging needs time I don\u0027t have right now.\n\nI\u0027ve been alright with reentries.  Steeply-vertical descents can run into trouble where there isn\u0027t enough room to decelerate to a safe speed -- *not that my tourists have ever experienced such a mishap* -- but that\u0027s the case for stock Kerbin as well.
