It\u0027s a gas properties issue -- argon is much lighter than xenon, which means its pressure vessel is going to be heavier relative to its contents, and there\u0027s also the matter that supercritical gas effects mean that the optimal storage pressure for argon is almost twice that of xenon. (The reason that we\u0027re still thinking about argon is that it\u0027s more common and thus cheaper at large quantities than xenon, which may be overcome the storage difficulties for large-scale ion and plasma thrusters.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-17T01:32:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2015 01:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbas_ad_astra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T02:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMakes sense to me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your applications you might be able to get away with lower tank masses, because as mentioned RF tries to arrive at reasonable stage structural fractions, rather than tank masses alone, so some of the thrust structure and some of the interstage may be baked into the tank mass.

I\u0027ll mull LH2 some more, but unless I have an epiphany (or I hear some suitably convincing argument), I probably still won\u0027t buff pure LH2 tanks at all, since the ones in NFP are doing about as well as a real tank could. That said, I\u0027ll probably keep the LH2 tank mass improvement in the modified Cryogenic Engines fuel-switcher patch, since that uses a worse tank mass fraction. I am also definitely making a pull-request to get the FTT LH2 tanks to be as efficient as Nertea\u0027s, since those tanks are heavier than the fuel right now.

Since SpaceY and Behemoth engines have TWRs in the 30s, a 4x improvement feels about right (vs. my initial comparison to the SSME at 54 which lead to a 2x improvement). I allocated some of that improvement to increasing thrust to let engines support taller stacks and reduce the need for boosters. SpaceY Expanded\u0027s big lifter engine has a thrust value that is close to (7.5/10)^2 times the total Saturn V first-stage thrust, and the 2.5m engines have Merlin-like thrusts, so I don\u0027t want to increase thrust too much; the 50% improvement lets me get that Sarnus VII to have a sufficient TWR without needing SRBs.

You could adjust some of the values yourself to get lesser improvements to fuel mass fraction, but I\u0027m not sure it would be worth your time to do. Delta-V to get into LK64O is about 7.5 km/s, which the \u0022Kerbal X Heavy\u0022 (i.e. one pair of boosters) can achieve with stock parts. That would put almost 7 tons in space with a 207-ton rocket (i.e. 30x as much rocket as payload), which is about what real rockets achieve. In other words, building rockets with stock parts in 6.4x KSP is about as hard as building real rockets (with realistic performance) in the real solar system is. Using SMURFF would make it possible to get that payload into orbit without boosters (possibly requiring a further extension to the upper stage), which would only be about 15-20x as much rocket as payload (which is still harder than the stock game, ~5-7x as much rocket as payload), which doesn\u0027t leave a whole lot of room for an intermediate buff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-18T01:09:49Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2015 01:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbas_ad_astra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed formatting.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T04:26:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 1.1.1 is here!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n2015 11 20 (1.1.1): Minor bug fixes.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFixed Procedural Parts patch (thanks to speedwaystar).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExcluded air-breathing jets, nuclear thermal rockets, monopropellant engines, and ion engines from TWR buffs.
