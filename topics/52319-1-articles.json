I think I have the thrust to do it, But I keep running into a problem. For some reason my fuel stops draining from my outer tanks onto my secondary engines. This is using some rudimentary Asparagus staging here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I have 4 large outer tanks, draining into 4 smaller inner tanks, which then drain into one large interior tank. Little complicated, but it works. now, I get to about 100k, then one of my smaller tanks stops using the larger outer tanks fuel, and stars draining its own fuel. so, as I\u0027m climbing, I jettison the outer tanks, then 3 of my rockets start relying on their fuel, and the 4th runs out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the flight log, nothing bad has happened. and I still have complete control of all my engines, so nothing came apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would upload my craft, but I think the site I was using has been taken down (megaupload). If you want to see my craft in action, I have some screen shots to show which tank is draining fuel when it shouldn\u0027t:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s609.photobucket.com/user/mattig89ch/media/screenshot9_zps3c83d266.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i609.photobucket.com/albums/tt175/mattig89ch/screenshot9_zps3c83d266.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot9_zps3c83d266.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see the fuel lines are still intact, but its draining fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s609.photobucket.com/user/mattig89ch/media/screenshot10_zpsb62a01cc.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i609.photobucket.com/albums/tt175/mattig89ch/screenshot10_zpsb62a01cc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot10_zpsb62a01cc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see, I still have control over the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daishi","CreatedById":85055,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T03:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might have a fuel line around the wrong way somewhere?
