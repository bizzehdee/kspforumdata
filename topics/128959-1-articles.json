I planned interplanetary transfer by reading the wiki \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:How_to_get_to_Duna\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETutorial\u003C/a\u003E. Actually you have to wait for the planets to align i.e., Kerbin and Duna should be around 44\u00B0 with sun as center. Then I launched it to a 100km orbit around kerbin. And after the prograde burn my spacecraft was on the transfer orbit around the sun to Duna. I did a retrograde burn after arriving Duna so that my periapsis is beneath the surface for an aerobraking. Then I opned the parachutes to slow it down to around 10m/s. After that the engines of the skycrane were ignited to land it safely and later detachd the skycrane and crashed it somewhere. I will be uploading the pics soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abhishek Adhikari","CreatedById":154450,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T06:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/mQlgh/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T17:10:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery nice job! But for future missions you might want to have a little less RCS since it hurts your overall Delta-V since it is highh density, usually 100-150 units of Monoprop for manuvering on a large stage is good. But the skycrane is awesome! Could you upload the craft file to KerbalX (or anying else works, it\u0027s just preferred to use KerbalX) so we can download it since I want to fly it now!
