[Waterfall test screens](https://imgur.com/a/1gzQrbE)  The only problem with waterfall is the F1 engine having minimal waterfall plume effects when not turned on. (again, not made by shadowmage so will have to pick that up with the ones that actually made the configs)\n\nAnd then there are the mysterious nullrefs... I was making a list of parts with problems, in the hope of narrowing things down incase there would ever be an update for this mod, basicly bughunt and make a list... And when testing all the parts i ran into something weird. To start that off we need to go back a few years, there has been a period where i was using this mod and my sunflare vanishing into thin air when i turned on the lights of a command module for example. Never knew what caused it, and because sstu was the only mod i used back then, i reported it on the forum once, and it was quickly brushed off as being a scatterer problem. Now, since then i saw how ppl report bugs and such and the way in wich they do it, so i understand the reaction there back then.  Wich brings me to now. When testing sstu past days i noticed a few parts having nullrefs, like the TKS part on a station when opening solar panels.  Lights on a command module triggered the same nullrefs still. And last night i was testing the inflatable parts of sstu, see if they inflated properly and such, all with console open, see if there were exceptions or errors. And there it was again, 1 of the inflatables nullreffed, so i added it to the list. But it didnt make sense, why would 1 part give errors while its most likely coded the exact same way as the other ones. The same thing happened on another set of inflatable parts. And then it dawned on me... the one thing those parts had in common was that they are the root part of the build. So i did a test, sent the exact 4 inflatable parts into orbit, but with another part being the root and behold...the root part nullreffed. So all these years of vanishing sunflares and such were not because i turned on the light in the command pod, but because i made the root part do something actively. The easy work around is to put a probe core on stations, make it the root part and the nullrefs will be gone, but it doesnt really solve the problem. Lets take a command module as example, i can add what i want to that but in the end i will end up with a command module\u002Bservice bay for example, both of wich will be sstu parts. There comes that moment when im left with a root part from SSTU and when i have it do anything, turn on lights or deploy solar panels or send science...i get the nullref. And i went back to my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E install, a 1.8.1 install, and tested my theory...and there it was... nullref on the root part and my sunflare went up in smoke before i could blink. After the errors the parts work fine, its just that one moment it has a fit when you make it do stuff.\n\nApart from what i mentioned above...everything passed every test i put it through, in a clean install and a 150 mod install.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-13T11:32:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2021 11:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Wackenhut**"},{"CreatedByName":"flyairways_x3","CreatedById":216603,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-15T12:17:50Z","Content":"[https://www.curse.com/](https://www.curse.com/) is replaced to [https://www.curseforge.com/](https://www.curseforge.com/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wackenhut","CreatedById":188714,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-16T12:33:12Z","Content":"the lighting on station parts, the not working staging button for fairings and an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E with a fugly plume are basicly the only things i can find, havent run into antything new that doesn\u0027t work.
