I have assembled a duna ship in orbit. It will probably fail spectacularly, but whatever. I am going to post a quicksave, and I would very much appreciate it if someone could add an antennae to the science lab (which I simply forgot to do, and since I am such a noob and do not have a quicksave before construction, only want to do as many dockings as necessary.

If it is station assembly, use the segment that has the desired part for the mating antenna. Add the antenna as the LAST part of the assembly. Name this craft with a unique ship name and make note of it.\u00A0For the sake of time, use Hyperedit to put the full craft in space. \u00A0Stage the craft down to the state it is in orbit. \u00A0Now you can look in the persistant.sfs (a text file) and search for your ship name. \u00A0Within the VESSEL { }\u00A0section find the PART { } section\u00A0information for the antenna you added. \u00A0You can then copy the text for this and insert it into the VESSEL { } section in your persistant.sfs file of your main game.
