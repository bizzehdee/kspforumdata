It was decided that docking with these vessels could be easier with a robotic arm to assist with docking and repairs. So a mission was done to test this new robotic arm system. Things did not go 100% due to the magnet being very powerful it caused it to snap a little too hard and the probe lost a solar panel. It was decided not to activate any magnetism until the arm is close enough to the probe, lesson learned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/p8sXH9GD1dE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-30T08:16:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2013 08:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by mojobojo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
