It should feature cut-scenes. And a number of those should feature a particular spokeman, who needs to be modeled very well, in appearance, style, gesture and the way he spins things. Sort of clumsy on all four accounts, probably. Maybe he should smirk and squint whenever he\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s telling a lie, like a certain president in the past (dont want to spur political debate here, but i swear i could tell everytime he did that), or raise both thumbs, like another. I dunno. Anyways: He\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ll need subtitles for various occassions. Since he\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ll be the guy having to sell the failures as \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4unexpected outcomes of experiments, which ended up yielding far more knowledge than had previously been expected of them\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, those occassions will mostly include bad stuff. So, bringing this post back to its beginning: Work on those subtitles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ranting on: The main thing about that spokesperson is, that he needs to be very \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4see-through\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, with nervous ticks and behaviour-patterns that are very easy to pick up, while he himself sees himself as very cunning and the pinnacle of smooth-talk. The fun part is, that he does a great job, since the kerbals buy it... You need to work suspension here: Say, at you news-conference cut-scene, an unpleasent question comes up. Mr. Spokesman hestitates for a bit. Puts on a thoughtful face, as the camera starts to move close up. Then he starts to squint - camera keeps closing up, guy keeps squinting harder and harder - almost as if he was trying to hypnotize his audience with closed eyes. Since you have picked up by now, that he squints everytime he\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s about to present more-than-questionable facts, you are really out on suspense by now: What sort of frog-prince is he gonna pull out of his hat now. And then comes the most obvious and blatant BS, that just makes you snort or giggle or rofl or whatever, followed by a second of silence... the audience is shown as it stands there, frozen, digesting what the spokesman said. And when they are done with that, all unisono, they start to cheer and jubilee, cause, hey, you heard it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will make you think wether the subs are translated correctly or wether you just misread what the guy said - cause remember they are all talking jibberish - you only get to read subs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: The kerbals need to be like sheldon cooper when he gets told that \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4it isnt what it looks like.\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-07T17:52:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2013 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akinesis","CreatedById":71042,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T17:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it wrong that I am totally, totally, TOTALLY jealous of your life??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was like that once, then I got married and had kids.
