There\u0027s no point capturing above 30FPS (that\u0027s what YouTube is), if you\u0027ve got more than one HDD record on the one that doesn\u0027t have the OS/Game on it, otherwise set the quality/framesize as high as you can without bad effects to gameplay. Try a couple of the recorders because different people swear each is better/worse on their particular system. I use Afterburner, there\u0027s also Fraps, Bandicam and some others I can\u0027t recall.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"starkllr","CreatedById":67760,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T22:44:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne more dumb question...where do I find the screenshots folder?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"starkllr","CreatedById":67760,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T22:50:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI looked in my KSP folder, and there is no \u0022Screenshots\u0022 folder in the main directory, or in the saved game directory.
