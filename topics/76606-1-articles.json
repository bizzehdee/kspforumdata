The high inclination of the probe\u0027s orbit will stop it entering Minmus\u0027s SOI. Then you only need to wait for the Mun to be in the right spot too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get into that orbit in the first place, I would wait until KSC is under Minmus\u0027s AN/DN (you might have to eyeball this, in which case you can use the apparent intersection of Kerbin\u0027s centre, the Mun\u0027s orbit, and Minmus\u0027s orbit to guide you), then launch and pitch north or south. That will get you a roughly polar orbit that you can then expand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-03T23:51:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2014 11:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cantab\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
