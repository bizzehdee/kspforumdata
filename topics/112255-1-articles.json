I would find it boring too, if I had to do all the manoeuvres manually. After you have planned your 20th~30th manoeuvre node it becomes tedious. To me, the greatest aid to loving KSP is a mod called Mechjeb. Mechjeb is an autopilot. Mechjeb does your nodes for you. it aligns you craft to the node and executes the burns. This leaves you to plan missions, build rockets, and do all the fun stuff. Other people will disagree. They like to do the hands on stuff. Good for them. I find it boring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
