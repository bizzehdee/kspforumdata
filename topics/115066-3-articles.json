Supports aeroFXdensityExponent1 (default = 2.0) and aeroFXdensityMult1 default = 90), and the final density passed to aeroFX will be (density^aeroFXdensityExponent1 \\* aeroFXdensityMult1 \u002B density^PhysicsGlobals.aeroFXDensityExponent) instead of just density^PhysicsGlobals.aeroFXDensityExponent."},{"CreatedByName":"jsimmons","CreatedById":85423,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T15:17:48Z","Content":"Is SO2 supported?"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T17:30:22Z","Content":"SO2?\n\n10char"},{"CreatedByName":"jsimmons","CreatedById":85423,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T18:34:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E SO2?\n\u003E 10char\n\nSulfur Dioxide"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T01:20:11Z","Content":"Ah.

It set some value to zero IIRC.\n\nI cant find the thread it was in though, can you remember what it was? Or is it no longer necessary since the update to 1.1?\n\nAt the moment, with realheat, I get aero FX starting around 80m/s, meaning that any craft I build (unless a very slow mover for some reason) is almost always shrouded in either clouds or fire whilst in-atmosphere.\n\nRemoving realheat removes the problem, but in above mentioned thread I thik you said that it was not necessary, implying that realheat has some use to us normal-scalers?\n\nSorry to be so vague! \n\nThanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T13:59:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 01:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by p1t1o**"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T21:37:42Z","Content":"Put this in a cfg somewhere, should do the trick:\n\n    @REALHEAT{\t%aeroFXdensityExponent1 = 1\t%aeroFXdensityMult1 = 0}"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T22:10:37Z","Content":"Thats the one, thanks ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T02:29:01Z","Content":"is this compatible with deadly reenetery continued?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T04:35:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E is this compatible with deadly reenetery continued?\n\nYes.

The guy in the video does not have an overheating problem.\n\nThe guy in the first post is from August and that was probably because of an outdated version of FAR which had radiative area problems back then.\n\nYou do look like you have an overheating problem. Post your logs (output\\_log.txt if Windows. player.log if Mac/Linux - if you\u0027re not sure where to find those files then see this post: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229))\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t hurt to post your ModuleManager.ConfigCache file from your GameData folder either. Between the logs and the cache, quite a bit of info about your install is possible.\n\nDo you also have Deadly Reentry installed? \n\nIf so, (or probably even if you don\u0027t) then unless parts are exploding, you *don\u0027t* have an overheating problem and the gauge is lying. It\u0027s a stock bug where the gauge checks for skin overheating by comparing skin temp to part internal max temp, which can be different. (In stock, AFAIK they\u0027re always the same. DRE and possibly other mods may set lower max internal temps with higher outers and it confuses the gauge.
