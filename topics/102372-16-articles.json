Take 12-16 tourists to an orbital station for 40 days with a Pilot, Engineer and Scientist and when you return 3 of them will be added to your permanent roster (one Pilot, Engineer and Scientist).  They\u0027ll also get a little bit of bonus experience (enough to bump them to level 1).\n\n**ContractPack-Tourism 1.4.0**\n\n- Strategia integration.\n- New space camp contract which gives you free Kerbals (thanks mcortez for the inspiration).\n- Investor contract (and therefore casino/hotel contracts) are now repeatable.\n- Support edge case for RemoteTech \u002B AntennaRange installations (thanks Algiark).\n- Fixed asteroid contracts to need the tourism starter contract completed.\n- Show messages when entering/leaving waypoints.\n- Silence warning about deprecated Contract Configurator functionality."},{"CreatedByName":"mcortez","CreatedById":153791,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-03T06:11:56Z","Content":"Super awesome!\n\nQuestion on older Station/Bases contracts -- what triggers base contracts?
