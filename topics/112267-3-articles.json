Remember an airliner can immediately turn around and go back out with a cursory inspection (the pilot\u0027s walkaround). The issue so far is that spacecraft have to deal with much more powerful forces than a plane. When it was originally designed the Space Shuttle was supposed to fly ~50 times a YEAR, about a launch every week. When NASA was promoting it to Congress they said turn around would be like an airplane.

Having one LV that achieves 70-80% utilisation is not lost money, however - it will not incur significantly higher maintenance costs by sitting around for a week after each launch. Could earn more money, is not equivalent to losing money, so long as profits are coming in. And having sub-100% utilisation on a reusable vehicle allows, as said, for quick-inserts such as replacement launches when a spare satellite was on hand, or for a payload that was with another service to transfer over should a failure occur and their launch be cancelled. It is a poor way for disposable rockets to operate, as you\u0027re literally making more of a thing than you need, but making one of a thing that can do more than it needs to is not inherently flawed. Airliners are almost always at sub-50% utilisation, yet airlines are functional as a very low-margin business - if it didn\u0027t work profitably, they\u0027re the last business that would be allowing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no inherent reason for a higher flight rate to be safer than a lower one.

The previous flight proves the components on the vehicle work - so long as high-wear components are checked and verified, then low-wear components are not a risk, and this previously-used vehicle is therefore more reliable than a twice-tested-now-launch component seen on a disposable rocket. SpaceX certainly realise this would be the case, allowing them to repeatedly recycle engines, and then dispose of older ones on the upper stage. And this mode certainly works for aircraft, which have a much higher safety requirement than rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, only reason to go for the $500 million sat is because you only have one shot at the launch. If you can relaunch soon in the case of failure, then making two for less is a better option. And insurance cost will be dramatically less for two $100mil sats, as the insurance doesn\u0027t actually have to pay out any significant money in case of failure, as you already have your spare and aren\u0027t losing revenue. Insurance will only have significant cost if the first fails and they then have to fund the second - and the second launch is going to be more reliable for little extra cost, as the failed components can be checked and verified more thoroughly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
