Yes, we could have the contract system replaced with something entirely different, but I think the core concept is fine. It\u0027s just the fact that it gets repetitive, because every contract is such a basic construct. \u0022Position satellite in orbit.\u0022 \u0022Rescue Kerbal from orbit/location.\u0022 \u0022Test part.\u0022 \u0022Collect data.\u0022 All of these are fine to do once or twice, but then it turns into a grind and not even a fun one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA relatively simple fix to this would be to link a bunch of these objectives together into a mission. What if instead the contract is to rescue the stranded Kerbal, deliver them to their ship in orbit, get some parts to that ship to fix it, take the ship to a destination, land it there, perform measurements, then bring the kerbal and collected science back. Same basic parts, but now you have a bit of a narrative to keep you invested, and the number of ways this can all be combined is a lot higher. Plus, provided that each step has its own rewards in credits and reputation, by the time you are finished the set, you are set for a while. And even if you have to run multiples of these throughout the game, because of the number of permutations, it can always be at least somewhat fresh. The generator for missions like this can be pretty simple - you really just need to make sure that whatever combo that\u0027s being generated is within constraints of player\u0027s current technical level and that the player is compensated appropriately for every step. And because this style heavily rewards combining resource investment for multiple steps, like carrying an engineer on your rescue ship so that you can perform the repairs without separate launch, if you spend a bit more time solving the problem creatively, you actually get significantly higher payout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-29T17:32:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApropos,\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/1897-timmon26/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u00221897\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/1897-timmon26/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Timmon26\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0did a pretty sick diagram of how colony economics could work and described it \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/205029-resources-sketch/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=4037193\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere:\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022O2SlFKD.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022103.75\u0022 height=\u0022778\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/O2SlFKD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-29T18:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea of that resource diagram, but I think there should be a step between \u0022mining vessels\u0022 and \u0022metal/volatiles/uranium/He3\u0022, because it\u0027s not like you can just make rocket parts out of bauxite.

There are nuclear reactors that can run on raw chemically-separated Uranium (one happened by accident in the Earth\u0027s crust long ago), but most reactors that we use today for power production (and all NTRs) would need a further Enrichment step to turn it into Enriched uranium before it\u0027s really usable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven ice needs \u0022some\u0022 processing before you can directly use it in life support, because who knows what kind of toxic or otherwise problematic chemicals might be in that ice even if it is mostly water ice.

I won\u0027t speak for Timmon but I think he\u0027s right about the overall scale of complexity that could work. I figure by now Intercept has a pretty strong idea what they want to do so its just us theorizing, but in general my feeling is you want colony management to be as simple as it can possibly be and still allow for creative strategies. Most intermediate steps can be abstracted and condensed into the various refineries. To start I agree with him that you\u0027d want at least 3-4 basic mineable resources. If you only have 2 resources from which you produce everything one of two things happens: either they overlap and there are places where you can build a colony and have everything without effort, or they don\u0027t overlap and there\u0027s no place thats particularly better to build than any other. 3-4 creates a more dynamic landscape where there are places where a couple of these resources overlap but you still need to expand and build new outposts and supply lines to go to the next level. In KSP1 there\u0027s just Ore and you have option load it up raw or process it on site. In reality it would almost always make sense to start to process it very close to where it was being harvested to cut down on transport mass. We\u0027ll see what intercept has in mind but I think you could just have drills and pre-processors that work together for each basic resource. After that the question is how many intermediate steps are absolutely necessary. In Timmon\u0027s diagram they go on to further processing in refineries to get different fuels, and workshops and reactors to make parts and energy. You could have an intermediate step with smelters and uranium enrichment facilities--but do you need to? For me realism isn\u0027t enough. Players should only be bothered with intermediate steps if they create a gameplay opportunity like being able to use one resource for two different end-uses or to streamline transportation in supply lines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-29T23:45:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2021 11:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-30T20:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell there\u0027s plenty of uses for something like Depleted Uranium IRL, and not just in weapons. Not just ballast masses either, it\u0027s an important part of nuclear weapons (and therefore Orion drive pulse units). Plus you can still get the stuff to undergo fission, just because it\u0027s fissile doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t split the atom. All you need to do is just shoot a beam of antiprotons at a small sphere of depleted uranium, which will make a small part of it undergo fission, including several FAST neutrons from each atom of U-238 which will induce fission in the rest of the mass of depleted uranium.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen you can direct that whole blast away from a spacecraft using a magnetic field, and since those fission products are sure to be quite highly charged that magnetic field will be VERY effective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat makes for another interesting type of propulsion system, the Antimatter-Catalyzed Fission drive (represented in Nertea\u0027s \u0022Far Future Technologies\u0022 mod, but it uses a different trigger system)\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s basically an Orion drive, but smaller, and at no point do you assemble anything that could be \u0022simply\u0022 taken out of the drive\u0027s systems and repurposed as a weapon, unlike Orion drive pulse units which are by definition devices designed to create a nuclear and in the best case thermonuclear detonation (after all, antimatter is blasted hard stuff to contain, not to mention OBTAIN in the first place, but that\u0027s another advantage of the ACF drive, you don\u0027t need a whole lot of antimatter to get a whole lot of high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E thrust out of it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point I\u0027m trying to make, is that maybe we don\u0027t need steps where one resource is turned into one other resource, but there are LOTS of interesting things we could do where we either take one resource and split it into multiple resources, or take multiple resources and combine them into one or more new resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance, you might have a processor that takes in Deuterium and He3, and spits out fusion engine fuel pellets (Inertial Confinement Fusion fuel, or part of Antimatter-Catalyzed Micro-Fusion drive fuel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I do think that there should be a Mass Driver type engine, which would ideally be able to run off of literally any solid resource as propellant, along with a hefty supply of electricity (not liquids or gases, those would go thru more conventional engines either NTR or Electric type thrusters).\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would be a high-thrust low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E drive system (EDIT: Well, \u0022Low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 compared to your more typical ion engines at least, but for sure it would have higher thrust) best used for moving around asteroids (so if you\u0027re interested in the metal content of an asteroid, you\u0027d run the mass driver off of Regolith and not Metal Ore, but either would be available as propellant should you run out of one or the other).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly you could have it just be FuelOres, MetalOres, and Regolith, and make a pretty good system if you had a bunch of converters.
