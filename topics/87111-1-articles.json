Major throttle issues after .25 update!","CreatedByName":"KevinKnox","CreatedById":125682,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T19:39:49Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"KevinKnox","CreatedById":125682,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T19:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a major noob to KSP and absolutely LOVE this game, however, I am at the end of my patience with it. I had one heck of a \u0022space empire\u0027\u0027 going, and then with no warning the update (.25) deleted all my save files, thanks. And now when i setup my joystick (extreme 3d pro), the throttle will not stay where I put it. As an example, if I set the throttle at 1/4, it drops off to 0, BY ITSELF. Same story in the 3/4 position, only instead of it dropping off it goes up by itself. The only two positions it seems to stay in place, is either half way or full throttle.... I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t Have to explain to any of you guys/gals why this would be such a problem. Also as a side note, the left shift and control keys use to work in unison with the joystick throttle, now the left shift and control don\u0027t work at all.
