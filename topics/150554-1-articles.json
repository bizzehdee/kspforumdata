Also looks of shock from friends as I went from typical office drone to commenting in an arcane fashion on electronic medical records and sharing interesting tales from the operating rooms..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut anyway, I got in the mood for some KSP and Oh My God 1.2 already. When I left it was 1.0.4 and I\u0027m pretty sure I will have to go mod shopping already. Feel free to school a returning newbie on what changed and what magically appeared from the magical forges of Squad - while some things like Z, T and space are the same, it looks like the UI has had a revamp making it look that much more modern.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd clouds.

For starters, a BACC booster core will be propelling a Mk.1 command pod to the edge of space, unmanned, with a Sounding Rockets avionics and science package atop the capsule. I also chopped the engine thrust to half so I could remotely attempt to destroy the vehicle if anything went wrong; or simply just let it fizzle out on the launch pad for lack of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and treat it as a static fire test.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually this is an excuse for setting the BACC thrust so low that it sat on the pad for nearly a minute before taking off so slowly you\u0027d probably ask why the heck is the rocket so fat and lazy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunately, Jeb snuck aboard this unmanned flight and things got VERY sour VERY fast - for I have installed the Gyro Saturation mod and the rocket had NO control as a result! At about 4000m altitude (still going really slow) the BACC started to do an uncommanded gravity turn by itself and ended up trying to fly horizontal, breaking the speed of sound. With no control (not even to cut off the engine, welcome to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E perils) and no aerodynamic lift to speak of, it of course started to plummet back to earth, still accelerating, and would break Mach 2.0 in its lawn-darting adventure had I not the fortitude to trigger stage separation anyway in a last ditch attempt to save the command module and its avionics stack.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSuccess - the capsule thrust away from the runaway booster, aero forces flipped the capsule around \u0022by design\u0022 and it started slowing down........\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd Jeb died anyway because I hit the parachute activation too late. To add insult to injury, the avionics package survived.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFlight 2 - After mourning Jeb\u0027s loss and feeling extremely bad I am playing on hard difficulty and cannot revert to launch pad, I recalled manned space flight on both the US and Russian sides had fatalities before successful manned space missions. Apollo 1, for instance.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI decided Valentina shall be chief kosmonaut and the R-1 manned \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E program should continue. I increased the BACC thrust to 80% and left everything else as is, for with higher acceleration it will streak out into space on a sub-orbital trajectory on its own. I decided from my past KSP experience of many thousands of gameplay hours\u00A0that BACCs were weak and easily manageable - famous last words.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K3zgdPj.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022K3zgdPj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWithout Kerbal Engineer however, I had no idea how much power the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E would actually generate, and how much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E this BACC - Mk.1 pod setup has.
