Basically the game engine would display a cylinder as a single polygon. Rather than draw it as a flat surface, it would draw it as a circle with texturing being draped along from one end to the other. If the engine could be made to do this and cylindrical rocket components could be redesigned for this, it could lower their polygon count tremendously without impacting their quality of appearance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T14:47:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah . . . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) That\u0027s not how graphics engines work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Unlike other games, what makes KSP lag isn\u0027t the graphics, it\u0027s the physics calculations.

Some *really* high end cards have them but requiring that would kill KSP\u0027s sell-ability. Most graphics cards simply do large numbers of simple flat triangles and that\u0027s it. So to implement a cylindrical surface rendering you\u0027d have to do it in software and not hardware which would be slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd besides the polygons aren\u0027t what people are talking about when they say \u0022part count\u0022.
