You can still read the line, but you can\u0027t see the click report\u00A0button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am using 1280X70 and am playing the beta version. It has been like it since I played, but viewing a recent you tube video, I saw you have a large area on the right which is blank, so I wondered why on mine it is so close. All the other screens seem ok and the actual flight, build screens all seem ok.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeith\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverwood","CreatedById":177391,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-05T17:11:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink this is to do with screen resolution, if\u00A0 change to a higher setting you can see the buttons; Strange it only applies to the archive screen though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeith\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverwood","CreatedById":177391,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-08T17:33:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust in case anyone else has this....you reduce the UI setting and then you can see all the screens, not just R\u0026amp;D, the pool table in the crew quarters and the car in the admin block!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
