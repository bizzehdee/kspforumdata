On the one hand I totally get players\u0027 desire to role play and give Kerbals more meaning, but having played a few long saves with 50-100 kerbals the leveling and specialization and shuffling crews around gets old real quick. Its fine when you\u0027ve got a dozen total Kerbals to worry about but after the 20th and 30th time its just not fun. And in theory for KSP2 we might have a few hundred colonists spread around and running various research missions and mining rigs and freighters.

Kerbals would get exp through doing colony stuff, and get a lot of exp through doing mission stuff. So a scientist can get exp by being assigned to a nuclear reactor, and they get a lot of exp by going on a trip around eeloo with lots of science modules. With a decently done search filter and autofill, you can just check if a kerbal has the specific skill you want before you bring them on your mission, however you will not need to care whatsoever if you dont want to.
