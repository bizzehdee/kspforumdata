How are the early rockets able to rotate and maneuver without any propulsion system. I understand the Gimbal controls movement in the atmosphere but its irrellevant once you cut the engine. So how is a rocket able to rotate before you get RCS?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T20:34:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 08:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by leocrumb**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T18:51:01Z","Content":"Almost every pod contains a [reaction wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_wheel), which allows attitude adjustments without using RCS or gimbaling, though they do consume electricity."},{"CreatedByName":"WeirdCulture","CreatedById":76591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T18:51:16Z","Content":"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_wheel)\n\nohh ok.. somebody came first.. so now i have some video ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) (for more information)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_6p-1J551Y?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T18:55:48Z","Content":"The short answer is internal gyroscopes and the principle of precession; [reaction wheels are very much real things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_wheel).\n\nEDIT: Damn - double ninja\u0027d."},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T18:56:22Z","Content":"I actually NEVER use RCS for jack unless im specifically intending to dock something. For ultra-lights you can get away with docking using very careful piloting and turning around to face port last second, but for lager vessels (over 5t) you need RCS to dock.\n\nAside from that, i dont touch RCS as its heavier then the wheels, and actually uses fuel too.

You will be able to see that the command pod does indeed have reaction wheels integrated. On the other hand, if you were to examine the Stayputnik probe core, you would find that it does not have reaction wheels. A rocket equipped with a Stayputnik will not be able to steer itself without additional parts addded (dedicated reaction wheels, RCS, gimbaling engines, steering fins for atmospheric flight).\n\nThis right-clicking for additional info works on all parts in the game and is very useful for finding out what each part does. Especially if the full function is not immediately apparent from the intentionally silly naming.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T07:37:47Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"}]}
