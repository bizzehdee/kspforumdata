It does seem to be a lot of parts to support this element, we\u0027ll have more antennas than we have rover wheels, or landing legs, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I\u0027ve noticed about Squad implementing features that were previously done by mods: The heavy users of those mods are never satisfied. New stock aero didn\u0027t satisfy most FAR enthusiasts. Stock ISRU didn\u0027t seem to satisfy the Kethane/Karbonite/ScanSAT crowd. Better stock spaceplane parts didn\u0027t satisfy the B9 people. I expect I\u0027ll be one of these people when/if a stock delta-V meter is implemented, it will likely be simpler than KER (or alternatives) so I\u0027ll stick to the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, these implemented features make a good core for those who don\u0027t use mods and make those aspects of the game better for a majority of players (I don\u0027t think any single mod is used by the majority of the playerbase, I\u0027d be surprised if the majority uses mods at all). Players can then pick and choose where the stock game doesn\u0027t satisfy them and use mods to enhance those aspects. Best of all, the new features added lately seem to be made with ease of moddability in mind, so they should make it easier to have mods that are robust and fully featured without reinventing the wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T22:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t say much, because I haven\u0027t tried it yet.
