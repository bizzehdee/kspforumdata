I don\u0027t really like not being able to switch to the probe at all, but maybe you could just lose control of all SAS systems only after switching away. Restricting maneuver nodes while disconnected might also be interesting, or it might just be tedious...\n\nI also like my own idea (![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)) of giving advanced probes increasing amounts of autonomy. I think it goes along well with most of the stock career mechanisms where gameplay restrictions are gradually relaxed as you progress.\n\nMost importantly, I think, is that there needs to be a very clear indication of connection status, both in-flight and in the map view. There also needs to be clear method for telling players what the loss of connection means (ie greyed out SAS indicator, some simple message about science transmission, etc...).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T18:00:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 06:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic**"},{"CreatedByName":"idPhobos","CreatedById":138298,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T18:05:45Z","Content":"I think now attention is swung that way maybe they\u0027ll get round to fixing the descriptions on the current antennas. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T18:18:24Z","Content":"Honestly, i\u0027m frustrated.\n\nRemotetech is a great mod and it seems the concepts parts etc, are part and parcel out of that mod. \n\nHowever, to keep the SQUADLINESS, the end-game of the feature has been nerfed.\n\na. no flight computer. This is because the signal delay has been nerfed right out. So we have realism in that solar panels get weaker as the light travels the system, but our communications are superior to light in every way and don\u0027t suffer at all.\n\nThat NEEDS to be a configurable option, because the additional complexity of the design considerations are the only reason why a person would use a communcation system to begin with. As it stands, it\u0027s a slightly more convoluted version of the instant communications we have now, requiring several more parts, and (i\u0027d imagine) several more lines of code.\n\nTo make matters worse, because it has been nerfed from the gate, it will still necessitate running remotetech anyway for many players. \n\nSo this \u0022feature\u0022 falls directly in the SAME category as life support - it shouldn\u0027t have been done, because there\u0027s already a mod for each flavor.\n\nIf you\u0027re going to add a feature, add a complete feature which would satisfy the people who use that modded feature to begin with.\n\nbut i guess if completed features were on the menu we\u0027d be expecting planetary bodies and bug fixes!\n\nThose are my thoughts - you asked!"},{"CreatedByName":"ouion","CreatedById":38531,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T18:31:59Z","Content":"IRL, some probes have artificial intelligence which decide on its own in a situation where broadcast is delayed or nonexistent.

But this so called \u0022easy way\u0022 is a double edge sword, specially in this case, where ppl either want something similar to antenna range or remote tech. A mod is a mod, a game feature is a game feature. Not entirely the same. The community will be split.\n\nThere is no middle ground here.. making a mix between antenna range \u0026 RT is not going to magically make everyone happy.

I certainly hope you guys enjoy it.\n\nAll that said, I do like the new models, they are very nice and I hope they can be used to replace or add to some of the RemoteTech dishes that are a little more \u0027blah\u0027. One of them looks backward though, the point of a dish is to reflect the signal but the second largest one in the image looks like the receiver is pointed out into space.

It does seem to be a lot of parts to support this element, we\u0027ll have more antennas than we have rover wheels, or landing legs, for example.\n\nOne thing I\u0027ve noticed about Squad implementing features that were previously done by mods: The heavy users of those mods are never satisfied. New stock aero didn\u0027t satisfy most FAR enthusiasts. Stock ISRU didn\u0027t seem to satisfy the Kethane/Karbonite/ScanSAT crowd. Better stock spaceplane parts didn\u0027t satisfy the B9 people. I expect I\u0027ll be one of these people when/if a stock delta-V meter is implemented, it will likely be simpler than KER (or alternatives) so I\u0027ll stick to the mod.\n\nThe thing is, these implemented features make a good core for those who don\u0027t use mods and make those aspects of the game better for a majority of players (I don\u0027t think any single mod is used by the majority of the playerbase, I\u0027d be surprised if the majority uses mods at all). Players can then pick and choose where the stock game doesn\u0027t satisfy them and use mods to enhance those aspects.
