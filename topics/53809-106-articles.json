The first launch also seem to use more memory when you scale smaller. With a 1Gb Gamedata I had 200Mb of difference spread between scale 1 to 8. But I assume it is the scaling process itself since seconds loading are then using less memory as scale goes down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed something also, with the previous versions I stopped using the \u0022texture res\u0022 options in the game to use atm scaling options instead, so I am not sure if it was already behaving like that before ( and I don\u0027t have the courage of moving any plugins files around anymore ) . Messing with the in game options was working over it but pointless. Now, I\u0027ve tried changing it, whit atm scale set to 2, and it\u0027s only affecting the terrain texture ... Maybe I\u0027m just really tired and it was always like that, but I feel like maybe ATM is keeping ksp from changing the res of certain texture, and in this case it would be the good ones. So with atm scale at 2 and FullRes ingame I have about 2gb of memory, If I lower it to eight res I have 1600mb of memory usage, but my ship,interior,kerbals,props stayed the same. The terrain are 1/16th though. So either it\u0027s new or I just discovered it, I\u0027m really happy ! Either an average ship in an average land or a nice shiny ship on a blurry planet for the same memory ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI removed dds loader since I don\u0027t really know anymore how to figure which files ATM is not managing. In fact I never knew it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs ATM giving a log of what he is doing, maybe I could extract a file list from such log and then use it as an exceptions list for a dds converter ? Or is someone witty enough to write a script that would do it from the log ? Anyways, wrong thread \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 for release, and throw the cloud in the compression = false zone ? ( about that, is there a patch for toolbar buttons cfg so they don\u0027t scale down? I wrote my own for mj,el,vv etc, but just in case )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agost","CreatedById":126710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T21:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, is this release official or still in beta?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T21:53:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile waiting for the first load... does this massively reduce the memory footprint from previous versions of ATM?
