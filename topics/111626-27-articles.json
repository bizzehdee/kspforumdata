I liked the look of your mothership but thought it was funny that it was much more aerodynamic than your lift rocket!  Good use of your Tylo lander\u0027s top stage to do the small moons.\n\n[@littlebuddy0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/147886-littlebuddy0/) Congratulations, you have completed the Jool 5 Challenge on Level 3!  Your landers were great, small and especially your Laythe lander looked like a Starfox ship.  Your long wobbly mothership and video antics were entertaining to watch.  As a small tip, if you click the green arrow in a fuel tank\u0027s right click menu, it locks the tank so fuel doesn\u0027t drain out.  Might save you some time in the future!\n\n[@Mesklin](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73898-mesklin/) Congratulations, you have completed the Low Mass Level 1 Challenge!  Ever so briefly holding the record at 10.775 tons!  With the now iconic low-mass design and a very interesting heat minimization technique on liftoff.  I\u0027m glad the idea of a LFO Vall lander worked.\n\n[@Nefrums](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145422-nefrums/) Congratulations, you have completed the Low Mass Level 1 Challenge!  Breaking the 10 ton barrier and a whopping 4 tons lighter than your previous best, at 8.600 tons you are the new record holder!  And the undisputed master of gravity assists.  Everything was not only low mass but low volume, which no doubt helped with drag and fairing mass.\n\nIf the Jool 5 Challenge could give out honorary PhD\u0027s, you\u0027ve both earned it.  Barring a rule change about pods (not going to happen) or a major Kerbal breakthrough in quantum mechanics (probably even less likely), I doubt we\u0027ll see more than a few tenths of a ton better.  Can the Laythe lander be just Rapier\u002Bjetpack?\n\nI have also added the two mods to the list that I had previously approved, and put a note at the top saying you may still do the challenge in 1.0.5.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-24T22:50:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2016 10:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by sdj64**"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T23:00:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, DaMachinator said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Requesting permission to use USI Survivabilty (airbags, inflatable floats, escape pod system)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I assume Lithobrake Exploration Technologies is allowed, it being previously approved.\n\u003E \n\nUSI Survivability is not allowed, on the basis of its extremely lightweight pod and very high temperature tolerances for many parts."},{"CreatedByName":"Barefoot Friar","CreatedById":77638,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T23:29:42Z","Content":"Just to keep myself accountable and to inform any interested parties:  \n\nI got to Tylo after using way, way too much fuel in my Jool insertion burn, disconnected my lander and the tug from the mothership, got it into the orbit I wanted, and then realized that the lander has no control authority because it lacks both RCS and a reaction wheel.
