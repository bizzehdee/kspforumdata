Meaning the Space age already started. And I\u0027d like to see images of the construction of the polder. The whole transition from sea, to a couple of dykes, to the island we have now. \n\nA few months ago I found a image repository of space to ground images made during the Gemini missions, these where amazingly sharp but I did not found any images of the Netherlands (I didn\u0027t really looked for that then though...).\n\nCan anyone here help me?\n\n(Note to mods : not sure about the board I should use, Science lab V.S.
