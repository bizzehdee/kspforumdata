Were any of the parts clipped when you did your original \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E build? Were any parts wobbly in flight?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStruts or autostruts can sometimes help reduce wobbling parts. If used incorrectly, though, they can sometime trigger new twisting of parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbal Joint Reinforcement mod can be used instead of struts. It strengthens the connections between parts so they bend less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose suggestions make it less likely to occur, but I don\u0027t know of any way to untwist a a mangled ship. If you catch it early and have a recent save you can reload. Otherwise launch a replacement ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022176740\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1776532182\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/184206-kerbal-joint-reinforcement-next/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:212px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-27T10:28:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had warped craft appear when autostruts were on and then the craft was docked to something else.
