I cannot figure out how to get science with the starting parts though? I have launched and landed a rocket on land next to the launch pad, and tried transmitting data back and then going back to the space center. I have tried going into space and then back down and transmitting data while in space(though not enough fuel to do a orbit), and then again when I landed. Neither way has given me any science points to use in the research center? What am I missing here? I tried looking at the wiki the but wiki site is down right now(showing a to many connections error).

I kept sending flights out and figured out how to transmit data via the antennae by right clicking the actual capsule instead of the antennae after the post, by landing on Kerbal and transmitting the crew reports. There needs to be a pop-up or something definitely to make that obvious as I fiddled around the last few hours launching multiple ships till I finally figured out the antennae, and did not realize I could just recover my ship by hovering the mouse over the altimeter up top(the mouse is not needed much in flight nor do I have any reason to go up there with the mouse). Thanks also for letting me know about going to the tracking center to recover, as I was able to go there and retrieve all of those flights. I still only ended up with 10 science from all of those sadly, so I wasted a lot of time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso thanks SRV Ron for the tips I will use them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-18T03:05:13Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2013 03:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MaGicBush\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T11:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBetter yet, don\u0027t even include antennas on your manned pods until you have unlocked solar panels.
