If you were off by less than 10 degrees, then it\u0027s not too bad. Try to see which direction you\u0027re off by, and retry the launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne piece of general advice I can give is this: when you burn, you can change your orbit at every point except at your current location. This means that if you start your burn nowhere close to your target orbit, then you\u0027ll end up nowhere close to your target orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T22:56:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the polar ornit, I presume you wait until it\u0027s right on top of you, then launch?

This helps you practice towards timing launches so that you save a lot of time and potentially fuel. This is especially useful when having time constraints such as life support systems running out etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo practice this, put a very basic station into a nice circular orbit, and see if you can launch and dock with it less than half an orbit after leaving the pad. This ofcourse depends a lot on your craft, but I find that launching just before the target rises over the horizont isn\u0027t too far off. When launching into a polar orbit, the craft specs also matter a lot, because one of the early maneuvers involves stopping the eastwards momentum you have from the planets rotation. This means that your TWR plays a big part of the timing, which leads to the following conclusions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Learn your craft! Build a craft that you can fly a lot so that you get good at eyeballing maneuvers by knowing how fast it can accelerate under certain conditions. In addition, learn its optimal launch profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Get good at timing launches\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith those two skills under your belt you will find that you will no longer have to spend time in interplanetary space, waiting for planets to line up for a holman transfer. Instead of orbiting to sync, you just launch to transfer. That being said, transfer windows is probably something you should look into. I find Kerbal Alarm Clock to be really useful for this. Even if I don\u0027t have any flights I need to keep track of, I still use it for keeping track of launch windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MadChris48","CreatedById":112853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T12:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emaneuver nodes are your friend. place one and play with it. you can pull a marker a bit and the click the node and drag it along your orbit to see how it will change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my pro-tip for nailing orbits around other bodies; Use a node to get a rough intercept with a body (say Mun), click on the body you are targeting and click Focus View. You should see your projected path in the SOI. Pan the camera around until you can see your node off in the distance, select it, and then fine turn your insertion orbit. About as surgical as it gets.
