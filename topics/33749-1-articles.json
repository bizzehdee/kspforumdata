Since many satellites are spin-stabilized the antenna gain must be increased by being either mechanically or electronically \u0027despun\u0027 (by rotating the antenna in the opposite direction of the satellite\u0027s spin in the case of of the first, or by phasing through a number of fixed radially mounted antennas in the case of the second). As you can imagine there are drawbacks to each of these approaches, such as mechanical reliability and accumulation of angular momentum through bearing friction in the case of mechanical despin and transmission discontinuities in the case of the electronic \u0027despin\u0027. Either way the antenna\u0027s effective orientation will remain fixed with respect to Earth:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T12:23:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo if it was rotating, it would only have a brief moment when it was facing the right direction to send the signal back.
