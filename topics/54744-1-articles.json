I have made a rover that can achieve 60m/s under its own wheelpower, but I add downforce for improved cornering. Problem is, if it\u0027s too far forward, the car is too touchy, and if it\u0027s too far back, it stays straight as an arrow and is horrific in the corners.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the CoL meant to be in the same spot as the CoM, sort of like for planes? Or is it based on where the wheels are positioned? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(before anyone asks, Kerbin-only rover. 60m/s on Mun would be absurd.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance, everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKyrian\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-30T00:23:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2013 12:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kyrian\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T00:35:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E60m/s under it\u0027s own wheel power is impressive, before you try anything though, be sure you are using Linear Docking controls and have SAS on.

You want to have the sum force of mass and downforce to act somewhere in the middle between two wheel axis. But the actual placement depends heavily the actual design, i would start by placing the lift center at the middle between two wheel axis and work from there to get more or less responsive steering at speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat also can influence responsiveness is speed sensitive steering that is set in part.cfg of wheels themselves. IDK if pizzas mod modify it to suit greater speeds that the wheels achieve thou.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: after a quick dab into Pizza\u0027s mod and a moment of though later:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like for basic racecar designs having center of lift roughly in the middle is good. And if you go for the RWD design like real F1 cars have, having center of mass at the back is also good for traction (acceleration).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if you wand to add some stability for high speed, you could add some negative Toe-in on front wheels. Adding some Camber can reduce the steering effect, and also from my limited testing adding Caster can also help somewheat (it also helps lowering CoM).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-30T05:51:36Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2013 05:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nao\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NQMT","CreatedById":79402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T06:10:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s really helpful, I\u0027ll consider all of that next time I\u0027m on.
