It would be like the already available \u0022Chatterer\u0022 mod- but I\u0027d prefer if it was coherent and human English. I\u0027d like it if the player would be able to select an audio loop (for example: Apollo 11 pre-launch\u002Bpostlaunch commentary/Apollo 11 random operations chatter (randomly asking for random systems operations and maintenance during no specific portion of the mission)/Apollo 11 landing commentary (same for STS-1,2,3 etc/Mercury Freedom, Liberty Belle, Friendship etc).\n\nMaybe this already exists but if it does please drop a link! If not- anyone else like this idea?"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T02:56:48Z","Content":"Somewhat interestingly, Chatterer already uses some audio from (amongst other sources) Apollo 11 voice recordings.
