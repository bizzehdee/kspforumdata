I\u0027d like it if the player would be able to select an audio loop (for example: Apollo 11 pre-launch\u002Bpostlaunch commentary/Apollo 11 random operations chatter (randomly asking for random systems operations and maintenance during no specific portion of the mission)/Apollo 11 landing commentary (same for STS-1,2,3 etc/Mercury Freedom, Liberty Belle, Friendship etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this already exists but if it does please drop a link!
