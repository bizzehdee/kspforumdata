I wont write down every little step, but rather focuss on the things that I believe are noteworthy. The career is played in a \u0022no revert-\u0022 mode. Meaning if something goes wrong, I\u0027ll have to deal with it. Quicksaving/loading during flight wont be allowed except for bugs/game crashes etc. But since I play with the Kerbal Construction Time mod, it will be possible to run (payed) simulations. Cheating through the alt-F12 menu will only be allowed in a fair way (shortcomings of the game itself etc.). Part-clipping is allowed however.\n\nAside from that, the difficulty settings are all on normal.\n\nA rough overview of the mods in use (might add/delete some later on):\n\n![FVMBpnE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FVMBpnE.jpg)\n\nThe first unmanned launch with a cheap \u0022sounding rocket\u0022 went just a few thousand meters up:\n\n![Rcx4biO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Rcx4biO.jpg)\n\nWith the science gains from the first rocket launch, the next bigger rocket was designed, which made it into the upper atmosphere:\n\n![OdnHTuN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OdnHTuN.jpg)\n\nThe third one already peaked into space, propelled by a BACC \u0022Thumper\u0022 SRB:\n\n![3DkFgFL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3DkFgFL.jpg)\n\nAfter these first few babysteps, the VAB is upgraded to level 2.\n\n![jsLUYxY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jsLUYxY.jpg)\n\nAnd the research progress looks as follows.

It is featuring an even longer cargohold and improved flight characteristics. Here it is taking off on a test-flight...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![7wdnYni.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7wdnYni.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E The KSA tried to adapt the plane into a role of a commoditie-hauler for the KSS, while the craft was originally ment to be a lifter for bulky payloads. So it brought a load of liquid fuel to the station.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![X7c3tLj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/X7c3tLj.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E The plane was never ment to dock itself to anything, and it sure wasnt easy to link up two such huge objects with 1.25m docking ports. Even worse: after contact was made and the fuel transfer was underway, the connection became unstable and even just tiny motions of either object resulted in enormous forces pulling on the docking ports and pylons. Seeing the majestic ***KSS Alpha*** with its current crew of four Kerbals as well as a 1.5 million-spaceplane on the brink of beeing ripped apart, the KSA aborted the test at once. The ***Skydragon*** undocked and pulled back immediately. The stations SAS was able to stabilize the movement before any real damage was caused. But it became clear that this plane would never become a resupply hauler for the LKO spaceport.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![fUjCHfG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fUjCHfG.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Nonetheless, a reliable SSTO had to be developed in order to routinely bring commodities to the orbital station. The old ***Phoenix*** simply had a to to high part-count to operate arround the KSS. So the ***Mammoth*** was created. It is a very sturdy design, compared to the ***Skydragon***. Within its 5 meter wide tanks it can transport at least 120 tons of goods.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![VbfJsZZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/VbfJsZZ.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Its main feature however, is the 3.75 meters wide docking port at its backend, slightly sticking out between the two engines.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Rm4d5yg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Rm4d5yg.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E With this tool, and combined with its compact design, the ***Mammoth*** can easily dock at the stations largest docking ports and the connection remains safe.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![9FIl5ur.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9FIl5ur.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Now the KSA began to figure out an inexpensive way to aquire fuel in space. It turned to Minmus, which would allow easy lifting of large quantities due to its low gravity. And so an orbital survey scanner was sent to the small moon, which mapped the resource hotspots from high above.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![QXpvM1w.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QXpvM1w.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E It was soon followed by an automated scanner lander...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![nRZHqSE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nRZHqSE.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ...which found the exact location for upcoming mining operations.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![VeMtLIb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/VeMtLIb.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E While the development department began to design and simulate various types of harvesters and refineries, mission control finally catched a launch window to send the ***Mariner 10*** probe to do its fly-by mission of Eve...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![uqRA5FE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uqRA5FE.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ...and Moho, visiting the latter for the first time ever and completing the historic mission-contract.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Sqd953Y.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Sqd953Y.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Continuing with its Minmus-project, the KSA launched a Griffon Century based lifter...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![WNacnI1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WNacnI1.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E It brought a set of mobile refinery rovers into space.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![w6bid1u.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/w6bid1u.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Once in orbit, the pair was seperated with one staying as backup just in case.

Click the spoiler below the picture to see more.\n\n![IdIBY98.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IdIBY98.jpg)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The upcoming Duna project means a massive effort for the growing Kerbal Space Agency. The goal is to send a colony module, that can keep three Kerbals alive, to Kerbins outer neighbor-planet. Once it has been landed, a team of Kerbals will travel to Duna with the next transfer-window and remain there for at least one year. Then it will travel back, leaving the colony-module on the surface and a 2nd crew will come from Kerbin to live on Duna for another year.\n\u003E \n\u003E Here is an overview of the vessels that will be used:\n\u003E \n\u003E The backbone of the project will be the ***Duna Habitation Rover*** with a total mass of nearly 44 tons. It is based on the mining rovers that were developed for Minmus earlier. However, since there will be plenty of time for refueling the landed ships, its drilling capacity is much lower. Instead it has more living space for a bigger crew, better life support systems and a wheel-system more suited for Dunas surface. The main power-source is a nuclear reactor, just like on the mining rovers, positioned just behind the crew quarters to save on heating costs. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![M272All.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/M272All.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E The KSA finished developing and testing of the ***Skydragon*** heavy cargo-SSTO. It will be used to haul the ***Habitation Rover*** into a low Kerbin orbit.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![cHO7e1Z.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cHO7e1Z.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Once the rover is in space, a carrier (some might call it a tug) will come to pick it up. Since this carrier-system is heavy and awkward enough to launch by itself, it wont be burdened with its payload during take off (lifter-stage not included in the pic below).\n\u003E \n\u003E ![s8DpQzF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/s8DpQzF.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E After the above setup has deployed the ***Habitation Rover*** to the surface of Duna, the first exploration crew will launch from Kerbin. They will take off with the largest \u0022regular\u0022 single-lane-rocket constructed thus far by the KSA. The three Kerbals and their gear that you can see within the fairings in the pic below (from top to bottom: lander, command- and return vehicle, travel-stage) will be riding a 180-ton lifter that was thus far only used for the unmanned ***Andromeda*** tanker class.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Ppe5hSX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Ppe5hSX.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Approximately one year later (depending on transfer windows), the 2nd crew will launch. Since by then a functional and re-useable lander should be in place at Duna, they will only carry a little extra-fuel in their travel stage and thus can use a slightly smaller lifter system (payload weight about 130 tons). Picture below: in the fairings the command- and return-vessel and the travel- and fueler stage below.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![O6wp52k.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/O6wp52k.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Since this project deemed to be somewhat complex and Kerbal-lives were at risk, after a few launch simulations, a more or less complete test-run on the Mun was set up to learn the procedures and get a chance to iron out any design-flaws.

But it beeing tied to the carrier would make things difficult at best, too, since the Rover had to refuel the lander vessel in order to get the Kerbalnauts back to their command module later on. So Jeb pulled out the remote device and gently lifted the carrier up.

Jeb: \u0022Yeah, those ports were moved out of the way to make room to mount the vehicle inside the SSTO lifter. You are an engineer. Take your screwdriver and reposition those ports.\u0022 Gerke: \u0022Uh... Screwdriver... nobody told me to bring my own.\u0022 Bob: \u0022D\u0027oh!\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E So the three Kerbalnauts sat down inside the Habitation Rover to consider their options. Bob said mission control could certainly send a package with a screwdriver within a short time. But Jeb was against that, since such an option wouldn\u0027t be available on Duna either and calling for help was not his style anyway. Gerke mentioned that this lander was designed for Duna,... it still had plenty of fuel for a Mun orbit left. They wouldnt need to use the mining equipment to get home again. But Jeb shaked his head again. The mission requirements precisely listed a full test of all key elements of the upcoming Duna operation.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![gMAaEP0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gMAaEP0.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Eventually they came up with a plan. The carrier also had connector ports for refueling, since this vessel was planned to be re-useable. So it might be possible to position the Rover on one side and link it up and connect the lander on the other side of the carrier. Then pump fuel through the tug into the landers tanks. However, it would require very precise maneuvering with the lander right next to the carrier-ship...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![cpH7Gtx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cpH7Gtx.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E (to be continued...)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T15:24:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 03:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TrooperCooper**"},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperCooper","CreatedById":110599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T20:05:50Z","Content":"The KSA is finishing its equipment tests on the Mun and prepares to start manned missions into interplanetary space soon.
