And since it only has a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E, it\u0027s basically uncontrollable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second problem I encountered was, whenever the rocket lands nose up, and I do get a chance to launch it, it explodes when the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E is empty and the speed drops below 347 m/s. So I can\u0027t even land the space craft whenever I do get to launch it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did try to create a new save game, but it has the same problems as my first save. Does anyone know what I can do about this? I would look in the game files, but I\u0027m not too experienced with KSP, so that all looks like gibberish to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
