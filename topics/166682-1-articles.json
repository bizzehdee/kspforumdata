I was trying to land at the Neil Armstrong memorial on the Mun. Starting from a 25km circular orbit, I opened up MechJeb, picked \u0027Enter Target Coordinates,\u0027 and input 0 Deg 42\u0027 6\u0022 N, 22 Deg 44\u0027 45\u0022 E. It did a Low Orbit Plane Change burn to bring the orbit in line with the target, which was perfect. The Deorbit burn seemed to be successful, but the Braking burn was sputtering and jittery, and the final landing site was 130 km east of the target coordinates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else had any issues like this, or might know how to fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MoarBoostersRUS","CreatedById":181916,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-20T00:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYea it doesn\u0027t work worth a damn for anyone sorry.
