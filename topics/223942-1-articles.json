I spent a couple hours trying various versions / uninstalling them.\u00A0 I cannot get any of them to work, this is probable due to a lack of my technical proficiency.\u00A0 So this is the only PM mod i can use aside from Head lamp .\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would like to plead for you to eventually bring this up onto the current patch manager version. I understand your very limited time and can understand if you want to wait great intervals between updating the dependency aspect...\u00A0 but there are some other kick ass\u00A0 mods (some QOL) I would greatly appreciate the use of. I will not harp on this subject or try to take a side, simply asking that you put this somewhere on the todo list.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain... i wanna thank you for taking the time to make this mod.
