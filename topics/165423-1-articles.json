Fuel dispersal was indeed a serious issue in the first few iterations, but was ultimately overcome by simply extending the nose a bit. No part of the wings deviate from the longitudinal plane, but the dihedral wing (is it still called dihedral if the slope angles down? Inverse dihedral?) facilitates the need of those forward canards to keep the nose level on takeoff. The only mod used in its making was Kerbal Engineer Redux, so I\u0027m not sure what CorrectCoL\u0027s beef is with the pitch... The only issue I\u0027ve had there stems from poor piloting.
