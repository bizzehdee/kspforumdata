Basically I was researching fuel cells for an idea I had for a car engine (car engine was a bust) but I did find out that a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) can reach 1000C which I also found out is the operating temperature of a pebble bed reactor. Pebble beds are also a form of reactor that can be used in an NTR and is a form of Very High Temperature Reactor as it can reach 1000C also. This heat should make the SOFC a suitable energy source for a thermal rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I calculated a lot of the specs but the problem I had was with the actual dimensional design of the engine. I am not familiar with the mathematics enough as I am currently in Algebra II I tried NASA sources such as the GRC site and even tryied contacting NASA engineers themselves but I tried to get a simulator when really I should have tried an engineer. I also tried multiple rocket companies such as Aerojet Rocketdyne and SpaceX. I can give you my calculations if you want to see, just pm me but I don\u0027t really want to put up a download. Also please don\u0027t steal my idea if it works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T23:15:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edbmorpher,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I promise I won\u0027t steal your idea!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The problem here is that rockets don\u0027t work by generating heat.

The fuel cell heats the Hydrogen not absorbed and also the Water byproduct which expands i the nozzle to produce thrust. Also the fuel cell produces electrical energy which powers ship systems. The turbopump could also be shutoff and the nozzle plugged to simply use the fuel cel to provide power and water for crew needs.

It\u0027s an interesting idea, and almost had me going for a moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, lets look at why NTR has such great I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E. After all, any conventional rocket will have hotter temperatures in its combustion chamber. The trick is using H2 as propellant. It\u0027s a very light molecule. Your next best alternative is LH2/LOX bipropellant rocket. The exhaust is H2O, which is 9 times heavier. So you need 9 times more energy to get same I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E. Everything else being the same, that\u0027s 9 times higher temperatures. And, in reality, the difference is closer to 4-5 times. Hence almost double the I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E of a typical NTR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the kicker, though. NTR gets energy from nuclear fuel. You propose using chemical fuel. Fuel cell, in fact. Again, your best bet there is LH2/LOX to power your fuel cell. To get H2 to typical NTR temperatures, you can probably go 5:1. That is, for each H2O you produce in fuel cell, you\u0027ll accelerate 5 H2 molecules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for the moment, lets forget the efficiency. We\u0027ll pretend that everything is 100% efficient. For simplicity, lets say that H2O molecule gives you 45 units of energy. Mass of each H2 is 2 units, and each H2O is 18 units. Split between 5 H2 molecules, each gets 9 units of energy, and therefore, exits with 3 units of velocity. v\u003Csub\u003EH2\u003C/sub\u003E = 3. In contrast, we could have just burned H2O in a rocket, get 45 units of energy to push H2O molecule, and get v\u003Csub\u003EH2O\u003C/sub\u003E = sqrt(5) = 2.24. So at a first glance, the exhaust velocity of H2 is better, so we expect better I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E. But we did burn some LH2/LOX to get that. So we have to work out the total impulse and divide it by total mass of fuel/propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case of conventional rocket, everything is easy. It took 18 units of fuel to get 18 units of fuel moving at 2.24 units of velocity. That means I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E is 2.24 units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case of thermal rocket, things are more complicated. We\u0027ve used 18 units of LH2/LOX \u002B 10 units of H2 propellant. But we only got 10 units of H2 moving at 3 units of velocity. So the total I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E = 30 / 28 = 1.07.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, you get much better I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E from a conventional rocket than you get from a fuel cell thermal rocket even at 100% efficiency for both. In reality, of course, fuel cell will have additional losses, making it even less efficient. The reason this works out differently for an NTR is because every single uranium atom that has decayed and become a dead weight gives you energy to get millions of H2 molecules up to speed. So the I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E works out to be just the exhaust velocity, and that makes NTR more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a rule of thumb, if you are building a chemical rocket, you want to use all of the products of combustion moving. And the best way to do this is a conventional rocket. When you find an alternative power source, that\u0027s when you start looking at other options. Ion drive, NTR, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T00:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edbmorpher,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Unless you are planning on building it yourself, you don\u0027t really need to know the ins and outs of rocket construction.

I know the fuel cell will not be entirely efficient but I believe the inefficiency is what drives the engine. You see the fuel cell, being cylindrical will never touch some H2. Supposing I make the cell conic it would absorb more but I don\u0027t want it to absorb all of it. Supposing there is a splitter from the H2 tank, some of the propellant stays propellant but a small part goes to the fuel cell. The propellant and the fuel can be blocked by quartz in the Combustion* Chamber so they don\u0027t mix but the heat is transferred because of quartz\u0027 thermal transparency.
