Aside from the fact that Kethane and other resource mods seem to have found a way to make it fun and interesing, I wonder given this why biome science is still in the game. Trolling for biomes in orbit has to be one of the most boring, tedious parts of the game at present. In the AMA MaxMaps talked about fleshing out the current planets (making them as good as Kerbin) before adding new ones; I groaned thinking that this must mean biome addition. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that biomes give you an incentive to visit multiple locations on and around a planet or moon. And prior to 0.24, they provided a necessary science boost at the beginning of career mode. (Now, you barely need to do science at all since you can get it from contracts.) But it seems like these objectives could be met with a more fun and interesting system, like having actual interesting geographical locations to visit and study: interesting looking rock formations, caves, canyons, canals etc. And rather than having general science objectives (orbit over every biome and do an EVA report) you could have specific objectives like: \u0022Visit this extinct volcano and use the seismic accelerator to take readings.\u0022 Or \u0022Get an EVA report from inside this Munar cave.\u0022 Sort of like a contract system for science rather than just adding science points for completing every contract.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobnova","CreatedById":75385,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T15:03:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like having specific locations, I found a biome entirely by accident on Mun (double-crater), I was psyched!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see more specific locations given science/things to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T15:07:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think biomes need to go away, I just think there needs to be less emphasis on them and more requirement to go somewhere other than the Mun and Minmus.
