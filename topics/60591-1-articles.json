Many of the lowercase letters are ugly, not very readable, and particularly \u0022v\u0022 letter looks completely like an \u0022u\u0022. Yes I know \u0022u\u0022 looks different, but it looks like a \u0022different u\u0022, it does not make \u0022v\u0022 any more readable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am rather sure there are other, better readable raster fonts which could be used for the same purpose. I was designing raster fonts back in the era of 8-bit computers and while I admit that designing raster font for 4-pixel width (5-pixel including the space) is challenging particularly because of the \u0022v\u0022 problem, there are ways how to make it readable. And by adding just one pixel to the width all problems are solved, you can have font which is readable and beautiful, at least compared to the font in use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow why I am talking about it? Because I always wondered why people are naming their ship versions \u0022Mk1\u0022, \u0022Mk2\u0022 etc ... till I realized that the usual standard \u0022v1\u0022, \u0022v2\u0022 just doesn\u0027t read right. Any many other names don\u0027t, you just need to avoid using \u0022v\u0022 if you want your ship name to not read funny.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobe","CreatedById":95803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T10:10:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou just need to avoid using \u0022v\u0022 if you want your ship name to not read funny.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t that a solution right there?
