I will not consider FAR entries nor will there be a separate table.\n\n- Craft must use one stock airbreathing jet and no other means of propulsion.\n\n- Craft must utilise separate control surfaces for roll, pitch and yaw (ie one wing, one tailplane and one rudder).\n\n- no intake spamming. By this I mean absolutely no more than TWO intakes.\n\n- no part clipping.\n\n- Undercarriage may be ejected to save weight - particularly as you won\u0027t be needing it again.\n\n- non-stock structural parts OK as long as they do not include \u0022hidden\u0022 inline intakes. Precoolers are the sole exception to this rule as they serve a primary purpose other than as air intakes (although a precooler intake will count toward your intake total).\n\n- Craft must demonstrate a range of at least 40km.\n\n- Craft does not have to survive.\n\nScoring:\n\nOne screenshot of the craft at a distance of at least 40km from the KSC, in level flight at less than 250m ASL, showing maximum speed.\n\nIn the event of a tie for speed (measured to the nearest tenth from the navball), board position shall be decided by lower altitude.\n\nLeaderboard:\n\n1. ihtoit (see below): 1248.9m/s at 240m\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\nChallenger\u0027s Entry: Whiplash-powered, one intake, 1248.9m/s at 240m. And enough fuel even at this altitude to make it to the next continent.

Basically its a cruise missile..\n\n![8zUmN7V.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8zUmN7V.jpg)\n\nA couple of tips for anyone else who fancies trying this:\n\nSteering 114\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 from the end of the runway takes you to a gap between islands and so giving a longer run without hitting hills. \n\nAfter 1250m/s increase speed very gradually, in 10m/s increments. Heat increases with acceleration but then settles down again.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T16:15:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 04:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T16:26:22Z","Content":"Another few tweaks to improve the stability so it flies with 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch and moving to just one \u0027wing\u0027 right at the front of the craft gained some speed... \n\n![jPNjRVN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jPNjRVN.jpg)\n\n![fUWrCXJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fUWrCXJ.jpg)"}]}
