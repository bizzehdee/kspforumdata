The features i suggest should be considered optional difficulty settings for the career mode and may not be included on easier difficulties by default . Also, sorry for any spelling mistakes as I am not a native english speaker and my native language is german.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo...let\u0027s begin!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe concept of rocket reliability\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first idea is not only a requirement \u0026amp; a big part of the second idea coming later but also, in my opinion, a concept really missing in the current KSP. Rocket reliability could change the well known gameplay a lot as not only (just somewhat!) random incidents \u0026amp; misfunctions are introduced as also the way you will build \u0026amp; use rockets will change. No longer will you be operating a just recently constructed rocket with 100% reliability as you first need to gather some science data of the vehicle and its components itself to increase the reliability of all the different parts and the rocket itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarting with things like engine tests, rocket static fire tests are now always (maybe a science option to remove that?) required. Propellant tanks need to be pressure tested before you know the exact data. All of that requires money, space, the right equipment \u0026amp; scientists. With that, the research system also changes: No longer will you see the whole tech tree and know what you need to research to get part X. Now you have to have the right scientists \u0026amp; engineers specialized in the genre you want to advance in. You want a new sea level rocket engine? Get your team to work \u0026amp; research and they will develop a prototype. You don\u0027t have scientists trained in your desired components technology? Buy components from other companies for an increased amount of money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you get the idea: New rocket stuff needs science, testing \u0026amp; also construction time (also a whole new gameplay mechanic as your parts have a limited stock) but that costs money \u0026amp; more so you get a whole nother level of ways to play the game. You got a mission from a rich guy living alone in the woods and he wants you to launch a satellite into LEO and gives you a hard deadline? Maybe quickly develop a prototype \u0026amp; launch the rocket without much testing? Or should we just buy some engines from another company and attach them to our tanks? When you decided which way you wanna go, you will create your rocket concept and announce the plans to the \u0022media\u0022 (Well, in reality you just click \u0022submit\u0022). The rocket is now officially known by the space fascinated kerbals around kerbin. Now it is your time to shine as the rocket is now able to gather reputation (which directly incorporates reliability in a way). More about that in the second part of my post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case it isn\u0027t clear: These\u00A0are just all my ideas stuffed into a quite simple concept so of course you could and should change things. I just think these mechanics could add a LOT more replayability and gameplay depth to the career mode which is my favourite way to play anyway and could really need some more managing aspects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe concept of rocket reputation\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour rocket got a name now! Yay! Be aware of people annoying you on social media with strange WENHOP questions. Now with your rocket known around the world, you could start creating a wikipedia article with pictures \u0026amp; flight data of your fancy rocket (not a gameplay feature). But wait? Didn\u0027t your last mission (the one where you should deploy a satellite for some rich unknown guy) fail on stage separation, as you did not test the decouplers nor the second stage engines? Please don\u0027t forget to add that to the article! Oh, some random internet dudes already did that. Your customers won\u0027t like that!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnough roleplay, I hope it still introduced you well to the second part of my concept. Rocket reputation is a stat that is bound to a rocket you created and \u0022submitted\u0022. That means, if you change too much (how much is too much requires a lot more thinking) on the rocket itself, the rocket will lose all it\u0027s reputation as it is technically a (almost) completely new one (maybe keep some reputation if it still has a lot in common?). Of course you could replace an engine with an upgraded version of the same one, as your newly trained engineers continued to work day \u0026amp; night on improving the already existing concept to increase it\u0027s stats (btw this is again a whole new game mechanic on it\u0027s own) but you cannot simply replace the whole upper stage or switch your engines with a completely new one without losing (some?) reputation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, some time later, your rocket has earned some good reputation, higher level contracts are available as the global trust in your abilities to build rockets and especially in the rocket you just proved to be working has increased. It is finally time for the rocket to become a global contender and not just a simple toy for random rich people or small satellites nobody will talk about. You want to transport THE BIG \u0026amp; IMPORTANT STUFF and, ofcourse, our beloved kerbals. To get the most rewarding contracts, you need to earn specific certificates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCertificates work like \u0022achievements\u0022 but are (mostly?) bound to your rocket. Prove your ability to deploy stuff into LEO and your rocket get\u0027s certified in that task which would not only offer your higher star contracts but could also allow you (if you want to enable that mechanic in your career) to let your star engineers prepare \u0026amp; launch contracts by themself, working in the background while you create new concepts or try to improve the existing one. The same is required to launch kerbals: Do some demo missions and prove that you CAN do it. If you can show the reliability of your rocket and your skill in achieving a specific task your rocket will get huma....i mean kerbal-certified and the big companies will ask YOU to launch their future kerbonauts. Yay! Also, your star engineers do your daily business to secure consequent funding. Finally, you are not only a rocket engineer but a real space company manager.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe end\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first, thank you for reading my suggestion for Kerbal Space Program 2. I am happy to discuss my ideas with you all and would really like some feedback. Ofcourse nothing is written in stone as this was just something I thought about an evening while talking with friends \u0026amp; watching a spacex mission. Again, keep in mind that all the introduced mechanics should be as customizeable as possible and just be some optional gameplay elements people CAN choose to enable. If you really like my concept, feel free to share it whereever you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee you next launch!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Please read my answers to some concerns about the reliability part. I got a bit carried away by my interest in solving unexpected things so it would be nice If you would focus future answers on the reputation part and not so much on the reliability part, as I already realized that there shouldn\u0027t be such a rng factor in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-29T06:42:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2021 06:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Sonic1305\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERequired notice\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-28T20:38:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to KSP 2 Discussion\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-28T20:50:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223996852\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203409\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221624910184\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022212469\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sonic1305\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n46 minutes ago, Sonic1305 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nrandom incidents \u0026amp; misfunctions are introduced as also the way you will build \u0026amp; use rockets will change.

It should not destroy your work when you do a mission that takes 30 or more real time minutes and then while landing on another planet suddenly your engines fail. It is more meant for some prototypes you build in your early game if you play \u0022the spacex way\u0022 and maybe not happen at all if you do it \u0022the nasa way\u0022, if you get what I mean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, when thinking about it now, it could probably be a good idea to focus the \u0022rng part\u0022 on the stuff the player doesn\u0027t directly do like automated missions you do not fly by yourself anymore and if you try to save money, there might be a really small possibility things could fail, which would only cost you some money and not cause your long work getting destroyed, only a single mission giving you some \u0022problems\u0022 to deal with. Maybe it would be interesting if these automated flights get interrupted by mistakes of your flight controllers and then you can choose to fix the mission by yourself, like small challenges which will rarely come by in your normal ksp-career life where you need to do a rescue maneuver or some other mission changing stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it would be enough if you added these tests and so on only to the science part and they become a way of early game thing where you still kinda develop the components by yourself before handing stuff over to specialized researchers.

I wanted to add the process of maximizing what an already finished rocket could do and using that rocket like spacex will still use Falcon 9 when starship and super heavy\u00A0is ready.
