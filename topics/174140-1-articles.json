Have the IVA and EVA suits used by the kerbals correlate with the current level of the Astronaut Complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a general idea of how they should look per level:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLevel 1 - A mashup\u00A0of various\u00A0early spaceflight pressure suits. Since kerbals can\u0027t perform EVAs outside of Kerbin at this point, there would just be one model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLevel 2 - Again, a mashup between Soviet and US suit designs during the Apollo and Soyuz days. The EVA jetpack will functionally be identical to the current one in-game, but have a more bare-bones look. Alternatively, the Making History suits could simply be ported over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLevel 3 - This would go 3 ways:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nA: The stock suits are used.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nB: The suits are slightly redesigned, with a bit more detail to them (agency logos, patches, decorative cameras, etc.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nC: The suits undergo a full redesign, now resembling the current spacesuits used by ROSCOSMOS and NASA.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
