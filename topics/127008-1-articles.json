I no longer have the patience for nukes on large mother ships, so I\u0027m going with Rhinos, that means I need LOX. If I go the mining route, I will likely have to rebuild the whole chain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do enjoy flying spaceplanes, but I fear these fuel requirements will entail 50 or so trips in any spaceplane I can design. I\u0027m not sure I enjoy spaceplanes that much. I don\u0027t suppose any designs out there can lift an 81 ton Kerbodyne?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI need a way to gas up that is affordable and has a good work/life balance.
