There were pen recorders for some instruments, but when Chuck Yeager, in the movie \u0022The Right Stuff\u0022 is reading out the speed, it\u0027s not to dramatise it for a cinema audience. He\u0027s telling an engineer something that might be useful, via the radio, if he doesn\u0027t come back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the tradition of Chuck Yeager and \u0022Winkle\u0022 Brown, we can write things down as we fly, but it would be nice to have a few tools to help us record things. Speed and altitude, for instance, maybe plotted on a graph.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might be something that could usefully go down the path of a connection to a browser. I don\u0027t have enough RAM for that, but if an HTTP connection can feed the data on speed, altitude, attitude, and time to an external program it could bypass a few problems for somebody wanting to log flight data.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T08:05:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like you might want \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24594\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETelemachus\u003C/a\u003E. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T10:37:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EkerbalEDU\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T15:25:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbaltek.com/graphotron\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGraphogtron\u003C/a\u003E by kerbaltek\n"}]}
