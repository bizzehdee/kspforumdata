Chatterer does a great job with this, I was just wondering if it was possible to make it stock. That would personally enhance my overall experience, not to mention add some realism. Also, for those who like to play bare bones stock games, this would be a tremendous addition. Flying inter-planetary missions with next to no sounds at all? Doesn\u0027t sound very exciting to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is more of a side-note, but one thing that I don\u0027t really think would fit in is EVA breathing, true, it\u0027s neat, but listening to kerbals breathing down you\u0027re neck would get old.
