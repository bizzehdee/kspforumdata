Given some thrust profile T(t) and specific impulse I(t), the mass flow rate is given by m\u0027(t) = -T(t)/I(t), while dV is accumulated at the rate V\u0027(t) = T(t)/m(t). So if you know thrust and I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E as a function of time, you can simply take an integral from liftoff to orbit and obtain the dV budget. Of course, by this point, you\u0027ve solved the problem for which you\u0027re trying to get dV in the first place. You essentially need to know the entire trajectory and how much fuel you\u0027re burning at every moment of time. In other words, what you really need to do is solve for ascent profile. And that\u0027s an even more complicated task, which typically involves considerable numerical skills.\n\nFor a planet without the atmosphere, good ascent profiles are pretty well known. They involve constant-altitude burn until you attain orbital speed, proceeding to prograde burn until you attain transfer speed to desired orbit. From there, it\u0027s identical to Hohmann. The actual dV budget still depends a LOT on TWR, but at least, it\u0027s a simple enough thing to compute for a given TWR. Once you throw in atmosphere, this becomes an almost impossibly complex problem to get a perfect answer for. You can get a *good* ascent profile, though, which is typically all you care about.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Actually, there is a formula you can use\n\nOnly for rough approximations.
