To get into a proper orbit try this technique:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Fly straight up until about 10Km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. At 10Km turn your ship to a 45 degree angle (look on the naviball)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Exit to map view and wait till your AP is 100Km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Once the AP reaches 100Km cut your engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Create a manuever at your AP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Burn the manuever\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.

This should not disappear and sounds like a bug. Are you in career or sandbox? I would start a new sandbox game to see if that changes anything.

It will cause your rocket to flip over and crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, turn just a little bit to the east when your rocket exceeds 50 m/s, then turn SAS off. Your rocket will slowly continue to tilt sideways on its own (called a gravity turn). If your rocket ends up turning all the way down to 45 degrees by the time you\u0027re between 10 and 15 kilometers, that\u0027s a good place to be and you can keep letting it fly without SAS. If not*, you\u0027ll want to carefully try and correct it. Sometime between 30 and 40 kilometers you want to be flying almost level. Continue accelerating until your apoapsis rises above the atmosphere; you will start going pretty fast by the time that happens, but don\u0027t be afraid. You need that kind of speed to get into orbit (not just space, but actually orbit) anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Reasons for the turn happening too fast or too slow are generally related to too much or not enough thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Umcookies","CreatedById":144324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T03:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight be worth noting that you need to upgrade your tracking station for your \u0027blue line\u0027 to work outside of Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
