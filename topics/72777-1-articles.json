I \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E wanted to build them - and you might too, which is fine - but they get old very fast, especially with problems of docking/linking separate modules. WITH Kethane bases become essential, therefore your rovers become an easy and interesting adjunct. Multiple bases within rover-commute give you a reason to rove and something interesting to look at while you do it. Rovers can even be useful in carrying things between modules/bases. Have you looked at the KAS mod too? It makes connecting bases much more funtional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Jets\u0027, in the common parlance (to quote wikipedia) are \u0027air\u0027-breathing engines - specifically they need \u0027oxygen\u0027, so only work on Kerbin and Laythe. \u0027Planes\u0027 using non-oxygen-breathing engines are pretty much defined by using wings for lift, in an atmosphere; so that adds Eve and Duna. However, the advantage of (space)planes is their fuel-efficiency from using jets, which still limits them to Kerbin and Laythe for any practical purpose, hence they \u0022are practically useless\u0022 and, even where useful, they take so much time and effort to fly \u0022it\u0027s easier and quicker to launch a (sub)orbital rocket than fly a jet\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Eve the gravity is so great you don\u0027t want to spend any time lower than you absolutely have to. Since you can\u0027t use jets and don\u0027t get any fuel-efficiency from staying in atmosphere with other engines \u0022you\u0027re better off with a normal rocket ascent-profile\u0022 - that is, going UP and out of the atmosphere as quickly as possible (allowing for gravity-turn to get into orbit). On Duna, in contrast, the atmosphere is so thin that you won\u0027t get much lift from a plane unless you carry a ton of wings, making the whole vehicle heavier, harder to build and less efficient. In other words, \u0022you\u0027re better off with a normal rocket ascent-profile\u0022. If you\u0027re not using jets and you\u0027re not using wings for lift there\u0027s no point in carrying a mass of wings - a reasonably aerodynamic rocket just doesn\u0027t need them - which means it isn\u0027t a plane at all any more and so \u0022The only place off Kerbin where jets work, and therefore spaceplanes are worthwhile, is Laythe.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not dispute the possibility of making a solar/xenon plane, just the utility of it. If you want a challenge by all means go ahead but the wonder is not in doing it well, \u0022but you are surprised to find it done at all\u0022. Don\u0027t conflate \u0027jet\u0027/\u0027plane\u0027 or \u0027air\u0027/\u0027oxygen\u0027 though (or \u0027SSTO\u0027/\u0027Spaceplane\u0027 for that matter, which a lot of other people do). As a sci-fi geek, I\u0027m sure you appreciate the difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve probably sorted-out your solar-panel issues by now but for the record, they work most efficiently when facing directly towards the sun but not when facing away from it or in the shadow of a ship or celestial body. The OX-STAT panels are simple, cheap and light but fixed in place, therefore it is important to orientate your ships so that the panels facing the right direction. Doing that even these little panels are useful and efficient, being less than a third of the mass of the OX-4W/L (the shielded versions are even heavier). When ships have trouble orientating to the sun the other panels are useful but they still won\u0027t worked if blocked OR if they are \u0027side-on\u0027. While they rotate in one axis they have no freedom of movement in the other two so you still need to consider their placement carefully, if not as much as with the OX-STAT. The best coverage is with three panels orientated at 90-degrees to each other, one per axis. In practice that\u0027s usually not necessary though, unless your ship really has no ability to rotate. You will still need more panels the further from the sun, of course, as you\u0027ll know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dire_Squid","CreatedById":111106,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T20:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I love using Kethane, I have downloaded the KAS AND Infernal Robotics mods (I use guide rails to lift/lower my landing struts so I can mine, until I can get the bigger Kethane drill).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Your points are VERY valid, Pecan, and they make a lot of sense (and yes, I place simple solar panels all around the circumference of certain areas of my rocket for effective recharge... and my Eve/Duna Probe Rockets I place 6 2x3 panels and deploy them the moment I reach 70K m)...

I try and try, and I can never catch up to/meet up with the other docked ship without being \u0022too late\u0022, or \u0022desperately using the thrusters to foolishly trying to catch up to align, only to realize I keep throwing myself out of alignment\u0022.
