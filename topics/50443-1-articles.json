They detach high over Duna while on a course to aerobrake with about 10km periapsis, starting at around 4000m/s, and are meant to land with parachutes plus engines. They\u0027re also far enough apart that I can\u0027t use [ or ] to switch between them, Flying either ship I discover that shortly into aerobraking, the other has disappeared from map view. Also, flying either ship, I find that they both don\u0027t actually aerobrake enough to land the first time around. So I know for a fact that neither ship could crash without firing engines first. Even then, they disappear way before impact would have happened, it\u0027s as if they\u0027re crashing into the atmosphere and dying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a height limit that the game just considers impact for ships you aren\u0027t flying?
