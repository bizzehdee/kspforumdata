I tried all sorts of crazy stuff with wings and control surfaces, doesnt seem to help, the ship starts tilting to the side (usually to the right) pretty much the second it clears the launch tower, RCS doesnt help either. I had a much heavier fuel tank initially in place of the orange one, i thought maybe its top-heavy so i replaced the 4x heavier with this one, pretty much no effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm including screenshots of both ships, first one is the one that works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for advice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFarseer-Enigma.png:\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageupload.org/?d=E8E283751\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageupload.org/thumb/thumb_133335.png\u0022 alt=\u0022thumb_133335.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Escreenshot19.png:\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageupload.org/?d=13A15A601\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageupload.org/thumb/thumb_133336.png\u0022 alt=\u0022thumb_133336.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-12T00:09:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENeeds moar struts! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-12T00:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Luigibro606\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Luigibro606\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeeds moar struts! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all seriousness, this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thunderbird","CreatedById":10459,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-12T00:43:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethats the first thing i tried,and i use KW struts :\\\u0027(\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-12T00:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E Is might be a thrust issue-I\\\u0027ve noticed that rockets tend to move sideways more the lower the T/W ratio is; e.g. on lower throttle settings.
