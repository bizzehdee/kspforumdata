Love it, much improves depth of play and what you can achieve... but I\u0027ve encountered a few bugs. Most have already been displayed above. My first launch with a pad attached was a bit wobbly so I restarted... and got the \u0027space scene\u0027 on trying to launch the rocket from the VAB. The throttle was up and slowed to zero and it wouldn\u0027t let you do anything except go back to the space center. Eventually I got that working by deleting the Kethane cfg file as mentioned earlier and repasting the DLL to replace Kethane. Not sure why it worked at first then didn\u0027t *shrugs* I did paste in this mods version of the kethane dll but it just... lost it. Weird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently I\u0027ve been having difficulty with doing anything with a pad after launching something. I DLed the new UI and now that UI pops up when ANY vessel gets within 2.2Km of the landed and set up pad. Also can\u0027t get rid of the UI. Annoying. Then, after I launched a vessel from the pad the UI disappeared... and the \u0027load ship\u0027 from right clicking on the pad doesn\u0027t work to bring it back. Just nothing, no way to make any more ships. Now I did \u0027end\u0027 the ship I just made because I didn\u0027t have enough fuel in it to get it off the pad (it was a rover and I just wanted it off the pad) does \u0027ending\u0027 the vessel before it\u0027s launched have anything to do with that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso a suggestion.
