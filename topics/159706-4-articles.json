At some point, before 2024, you look at your mission duration, and you fly the transfer vehicle to LEO, and test the life support. Heck, you might send the actual vehicle up, and put people aboard for 3 years, but that means sending it up by 2021.

You can give Tsiolkovsky the middle finger and use local resources.

For simplicity, you can just let it collect LOX in-situ and let it bring its (less massive) fuel along with it. But there are a lot of reasons why it\u0027s sub-optimal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe concept of having the crew leave their descent vehicle and head to a separate ascent vehicle is not attractive at all. You\u0027ll probably need a very sturdy rover as a primary mission survival requirement, just to allow the crew to get to the ascent vehicle, so that drives up mass. You have to have a separate airlock, cabin, and ECLSS in the ascent vehicle, and all its systems need to be able to be landed long in advance and remain perfectly ready for at least 2 years without maintenance or checkups. Are crew members in IVA suits or EVA suits? EVA suits take up much more space, but you need to bring at least one along in case there is some mission-critical problem that needs to be correct in order to allow ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost disturbingly: no landing abort mode. None. From the moment you start entry, you\u0027re committed, and your survival depends not only on successful EDL, but landing in a site that will allow egress, and allow you to unload your rover, and allow you to make it to your MAV safely. Imagine how much riskier Apollo would have been if Buzz and Neil had been forced to head off to a separate ascent vehicle!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, since the lander needs descent engines, you can size them a bit bigger and use your lander for ascent as well. Just go the ITS route and transfer propellant from a pre-launched \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E unit\u00A0to your sole crewed vehicle. But that requires an even greater landing precision, and I don\u0027t think anyone is comfortable with the idea of hooking up hoses for propellant transfer in an EVA on another planet for the first time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only other option for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E (other than bringing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E unit on the lander, which is a non-starter because of the time it takes to collect propellant even if dry mass wasn\u0027t an issue) is to have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E vehicle autonomously land, collect propellant, and then return to Martian orbit on its own, to transfer prop to the manned vehicle prior to crew EDL. This is the lowest-risk option, because the manned vehicle has all the propellant it needs for ascent before committing to entry. It\u0027s also promising from a dry mass point of view; if your lander can drop up enough\u00A0payload on Mars with a single direct ascent (projected mass to TMI from a fully-reusable Falcon Heavy with my mini-ITS upper stage is 4.5 tonnes plus the entire dry mass of the vehicle), then you can end up with about 35-40 tonnes of propellant available for transfer in low Martian orbit. Of course, you\u0027ve wasted more than half of your fuel getting that fuel up into orbit, but you don\u0027t have to worry about finding a way to transfer propellant on the ground. And it would take much more than a single reusable Falcon Heavy launch to put 35 tonnes of propellant into a TMI; 35-40 tonnes of propellant is what the Falcon Heavy \u002B mini-ITS tanker combination can manage for LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest advantage of the last option is that your EDL and ascent double as tests for the parallel manned mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-01T16:37:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEye candy:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022crew_dragon_3_view_2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://s10.postimg.org/pk2tv9n5l/crew_dragon_3_view_2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022crew_Dragon_3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://s30.postimg.org/yga9l72xd/crew_Dragon_3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-07T22:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the future of humanity somehow depended on it (say aliens told us they\u0027d destroy us if we didn\u0027t get to Mars, just being hypothetical), then yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEasy.
