Been messing with designs and, while using my old design i used for most of my rockets, managed to keep it and just use the new parts, to build an awesome asteroid catching ship\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe First one i made was the prototype, but the asteroid i was trying to catch was 8 days away and i didnt want to spend too much time building and testing so i just used the first ship and it worked out well. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOvNOUH4Ujs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EAfter getting the E type into orbit, i wanted to make a more efficient, bigger and all around more usable ship so i got redesigning and came up with a new variant of the ship which im very happy with. It gets into orbit with tons of fuel left, has the ability to drop off 50% of the fuel tanks when they are empty, making the ship lighter and lighter and the top section has 2 \u0022escape pods\u0022 generally small ships with a parachute and some science stuff, mainly just for kerbals that are on the asteroid to be able to jump ship and go back without needing to take the whole thing back.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EIt can also detatch the 2 huge side engines, each with 4 nuclear rocket engines on, and they both can claw into asteroids and are actually really good at doing the job, it also can just stick in as 1 big ship.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EAlternatively both side bits can detatch and you are left with a smallish ship with still 2 nuclear engines and a docking port on the front attatched to the top pod.
