Second I totally failed to specify the type of craft I thought this would be a good option for, that was silly considering that some craft in KSP2 will be very large. Third I completely and utterly failed to get across the exact nature of the propulsion I had in mind. Fourth I also completely failed to bring the most spectacular point of the entire idea into focus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow then. Armed with some better understanding of electric propulsion in general I\u0027ll try to explain the design I\u0027d go for. The whole point is to use electricity to accelerate any random gas to a useful speed somehow, but I should have made it far more obvious I wasn\u0027t at all thinking of the 30km/s or so that\u0027s common among regular ion thrusters. Those use insane amounts of power because they have to make the fullest use of \u003Cem\u003Eevery single atom\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the gas, that\u0027s not what we need at all. What we need is an \u003Cem\u003Eaverage\u003C/em\u003E ejection speed of more like 2km/s and the ability to fire off a comparatively astronomically much bigger quantity of gas at that speed per second. My original interest in the PIT was quite flawed on a number of levels but it at least gave me an idea, though it\u0027s embarassing I didn\u0027t even read far enough to see the FARAD variant at first. Now finally we get to the actual design; rather than a flat disc of a PIT or any other variant of magnetic field I\u0027ve seen it would be better to make a rather deep\u00A0\u0022cone\u0022 pointing inward. The cone would be surrounded by a coil to induce a strong magnetic field but the inside of the cone where the gas is located would be lined with a protective layer that would also strongly reflect RF waves. Using the FARAD low energy ionization of gasses we could then inject a big puff of gas into the cone, fire a strong RF burst from the open end but trailing along the walls to ionize only the layer closest to the coil, then activate the coil to \u0022squeeze\u0022 this \u0022membrane\u0022 of ions around the unionized gas to make the still unionized gas interact with the magnetic field and be ejected at great speed. Any gas remaining after the membrane has exited the cone is likely to have absorbed a lot of heat and will be ejected from that instead so it\u0027s not entirely wasted either.\u00A0Naturally the main process would only work if you have a high enough concentration of gas present but that\u0027s the hidden beauty of this: you can switch mode of this thruster and either use it as a regular ion drive while firing thin puffs of gas (of course much less efficient than a standard dedicated ion drive but still useful) or you can burn gas like there\u0027s no tomorrow at a massively reduced efficiency but with thrust values possibly approaching regular monopropellant systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for scale I see no immediate reason this can\u0027t come in more than one size and no reason you can\u0027t use several at once with minimal performance difference due to the greatly improved specs of KSP2.\u00A0I also see no reason other \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters can\u0027t have vastly different sizes since they simply operate like little rockets, I don\u0027t understand the fear that KSP2 wouldn\u0027t have far bigger and more powerful ones if the game literally encourages ships that are many times bigger than anything possible to fly in KSP1?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly the biggest selling point of the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E that seems to have been lost on most of you; the random gas used as propellant.
