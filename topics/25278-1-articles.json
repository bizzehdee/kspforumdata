Your two ships are parked nose to nose, 50m apart. A quarter of an orbit later, the one out front is now pointed straight down at the planet, while the one in back is pointed straight up at the stars. Half an orbit from the starting point, the craft are now tail to tail, still 50m apart, simply because of the curved path they follow, and they are not rotating to match the curvature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis apparent rotation can be eliminated by turning both craft so that they point along the Normal axis, which is 90 degrees off your prograde direction, and on the horizon line of your NavBall. So, if you\u0027re orbiting to the east (heading 090), turn your craft to face north and south. This causes the craft to \u0022roll\u0022 as they orbit rather than \u0022pitch\u0022, giving you a stationary target to dock with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dd61R.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Dd61R.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T01:52:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEh...it adds mass.
