In time acceleration, the flight integrator merrily does it\u0027s thing and interpolates their orbits/trajectories - which will always be different - with physics paused so the joint is ineffective, and herein lies the problem.

As far as modification goes, as long as we make sure that the other modules are updating their local instances of that variable from the config manager, then everything will stay in sync. The variables in the config manager were never meant to be updated from the outside modules. if we needed to update a global variable from another module, I\u0027d likely have the config manager periodically check for changes in a separate variable in the module we needed to update from and simply set the value to be equal to that. In this way, the variables being loaded for global access are only being set from within the class that they are managed from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I don\u0027t see any situations where an outside module would ever need to change the value of one of these global variables we\u0027ve set up. The modules should be using local variables which are set from the global variables first. We don\u0027t need to persist data from the flight scene backwards into the editors, so it\u0027s pretty easy to keep track of what is setting what value and keep collisions from happening between saved data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m starting to feel like I\u0027m typing in circles and making little sense... but it makes sense in my head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do remember data binding from my ASP.NET class last quarter. It actually isn\u0027t all that complicated, but in ASP you have prefabricated methods for handling all of that, and prefabricated controls for the web-GUI which are already configured to receive the data. You also have access to the database structure from the beginning so you can predict how the code will interact with it. In KSP, we know there\u0027s a database of stuff in there somewhere, and we have methods to access it, but we really don\u0027t know exactly what it looks like or how it\u0027s structured until we start asking for information and it starts telling us to \u0022stuff it where the sun don\u0027t shine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T04:07:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 04:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T09:31:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Darren9\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Darren9\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI already collected up the mods and had the pod-racer built for it Lo-fi, then launched with it for the first time in the new aero and it all went bad \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E They only work by enough drag at the rear to keep the ropes reasonably tight - I think it\u0027ll need about a hundred air-brakes.

The priority is getting the rest of the parts rewritten for the new module rewrites and completing the dust stuff.
