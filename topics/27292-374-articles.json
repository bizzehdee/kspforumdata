I got a test contract for the RAPIER again, and decided to build a cheaper, payload-less spaceplane to perform rescue missions. I also added ion engines and lots of monopropellant - perhaps it could dock, dump fuel and transfer to Laythe, or something, I thought. Once in orbit I did a delta-V calculation: not even 1km/s, with fuel and monopropellant levels as they were. I didn\u0027t check against fuel-dumping, though.

So instead of putting long-range antenna on all crafts, suitable relay satellites are launched. Unfortunately in their haste to prepare for the first Mun Shot, Mission Control forgot about this when launching the Munar scanning satellites a few days earlier. Hence no detailed surface data about the Mun has been beamed back. Well, at least Bill should be able to pick it up once he is in range, and choose an appropriate landing spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch and transfer to the Mun went according to plan. A deep-space inspection showed no faults halfway to Mun, and the insertion burn on the dark side was similarly flawless. It seems nothing can go wrong on this endeavour! Due to the different mission profiles, this is also where the comms satellite was decoupled to allow it to enter a higher orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill chose a large crater on the sunlit hemisphere as a suitable first landing site. Final descent and touch-down were also right on target, and a flag to commemorate Jebediah (who sadly died while attemping a landing in a test plane last week) was erected. After a minute of silence, Bill went ahead and deployed various science instruments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately part-way through, communications with Mission Control became spotty and finally petered out completely. It appears that Mission Control was being greedy and had decided to use the remaining fuel of the transfer stage to place the comms satellite into its orbit, presumably in order to save the satellites\u0027 fuel for later orbital corrections. Hence the most likely scenario is that because the satellite fairing had not been jettisoned, the solar panels were not deployed, and now the satellite is dead to all commands. Well, maybe Bill has the time and initiative (and enough dv) to check on the satellite on the way back to Kerbin.. until then, all we can do is hope that he is ok!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[\u003Cstrong\u003EUPDATE\u003C/strong\u003E]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter Bill completed a few short excursions from the inaugural Mun landing site, he crossed his fingers and fired up the engine, which, thankfully, sputtered back into life, lifting his capsule, now heavy with Mun rocks, back off the surface and into a low Mun orbit. From there, carefully calculating his Delta-V margins, he decided to have a go at repairing the defunct comms satellite, which was on a highly elliptical and slightly inclined orbit. Nevertheless, a few burns later, he was on an intercept! There\u0027s a reason he was the first to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter intercept, Bill EVA\u0027d over to the satellite and tried to pry off part of the fairing, but no luck. His space-suit was also too bulky to squeeze inside to see if he could trigger the eject mechanism from inside. Dejected, Bill returned to his capsule. But as he approached his fragile home of the last few days, he had an idea! A quick rest and refill of his suit later saw him venturing back out into the cold black void.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily his capsule was still the old model, with various external components, including some battery packs! One of these he disconnected, and carried over to the comms satellite. A short while later he had it connected up to the satellite systems, which slowly flickered back into life. Now it was a simple case of reprogramming the satellite systems to eject the side which covered the solar panel and deploy the panel. Unfortunately Bill neglected to retreat to a safe distance, and when he hit \u0022go\u0022 the ejected fairing careened straight into him. Luckily Kerbal spacesuits are made of strong stuff! Despite being a bit woozy, Bill saw with satisfaction that his plan had worked and that the satellite was fully operational again - just in time for sunrise!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe remainder of Bills outing to the Mun was mundane in comparison. He returned to his capsule and watched the satellite perform its first orbital burn, then fired up his engine in turn for the long return to Kerbin. The return trajectory was carefully calculated to perform an aero-brake in Kerbins atmosphere as there was insufficient fuel left for orbital insertion. Soon he was approaching Kerbin, the welcoming blue-white orb hanging tantalisingly close in space . The upper atmosphere gripped him and Bill ejected the last, and lower, stage of his craft, leaving a small capsule for the final fiery plunge through the atmosphere, carrying its precious cargo of science. And Bill. He was coming in hot and fast over the daylit side and soon splashed gently down in the ocean to be picked up by the recovery crews.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Rzvbe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
