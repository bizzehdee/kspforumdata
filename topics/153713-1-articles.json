The winner will be announced on 25th December, so all entries must be in by midday on the 24th. Also, your crafts must be 100% stock. I will run them on my vanilla version of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two competitions, the \u0027wacky\u0027 competition, where you must present your weirdest craft. It does not have to conform to any rules apart from one: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E only. No \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Sorry. It can be a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, a rover, a supercar, a plane, or whatever the hell you want. The crazier the better. However, it must fly well, my nooby younger brother will test them to see how easy it is to fly. However, I will be the main judge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second competition is a \u0027festive\u0027 competition. Submit any festive-themed craft. It can be christmassy, chanukah-y or whatever festival you like. It can be \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, just make it good and fun. Once again, it must be easy to fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you enter, please write the competition you wish your craft to be judged in, and if it is a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E.

I am able to make crafts, but I\u0027m not the world\u0027s greatest builder. However, the KSP community is more than capable of creating fantastic crafts. I am absolutely open to other judges joining, or even becoming sole judges without me. My aim was simply to make a fun, light-hearted competition. Directly message me through the forums if you would like to judge, I will take up to 5 judges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.
