You could also use a mod that turns the capsule into a satellite; take a look at Probodobodyne (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=6397.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=6397.0\u003C/a\u003E), you can make some very nice satellites using it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Build massive space stations, both orbital and munar - there is so many mods im lost as to what to do to achieve this - id love to build something insane in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually these are made using space station parts from mod packs.

You can choose to launch these manually or using a mod that just dumps it in orbit. Once the developers finish docking (give them a month or so) it\\\u0027ll be much more practical to launch large stations manually as they can be broken up into separate trips and assembled in orbit (like the ISS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope I answered your questions! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-03T17:39:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s going to take longer than a month to complete docking.
