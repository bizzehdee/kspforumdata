Try running KSP from the terminal with sudo (or gksudo or whatever you want) - that solved all my problems. How much RAM/VRAM is being used?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal007","CreatedById":92253,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T03:32:31Z","Content":"Sorry, it was late at night for me, ill try that out. I have 16gb of ram on a i52500k, i have the correct drivers installed .349 nvidia however i might try 340 as i did not see any issue there, however i may not have tested IVA.\n\nI am running in full screen window, only other thing I have done is installed cairo dock which could be causing an issue i am unaware of :/ thanks for the tip. I am a novice so if anyone sees this a pointer on how to run ksp from the terminal would be tops !"}]}
