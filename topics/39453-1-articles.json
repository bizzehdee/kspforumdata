Would it be reasonable or possible to ever add an extension to the current atmosphere models where its drag on spacecraft becomes low enough at high altitudes that one can still complete dozens of orbits on medium- or medium-long- timescale maneuvers, like rendezvous, without any detectable change in orbit, but on the timescale of months or years or more it does begin to cause decay?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T19:02:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, is that any time warp above 4x causes everything to be on-rails, so physics would cease, and such orbits would be much more permanent.

The problem is in knowing by *how much* to change it. There is no analytical way to predict the behavior of a craft being influenced by both gravity and atmospheric drag - the problem is fundamentally the same one that prevents KSP from having n-body physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtmospheric drag has some basic models that predict motion given some assumptions of the atmosphere and craft. Considering how blatantly obvious the flaws with the current model are, I think any approximation would be an improvement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, having orbital decay is important to have if we ever want a fully realized recovery mechanic. There is no reason that boosters dropped into the atmosphere with sufficient parachutes should be \u0022destroyed\u0022 by the current model. The solution may just be a simple check to see if the number of parachutes would sufficiently slow each part in order to prevent damage, and then automatically have it recovered, but I think a more comprehensive simulation of drag, even with rails accounted for, is not outside the realm of possibility. Once re-entry heat is properly added, maybe parts could be destroyed on their thermal properties as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and doesn\u0027t mechjeb even have an aerobraking simulator on it?

Not only is the current behavior unrealistic but it doesn\u0027t even follow it\u0027s own internal logic! A solution to this problem would have gameplay ramifications for part recovery as well.
