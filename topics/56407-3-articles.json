This is true of any game. However, most games at that point just end and you get to watch the credits roll by. With KSP, you are free to continue playing until you\u0027ve exhausted all possibilities, and beyond. This \u0022end-game lull\u0022 is a frequent issue with sandbox games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E However, I disagree that resource mining-- especially the idea for resource mining that we proposed last year-- is the best solution to improve end-game activities. There are a lot of other cool things that we could add there, that would be a lot more interesting and fun, and that wouldn\u0027t require an overly complicated and honestly, very tedious system to give you new cool things to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What those things are aren\u0027t something we want to discuss yet. For all we know at this point, whatever new idea we disclose now might end up turning into a new \u0027resources\u0027, that later needs to get scrapped, so let\u0027s not get into that discussion now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E One thing that needs to be made clear though, is that a game in Early Access, while it shares a lot in common with the usual MMO-style development process (without any regard to payment model either, that\u0027s an entirely separate and off topic thing here), it is different in that while the MMO is essentially complete from the start, and receives new updates to extend the content for players who have done everything, the Early Access game is still incomplete, and must devote its development time to adding features that maybe might not seem important to experienced players, but that make it easier to be picked up by new players, or that make the overall game experience more complete even if that doesn\u0027t make it more lengthy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That\u0027s not saying we won\u0027t ever add more things to do on the end-game level... However, you may notice it\u0027s even been mentioned several times here that the key thing is that people feel that once you land on another planet, there isn\u0027t much else to do. That does not imply the solution to that is to get out the shovels and start mining. Especially if you were supposed to remember to pack the shovels in the first place and didn\u0027t realize it until after touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My point is, that old plan we had for resources is most certainly not the right solution. It doesn\u0027t fit organically with the rest of the game, it requires you to remember to attach a bunch of single-purpose parts to a vessel (forgetting any of which would render a mission a complete failure), and really, that\u0027s just not how we want the game to play out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I think this is the crux of the issue then. The resources plan being shelved is, by all means, a good thing. It wasn\u0027t any fun once we got down to it, so we\u0027re not losing anything that was worth keeping here. However, that does not mean there isn\u0027t a need (and budding plans) for more end-game activities. I\u0027m just saying that old plan for resource mining wasn\u0027t it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Cheers \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Last edited by HarvesteR; Today at 12:56. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I figured it out !!!!!

Would you mind elaborating on this a bit please? What is your issue with the PR-side communication and what do you think could be done to improve?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that it boils down to a few things that all collaborate together to create a poor situation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The KSP community in general has fantastic communication and collaboration amongst each other, and SQUAD maintains an excellent community space for such things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Information about upcoming features and releases has (historically) been almost entirely absent. SQUAD has been changing this a bit (0.23 being a notable example) but not significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There are many different styles of play in this game, and SQUAD is trying to support them all. They are doing a decent job of that, but some of them (such as sci-fi themed vs. realistic near future) are mutually exclusive, and at least in all communication so far, SQUAD has not even noted that they understand this (which they obviously do). I think it\u0027s pretty clear that SQUAD likes and is building for the realistic near future scenario, but creative direction in general has been mostly uncommunicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- As a developer, I know that part of this has to boil down to the fact that this is an alpha game in pre-release, and if SQUAD was spending that much time on such general direction, it would be difficult to get work done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- However, there needs to be more finality to things that come from development. If there is a future feature set that is outlined by dev to the public, it should be because some version of it will definitely be there. Likewise, if something is removed from scope, that decision needs to be communicated promptly and simply. At issue with this particular update, and the resulting thread, is that it\u0027s clear from the update the dev team has known resources (in their previous form) were out for a while. This communication doesn\u0027t tell us 1. why that communication to the community was delayed or 2. what sort of conceptual replacement is envisioned. It should have included one of those, or not been announced at all, IMO. Most people that are displeased would probably have no issue if the probable replacement goal/mechanic was outlined at the same time, or it was communicated briefly early on when it was figured out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The communication needs to be more honest about the fact that some things can be very cool, but out of scope. Things like \u0022multiplayer can\u0027t be done\u0022 never should have come out. \u0022Multiplayer doesn\u0027t fit our scope right now\u0022 would have been better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary, I think it has to do with the fact that SQUAD is giving us details, but not as much vision. If we have details, it should probably be a subset of some vision that we already know about, or we probably shouldn\u0027t know about it. I\u0027m honestly not sure if SQUAD is over or under communicating right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T02:36:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Themohawkninja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Themohawkninja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell yes, I understand that the NERVA engine was tested, but it was never put into use, so for all intents and purposes, you could argue that it\u0027s future tech.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really.
