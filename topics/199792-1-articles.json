Can we get the ability to select them in a cluster like in an rts, or all of the same part type with one single click and menu to change them all at once. Or any with the same settings already with an override for select all of that type of part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalt(rightshift in linux) plus double right click a part will bring up one of those menus with fuel and other selections. Under the hood it has selected all available big S wings to adjust their settings with one single screen showing fuel to empty for fill or set the autostrut etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe double left click and double right click do different things. Left could be the overriding all of this part type. Right click could be for all of that part type with the same settings currently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-24T05:18:43Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2021 05:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
