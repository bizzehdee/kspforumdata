The node shows up nicely, however it states: \u0022Technology has unresearched requirements\u0022, even though I already researched \u0022fuelSystems\u0022 in the file. How can I fix this? - I run kerbal construction timer with quite an unforgiving timing on researching so I prefer not to edit my save file and delete \u0022fuel systems\u0022 research node. (Or should I delete it, and load ksp, then add the node to the researched list again?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
