Reductio ad absurbum style - less so a violation of common sense than in most cases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if we look at risks and dangers and we see that there are many interconnected risk. Education is by far the best deterrent to risk of any origin (for example the most educated people tend to have the least problem with sugar diabetes). In risk management there is a word called situational awareness, for example if you are working around a cobalt irradiator, its a good idea to know that it can be lethal, and it is best to take note any unusual behavior. If you have a beach house in a typhoon zone, its best to check the weather report more often and follow the guidance carefully. If you live in a war zone then have a complex risk aversion strategy that may involve kin-selection. Education also helps discern killers by there nature (a hand grenade, etc) from things that are lethal only in rare situations (like water, that beam above your head in your house, or an incoming asteroid). For example if you asked an extremely educated person what chemical statistically is most likely to kill you as a result of all it direct and indirect affects (due to overconsumption, for example) that substance would be dextrose. IOW through a process of statistically mediated risk aversion we can see in a process of exclusion; which things will increase or decrease life expectancy with exposure above an optimum - multiplied by its likelihood of exposure. Botox is not a likely risk, but cigarettes are given there is a risk of physical addiction, sugar is also a risk, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel of Life","CreatedById":45646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T17:53:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most hazardous material I have personally worked with is nitromethane (CH3NO2).
