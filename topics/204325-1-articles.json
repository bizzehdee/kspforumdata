I never named stuff in career except with a mission designation (\u0022comet lander\u0022, \u0022mun probe\u0022 or stuff like that), for clarity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of my names are given out of similarities; I look at the final ship, then wait for it to struck my fancy. In particular, I decided to use names of common objects for small landers; hence I had The Can, Stool, and Horseshoe. Also named for their shape are Arrowhead, Nail, Bolt, Wings, Flying Christmas Tree, Dancing Porcupine (this last one, a rover with landing struts jutting out from it to protect from impacts, gets \u0022porcupine\u0022 because they look like quills, and \u0022dancing\u0022 because of the way it bounces on the ground).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome other ships are named after the stuff they do, like Taxi and Trucker, ships intended for long range travel, to ferry around smaller landers. Or Not! Albatross, a seaplane I would have called Albatross, except it would have been too unoriginal. Or Digger, mining ships with drills, they dig. A bigger version (that never went past initial concept) was named Crater Maker, because it would dig so much that it would leave a big hole. Or Craplane, a plane that wasn\u0027t very successful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore rarely, I name ships after philosophical affinities. The Dolphin crew escape pods get their name from the fact that dolphins sometimes help shipwrecked sailors to shore. And FU Eve was my exclamation when i gave up on making an efficient Eve lander and decided instead to solve the issue with brute force. Home was the habitation module of a life support long term ship, because it was supposed to be a home for the crew for decades.

I\u0027m a bit put down that nobody commented on it, I was hoping there would be more pterry fans around here. Digger/Trucker/Wings was also a reference to the nomes trilogy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes I imagine a ship and I immediately know the name. Other times I leave the ship temporarily unnamed, and give it a name after using it.
