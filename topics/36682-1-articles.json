Despite that, it is one of the greatest things to have happened to the culture of humanity during my brief time alive on this Earth. It was a series on the Apollo program, from the Murcury and Gemini programs that lead up to it, to the fire of Apollo 1, and NASAs recovery from the disaster, Apollo 8\u0027s 10 orbits around the Moon, 11\u0027s first landing, the war between factual news and sensationism during one of the greatest news stories of living memory, Apollo 13, turning the \u0022throttle-jockeys\u0022 that would go on the J class missions into scientists, and finally the bittersweet end of the program on 17.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had a look around the forums, and it seems the people on it are rather interested in spaceflight, so I imagine a great deal of you have seen at least one episode. If you\u0027ve seen more than one, which one is your favourite. I know, choosing is like picking a favourite flavour of ice cream. Even blueberry is gosh darn delicious. You could say which ones tie first place, if that is the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a four-way tie: \u0022Spider\u0022, the story of the boys at Northrop-Grumman who were tasked with building the first true spaceship (these guys had to build a whole new class of flying machine. They had little knowledge at the beginning on what the moon was even like, imagine having to people for a trip to somewhere on the planet, you get ready for the arctic circle, you\u0027re landed in the amazon. Making the LM took truly inspirational genius.), \u0022That\u0027s all there is\u0022, the crew of Apollo 12 (You\u0027ve seen everything that makes sense, then you\u0027ve seen an astronaut, on the moon, banging a TV camera with a hammer.), \u0022Galileo Was Right\u0022, how a pair of geology egg-heads were tasked with turning the Apollo 15 crew, all three US air force pilots and adrenaline junkies into scientists, and their discovery of the \u0022Genesis rock\u0022. (Seeing grown men go from being bored out of their minds in a classroom, to falling in love with how geology, and science in general, can tell a story, and how listening can only enrich the human race, was beautiful) and \u0022Le Voyage dans la Lune\u0022, how Apollo 17 smashed record after record, ending Project Apollo with a brilliant, if premature, bang.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-02T22:30:52Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2013 10:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Drunkrobot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nikolai","CreatedById":23085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T15:11:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s All There Is\u0022 is the one I tend to show other people (who probably have little familiarity with the Moon race), since I think it\u0027s the most approachable and humorous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Spider\u0022 is my personal favorite, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hiddos","CreatedById":65501,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T17:29:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t heard of this series yet, so I\u0027ll try them out as soon as possible and come back afterwards D:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat other series do you recommend?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drunkrobot","CreatedById":58034,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T17:41:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only other series I could think is Space Odyssey: Voyage To The Planets.
