You\u0027ve also probably encountered the base kraken. When this beast strikes it usually comes out of a rip in the fabric of time when you go from warped state to normal state. Here\u0027s a list of tips of things I do to fight off the base kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Only landing gear or wheels may touch the ground. The base kraken likes to eat things that are in contact with the ground. To minimize this effect use landing gear or wheels on the ground. Landing legs are better as they have shock absorbers. The exception to this is the small probe landing gear. Don\u0027t use that, it doesn\u0027t have enough strength in the shock absorbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Weight shifting during timewarp invites the kraken. If your base\u0027s weight changes during timewarp (smelting metal or mining ore/kethane/karbonite) the center of mass of your base changes. When you leave timewarp it will change the rotation of your base and parts may contact the ground. Entering time warp again will clip those parts into the ground! The base kraken will attack the next time you leave timewarp. To minimize the impact of this the parts which change weight the most should be nearest to your base\u0027s current center of mass. COM change will also destroy your base if you leave to the space center and come back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. No RoveMax Model XL3. I\u0027ve seen a glitch on this part where it can\u0027t figure out if the vessel is landed or not and if you warp when it thinks it\u0027s suborbital it\u0027s instant death for whatever vessel was using this. I so badly want to use this wheel too as it has awesome ground clearance for whatever you use it on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The fewer vessels that are linked together on your base the better. The base kraken is drawn to bases which have many linked vessels (via the claw, docking ports or through KAS). Linked vessels also seem to disrupt the flow of time near them too, slowing everything down. If you\u0027re able to have everything together in one piece you\u0027ll be safer from the kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
