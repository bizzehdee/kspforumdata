Sure, it may be kinda cheaty, but in the end it\u0027s saved my hide a couple of times. Who knows when you\u0027ll have to get out and push your spacecraft back home?\n\nAll in all, if it was changed to drain the monopropellant, then I would approve of the change. At least it\u0027ll give more of a reason command pods have RCS storage now. Hmm.... What if that was the reason it was added? Just not implemented yet?"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T16:36:49Z","Content":"More realism as always please.

There is no reason why you could not use an oxygen supply as a propellent in an emergency. However, the astronaut may wish to breath first, so we\u0027d end up with CO2 as the propellent. Blown, as compressing it and moving it from the cabin to the engine nozzel (in this case a drinking straw ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ) would give some propulsion.
