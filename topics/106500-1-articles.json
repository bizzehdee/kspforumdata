For example, what heading should I take off to get a given final orbital inclination? I know 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA heading relates to a 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA inclination - is it as simple as having a 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA heading equal a 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA inclination? Also as both 270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA and 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA headings give a 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA inclination, what would the inclination be on a 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA or a 100\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA heading? 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA both ways? ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif) And is there a way to differentiate a 270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA or 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA orbital inclination of 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA? Obviously they are going in opposite directions but is there a term for this?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T07:04:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 07:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by funkcanna**"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T07:26:10Z","Content":"It\u0027s not an entirely obvious answer, it\u0027ll require a little bit of trigonometry to figure out precisely. Because Kerbin is rotating, you already have some eastward orbital velocity just sitting on the pad. If Kerbin didn\u0027t rotate, then if you took off at a heading of 45 degrees your orbit would have an inclination of 45 degrees.\n\nNow, we can break the rotational velocity we get from Kerbins rotation into two parts, one is in the heading we want to go, and the other is perpendicular. Think of the velocity in the way we want to go just as free dV. The perpendicular stuff is either normal or anti-normal to our orbit, so it\u0027ll cause a plane rotation, and depending on whether you are heading east or west, rotate your orbit closer or farther from equatorial, respectively.\n\nTLDR; if you take of at a heading of 45 degrees, your inclination will be closer to equatorial. If you take off at a heading of 315, your inclination will be closer to polar.

It is called retrograde orbit.\n\nThe numerical difference between heading and inclination in all these examples comes from different references. Your heading is referenced to North of the body you are on or orbiting, while inclination is referenced to equatorial plane (the plane in which the planet rotates)."},{"CreatedByName":"funkcanna","CreatedById":138944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T07:58:52Z","Content":"So does the inclination number go up from 0 as you head south?

If you launched directly north or south you would end up in an orbit with an inclination of 90 degrees either way, the longitude of ascending node would be very different, though. (See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements) for more info on orbital elements.)\n\nHeading is a bit trickier for inclinations other than 0, 90 or 180 degrees, in that the desired heading changes as you move north or south from the equator. This happens because the spacecraft always follows a [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle) route. Have a look at the ground track for an object in an orbit with about 45 degrees of inclination (yellow line):\n\n![Satellite_Orbital_Elements_ISS_Groundtrack.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Satellite_Orbital_Elements_ISS_Groundtrack.png)\n\nYou can see that the object\u0027s heading changes from about 45 degrees at the equator when moving north, then changing to 90 at the northernmost point, then 135 when crossing the equator moving south, then 90 again at the southernmost point."},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:27:00Z","Content":"Okay, now that it\u0027s morning and I\u0027m more awake, I did some of the math to help illustrate what happens.
