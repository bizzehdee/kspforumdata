Still, no use and i would really like to use the atmospheric effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKsp version: 1.2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGPU (probably most important here) Asus 1080 strix (reference card: NVIDIA GTX 1080)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCPU: Intel 4790k at 4.0 GHz\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16 GB RAM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lag is probably down to about 40 frames with.... 1 part on the launchpad. And then, with more parts, it starts to go further and further down, when before I could manage \u00AC800 parts with playable FPS. Please can somebody help me? I highly doubt I should be getting this lag with my GPU, and shaders are GPU based, not CPU (afaik).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther mods I am using:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVarious part mods, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E.
