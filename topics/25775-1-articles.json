Thus, from the perspective of a Kerbal on the planet below (totally just typed \u0027kerspective\u0027) the satellite will \u0027drift\u0027 slightly prograde or retrograde. If you wanted to make a spy satellite that stays perfectly over top of a location on Kerbin for years at a time, get Mechjeb. Otherwise, accept that your satellites won\u0027t stay perfectly aligned with the planet below. Fortunately, the margins for error are quite large when doing a satellite network, especially if you put more than three up, so it won\u0027t matter too much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
