For instance: I want to select a wheel attached to a girder. If I click the wrong place (by a margin of a few pixels), I select the girder instead. It\u0027s more aggravating when selecting struts or pipes, but it happens (at least to me) a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we could lock a piece, we could, for instance, lock the girder, which is already in place and fine, fine tune the wheels, attach more stuff to it if needed, all while being unable to select it. And, once we\u0027re done with that or we want to modify the girder (or whatever piece in the background we end up selecting instead), we unlock it and continue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T05:09:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat wouldn\u0027t be a problem if the undo feature (CTRL\u002BZ) would actually work so that accidentaly chipped off parts could be reattached.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
