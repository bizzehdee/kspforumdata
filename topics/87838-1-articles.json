They are probably the product of some kind of environment where that is necessary in order to effect some sort of change. I find this extremely depressing, because that tells me that you live in a normal environment where your words and opinions go completely unheeded in normal conversation and you gotta shout to be heard. That sucks. It really does. But I have to say, it simply isn\u0027t gonna work here. In the real world. Ninety-nine out of a hundred times, people don\u0027t respond well to being browbeaten. By anybody.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say I\u0027m a dev. I come across a thread with two posts about a perceived problem. One says \u0022rofl u guise dunno what ur doin and u all need to die in twelv fires kthxbai\u0022, and the other says, \u0022This mechanic is bad. Here\u0027s why. Here\u0027s what happens when you do this, this is why it\u0027s broken, and here\u0027s what I think you need to do to fix it.\u0022 As a normal, mostly human non-dev, even I can see that the second one is worth reading and the first one barely rates being placed on the bottom of my pet cockatiel\u0027s bird cage. If you really feel strongly that something is wrong, and you wanna gripe, then PLEASE, gripe away. Just do it in a manner conducive to the problem being fixed. Posting like the first example I noted is actually counter-productive, given that you\u0027re actually making it EASIER for me to ignore your complaint. The second one is not ignorable. It could be completely wrong, but I\u0027d have to address it, and give detailed reasons why I think it\u0027s wrong. The first doesn\u0027t even rate a response, really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, TL;DR version: Griping isn\u0027t bad, but griping ineffectually is. Learn to complain with panache. Ranting might make you feel better for a moment, but getting your gripe heard and acted on and actually getting something worthwhile accomplished makes you feel better a lot longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EINDEX: Here\u0027s what you wanna put in every single complaint:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.)
