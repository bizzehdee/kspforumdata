Rather than just have one surface sample from a geological region (aka biome)\u00A0 I think allowing scientists(or any kerbal?) to take samples from ground scatter rocks would be an interesting game play mechanic. There would be the default soil sample from biome X, then there would be rock samples obtained from the surface scatter locations.\u00A0 Rather than just have one type of rock sample I think having several that are random might be best, that way you\u0027d have to travel to a number of different rocks to get a variety of samples. Sort of like random science loot drops. This would give a reason to explore around the landing site and spend a little more time on the planets surface. Rovers would be useful for this. Perhaps high level scientists might get a low random chance to recover meteorites, including those originating on other bodies. ie rock sample 5 - granite meteorite originating on Duna, found on the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T23:00:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are some practical obstacles to this, but yes, it would be cool, especially when tied to a contract. \u003Cem\u003EObtain a surface sample from an orange rock in the East Crater of Mun.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nNot everyone has scatter objects\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome players have a real low scatter object count, making the \u0022required\u0022 ones stand out\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMight lead to science grinding\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBut working properly around these concerns could add an interesting game dynamic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T23:11:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContracts could spawn an object independent of the scatters, also I think surface samples should have mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T23:18:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I am 100% in agreement with the OP, but it would require that scatter objects would become material ( aka you can interact with them ) .

Adding a contract for \u003Cem\u003Etake a rock sample from object at location X\u003C/em\u003E is just a minor variation on the \u003Cem\u003Etake a surface sample at location X\u003C/em\u003E type contracts that already exist in the game, (no doubt a nice addition) but it doesn\u0027t make the basic science interactions any more interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion was to change how taking surface samples works to make it more interactive and to require exploration. Something that would require you to move more than 1m away from the bottom of the lander ladder, and take more than 10 seconds. Something that would give a slight sense of actually exploring a planet and doing science. The random scatter is merely a convenient visual cue. There\u0027s no reason you couldn\u0027t have sample variation from locations that differ by 100m or something of that order.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContracts are a really bad fit for this. Chance of a random contract at the time you land, in the biome you want to do science in, at a suitable inclination etc etc is likely to be pretty low. And if past contracts are anything to go by they will be at locations that are just far enough apart to make it tedious by rover and inconvenient by lander/hopper. Contracts are like side quests, and I\u0027m talking changing a game mechanic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemeko","CreatedById":154318,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T01:50:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis are discussed some time ago\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72635-very-wip-syndics-geologyrocks-mod/\u0026amp;page=3\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72635-very-wip-syndics-geologyrocks-mod/\u0026amp;page=3\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2jq4od/kerbal_rock_collector/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2jq4od/kerbal_rock_collector/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanimations\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126976-things-that-never-made-it-to-the-gamethings-that-were-added-later/#comment-2307896\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126976-things-that-never-made-it-to-the-gamethings-that-were-added-later/#comment-2307896\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd with the physic part you can appreciate in this video that physics appear very near the object when the object is landed\u00A0\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Efrom minute\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan\u003E14:20\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E (it supposed that reduce the lag when you are landing)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3V6COGcLW4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3V6COGcLW4\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m try to make a mod myself for this but is very complicated (for my) and i\u0027m learning things about moding very slow\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-08T01:59:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2016 01:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Nemeko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
