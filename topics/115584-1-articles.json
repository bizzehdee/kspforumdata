(actually simpler idea)... Change your terrain settings until the part loads onto the surface correctly, then run your recovery mission, and then return your settings to their previous values.

The part will fall out of the sky and come to rest on the surface, where I can use a grabber to attach it to my lander (and, if I am _very_ careful with the throttle and the gravity is low enough, i can boost it to orbit), or\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

As soon as I get too close to it, it falls through the ground. And every time I switch to it, it get\u0027s stuck just a bit under the surface and falls again.

As soon as I dock the rover with the space tug, the whole ship gets uncontrollable. Not sure if this is a KSP bug or has something to do with MechJeb.

The spot was on the side of a hill, so the MPL must have spawned with one corner slightly clipped underground. As soon as it came into physics range, it would sink all the way up to the top wall. I could dock the claw to that wall, but the MPL would explode as soon as anything moved it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO, the correct action is to edit the .sfs file so that the module is sufficiently high up that it falls to the surface in a normal way.
