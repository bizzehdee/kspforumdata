Every time I try to collect the gravitational data in flight (even in the node requiring it), it tells me that data cannot be collected at this time. Jeb is busy flying the aircraft, so I brought along Bob, the scientist. My theory is that Bob is too terrified to do anything other than gawk in horror out of the cockpit windows, but when safely on the ground, he\u0027s OK. How can I motivate the adorable little Kerbal to do his job?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T06:51:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Gravioli detector only works while in space (or landed), so if you\u0027re in flight in the atmosphere you\u0027ll be out of luck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gravity scan contracts require orbital (or at least suborbital) scans.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T06:51:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGravity data should be collectible in any situation you\u0027re required to run it in.
