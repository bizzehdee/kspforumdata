Saitek software allways gave me headaches and I\u0027ve heard that this is more true with Windows 10. IIRC Scott Manley commented something about this in one of his videos.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, anyone here uses this joystick or any other from Saitek on Windows 10? How does it work? What did you do to get it working? Any side effects?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
