It had a huge impact on me, because it was the event that got me interested in meteorology, AND got me watching the Weather Channel nearly ALL the time, which... for an ADHD pre-teen, is quite an accomplishment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the research I\u0027ve been able to do, it was in 1989, probably in July, and a MASSIVE lightning storm rolled through my area and then went into NYC. It was significant enough that TWC had video footage of the storm. Lightning bolts literally every second, for up to 15 minutes in the dark, with the power out. Freaking incredible. Even now, the thought of how much electrical energy that was discharged in that event is mind-boggling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kmMango","CreatedById":109375,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T03:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook up time-lapse video of the April hailstorm in Lake Orion, Michigan.

I lived in Tornado Alley most of my life. My main memories of hail, however, are from when I was old enough to own my own house in Arlington, Texas. I owned that house for 3 years and put 2 roofs on it due to damage from baseball-sized hail. Fortunately, I moved elsewhere (and went back to renting) just before folks in that area had to start buying hail insurance separate from basic homeowner\u0027s, like with flood insurance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring one of these storms, the guy who lived across the street from me had like the 4th or 5th largest hailstone ever recorded hit his house. This was 15-20 baseball-sized hailstones welded together into a wad about like a rugby ball . It went through his roof (composite shingles on 1/4\u0022 plywood decking), through his ceiling (6\u0022 of insulation over sheetrock), through the coffee table in his living room (1/2\u0022 pine with oak veneer), not stopping until it reached the slab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your car looks like a golfball, you might live in Tornado Alley.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T04:36:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHail fell here in Pittsburgh today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for my first storm, just Google \u0022Blizzard of \u002777\u0022.
