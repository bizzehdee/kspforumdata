A lot depends on what you\u0027re doing- liquid hydrogen and\u00A0H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E(l) are the same thing, but you\u0027d use one in a sentence and the other in a chemical equation. If you\u0027re making a mod that\u0027s intended to lightly augment the stock game with some cryo engines then liquid hydrogen matches the stock liquid fuel well, but if you\u0027re going for a realism mod then calling it\u00A0H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E(l) makes more sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem gets worse when even the real versions have multiple names e.g. tritium or deuterium, which are hydrogen isotopes also called hydrogen-2 and hydrogen-3 but also have their own chemical symbols D and T plus their atomic symbols \u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003EH and \u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003EH as well. Burning pure liquid tritium in a\u00A0rocket would work just as well as regular liquid\u00A0hydrogen because chemically it\u0027s the same thing, but using hydrogen-1 in a fusion reaction is impossible because they\u0027re different at a nuclear physics level. And that\u0027s just the first element!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, having the same resources but different displayed names would be a big step in the right direction, with something somewhere that knew liquid hydrogen and\u00A0H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E(l) were the same thing but hydrogen, deuterium and tritium were different and showing the preferred names accordingly, would be a great way to split the difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis right here is a large reason towards why I made this thread.

This just might be my own personal bias because i use the Near Future Suite, but i think a case can be made for LH2, LCH4, and Chilled RP-1 as our fuels. Oxidizer would be LOX in all three, and a variety of lego \u003Cem\u003Eand procedural \u003C/em\u003Etankage would be provided with a stock fuel switch system so you don\u0027t need 4 different tanks for every fuel. Compact Fission and even large fusion reactors would be introduced later for the more exotic ships, and would reduce \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E spam that is the stock option currently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy these specifically? Why not some of the more exotic things? Because they provide a pivot for balance that isn\u0027t too hard to get your mind around, and really only requires 3 additional fuel types (Chilled RP-1 could just remain \u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022). LOX and RP-1 are the densest, and the fuel to dry mass ratio is around the middle. These are stable, reliable fuels; the \u0022Handyman\u0022 rocket in a way. LH2 and LOX trade raw power, density and volume for best-in-class vacuum performance and a much better fuel to dry mass ratio, but are difficult to keep cool, and require some special tankage to really get the best results (Again look at Nertea\u0027s stuff if you haven\u0027t already). LCH4 and LOX are between these two extremes, not as dense as LOX and RP-1, but with better vaccum performance and not too large of an increase in volume.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd these all directly feed into engine performance; RP-1 and LOX can create ludicriously powerful but relatively simple lifter engines. But with more dry mass, and less vaccum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E. LH2 and LOX engines are lighter, but no where near as good at sea level, and thus making poor lifter engines. LCH4 and LOX again straddle a middle ground here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2- A \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E system that makes more sense\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently the 1.25m \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E parts are some of the most curious things in the game, as they throw away the majority of Ore while making pitiful amoinsunts of fuel and never stabilizing thermally. This is on top of the drills only being usable in relatively rich deposits of Ore, and thus not suited for general purpose landers. While the 2.5M parts don\u0027t suffer from any of these issues, and are. So while the 1.25M parts shouldn\u0027t be just as good as the 2.5M \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E kit, they need to at least be usable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition it would be nice if the concentrations of components were weighted by biomes, but mostly abstracted away from the player. For instance; you should get an efficiency boost making LOX, CH4 and LH2 when drilling into Duna\u0027s caps since they\u0027re mostly CO2 and Water ices. With the rest of the fuels being produced at around the same rates, this means the player doesn\u0027t have to worry about the nitty-gritty of the chemistry involved unless they want to. And it can exploit intuition to make sense; cold things are better made in cold places etc. The API\u0027s exposed to modders would hook into these, and be exposed. So something like Rational Resources or the like could be made much easier, and have more control over the biomes and what occurs within them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#3- Colonies, Starships, Vehicles, OH MY!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nColonies must do more than simply be massive facilities to provide resources, indeed they must become staging grounds for our assault on the stars around us. But this also presents a problem, and i think it\u0027s widely overlooked for the most part. Which is that the interaction with these facilities, their staff and the vehicles they use must be reliable and predictable. One of the main reasons in KSP i don\u0027t faff about with large rovers or vehicles in general is that they aren\u0027t reliable in the slightest; a rover that seems as if it could be driven all day long one night may decide to send itself into orbit with no reasonable explanation upon loading that save the next morning. And the same science that could be gotten with this rover can just as easily be done, and be done faster with a mining lander and biome hopping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 does look like it\u0027s tackling this head-first; which is good. But it also means that i\u0027d like to see more purpose-built kit for Rovers and Vehicles in general. A small selection of bodies, perhaps a couple drivetrains and a decent assortment of wheels and tracks would make these much easier to build. And then you could have experiments that could be done specifically on or with vehicles, like the robot arms in KSP1 currently. Or even have biomes inside caves or other structures that couldn\u0027t be reached with a lander due to their topology inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese would also be related to the Resource system; though more tangentially than anything else. Fuel Cells would have different efficiencies and produce different byproducts depending on what they were fed with, and ofc the same volume vs density sliders would apply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-11T00:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI stand by my suggestion for a resource standard immediately out the gate, even if my enthusiasm has been tempered somewhat.
