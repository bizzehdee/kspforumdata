I was a bit surprised to discover this, as I thought that you would want a launch site as far from the equator as possible, to minimise siderial velocity (as you are launching north or south, the eastward rotation would need to be annuled), however Vandenburg is in California, one of America\u0027s southernmost states.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs my initial hypothesis wrong, or does the annulment of the rotational speed not matter as much as I thought?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T22:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECalifornia is simply where it CAN be due to other concerns.

A southern launch from Vandenberg heads out over the oceans. Most sites further north would either require the rocket to fly over land, or are in Alaska which adds some logistical issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T23:20:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunch sites are overwhelmingly sited for safety reasons, not orbital ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
