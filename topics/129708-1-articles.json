RCS Build Aid is another mod that\u0027s been needed to be stock for a LONG time, ever since docking became a thing. Increased use of Tweakables, and better attention to Aircraft. I REALLY think that your early tech should be basic airplane parts, a set of wings, non-retractable landing gear (and better landing gear too, the only retractable LG in the game has 0 give to it at all) and that would allow you early science.

attached parts not being shielded, I think).\u00A0 Not really sure what they were aiming for but lets face it FAR was already a good, intuitive model where things behaved realistically.\u00A0

\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes the response is \u0022Yes\u0022 and they devote effort toward that end, sometimes the result is \u0022No\u0022 and they let it slide for the sake of playability. \u00A0Of course, enjoyment is a subjective thing, and not every person will get the same degree of enjoyment out of various methods of modeling in the gameplay, hence moddability.
