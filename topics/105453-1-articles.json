I\u0027ve always enjoyed performing simulations outside the game in order to test/optimize my designs and to predict performance. Even though the old aero model was flawed, it was well understood and easy to simulate. I\u0027m now trying to get a handle on the new physics model so I can update my simulations. I\u0027ve performed several experiments to try to reconstruct what\u0027s going on, but I\u0027m seeing some things that don\u0027t quite add up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, the old model was internally inconsistent and couldn\u0027t have existed in real life. For example, at constant temperature we have the following relationships:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHg = RT = P/\u03C1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhere H is scale height, g is gravitational acceleration, R is specific gas constant, T is temperature, \u03C1 is density, and P is pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the old model we were given the following sea level values: H = 5000 m, g = 9.81 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, T = 293.15 K, \u03C1 = 1.223095 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, and P = 101325 Pa. With these numbers we see that Hg does not equal P/\u03C1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the first things I did was to test the conditions in the new model for internal consistency. Taking pressure, temperature and gravity measurements at different heights at the launch pad I was able to reconstruct the following sea level conditions: H = 6749 m, g = 9.81 m/s\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/span\u003E, T = 309.75 K, and P = 101325 Pa. (I can show the work if anyone wants to see it.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming that everything is internally consistent, I computed R and \u03C1 as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nR = (Hg)/T = (6749*9.81)/309.75 = 213.75 J/kg-K\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u03C1 = P/(RT) = 101325/(213.75*309.75) = 1.5304 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E2\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd from R we can compute the gas molecular weight, M = 38.9 kg/kmol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight away we see some issues. Squad has always made Kerbin very Earthlike in terms of its gravity and atmosphere, yet these values of R, \u03C1 and M are very un-Earthlike. I do not trust that these are the numbers actually being used in the game. In fact, I\u0027ve conducted some other experiments that suggest that the density of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is similar to the old model. I am therefore left to conclude that we again have some internal inconsistency in the way the atmosphere is modeled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis leaves me with a problem. It is difficult to reconstruct an atmospheric model if the atmosphere doesn\u0027t follow real-world laws. I\u0027m sure I can devise a model that can reasonably replicate the results that I\u0027m seeing in the game, but my task would be much easier if I could understand exactly what Squad has done and use their modeling method and equations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn additional to the above, I\u0027ve performed other experiments and measurements that have provided useful information, but I keep getting to a point where the computations stop making sense. For example, I dropped a barometer through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and recorded a series of pressure-height measurements. From this I was able to compute the scale height at various altitudes. From H, T can be computed if R is known. Although I don\u0027t trust the R value I computed earlier, using it does produce temperatures that are in line with what I expect. However, I also performed tests in which I experimentally derived the drag coefficients for some difference nose cones. In this case, using R = 213.75 produced wonky results. I got much more realistic and believable results using an Earthlike value of R = 287.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked through most of the game .config files hoping that I\u0027d find something that reveals how the game computes some of this stuff, but I found nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anybody here has any additional data or advice, it would be extremely helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E(EDIT) After making my original post I discovered that the flight stats in the debug menu includes \u0022external temperature\u0022. This a better means for measuring air temperature than the 2HOT thermometer. I\u0027ve already edited the above post to include some revised data. I\u0027ve also been able to collect some temperature-height data that should prove quite useful.

I\u0027m trying to see if I can return to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, somebody riddle me this - what\u0027s an engine that has a reasonable enough ISP to get off the surface at those pressures? The LV-T\u0027s were running at about an ISP of 64s on the surface. Great if you want your craft to fall over. I haven\u0027t tried the aerospike, but it\u0027s listed at 290s ASL, whereas the LV-T\u0027s were 280s and 270s. So I\u0027m not sure the Aerospike would fare much better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr is getting off Eve\u0027s surface just not possible any more with stock parts, unless you have a nearly weightless craft?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-BS\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
