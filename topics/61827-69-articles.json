I don\u0027t consider that \u0022cheating\u0022 because it\u0027s like running the autopilot inside a simulator which a real space program would have a chance to do. It only becomes \u0022cheating\u0022 if you then copy the effect of the test back into the main game, because then you\u0027re esentially just allowing yourself a \u0022revert to VAB\u0022 option through the back door (and I assume that you\u0027re playing hard mode to avoid \u0022revert to VAB\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always been annoyed that the main game doesn\u0027t have a \u0022simulator\u0022 mode.

I can see how this would be unintersting for the majority of the players, which can probably be considered pretty casual players. If you are more into roleplaying a space program, like a lot of people obviously are too, it suddenly becomes a much more interesting and necessary option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing a little restraint will not solve, but having it for real would be a bit more fun. I tend to use a seperate save and Hyperedit for this purpose, though even then some restraint is needed, as NASA had trouble properly testing supersonic Mars parachutes too. Some things are just hard to emulate in an Earth/Kerbin environment.
