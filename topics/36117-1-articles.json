Saw KSP on steam the day it came out and bought it instantly after seeing the screenshots. This is honestly the game I have been looking for for years. I\u0027m actually irked all those google searches I made never led me to this game, but better late then never.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this game and me have an unhealthy relationship. Not as unhealthy as some people and games as my girlfriend provides a certain level of entertainment this game can\u0027t. But unhealthy as in when we\u0027re not doing something or I\u0027m not at work this game all the time for over two months straight now.
