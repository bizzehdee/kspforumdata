The reason I am using this analogy is because the farther out the string is from your hand, the slower it has to travel to keep it\u0027s momentum going. Essentially this is true of the orbits. Think of the orbit plane as a string and your space craft and space station as individual points on the string. The current path is set to have your spacecraft catch up to the space station, however, you want the opposite. Adjust your orbit so the craft is farther out than the station, the farther out your craft\u0027s orbit the quicker the two will meet up. I wish you luck\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkStar","CreatedById":37056,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T01:16:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify, it takes longer to go on a larger orbit, and shorter to go on a smaller orbit. To rendezvous, you get either a larger or smaller orbit until you get close, and then you decelerate (relative to the target) so you can dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khan_Tiger","CreatedById":58098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T01:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many threads in the tutorial section that go into this in detail, the one that helped me the most was \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24670-Tutorial-Orbital-rendezvous-You-can-do-them!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24670-Tutorial-Orbital-rendezvous-You-can-do-them! \u003C/a\u003EThe biggest thing to remember is that spacecraft further from a planet are traveling slower, and thus you\u0027d want to raise your orbit so that the station can catch you. Maneuver nodes are incredibly helpful for this, play around with one and keep an eye on how various manipulations affect the target indicators.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mubzat","CreatedById":68092,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T01:24:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it is behind you then move into a slightly higher orbit and then use a maneuver node. I find that maneuver nodes are pretty handy for rendezvous (and pretty much everything else). Just mess around with the maneuver node, extending it both prograde and retrograde and try moving the node along your orbital path untill you find a close enough approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
