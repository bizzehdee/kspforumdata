Aerodynamic failures will mean learning to overcome new challenges, which is a big plus. It\u0027s also more realistic and more \u0022Kerbal\u0022 at the same time.\n\nWell, there\u0027s realistic and then there\u0027s realistic. Aero failures the way FAR did it is actually fake: real life aero failures come from when the aerodynamic forces overload the *natural structural integrity of parts and joints*. KSP already has structural integrity - very extreme integrity (although almost no stiffness). In theory, one can tear apart a craft using FAR with aero failures off, which would represent the natural failure of these parts. However, since the stock integrity is so insane, it\u0027s *almost* impossible to do so (I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever managed it, but others say they have). Instead, Ferram wedged in a bit of code to cause things to fail in a manner that\u0027s more in-line with real life craft - but that\u0027s now violating the natural structural integrity of the stock engine.\n\nOr, to put it differently and shorter-ly, it sacrificed internal consistency to model real life, which is not always the best course of action. KSP rockets are held together by a very elastic version of the strong nuclear force, except when exposed to air...?\n\nAlso a significant percentage of the community objected rather violently to aero failures, which is part of the reason why NEAR exists (even though there\u0027s a configuration option in FAR to disable it).\n\n(Of course maybe I\u0027m being pessimistic, and that the truth of the matter is they\u0027ve fixed the structural integrity issue so it is both consistent and realistic, and the aero failures are simply a natural consequence of that)"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T17:02:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s a lot of \u0022Karbonite\u0022 on Eve.
