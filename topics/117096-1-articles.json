Similarly, orbits with periapses that dip into an atmosphere survive far too long.\n\nYou can directly calculate a 2-body-conic position given just the conic, start position and timestamp, and there\u0027s any number of at least roughly right direct approximations for per-orbit energy loss by say entry velocity and periapsis and cross-section. Seems to me reasonable and cheap implementations of those could make the sim much more satisfying for me, and I think for anybody who\u0027s already got some grasp of the basics, that I\u0027m in here begging to have them implemented. Pretty please? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
