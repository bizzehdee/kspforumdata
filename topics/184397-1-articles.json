If any of these happened, our society would not be able to prepare or properly respond in time. We spend too much time in the deliberation and are too stand off ish. More likely to take idle, or not decisive action to ensure we take the most efficient and cost effective route. Despite that a faster, and more direct answer, would solve it vastly faster than taking time to observe, deliberate, plan, and then execute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs another channel pointed out- just the time it would take to prep a mission, especially when it\u0027s as far along as Earth orbit, would take a internationally coordinated and assisted venture to just get a rocket ready to respond. Much less make it safe to fly. The moments with Teddy Sanders, the Director of NASA in \u003Cem\u003EThe Martian\u003C/em\u003E ring to mind as he asks \u0022is there any other way to bide more time?\u0022 after skipping vastly important safety checks.
