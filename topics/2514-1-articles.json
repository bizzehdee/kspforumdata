Running on a new, highly potent prototype fuel (Pentakis(Tetroxotribullshitide)Unobtainium, or Ub(O\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003EBs\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E)\u003Csub\u003E5\u003C/sub\u003E), this thing is guaranteed to lift any heavyweight rocket you can strap it on. Burning for a vigorous 80 seconds at full force, you no longer have to worry about getting your craft airborne! Also included is a generic heavy decoupler, for all those times you needed a strong decoupler (it is quite weighty, though). Not recommended for small crafts. Comes in three parts: adapter, fuel tank and engine. Ignition is triggered by a small charge of explosives, after which the heat of the reaction itself keeps the fuel burning. As such (and as any good booster should), it is impossible to completely shut off the thrust, but it has a wide operable range. PS: structural legs are recommended as engine only has a precarious balance and WILL fall aside if not fully stable. Point is moot if number of engines is equal or superior to three. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21447217/PFire.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGet the order forms here!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:48px;\u0022\u003EPPS: You\\\u0027re more than welcome to retexture it.
