You will need enough radiators to support 1% of reactor power. This should keep the reactor core hot but generating a minimum of extra heat. When you want to make maneuvers, bring the throttle up - in engine mode the reactor\u00A0will select whichever is higher, the main engine throttle setting or the reactor power setting, and adjust itself to match. So if you set the power level to 1%, then bring the throttle to 90%, the reactor will spool to 90%. When you cut power back to 0%, it\u0027ll return to that 1% mode.
