Sandbox shoul stay as it is (sandbox is as difficult as you want to make it). In career mode difficulty levels would make sense as most people are going to buy the game and start in career mode it makes sense for people dont get overwhelmed by lack of cash etc. I also agree with the \u0022customizable Difficulty\u0022. So at the start of the career you decide how hard it is. Starting cash, science gain, available parts etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheres not alot you can do without screwing up the game however. You shouldnt be able to pick \u0022EZ mode\u0022 and have every engine with a surface isp of a bajillion and twr of 56. Maybe things like re entry damage, realisic aero dynamics, scale of the star system ect. You should be able to turn these on and off at will (yes you can do it with mods but not all people buying a fully released game will want to mod it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIN a sense, though the Realism panel of Microsoft Flight Simulator is probably a better thing to base it off, in my opinion.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I havent played flight simulator this is the sort of thing i was trying suggest \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-01T13:02:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2013 01:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by vetrox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T14:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think Mechjeb will ever become stock.
