It has been over six and a half decades since the disastrous Atomic Conflict. Kerbal society has experienced a strong recovery. Under the aegis of the United Nations of Kerbin\u0027s loose world government, economic growth and technological progress are at an all-time high. Global trade is vigorous. Illness, injustice, crime, and all sorts of wrongs and problems are on the decline thanks to these conditions. Travel has been mastered by Kerbalkind, thanks to the combustion engine. With it and the pneumatic wheel, land travel is no longer exhausting and timeconsuming. With it and the propeller, sea travel has become a major fixture of world trade and transport; even the skies have been conquered as air travel is commonplace thanks to the combustion engine.

It has been subject to the wandering speculations of dreamers and discussion of scholars since time immemorial; but it has been so far inaccessible, and many say impossible, for Kerbals. However, with great expectations, the United Nations of Kerbin, that same government which has spearheaded the effort to rebuild global Kerbal civilization, will embark on a grand effort to reach out to this final frontier. Those brave engineers, scientists, and pilots who it falls to to push the last frontier beyond Kerbin are technically called Kerbonauts, but they are much more popularly known as...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESPACE KERBALS.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Csub\u003E(1) Kerbin Combat Century, signifying the number of years after the Atomic War.\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(This time, I\u0027m confident I have what it takes to go through with this.

But some last-minute research led Gene and Wernher Kerman to convince the UNK\u0027s administration to push it back in exchange for making Summit-I more ambitious. \u0022Just a few more modifications,\u0022 Gene pleaded with the bureaucrats, \u0022and we can take it outside the atmosphere entirely! See, this design, although theoretical, has a Delta-Vee of about two thousand four hundred..\u0022 As a result, its launch date was pushed back by 41 days of hectic research and 8 days of rushed manufacture and assembly. Thus, it was in the late afternoon of Day 49 of 0067 that it actually flew. Jebediah, Pilot Zero, the world\u0027s first Space Kerbal and darling of media the world over, was selected. Summit-I was a small, unassuming, suborbital rocket, designed simply to defeat gravity enough to reach space for a few fleeting minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220ySEGqC.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0ySEGqC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Roger. Summit-I, you\u0027re good to go!\u0022 Gene\u0027s voice boomed, but audibly crackling from the cheap speakers. Under it, other Mission Control personnel, media personalities, and spectators could be heard shouting phrases of encouragement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb simply smiled, hit the engine ignition key to his right and floored the lever--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IRkJK5I.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IRkJK5I.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first feeling he had was a roar outside of the rocket and the G-forces, pressing him down. It was like having another entire Kerbal sitting on his chest. However, he retained control of the stick and could still see the navball clearly. \u0026gt;BANG\u0026lt;. The roar mostly died away: he had breached the sound barrier. The air around the rocket burned bright red and he felt as if the entire capsule was warming up. The ascent was rather touch-and-go: alarms whined that the fins around the barrel of the rocket itself were starting to overheat. He let up on the throttle and the feeling of pressure vanished. Soon, the flames did as well. He could hear Gene\u0027s voice crackle with a triumphant tone over his helmet speaker. \u0022..passed the atmosphere and Tracking says he\u0027s got an apoapsis of 222 kilometers!

He simply embraced the feelings of weightlesness around him. However, another, tense, harsh, accented voice sounded over the speakers. \u0022Du.. Your apoepsess is too high for ze kraft, Jeb! Push eet down!\u0022 Wernher. \u003Cem\u003EHe\u0027s probably right, too,\u003C/em\u003E Jeb recalled. \u003Cem\u003EThere\u0027s a limit to how fast the Summit\u0027s capsule can slow down. Remember your training. \u003C/em\u003EHe used the Summit\u0027s reaction wheels to orient the vessel down and burned with what little fuel he had left. After he had spent it all, he decoupled the booster. \u003Cem\u003EI\u0027ve done everything I can.

He started thinking of what would happen if he had died, but brushed it off. The actual reentry was incredibly intense: it took him almost the entire atmosphere to slow down enough to use his chutes. It took another tense moment for them to reef open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QMTGHtO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QMTGHtO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aTE6JkI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aTE6JkI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter another seemingly endless minute, Summit-I\u0027s capsule splashed down softly in the Meridian Sea.

Aaaaargh, why must it be zo diffikult to reach orbit with this teknology?\u0022 Wernher sat frustratedly at his desk, throwing away design after design. The 3500 m/s limit was seemingly impossible to reach with what little talent the UNK had mustered for the space program. In addition, it would be twelve days before the launchpad could be expanded to accomodate larger and heavier vehicles. Adding that to the construction time, it would likely be two weeks, at a minimum, until the Hoop program could begin. Jeb was in recovery. Although he was almost completely cool and unfazed, Walt had his hands full trying to play down the narrowly-averted catastrophe and putting the spotlight on the expert flying of Pilot Number Zero. Limitations whapped him at every frustrating turn. The UNK\u0027s bureaucracy, despite all their talk, simply didn\u0027t want to commit so many resources to them. The program had been undermanned and underfunded from the start, and Wernher felt as though it would only keep getting worse as more demand was placed on the program.

Only one flight, and the Summit program had already ended. The Hoop program was the next big thing, and the media were all over it once again thanks to the tidbits of information Walt parceled out to them during the break. The R\u0026amp;D department had designed a slew of new equipment and was preparing for another round of work. One of the new engines, the LV-909 \u0027Terrier\u0027, was incorporated into the Hoop\u0027s design. All Hoop rockets would use a standard configuration with minimal change, and thanks to this LV-909 and the BACC solid booster, Wernher and his team had been able to draft a new design which had plenty of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to get to Kerbin orbit, perform operations there, and return.

He\u0027s already a spacekerb! Surely it wouldn\u0027t hurt to let me have the mission just this once?\u0022 Derek curtly replied, wearing a frown. \u0022Look, I don\u0027t give a mulch about those lines Walt gave the media about you. Gene decided Jeb needs more flight time, Jeb will get his extra flight time. You\u0027ll get to go on the second Hoop flight and then you\u0027ll get to be the biggest girl on all of Kerbin and eat up all the attention. That\u0027s what Gene decided.\u0022 \u0022Bu--!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore Valentina or Derek could speak again, Linus barged into the conversation and addressed Val. \u0022Actually, it\u0027s because of that new ranking system they came up with.\u0022 \u0022The new... ranking system?\u0022 she asked, now confused instead of angry. Derek was visibly frowning, but he didn\u0027t interrupt. \u0022A systemic way of-- nevermind. See, Gene and some of my neuroscientist colleagues were in a brainstorming session about a Munth ago and they realized something: it\u0027s possible to quantify a Kerbal\u0027s exact experience with five discrete rankings. Each successive ranking means that the Kerbal\u0027s acquired new skills in their field. And we also found that different types of missions will give the pilots different amounts of experience.\u0022 \u0022That doesn\u0027t make much sense,\u0022 Val was almost calm now, quiet and nearly muttering. \u0022I mean, acquiring new skills hasn\u0027t really been observed to be a clear-cut process..\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus replied, \u0022It is. That\u0027s what we\u0027ve found. It\u0027s a little hard to believe, but it\u0027s true. It\u0027s a pretty revolutionary finding, too. Behavioral scientists, educators, and other neurologists are gonna be eating this up for years and figuring out everything it implies. Bottom line: Gene wants to get Jeb and you to one-star ratings, that\u0027s why he\u0027s holding you both out for orbital missions. We think orbital missions will get you up to about equal par.\u0022 Valentina and Derek had been completely sidetracked by this talk and had almost forgotten about their spat when Derek said, trying to reinsert himself into the discussion. \u0022Yeah. Bottom line, Val: You\u0027re not getting on Hoop-I. Just live with it for awhile, you\u0027ll get your fame almost immediately afterward.\u0022 She was still annoyed, but was now more focused on Linus\u0027 explanation than her previous conversation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDerek was struggling to get a single word in sideways, but Linus continued, \u0022Oh, and Derek? Gene wants you to round up a couple more Kerbonauts for us. And he wants to expand the skillsets of Bill and Bo- I mean, Robert and William, too. We\u0027ll come up with something so they can accompany pilots on flights.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe lowered his voice to a whisper and addressed Valentina. \u0022And one more thing, Val: don\u0027t tell anyone I told you, but you\u0027re on the special shortlist for any Mun or Minmus missions.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n****\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022AH!\u0022 The young engineer lost his balance for a moment and hobbled in pain. Somehow, he\u0027d wandered too close to the rocket again, and his side had painfully grazed the metal skirt above the BACC\u0027s nozzle, again. He glanced up at the half-finished guideframe over the first decoupler in frustration. \u0022Crud. They don\u0027t pay me enough for this...\u0022 He sulked quietly over to the other side of the building as one of the R\u0026amp;D staff stood in front of the rocket, ticking off boxes on a clipboard. Far above ground level, other engineers were starting work on the second stage. Unbeknownst to most of the engineers working on the Hoop-I, some time (actually, all told, only about three hours) had been saved by hurriedly refurbishing the capsule and parachute from Summit-I.

They had finally done it. At first, it looked as though Hoop-I was going to take six arduous days to finish, but the administration had managed to pull in extra equipment and manpower, enough to pull the ETA down to four days. Then Jeb\u0027s speedy recovery finished. (they\u0027re durable, those kerbals!) Three more days of work after that, plus Command\u0027s decision to finish Hoop-II before launching added up. It was Day 99, late in the afternoon once again. The spectator\u0027s seats a decent distance from the launchpad were completely filled to the brim once again. The space program\u0027s tradition of not using countdowns wore a little on the audience. It was completely unexpected when Gene\u0027s voice abruptly crackled over the speakers. \u0022Hoop-I, you\u0027re good to go!\u0022 Everyone immediately dropped whatever they were doing and turned all their attention to the pad. A moment later, Jebediah hit the IGNITION button- and he was greeted by the roar and acceleration instantly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/epUX2KR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022epUX2KR.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, it was noticeably less than previously. As previously, however, he managed to retain control of the stick and start his pitch-and-roll program. After less than two minutes, the first stage abruptly died, and he immediately ejected it and began with the second stage, which had much less thrust. However, the Apoapsis counter still rose fairly fast, and he eventually established a 76km one, at which point he cut off the engines and coasted briefly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZS5pjnX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZS5pjnX.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, he was still dangerously approaching that apoapsis, and so his insertion burn was about 30 seconds early and aimed slightly upward. The LV-909\u0027s push was much gentler than the other two he\u0027d experienced. Carefully shepherding his thrust upward, he climbed steadily up, steadily up, steadily up... until the periapsis counter registered 79.8km, to loud cheers from Mission Control. Some tiny recess of his brain breathed a sigh of relief. The hardest part of the mission was over.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe simply let go and floated lazily above Kerbin, becoming a shining beacon of hope and opportunity to Kerbals all over the world. (At least, those who were close enough to the equator or had powerful telescopes.) He would go on to make three and a half revolutions around Kerbin, feeding the Mission Control types some words on occasion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N4lZGHl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022N4lZGHl.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbout 58 minutes later, dawn broke for the third time. A strange place, Kerbin orbit was. However, it was time for him to return. He had done everything he possibly could and had set an endurance record of an hour at this point. The boredom was about to erupt. He flipped the tiny rocket some, ejected the spent stage once it was out of fuel, and simply waited. Eventually, he hit the atmosphere hard and fast enough that air compression created a tiny lightshow. If any of the inhabitants of a minor Forseti town had been looking up, they had seen him reenter, a shooting star far above the clouds.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wDAnc1K.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wDAnc1K.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEventually, his shallow trajectory slowed him down to the point he could activate his parachute safely, roughly five thousand meters above the ground. Around airplane altitude, now that it occurred to him. Eventually, it reefed open. He slowed. No noise, not even the recovery boat\u0027s, just those of the sea and what might have been the second stage\u0027s remnant slamming into it. He drifted lazily, lazily, lazily down until he splashed calmly into the Westernmost Ocean. He smirked to himself. He\u0027d done it yet again. A Kerbal had reached orbit and returned safely. It was the true beginning of the Space Program.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OGVFdJP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OGVFdJP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElJugador","CreatedById":18783,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-02T20:48:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Sorry if my pace is a bit fast.

Just when it looked like they were going to finish Hoop-II on time, the management had concluded the BACC wasn\u0027t powerful enough to loft all the extra scientific equipment and drogue chutes the capsule was carrying and ordered the installation of a new, liquid fuel-based booster. Engineering Test Article 01 looked really bizarre even on paper and no one wanted to even think about building the thing yet. Some inexplicable requests had come in, and the engineer just couldn\u0027t understand why part manufacturers had suddenly become so obsessed with testing their equipment in weird and inapplicable situations. What use did one have for an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E in orbit? Either they were simply being diligent and trying to be ready for any situation, or they were just stupid, insane, or stupidly insane, or all of them at once. Whatever the reason, the rigors of their demands made for very strange-looking Engineering Test Articles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n****\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElJugador","CreatedById":18783,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-02T22:12:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEpisode 03: A Slightly Bigger Hoop(e)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHoop-II had been pushed back to the late morning of Day 107, 0067 by, well, everything, it seemed. Delay after delay after delay had resulted in that. But Valentina was finally ready. The attention placed on her nearly exceeded Jeb\u0027s. Truth be told, the media was mostly interested because she was the program\u0027s only female Space Kerbal, and how this reflected on the UNK\u0027s social policy, but she still soaked it up while she could. Eventually, it was Launch Day. The bleachers at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E were full once again, only this time the audience was majority female.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1zkH3j6.png\u0022 alt=\u00221zkH3j6.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHer ascent was fairly unremarkable, if a little marginal. It turned out that the Hoop Block A/B, as they were now known, were quite ponderous launch vehicles. Takeoff was slow and she, once again, had to depend on the second stage to complete her ascent. She managed to establish a 92x92 km orbit almost perfectly on injection, setting a record that placed her, at least for a time, above even Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EmhIgIs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EmhIgIs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow came the true purpose of Hoop-II: the science. R\u0026amp;D still had a huge slew of new parts due to come in in several Munths, but they had already warned they were about to hit a wall as to what they could do without actual rocketry experience and better facilities. While an upgrade, in terms of funding, was still very far out of the program\u0027s reach, there were a few easy Science! experiments in reach inside Kerbin Orbit.
