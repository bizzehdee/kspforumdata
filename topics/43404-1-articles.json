Fortunately rover suffered only minor damage: some auxillary and/or backed up parts fell off but everything critical is intact, so I can continue my journey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I thought that it whould be nice if Kerbals could take some spare parts with them and attach them to vehicles \u0022in field\u0022. Seeing KAS mod I assume that it is technically possible - KAS allows to attach ports to ships in \u0022run-time\u0022, so there should not be any problem to attach, say, RCS ports, small fuel tank or spotlight. What do you think about this idea? Maybe even KAS might be repurposed for this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mushroomman","CreatedById":236,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T20:52:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a mod which did exactly that.
