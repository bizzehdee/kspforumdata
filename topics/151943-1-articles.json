I have been playing the KSP demo for several years now. I\u00A0have been to the Mun many times while watching others play the full version on YouTube. I am on a limited budget so I rarely buy new (unused) games especially online. The last major PC game I bought was Minecraft back in 2011. I finally bought Kerbal Space Program about a week ago and it has consumed every free moment of this entire week. I absolutely love exploration games and have spent hundreds of hours playing Minecraft,\u00A0StarMade, Silent Hill and the like. When I was a kid I spent just as many hours exploring the real backwoods of\u00A0Crawfordville, Florida. I hope to have a great time exploring the KSP forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-13T00:12:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello SolitaryPoet and welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure you\u0027ll have a great time exploring our fine community.\u00A0 Glad to have you aboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-13T03:26:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour purchase will prove to be a splendid investment. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-13T03:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome!
