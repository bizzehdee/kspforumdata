Having this weird issue with my RCS thrusters. Have 4 of them set in quad sym around lander can, but for some reason every time I try to translate for docking, all 4 thrusters fire and I end up going nowhere. I\u0027m using standard controls wasd and am in LIN docking mode. I tried the same positioning on a tester rocket and they work properly, but just not on my miner/lander.
