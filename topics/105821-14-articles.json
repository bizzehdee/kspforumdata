I just finished making my own stock SAS menu handler based on the code Lybodo posted a few weeks ago. For selecting SAS modes, I wanted to avoid the cumbersome \u0022scroll though and select\u0022 type of menu, so I made one that assigns a button to each mode.

It doesn\u0027t render on external parts, and you wouldn\u0027t be able to interact with those parts if it did. I won\u0027t say it\u0027s impossible, but it\u0027s not a priority for me at this time (besides, I\u0027m not a modeler, so I wouldn\u0027t be able to make the panels in the first place - I\u0027d have to find someone who could make them).\n\nSo, the quoted post is from a few pages back, but I was doing some reading here and had to make a comment on this one. There is one way you could add panels and such for something like a command seat by creating a completely transparent IVA scene for that command seat, using parameters that specify that the helmet is required within, and then adding some props to the front of the IVA scene that would correspond to the seat and whatnot. Visually, you\u0027d still just have a Kerbal in a command seat, but in the configs you\u0027d actually turn the command seat into a pod with an IVA. lo-fi has done something similar with his latest pod which is a sort of roll cage, extremely minimal, looks like a basic part with a command seat inside it, but it actually uses a transparent pod. That\u0027s the closest way I can think to have a sorta-external RPM prop. At the very least, you\u0027d be able to command your craft from a first person view from the command seat and the monitors would still show data when outside of the IVA scene.\n\nAnother idea would be to create an empty (more or less invisible) pod with an IVA that simply contains a large monitor that is placed on the craft radially. You\u0027d still have to have a kerbal inside it somehow, and functionality would only be in the IVA view, but you could probably hide that part of the scene inside the parent craft and leave a copy of the monitor displaying (really large like) on the outside of the craft, thus creating a relatively easy way to display information on the outside of the craft. Yeah, it\u0027s a rather weird idea, but it could work possibly. Alternatively, maybe you could have an internal camera and use something like that CCTV mod to display the camera on one of its large external monitors with the camera itself aligned directly with one of the IVA panels. That might work."},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T20:50:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is my first time ever writing code for KSP, or C# for that matter.

They\u0027re the craft\u0027s surface prograde vector displayed on the heading strip (at the top) and onto the pitch ladder (in the middle region). They\u0027re not correct, as far as AoA and sideslip are concerned, since they\u0027re the surface velocity vector projected onto a coordinate basis that oriented to surface \u0022up\u0022 (where AoA and sideslip \\*should\\* be based on the craft\u0027s local orientation). Maybe the shorter answer, if that\u0027s too muddled: The one in the center region shows which direction the craft is headed - if it\u0027s above the horizon, you\u0027re climbing; if it\u0027s below the horizon, you\u0027re descending.\n\nIf someone more familiar with heads-up displays wants to suggest what they should do (or if they even belong in the first place), I\u0027d be willing to make changes."},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T14:16:42Z","Content":"Fixes a number of issues with the new text renderer (which unfortunately re-introduced the harder-to-read HUD text).
