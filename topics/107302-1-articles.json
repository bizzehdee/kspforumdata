Upon attaching to an asteroid with a claw and capturing it in an orbit, without fail, I find that all vessels I load from then on out experience violent phantom forces when coming out of on-rails time warp, which rips them into their component parts quite handily. It\u0027s not just the ship that\u0027s captured the asteroid that\u0027s affected, either; any vessel (newly launched or existing) will break up the second time warp is used after an asteroid capture. I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s a known fix for this issue, as it kind of makes the game completely and utterly unplayable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mLegion","CreatedById":69285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:33:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESame problem here, i undocked my mining rig to move it to the other side of the asteroid, when i timewarped as soon as timewarp ended my pod became fixed in place causing the rest of my craft to rip off of it.
