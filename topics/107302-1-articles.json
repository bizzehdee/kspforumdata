Upon attaching to an asteroid with a claw and capturing it in an orbit, without fail, I find that all vessels I load from then on out experience violent phantom forces when coming out of on-rails time warp, which rips them into their component parts quite handily. It\u0027s not just the ship that\u0027s captured the asteroid that\u0027s affected, either; any vessel (newly launched or existing) will break up the second time warp is used after an asteroid capture. I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s a known fix for this issue, as it kind of makes the game completely and utterly unplayable."},{"CreatedByName":"mLegion","CreatedById":69285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:33:31Z","Content":"Same problem here, i undocked my mining rig to move it to the other side of the asteroid, when i timewarped as soon as timewarp ended my pod became fixed in place causing the rest of my craft to rip off of it. After using quickload the asteroid seemed to be a fixed distance from my ship, if i throttled up the engine the asteroid (visually) remained at the exact same distance no matter what even though the orbital view showed my orbit changing.\n\nmy log ended up 4MB of this:\n\n[LOG 15:39:43.070] Packing Asteroid Refinery2 for orbit\n\n[EXC 15:39:43.071] NullReferenceException\n\n UnityEngine.Transform.TransformDirection (Vector3 direction)\n\n ActiveJoint.getControlOrt (Vector3 refAxis, PartSpaceMode mode)\n\n ActiveJoint.applyCoordsUpdate ()\n\n ActiveJoint.onPartPack (.Part p)\n\n EventData\u00601[Part].Fire (.Part data)\n\n Part.Pack ()\n\n Vessel.GoOnRails ()\n\n OrbitPhysicsManager.LateUpdate ()\n\n[LOG 15:39:43.102] Packing Asteroid Refinery2 for orbit\n\n[EXC 15:39:43.104] NullReferenceException\n\n UnityEngine.Transform.TransformDirection (Vector3 direction)\n\n ActiveJoint.getControlOrt (Vector3 refAxis, PartSpaceMode mode)\n\n ActiveJoint.applyCoordsUpdate ()\n\n ActiveJoint.onPartPack (.Part p)\n\n EventData\u00601[Part].Fire (.Part data)\n\n Part.Pack ()\n\n Vessel.GoOnRails ()\n\n OrbitPhysicsManager.LateUpdate ()\n\nrepeated over and over.\n\nI don\u0027t have the log anymore, i only had this saved to google it."},{"CreatedByName":"WissNX01","CreatedById":118195,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T13:30:54Z","Content":"Had a similar instance yesterday when one of my space stations exploded when I approached.
