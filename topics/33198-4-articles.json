Build a rigid but light structure that is buoyant and just float down to the surface, using small thrusters (probably ducted fans to save propellant) for maneuvering, you could scan a reasonably large stretch of surface before you had to turn back, and potentially scoop up/drill up a sizeable sample cache. When it\u0027s time to go back, use the buoyancy to climb as high as possible, then deploy an inflatable balloon to climb even higher.
