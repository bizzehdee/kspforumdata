We know that with manned vessels we can choose the option to observe things like a planet or a moon to gather science data. This however is not the case with unmanned vessels as they don\u0027t seem to have this option. However adding a camera in the game will allow them to gather this information. Do you guys think this would be a good idea? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note: This might be available as a mod but I\u0027m a person who wants to play the game vanilla and there are other people who want to stay vanilla too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
