I apologize if it\u0027s the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile highlighting the MK1-2 pod in a dark area, I noticed some artifacts on the texture. The kind you usually find on an image after an agressive compression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a short investigation, I noticed some on other parts too. In fact, most of them. It\u0027s not very noticeable on dark parts, but it looks weird on light ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI checked the texture quality in the game settings (everything is set to maximum quality), and re-downloaded the game once, to be sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, I replaced some faulty textures with their counterparts from 0.90, converted to DDS with DDS4KSP. It solved the issue. Unfortunately, new parts textures can\u0027t be replaced this way, so it\u0027s only a partial workaround.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is the conversion to DDS textures has been a bit agressive. But then again, I need confirmation this problem is not only on my side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MK1-2 pod artifacts are quite noticeable, but I replaced the texture before taking a screenshot, so here\u0027s one with a stock fuel tank;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xGyBFBa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xGyBFBa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any answer on this, it\u0027s one of those \u0022can\u0027t be unseen\u0022 problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Forgot to mention, both textures for this screenshot have the same resolution, and the file size is the same (1366KB).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T02:27:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 02:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lilleman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
