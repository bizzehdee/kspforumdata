I apologize if it\u0027s the case.\n\nWhile highlighting the MK1-2 pod in a dark area, I noticed some artifacts on the texture. The kind you usually find on an image after an agressive compression.\n\nAfter a short investigation, I noticed some on other parts too. In fact, most of them. It\u0027s not very noticeable on dark parts, but it looks weird on light ones.\n\nI checked the texture quality in the game settings (everything is set to maximum quality), and re-downloaded the game once, to be sure.\n\nThen, I replaced some faulty textures with their counterparts from 0.90, converted to DDS with DDS4KSP. It solved the issue. Unfortunately, new parts textures can\u0027t be replaced this way, so it\u0027s only a partial workaround.\n\nMy guess is the conversion to DDS textures has been a bit agressive. But then again, I need confirmation this problem is not only on my side.\n\nThe MK1-2 pod artifacts are quite noticeable, but I replaced the texture before taking a screenshot, so here\u0027s one with a stock fuel tank;\n\n![xGyBFBa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xGyBFBa.jpg)\n\nThanks in advance for any answer on this, it\u0027s one of those \u0022can\u0027t be unseen\u0022 problem.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, both textures for this screenshot have the same resolution, and the file size is the same (1366KB).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T02:27:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 02:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lilleman**"}]}
