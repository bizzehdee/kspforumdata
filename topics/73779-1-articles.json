The asteroid is coming in on about a 30 degree inclination and has a 20,000 km periapsis. This pass will then send it on to Duna (I already arranged that assist with a tug) and I want to send up a ship with more hardware for the Duna mission. The ship I\u0027m sending is currently at my space station, in a 255 km equatorial orbit. I\u0027d rather meet the asteroid during the Kerbin flyby so I can return the current crew and science while I\u0027m at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first idea was a prograde burn opposite the ascending node to give me an intersect at the ascending node, to make the plane change as cheap as possible. Unfortunately by the time I get to apoapsis the asteroid will be well past the intersect, making this not an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next idea was this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nNZ5wn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5557/14315187545_54174f5ab3_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002214315187545_54174f5ab3_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA plane change in my current orbit, then a prograde burn to get an intersect at the asteroid\u0027s periapsis. This will work, but gives me some huge burns - 1500 m/s for the plane change and 600 to raise apoapsis, and that\u0027s not even counting what I\u0027ll need to match speeds with the asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have something like 5000 m/s of delta-V, so I could go this way, but I can\u0027t help feeling I should be able to do it more efficiently. Plus I\u0027d like to keep my fuel for pushing the rock around when it gets to Duna. I\u0027ve not been able to figure out a specific approach though to get said hoped-for more efficient intersect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-01T02:42:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2014 02:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cantab\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnswered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T22:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all you should launch into orbit with corresponding inclination. That will solve you a lot of problems and save a lot of dv for free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EIf nothing can be done about it at the moment, a good option might be to raise your apoapsis in the direction of your inclination point with the asteroid and change your inclination from there. That\u0027ll cost you probably less dv than doing so in LKO. And you can use that extended orbit to plan the rendezvous.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: okay I see you already ruled out that option. You can of course raise your orbit just a bit, not all the way to the asteroid trajectory. That can be done faster.

By waiting many orbits before making that first burn I can get an intersect of a few hundred km around the asteroid\u0027s periapsis, which I\u0027ll fine tune on approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the common target orbit of 20,000 km circular with matched inclinations, this takes around 1100 m/s of delta-V, compared to 2300 m/s for the method I showed previously, and 2800 m/s if I tried to do a single burn from LKO to put apoapsis at the asteroid periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nP4UwS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2898/14316129494_8aa762b98f_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002214316129494_8aa762b98f_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nP4UwS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThat\u0027s more like it\u003C/a\u003E by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/people/52548818@N05/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecantab314\u003C/a\u003E, on Flickr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact it looks like in this case I\u0027ve got away without too much cost from not launching directly to inclination.
