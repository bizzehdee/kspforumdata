Higher temperatures result in higher density altitude (i.e. lower air density). Takeoff, landing and climb performance are a function of density altitude because lift is directly proportional to air density. For example, you need a longer runway to takeoff at high density altitudes than you do at sea level. Compare runway lengths in high elevation cities like Denver, CO or Calgary, AB to those in JFK or LAX. They\u0027re about 4000 feet longer in Calgary and Denver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemperature also affects the speed of sound. Airliners typically cruise at a mach number rather than an indicated airspeed. Higher temperatures result in higher speed of sound, although the effect isn\u0027t that significant at typical cruising altitudes. The speed of sound at 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C is 340 m/s, while the speed of sound at -57\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C is 295 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-03T20:39:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2013 08:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded sentence about runway lengths.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T21:44:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt quite measurably affects performance, as PakledHostage described. Everything from lift, to engine efficiency, to thrust from turbines or props will depend on outside temperature, among other factors. Even the way your air speed indicator works will depend on temperature, because it uses ram pressure, and that will depend on density. But variations in temperature do not really affect the way you fly all that much. If you are supposed to climb to a specific altitude, you always go by pressure altitude, which is what your instruments measure. If you need to go at certain air speed, you use Indicated Air Speed. Amount of lift and IAS are proportional to air density in the same way, so you don\u0027t have to worry about stalling at a lower IAS on a warm day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty much the only effect of density you are likely to really notice is the landing and takeoff roll distances.

Many, many accidents have happend this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn jet aircraft, air density also affects the balanced field length because of the detrimental effects of high density altitude on performance. Jets are required to be able to reach V1 (loosely defined as the speed at which they can safely continue a takeoff after an engine failure) and then stop again without going off the end of the runway. Wind affects balanced field length, but so do factors such as braking action (i.e. how slippery the runway is).

The U2 is a subsonic airplane however, and the speed of sound is basically a function of air temperature not density. Eventually the aircraft reaches an altitude where it must fly at high subsonic Mach numbers to avoid stalling. But subsonic aircraft are generally not designed to approach the speed of sound. They have an MMO above which they may encounter all sorts of nasty effects (i.e. flutter, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-04T15:47:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2013 03:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eremoved some non pertinent information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T06:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Westair: I just realised that I misread your post.

That was the result of a structural failure of the pylon, not an engine failure. AA had done an inspection on the pylon using an unapproved method. They unknowingly caused the rear bulkhead of the pylon to crack. It failed shortly thereafter and took out the slat mechanism when it and the attached engine departed the aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-04T06:33:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2013 06:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
