I used part clipping to enhance structural integrity and aesthetics, but not to increase fuel capacity. Aside from the KER module and one antenna from RemoteTech, this lander is completely stock! I haven\u0027t tested it on the Mun yet, but (in theory, at least) it has enough delta-v to manage it using the FAR-to-Stock KIDS setting (which scales back vacuum ISP by 20% or so). I will be happy to post the stockified craft file of enough people want it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0KqkaBT.png\u0022 alt=\u00220KqkaBT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
