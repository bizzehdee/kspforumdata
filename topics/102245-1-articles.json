I used part clipping to enhance structural integrity and aesthetics, but not to increase fuel capacity. Aside from the KER module and one antenna from RemoteTech, this lander is completely stock! I haven\u0027t tested it on the Mun yet, but (in theory, at least) it has enough delta-v to manage it using the FAR-to-Stock KIDS setting (which scales back vacuum ISP by 20% or so). I will be happy to post the stockified craft file of enough people want it!\n\n![0KqkaBT.png](http://i.imgur.com/0KqkaBT.png)\n\nThanks! I will post screens of the rest of my rocket when it\u0027s done!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T22:27:10Z","Content":"While I wouldn\u0027t call this a replica, it\u0027s definitely really really Apollo-style and very tightly constructed with aesthetics obviously a chief design concern. I like this very much.\n\nGood luck scarring the Mun\u0027s surface with your nasty burnt-out husk of a descent stage and a little tiny Kerbal flag. That\u0027s my favorite thing about Apollo-style landers."}]}
