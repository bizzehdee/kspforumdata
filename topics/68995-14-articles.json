Was diving me mad as I thought I fudged something up with the custom MM patch I made. After re-installing the Taurus mod, removing the MM patch, etc... nothing seemed to fix it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out it was a mod (Mission Controller 2) that I didn\u0027t even think of because I was in a sandbox game testing parts and that mod affects only career games (Or, at least it advertises that). The issue was that MC2 kept trying to fill the \u0022Available Kerbals\u0022 list so the Taurus capsule would have the maximum allowed crew. The only reason I finally noticed it was because MC2 is integrated into the stock messaging system and I finally saw the 20\u002B messages it had spawned. It kept spamming \u0022Auto hired new Kerbal: John Doe Kerman!\u0022 but it was never\u003Cem\u003E actually \u003C/em\u003Ehiring them, I guess maybe because it was in sandbox mode, I really don\u0027t know. I didn\u0027t bother any further testing with the plugin due to how frustrating that one issue was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI removed the mod (Mission Controller 2) and all issues were resolved. Sad I had to remove it because it does a nice job spicing up career saves: hiring kerbals cost money, life insurance for the kerbal\u0027s \u0022family\u0022 if he died on a mission, etc. Disappointed I couldn\u0027t keep it but it was messing with sandbox, and, you know, you should be allowed to do \u003Cstrong\u003Eanything\u003C/strong\u003E in a sandbox game mode. It\u0027s named that way for a reason... Combined with the fact that, for the most part, I end up making custom MM patches to suit some things to my playstyle, and, well, I need something that\u0027ll let me test the parts instantly, so MC2 had to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this little write up / rant will help you determine the problem. It may be this mod, or it may be some other mod that you have no idea it could even interfere with something like this. If you run a heavily modded game, try to think back to what mods you installed. Try to remember what you\u0027ve installed recently \u003Cstrong\u003Ebefore\u003C/strong\u003E installing this mod. If you installed any more mods \u003Cstrong\u003Eafter\u003C/strong\u003E installing Aerojet Kerbodyne before testing to see if it worked before installing more mods, then I think that\u0027s the next logical step. It could be a plugin that changed a game mechanic, or even something that added a MM config that could be unintentionally messing with items that contain certain modules and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, be sure you installed Sumghai\u0027s SDHI service modules and it\u0027s dependencies. I know that can cause some wonky issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL/DR - Had same issue but with a capsule. Turned out to be another mod (Mission Controller 2) that should just affect career, but it didn\u0027t and was trying to auto hire kerbals to fill remaining seats. Removed mod and placing issues were resolved. Make sure it\u0027s not another mod interfering by changing something via a MM config. Yes, I\u0027ve seen one where the user wanted to change just his RCS thrusters. Instead of changing just those parts, he did it in a way that affected any part that had the module \u0022ModuleRCS\u0022 in it. Make sure you have all of the dependencies as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this can shed some light on the issue that you\u0027re having!
