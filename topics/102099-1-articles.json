And needless to say, this has made my experience of the game quite interesting. It allows for intense, Interstellar-esque moments, where I have to do my best to save people when missions go catastrophically wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd sadly, I lost Jeb a few in-game months ago (he was the second casualty), and I miss the guy.
