Sure, it\u0027s a unit that few will fully understand just from a glance (because it is arbitrary), but if you try to give their heat output capacity as \u0022x kW per second at temperature y\u0022, then that is even less useful to players, because there\u0027s no way in the VAB to target a specific temperature. Even the launchpad isn\u0027t enough, due to convection getting in the way. You\u0027d have to run trial and error by launching into space, and that isn\u0027t fun (nor really viable in career mode). So, better a relative performance rating.\n\nBonus points, perhabps, if you can actually call it \u0022relative performance rating\u0022, so the player has a hint that this isn\u0027t actually a physics figure ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAs for the test release, I\u0027ve only poked it very briefly yesterday night.
