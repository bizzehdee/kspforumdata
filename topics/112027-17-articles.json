For example, a radiator with a curved shape, like the GR-EXP, has a much bigger radiating ability than its size would suggest, because the curved shape generates a larger drag cube than you would get if you had the same surface area in a flat shape. All stock radiators as well as Heat Control\u0027s extensible XR series are also sightly better than they look, because they deploy into a flat zigzap shape instead of being completely flat. You can use the emissiveConstant field in each part config file to tune the exact amount of heat energy radiated at a specific radiator temperature.\u003Cp\u003EYou can find the drag cubes of all parts stored in PartDatabase.cfg in the KSP root directory. This file loves breaking horribly whenever you update KSP to a new version, or (somewhat less often) when you update a parts-containing mod to a new version. Parts get wrong drag cubes or lose them entirely, resulting in things like being unable to slow down on reentry or having zero heat emission capability. Because of this, ModuleManager simply deletes this file whenever it detects that something in the installation changed, and you can also delete it by hand if you suspect something is off. It will regenerate automatically on game startup with proper values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis represents the entirety of my perceived knowledge about drag cubes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest read in a long while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you have the time and knowledge, can you simply explain what Nertea has to do to remove the overheating problems from Near Future Propulsion engines?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T06:42:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat overheating problems?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I suppose if you try to run the 1.0.2 version of the mod in 1.0.4, there might be heat issues.

A \u0022coolant\u0022 resource that could be contained in a heat exchanger or other kind of power consuming module. The resource could slowly deplete (evaporation) but provide very efficient cooling when combined with a radiator. It could make for a nice active heat control system.
