You can control the rate at which your rocket tips towards the horizon to some degree with the throttle, however. As you ascend, keep a close eye on your TWR; you\u0027ll need a mod like mechjob or kerbal engineer for this. (They will also calculate your delta V for you). If you find the nose of the ship not dropping to the horizon fast enough, throttle back to reduce your TWR. If it is dropping too quickly, increase your throttle. This technique does not give you a huge amount of control, and will not overcome poor design decisions, but it does allow some control over the flight path.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T17:22:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA well designed rocket, (and I mean on the order of NASA level design) once you pitch over ever so slightly, you can turn off SAS and it will perform about as optimal an ascent as you can get.

It also depends on what your planned velocity profile is, for managing aerodynamic drag. The issue is that aero drag spikes upward sharply at Mach 1, which is a bit over 300 m/s at sea level on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen a couple of schools of thought on this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption #1: Take it slow. Avoid going over Mach 1 until you\u0027re high enough in the atmosphere that aero drag isn\u0027t such an issue. With this approach, keep speed under 300 m/s until you\u0027re over 10 km, then punch it hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption #2: Bat out of hell. If you have a high enough TWR, just blast right through Mach 1 and head out of the atmosphere as fast as you possibly can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to go with option #1 myself (primarily because to use #2, I\u0027d have to have a wastefully high TWR, with too much mass dedicated to engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis affects ascent profile, because the \u0022take it slow\u0022 approach means that your gravity turn will bend harder, so you wouldn\u0027t pitch over as much. Whereas the #2 approach would need to pitch harder sooner, because its pitch won\u0027t drop by as much in the gravity turn because it\u0027ll be going so fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uncle_jew","CreatedById":152178,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T22:14:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the feedback.
