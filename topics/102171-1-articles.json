I orbited a ship at exactly this altitude and timed my passage over KSC. It actually takes precisely 40 minutes according to the UTC clock. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\n This has to be confusion on my part about sidereal vs. solar time, but I\u0027m having a hard time wrapping my head around it. Why am I missing 4 minutes per orbit?? \\*scratches head\\*...\n\n Anyone run into this problem or have any ideas?\n\n Best,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T21:02:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 09:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T23:32:05Z","Content":"Your passage over KSC appears to be delayed (compared to your orbital period) because Kerbin is rotating underneath you. \n\nAfter your 36-minute orbit, you return to the exact same point with regard to the fixed stars.
