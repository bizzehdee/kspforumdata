But I don\u0027t know what to the icons are trying to tell me and how to adjust my maneuver to actually get captured by Duna. I imagine that I:1 and I:2 mean intercept 1 and 2 of my and Duna\u0027s orbit but what is the prograde looking icon about the other I:1 and I:2 trying to tell me? Can I know from the map as seen in the screenshot what I need to adjust? Feeling a bit lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[EDIT]: through try and error I figured that I need to get the I:1 without and with target icon to line up as perfectly as possible and have 0.0\u00B0 divergence, then I finally managed to get captured by Duna and am sitting now in a nice 100km orbit around it. So to answer my own question - and please correct me if my conclusions are wrong - if I:1 with icon (target) is ahead of I:1 without icon (my orbit), it means the target will be ahead and vice versa and I need to adjust departure time accordingly to bring both together.

There was a tutorial in KSP1 that explained these as part of the rendezvous/docking tutorial. They are your intercept points for your selected target. There are two pairs. I:1 \u0026amp; I:1 Target. Basically these are the points that you should be entering the target \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. Though in KSP2 the intercept points are a bit different it seems, Since they add the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E points separately and don\u0027t always appear when they should (see my bug report post).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022227115\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3197603058\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/214219-soi-intercept-points-not-shown/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you hover over the Intercept flags you\u0027ll see your closest approach distance and relative velocity. If you adjust your orbit maneuver to get I:1 and I:1 target points as closely as possible to each other, your approach distance should be at its minimum. Thought your relative velocity could be quite high. The second pair of I points is a second approach opportunity for the same orbital maneuver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
