The thing is, the exact method can vary depending on how you fly and the characteristics of your ships, so there isn\\\u0027t one correct answer. I\\\u0027m not an expert, but this is how I figured it out. It works for me, and I hope it will help others. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, make sure you are orbiting Kerbin on the same plane as the moons, heading east. (That\\\u0027s flying compass heading 90 all the way from liftoff to orbit.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave the game and, from wherever you happen to be at the time, accelerate your rocket toward the navball eastern horizon (its an easy landmark for consistency of result). Switch to map view and shut the engine down when your apoapsis markers reaches the orbital height of the desired moon. The apoapsis marker then tells you your own personal transit time, to that moon, based on how you fly and how fast your current rocket accelerates (see attached screenshot \u003Cstrong\u003ETime benchmark\u003C/strong\u003E). You can then do some simple arithmetic to figure out how far the moon will have moved in its orbit by the time you get there: orbital period (from the wiki if you don\\\u0027t want to figure it out) divided by your transit time equals the fraction of a circle to aim ahead of the moon\\\u0027s current position. Multiply that by 360 to get easier-to-visualize degrees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Mun the leading angle is : 138,983/(your transit IN SECONDS)*360degrees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Minmus the leading angle is: 1,077,379/(your transit IN SECONDS)*360degrees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so how to aim for that angle? First, load your save so that you haven\\\u0027t wasted all that rocket fuel and are still in Kerbin orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHit the tab key to make Kerbin the center of your camera view, then zoom way out looking straight down on the plane of the moon\\\u0027s orbit (from north) then rotate until the moon is straight above the planet (\u003Cstrong\u003EPolar view\u003C/strong\u003E). That is where you would fly to hit the moon if it was not moving, but of course it is. So then rotate the view again until the moon has moved to the right to the desired intercept angle (\u003Cstrong\u003ECorrected aim angle\u003C/strong\u003E). \u0027Up\u0027 on your computer screen is now the proper direction to fly to intercept the moon. Zoom back in on Kerbin and bring the camera angle back down level to the plane of the orbits (\u003Cstrong\u003EBack to the plane\u003C/strong\u003E), but keeping that \u0027up\u0027 at the top of the screen. You should now be looking straight at the desired interception point, \u003Cem\u003Ethrough \u003C/em\u003E the planet (\u003Cstrong\u003ELined up stars\u003C/strong\u003E). Wait until your orbiting ship is in the middle of the screen at that burn point, right on that line of ship/Kerbin/intercept point, and hit the throttle. Switch to map view and watch your orbital path climb (\u003Cstrong\u003EClimbing apo\u003C/strong\u003E), shutting down the engines when the apoapsis marker reaches the orbital height of the target moon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\\\u0027re aiming for Mun, this should do the trick and the conics intersection symbols will replace the apoapsis marker as it gets close (\u003Cstrong\u003EBingo!\u003C/strong\u003E). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus is trickier, because its orbit can swing above and below the usual plane. You could be lined up properly in the east/west direction and still not see the conics intersection symbols because you\\\u0027re too far north/south. The easiest way to fix that is to wait until you\\\u0027re partway to Minmus, then look and see if it\\\u0027s above or below your path. If it\\\u0027s above (\u003Cstrong\u003EDrat! Missed\u003C/strong\u003E), turn your ship to straight Kerbin-north (on the navball, that\\\u0027s where the horizon meets the gold north line at compass heading 360 (\u003Cstrong\u003ENavball north\u003C/strong\u003E)), turn the engine on low (so you don\\\u0027t over-do it), and watch on the map view until the conics intercept symbols appear, then shut down the engine (\u003Cstrong\u003ESloppy, but adequate\u003C/strong\u003E). Or if Minmus is below your path, point straight south and do the same thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there are more elegant ways to do this (especially Minmus with its inclined orbit), but I think this is pretty simple conceptually and can be done from numbers and viewing angles within the game. Anyway, this is how I do it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComments?

Are those factors enough to cause a newbie to miss? Not most of the time, it\\\u0027s true. I just don\\\u0027t like the idea of using the one-size-sort-of-fits all fire-at-moonrise and trusting to slop and luck. That can be wasteful of fuel, which will matter when economics are eventually added to the game. By my suggested method of doing a test run first, the player would get an accurate transit time figure for THAT rocket, altitude, and any steering clumsiness an inexperienced player might bring to the mix. As long as your real burn is as good or as sloppy as the benchmark run, my method should get you where you want to go. You don\\\u0027t have to be good, just consistent. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrdest21","CreatedById":10441,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-28T04:55:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve done the Mun-sets-over-Kerbin (I go westwards and go head on with the Mun) and it rarely misses, if ever, independently of height and speed.
