I remember it being pretty satisfied with Squad, and Squad appreciating the support. Now I come back and there is a lot of hate towards Squad now it seems.

Different people have become annoyed at different times for different reasons. The bottom line is that through a number of chaotic recent changes, which arguably have made the game rather less fun, stable, and playable, Squad has managed to stir up some level of resentment in pretty much everybody.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the community has been riven by faction because an issue that one group finds intolerable another group takes as holy writ and is willing to kill over, unable to hold a rational discussion on the merits at all. So now we have 2 armed camps, one of haters and one of zealots, both of whom complain loudly and do their best to insult the other. Their rants both ways take up much of the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn between, we have a largely silent population that is willing to roll with Squad\u0027s punches but which is becoming increasingly disgusted with the rudderless course of KSP development, the frequent game-breaking changes, the introduction of new bugs instead of the fixing of old ones, and the resulting turmoil in the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T21:57:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always thought the version numbering was a little optimistic.

When 1.0 came out with some major bugs and a serious lack of polish and balance (i.e. another early access update, but not anything like a 1.0 release), many community members felt that Squad didn\u0027t really care what they said or really knew what they were doing, and so burned a lot of goodwill with the community. In this light, the community (understandably IMHO) is concerned with the future of the game and how the PS4 development is going to (further) affect the PC version when the game we have now still needs so much work. The recent (major) aero rebalances in 1.0-1.0.4 also haven\u0027t helped either, since the game is still in a major state of flux and craft that worked fine in 1.0 failed in 1.0.2, and the same thing happened from 1.0.2 to 1.0.4.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T22:06:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 10:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T22:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is because what SQUAD has done is innovative for the stock release.

I don\u0027t think that many of us really care either way whether a console port is released, but given the above, took it as a bit of a slap in the face that Squad would consider that something we\u0027d get excited about.
