To go for interplanetary, you must do a (tangent) prograde burn so you have match the PE ou AP at the correct burn angle. With a random elipse, this is mostly unefficient.

At first there is a plenty to learn about what day to leave (the launch window), where in your orbit to burn (angle to prograde/ejection angle). Later you can add more complications like below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, starting from Mun for interplanetary is more straight forward because its at 0* inclination versus Minmus\u0027s 6* inclination. Assuming you are going interplanetary, and thus speeding a lot of dv, its most efficient to drop down from Mun/Minmus orbit to very low Kerbin orbit and perform your interplanetary burn there at periapsis without ever circularizing. By doing it that way, you would have an extra 800-900 m/s of speed at periapsis and thus gain more efficiency from the Oberth effect. However timing that so that you arrive at the right window and with the right ejection angle and inclination can be tricky. Plus if you mess it up, you can end up costing yourself much more than you would have saved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: 2) A 5000 m/s ejection burn is a terrible idea and will result in a similar sized capture burn to Duna. You need to learn more about launch windows and ejection angles that I talk about above.

So the Oberth effect should apply more and more. But the issue is more about timing. As you AP rises the time to do the full cycle will be higher and higher. To eject at the perfect time you have to know when to start your cycles. This is the tricky part.
