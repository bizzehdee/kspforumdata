Reading through my thread and the linked emissive tutorial thread should make it clear that the changes made in Unity 4.3 broke emissive animations for KSP/part tools. You can see that when DMagic suggested using Unity 4.2, It \u0022magically\u0022 worked \u003Cem\u003E(no pun intended)\u003C/em\u003E. It wasn\u0027t because I was doing it wrong in Unity as you might suggest, because the animation was working fine in Unity. The short answer, at the moment, is that if you are having problems with emissive textures/animations then you need to us Unity 4.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see how making a post that would make it easier on everyone who was following that thread at the time aware that the solution had been found is selfish at all.
