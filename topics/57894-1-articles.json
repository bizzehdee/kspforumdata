No need for a full physics simulation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T13:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Asmayus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Asmayus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably a year or two away in any event, so wait and see... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking the initial implementation will be a lot sooner than a year; the Devs have already said that they want the gameplay essentially complete for 2014, which means that money and all that it entails will have to be implemented sooner than December of next year. There will need to be at least a couple versions to make sure there\u0027s no way to \u0022game the game\u0022 (like transmission spamming for Science in 0.22) and become infinitely rich in like two in-game months, for instance. I\u0027m betting some rudimentary money stuff shows up in 0.24, even if it\u0027s just a large wad of seed money to start your program and a regular monthly budget to keep it working.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T14:16:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to Development Discussion \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
