Putting node on moving part isn\u0027t working, Infernal Robotics may help but it\u0027s not a magic solution for that AFAIK, also it doesn\u0027t allow free move yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETexturing is mostly 2D art, but it\u0027s not as hard as you may think, you can do good/decent texture without being an artist or using pattern/texture \u0022generator\u0022 like mapzone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"etopsirhc","CreatedById":109812,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T07:40:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell that sucks, but at least theirs hope in the plugin area. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027m actualy in a class now for texturing. so far its been easy(ish) but all the assignments require a source image, so i\u0027ve just been using parts of the pic for the textures. they come out decent enough but any time i try a from scratch texture it comes out like a 1st grade art project\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
