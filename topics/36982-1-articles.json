You can do that by hand or with a spreadsheet. I recommend looking into it because it will deepen your game play when you understand how to make efficient rockets that still get where you want them to go, and understand why it is efficient. And don\u0027t just add MOAR BOOSTERS as the solution to everything (even though it is fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E90% agree, great list. Only one thing I question... no aids, ok, protractor measures the actual angles as they are happening. If you do not use any computerized aids, would that mean you have to actually put a protractor to the map screen to decide when to burn? I like some of the computer aids, but does a protractor that is not even a pocket calculator qualify?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am going to try your life support. I have fiddled with Ironcross a bit and I like it but I have not seen yours. I have a problem, I fly a capsule based on the Dragon of my own design and it has a lot of switches to control how it works. When I added Ironcross it made the bottom of the list roll off the screen and I can\u0027t find any way to move it or split it or make access to it user friendly. Do you have any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am about convinced I need to try Figaro. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy daughter and her BF love Kethane but before I found out about it I created my own system so I haven\u0027t played it but I have considered starting another game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TouhouTorpedo","CreatedById":30603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T09:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FlowerChild\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FlowerChild\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey guys,\u003Cp\u003ECareer mode is a really big deal to me\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Controller. 100% you want that.
