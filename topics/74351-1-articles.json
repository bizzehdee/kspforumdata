It sounds like you could afford to make your pitchover earlier. As you\u0027ve noticed, with FAR, rockets lose control if they are pointed too far away from the prograde marker. The solution to that is making a gentle (\u0026lt; 10 degrees) pitchover at low speeds (\u0026lt; 100 m/s). Then you adjust the throttle down or up to keep the rocket from going above or below the prograde marker. Gravity will turn the rocket the rest of the way over as long as you keep the TWR low enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ascent goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdjust throttle so the launch TWR is about 1.2 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELaunch with SAS on \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFly straight up until between 50-75 m/s \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPitch over of 2-5 degrees east and turn off SAS \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdjust throttle to let the rocket turn these pitches:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E5-10 degrees by 5 km \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E15-20 degrees by 10 km \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E25-30 degrees by 15 km \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E45-50 degrees by 20 km \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E55-60 degrees by 30 km \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E75-80 degrees by 40 km \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]Hold 5-10 degrees above the horizon until apoapsis is high enough \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a demonstration where the first stage has no attitude control, so the pitchover is entirely on the capsule torque.

A version or 2 back (still for KSP 23.5), you had to mount short-lived boosters way up near the top of your rocket because the effects of their body lift on the CoL and CoM overpowered any number of tailfeathers you put on the central stack. And at the same time, main stack tailfeathers had to be aligned orthogonally and their control surfaces limited to only pitch or only yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current version of FAR, OTOH, doesn\u0027t care as much about the positioning of early boosters so you can do asparagus with it no problem. Also, it seems to work best with main stack tailfeathers oriented at 45^ and free to work on all axes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy SOP for lifters with FAR is to have a subassembly called Tailfeather. This consists of a stock Delta Wing with a stock large control surface on the trailing edge, and 3x RCS blocks on the wingtip. Depending on the mood FAR is in at the time, I mount 4 of these either orthogonally or diagonally. If diagonally, I use 4x symmetry and move the RCS blocks to the orthogonal points of the main stack. If orthogonally, I use 2x symmetry, leave the RCS blocks on the wingtips, and set each pair of control surfaces to either pitch or yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T01:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo append to my last: If your main stack drops a stage on the way up, where the atmosphere is still relatively meaningful, it\u0027s best to put some small tailfeathers on the next stage up. Small, so you don\u0027t need any more on the bottom stage, but big enough to keep the rocket heaing in the desired direction. So if my bottom stage has delta wings with big control surfaces, the upper stage has merely AV-R8 winglets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
