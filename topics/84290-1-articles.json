I. A.\u0022 written on top in big, low-res, yellow letters. You can stil see this in some of the old YouTube videos. The old hands had tangible proof of their accomplishments and I\u0027ve always regretted that went away by 0.20 when I came along. With the current thing of the portraits just disappearing, you\u0027re left to wonder if maybe the little bugger managed to escape \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have good news! The old \u0022K. I. A. on static\u0022 is still in the game buried under all the new stuff. You just need excavate it with sufficient force. Such as by flinging a Sepratron-powered dragster into the SPH at over 400m/s \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.

I think it happens whenever the game auto-switches to a nearby craft when the current one gets obliterated. I had it happen very consistently when I was testing glider-bombers in FAR yesterday and had one parked next to the runway while I crashed another one nearby- it would automatically switch me to the parked plane, with both kerbal icons saying \u0022K.I.A.\u0022 like that.

Still, the important thing is, we now know how to create ZOMBIE KERBALS at will! Take 2 Kerbals, sacrifice 1 to the Kraken, and the other becomes a zombie.
