If you do heat up diamonds, they will burn quite nicely in pure oxygen and can, theoretically, make for better fuel than pure graphite.

With a fusion plasma rocket (like one that uses a tokamak or stellarator to contain the fusion plasma), the fusion plasma exhausted from the rocket\u0027s magnetic nozzle will not entirely consist of fusion fuel that has undergone a fusion reaction.

This is because the reaction happens between colliding particle beams of fusion fuels, with the velocity of the particles being caused by a linear or cyclotron particle accelerator, rather than by thermal heating. Unlike thermal velocity, this velocity is highly directional, which is why you\u0027re able to form particle beams in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou do need to heat the fuel atoms a small amount, but only enough to slightly ionize them so that the particle accelerator can manipulate the atoms by use of electromagnetic fields. The majority of the input energy of the fusion reaction is supplied by the particle accelerators.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe advantage is that you can use fusion reactions that have much lower radiation shielding requirements (D-He3, P-11B, etc), despite those reactions requiring much higher particle energies to cause fusion, because you can ensure that a large portion of the input energy goes directly into making the fusion reaction happen, instead of just being mostly wasted on heating plasma that won\u0027t even be able to react before it is expelled out the magnetic nozzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yeah, and as for how a fusion rocket is able to beat a fission rocket, that\u0027s easy. Each instance of the fusion reaction happening outputs more energy than each instance of the Fission reaction happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as for how that translates into higher specific impulse without melting the engine, that\u0027s also easy. Since we\u0027re ideally dealing with plasmas and not hot neutral gas, instead of using a physical nozzle you can use a \u0022nozzle\u0022 constructed of magnetic fields, ideally created by superconducting magnetic coils.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve ever seen a rocket engine nozzle that looks like it couldn\u0027t possibly work because there\u0027s only a skeleton in the right shape, and nothing physical to contain the gas, that\u0027s almost certainly a magnetic nozzle of some form.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you haven\u0027t seen one, here\u0027s an image:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/images/realdesigns/discovery2d.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMagnetic Nozzle\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-28T20:46:15Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2022 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
