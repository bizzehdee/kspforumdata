You put a rover out on the runway, then drive it off the ocean side of the runway, set the parking brake, re-label it as a base and call it KSC 27. Put a second one on the landward side of the runway, set the parking brake, relabel it as a base and call it KSC 09. Drive a third one one kilometer inland from where you parked KSC 09, set the parking brake, relabel it as a base and call it \u0022Meatball - 1 km\u0022. That\u0027s all you need; the three points will show you if you\u0027re properly aligned for as long as you can keep them in sight, and then you can use either KSC 09 or KSC 27 as your \u0022inner marker\u0022; you compare your distance to the marker to your altimeter reading to see if you\u0027re too high or too low (the formula is altimeter = 100 \u002B(100*distance); this would give you something like a 5.7 degree glide slope). You can set up additional markers on the landward end of the Runway at five kilometer intervals to assist with the determination of lateral alignment. If you identify how far each marker is to KSC 09, you can use any one of them to determine your ideal altimeter reading; you just add that distance to the distance to the marker (for example, if you\u0027re 2 kilometers from the 10 kilometer marker, you want to be at roughly 100 \u002B (100 * (2\u002B10)) = 1300 meters. The system works reasonably well; the time consuming part is setting it up and making sure the markers are in the right spots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could do this with flags too, though I find that flags have an annoying tendency to disappear spontaneously. Another advantage of classifying the markers as bases is that they can be seen from orbit; if you have a mod like Trajectories, this gives you a place to put your bullseye prior to re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ss8913","CreatedById":94747,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T05:47:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb\u0027s spaceplane function will set a target at a configurable glideslope for ILS guidance.. it\u0027s not as good as a real HSI though.

As soon as I click the NavUtilities stock toolbar button in flight view, all GUI elements disappear. When switching to IVA, the IVA view is black, and I see the NavUtilities configuration GUI - that is, until I toggle the \u0022show overlay\u0022 option, upon which all GUI disappears. Maybe I am missing a dependency?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s strange, I cannot reproduce it whatever I do. May be one of the mods you use has some interference? I would recommend you to move all other mods except for toolbar and RPM to a folder other than KSP/GameData to see if there\u0027s any incompatibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I got it, the same exception when I renamed some textures in the mod\u0027s folders. So it seems that you simply miss some files. Have you tried to redownload and to reinstall the NavUtils? Make sure your path to the folder with dll files is \u003Cem\u003EKSP\u003C/em\u003E\\GameData\u003Cstrong\u003E\\KerbalScienceFoundation\\NavInstruments\u003C/strong\u003E because the mod is path-sensible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T17:14:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 05:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ser\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mic_e","CreatedById":60757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T17:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre Toolbar and/or RPM hard requirements?
