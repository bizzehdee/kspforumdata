So a few weeks ago, I went into the patcher and updated the game from 1.0 to 1.1 (even though 1.0 came out like two years ago, but anyway). I played around with the \u0027new\u0027 parts added since 1.0.2, and really enjoyed the HECS 2 and the Mk3 shuttle engines, and the new\u00A0mk1\u00A0cockpit (why isn\u0027t there an \u0027old\u0027 mk1 cockpit and the \u0027new\u0027 one though\u00A0so I can still use it? But again,\u00A0getting off topic). So\u00A0after playing with the new parts, I then went into the patcher again and tried to update it from 1.1 to 1.2. Then, it just stopped. It said \u0027patcher.exe has stopped working\u0027. Since I have been accustomed to this (whenever I click or press a button on my keyboard when a craft is loading or the game\u0027s loading it just comes up with the \u0027ksp.exe has stopped working\u0027, but then it just goes away and it loads and everything\u0027s fine).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, every time I click on \u0027update\u0027 to update it from 1.1 to 1.2, it comes up with the \u0027patcher.exe has stopped working\u0027. And then\u00A0the launcher closes. I have a theory: Could a mod be causing the patcher to not update the game? Or is this just a bug, glitch or is it something to do with my version of the game (I have a clean install, payed for the game, didn\u0027t get a pirated version or something from a sketchy website or whatever). Because this is frustrating when there are so many cool features in 1.2 but I\u0027m prevented by a simple \u0027has stopped working\u0027 error. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-02T06:13:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe patcher isn\u0027t supported anymore the last time I checked, so to update your game you have to download it from the store where you bought the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-02T15:33:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo go into a bit more detail, there are patchers available, but you have to download them from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/kspstore\u0022 ipsnoembed=\u0022false\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/kspstore\u003C/a\u003E after logging in and going to your account to get the download links.
