No More Science Grinding modifies re-runable experiments on the experiment definition level so that they only need to be run once to reach their full value. For example, if you launch and recover a mystery goo from low orbit over biome y, performing another mystery goo study in the same situation will yield no further gains: all science possible was awarded on the first go. Science Revised modifies the rate at which the experiment will transmit at the per-part level. The reason the mods \u0022compliment\u0022 each other is that both seek to \u0022fix\u0022 parts of the stock science system that many found unintuitive or unfriendly for gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022draeath\u0022 data-cite=\u0022draeath\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow, what I \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E get.

I have a minmaxer playstyle, so for me, it\u0027s good gameplay to have to have the opportunity to take risks (data return on a mission where the craft [hopefully] returns) for a slightly improve science reward. I figured that for non-minmaxers, the trivial amount of science lost would be inconsequential. However, the rationalization, which I think is a sound one, is that the results can be verified and calibrated if the instrument itself is returned to kerbin for analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m considering adding a feature in the next patch that removes the ability to \u0022take data\u0022 from these numeric sensors. This would better suit the rationalization, but would still allow the experiment to be re-run indefinitely for repeated data transmission. If I include this option, I\u0027ll also include a patch, disabled by default, that sets the data scalers to 1 and re-enables data removal as an alternative to my system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T19:36:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really love this mod, and I\u0027m using it in my current Science game, \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMOAR SCIENCE, HI! \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EIt really solves a few of the science headaches I\u0027ve experienced previously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I noticed that it doesn\u0027t seem to buff the Planetary Lab from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127413\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Planetary Base Systems\u003C/a\u003E.
