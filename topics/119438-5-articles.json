In 2000, adult education finally extended the associates program to these technical schools making them technical colleges and had the option to pursue an associates in a few fields, including computer information systems, which had a computer science requirement. But, since I already did the core work in my previous tenure there in 95, everything transferred over to the new field so it didn\u0027t take me long to get my associates. I was actually teaching classes and holding tutoring programs for students who were falling behind. And since I was getting a minor in networking, they put me in charge of integrating the school onto a network.
