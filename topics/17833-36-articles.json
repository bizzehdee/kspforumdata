The VOID HUD correctly displays the Dv the rocket has while the payload is attached, but KER shows me the Dv the rocket has with the payload released.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not familiar with the mods you are using so could you give us a list? Does the staging of the vessel actually make sense? Can you do a screenshot with \u0022Show all stages\u0022 selected (and provide the craft file if possible)? My prediction is that it will show a stage 1 with no deltaV because KER is deciding (probably unhelpfully) that there is no point in the first stage as the decoupler doesn\u0027t detach anything important...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that VOID actually uses the KER\u0027s vessel simulation code to calculate dV I would expect them to be the same but I suspect that even the latest release of VOID is running at least one version behind.
