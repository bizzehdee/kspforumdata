It\u0027d be nice if when you are changing the color in the UI that the rocket that can see in the background would update it\u0027s color scheme to match so you had an idea what the chosen color scheme would actually look like on a rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-23T06:27:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can change agency colors at any time in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.

I know as a first time user I felt a bit rushed/panic to make a decision that I had 0 idea the ramifications of. It also impedes the build process because you have then stop your building fun, then navigate the paint tool, etc. Just is way more clicks for something that could be handled upfront in a way that remedies new players immediately feeling rushed into a decision they haven\u0027t been given the tools to make properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
