Their qualities were pretty high so I decided to give it a shot. The experience was good in general, but I found the lack of Chinese localization a little annoying for me. What\u0027s more, when I look into the source files of the mod, I discovered that the descriptions of the parts were not written in the form which enables multi-language localizations and no Chinese files were found. Does anyone have a Chinese localization file for Planetside Exploration Technologies and/or Artemis Construction pack? If you do, then please contact me or Benjee10 himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
