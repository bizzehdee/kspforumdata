This group also tended to be mad when 1.0 came out... and .90, etc. etc. A little pattern is arising. It seems that they\u0027re also mad about the \u0027kiddos\u0027 from the PS4 community to plague the forum community... a bit hypocritical, don\u0027t ya think? Not to put labels on anyone.

And if SQUAD loses some dev time (which they will probably not), we have mods, do we not? Hopefully the port is decent enough to not be considered a failure.

Squad was embarrassed by the need for v1.0.2, a mere 6 hours after v1.0.1 and doesn\u0027t wish to repeat that scenario.\n\nYou\u0027ll find that in one of [my previous posts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125658-PS4-Announcement-Discussion?p=2022966\u0026viewfull=1#post2022966) in this thread.

I\u0027m not saying that I guarantee you that it is false, mind you; that would be equally unscientific. I\u0027m just saying that nobody has a source to claim that it is true. None. Nada. Zilch. The one single source we have on this topic in fact states the exact opposite. Yet this thread, page after page, is filled with people treating it as fact. Why so? Because it is a convenient excuse for everyone with a personal agenda to jump up and shout \u0022oh, so THAT\u0027s why \u003Cpersonal pet=\u0022\u0022 feature=\u0022\u0022\u003E was never implemented/bugfixed\u0022 and similar statements.

The community here claims for itself to be more mature than any other gaming community, because science and rational reasoning is said to be held in high regard by everyone. I\u0027d like to implore everyone involved in this discussion to actually follow those claims with actions, and behave like rational human beings. This includes *not* building a \u0022critical discussion\u0022 on the back of a logical fallacy, or by seeing one forum user say something and then repeating it blindly.\n\nI have now read through all three threads on this topic in their entirety (this one, the devnotes, and the mini-FAQ blog post), and I have yet to see a single well-reasoned, fact-based argument for why having a PS4 version would in any way, shape or form negatively affect me as a PC player in the future.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T07:56:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 07:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T08:09:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You\u0027ll find that in one of [my previous posts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125658-PS4-Announcement-Discussion?p=2022966\u0026viewfull=1#post2022966) in this thread.
