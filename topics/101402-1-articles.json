THe moon is a few hundred dV, mars is a few 1000 to land. Getting a lander back in space and back to earth is a challenge. This challenge to a mars landing can be circumvented if Phobos is selected instead of mars. Mars may slow down reentry (not much for the really heavy people movers) but it has alot more dV to stop, more with aerobraking than the moon has without, but the big killer is getting off.

CO2 without water does not make mars a better choice than the Moon. You can, with difficulty make O2 from CO2, its simply easier to make O2 from water, and you get hydrogen, which can react with CO2 at high temperature. Even if you use plants to make O2, the reaction requires water. Just because Mars has an atmosphere does not make it a better choice. Unless you have a probe that has discovered liquid or frozen water on mars at a high enough density, making fuel for return trip is nearly impossible. The water that is in the martian soil would be depleted quickly for any productive effort without a full fledged surface manipulation technology designed for that application. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

Technological proving ground-Most important. Its not about CO2 or O2, this is overemphasized, its about surface manipulation. The tools you apply on the moon will fail, but new technologies can be brought in a cycle of a few weeks, and structural failures can be returned to earth within a few days for analysis. You bring a tool to mars it breaks, you make a new one on Mars it breaks again, finally you can\u0027t make any tools. It breaks on the moon, send it back on a space teather to a space station, see if the can figure out why it broke, if not place it on a small scale re-entry vehicle and send it back to earth for analysis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.
