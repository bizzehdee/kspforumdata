Jebediah also know this was a plot by Bill to take from him the first moon landing as their positions on the respective missions were switched.

I already had a space tug in orbit and docked to the station, so all I needed was to build the lander and dock it to the tug. After a good 20 to 30 minutes of maneuvering during the docking approach, I was almost done. The lander was moving forward nice and slowly, right on target. And then it stops. I look at the display from Romfarer\u0027s Docking Camera mod, and it tells me that there\u0027s only .25 meters between the two docking ports. Puzzled, I try thrusting forwards with the RCS, but the lander doesn\u0027t budge. I realize that the lander won\u0027t fit. The way the space tug is built, it has two engines mounted on the sides, with the docking port in the middle. And the lander is stuck between them. Only a quarter of a meter prevents the two craft from docking, but that quarter of a meter might as well have been a million kilometers. I would have to abort the mission and redesign the lander so that it could clear the tug\u0027s engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thunderstar","CreatedById":64703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T18:54:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Whackjob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Whackjob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/xKgSl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
