The design process made heavy use of HyperEdit to test its flight properties on Duna. Then I realized I had to get it off the ground to start with, which proved an equal challenge. Countless fails with vertical rocket launches having finally convinced me that wasn\u0027t going to work, I finally bit the bullet and tried it as a spaceplane. Many fails later (as usual for me with spaceplanes), the above pic shows the successful result. It weighs 32 tons (15 of which is the D\u0027OH payload) and takes over 15 minutes to reach the switchover point from jet mode to rocket mode, but it works.
