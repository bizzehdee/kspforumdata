After digging through some code bits from Mechjeb, AlternateResourcePanel, RCSBuildAid and others (thanks to the developers, having code to look at how to do things helps a lot!) I found several Methods to get all the Parts of the current vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I used EditorLogic.startPod and went through all the children of the Part (recursively) which worked fine.

They seem to be both working, with the SortedShipList I don\u0027t have to get a instance of EditorLogic, get the ShipConstruct and then the parts so I think this should be the faster/better one!?
