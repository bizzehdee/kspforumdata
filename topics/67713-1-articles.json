Germany was completely wiped out after WWII. Its population was beaten, humiliated, and most of all traumatically ashamed by what it had caused. In the wake of WWII, the last thing the German people (and the Allied occupation forces) wanted was to hear about national pride. As a consequence, West Germany took a low profile on international affairs and concentrated on rebuilding the country and the economy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this, and also because the Allies imposed weapon restrictions, West Germany had no incentive to build nuclear weapons. In fact, because the country was traumatised by the destruction and casualties of two World Wars, the German population is mostly pacifist and opposed to nuclear power, which explains why the Green movement originated there. No nuclear weapons means no need for ICBMs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, there\u0027s probably two smaller practical factors. First, Germany is densely populated and has no ex-colonial overseas territories near the equator like the UK or France, so it doesn\u0027t have access to any decent launch locations. Second, most of Germany\u0027s rocketry assets were captured by the Allies after WWII and its rocket scientists ended up working for the USA or the USSR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T00:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, they didn\u0027t exactly have a good latitude.....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klingon Admiral","CreatedById":69090,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T07:41:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFunnily enough, there currently is a lot of argueing within ESA about the future of the Ariane rocket family, with France and Italy prefering the Ariane 6, while Germany supports the Ariane 5 ME proposal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"szputnyik","CreatedById":84032,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T17:41:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KASASpace\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KASASpace\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, they didn\u0027t exactly have a good latitude.....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeither the Soviets.
