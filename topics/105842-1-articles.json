By this I mean the last part of the lifter does the 1st part of the transfer burn so it ends up well away from LKO, then the actual transfer stage does the 1st part of the landing so it will be sure to crash. Thus, the ship in Round 1 above didn\u0027t have quite enough left in the lifter for my tastes, so I added some fuel to the 1st set of asparagus booster, keeping the same engines of a central Mainsail surrounded by 4 Skippers. This had 3438m/s (vac) in the lifter and an initial TWR of 1.33. I then launched this rocket using the 35km turn stop altitude obtained in round 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResult: 3092m/s required to reach 100km, 346m/s left in the tank at 100km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then swapped out the Skippers on the 1st (bigger) asparagus boosters for Mainsails, keeping everything else the same. This dropped the lifter dV down to 3307m/s (vac) but raised the TWR to 1.84. Again, launched with the same ascent profile (1km start, 65% curve, 35km stop).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResult: 2789m/s required to reach 100km, 518m/s left in the tank at 100km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a given flight profile, a higher TWR trumps a higher dV total, at least up to a point. The 3-Mainsail/2-Skipper version got some mach effects shortly before the Mainsail boosters dropped, which I\u0027m sure is inefficient. Plus, Kerbals don\u0027t like long periods of high Gs. Thus, it\u0027s probably not a good idea to overpower your rockets. FAR didn\u0027t like to exceed about 1.5 Gs for most of the launch, which is why I tried to keep my initial TWRs rather low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBOTTOM LINE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn ascent profile that has you level off about 35km will save you fuel. So will higher TWRs, even if you have less dV to start with. The main point, however, is that the \u0022new standard\u0022 of 3400m/s to LKO is way too high. It should be closer to 3000m/s, maybe even less. I can do it in 2800m/s if I try hard enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EFuture Study\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe obvious next step is to vary the shape of the curve and also the altitude to start turning. I suspect (as it was in FAR) that a curve that starts slowly and finishes quickly (that is, \u0026gt; 50%) will prove the best. The idea is to get through the thicker part of the atmosphere quickly, which probably explains wihy having a higher initial TWR also helps, then drop those engines for more fuel efficiency once you\u0027ve got some altitude and speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: I\u0022m sure most vets have figured this out already.

Which is a logical thing given that for the vast bulk of any space trip, it\u0027s the vacuum Isp that matters, starting with what\u0027s left in the tank immediately after launch. The goal, therefore, is to fly the launch in such a way that you have as much vacuum dV after launch as possible for whatever stage you\u0027re using for the next phase of the mission. Thus, unlike a spaceplane, with a rocket you really don\u0027t care about atmospheric Isp except to avoid the obvious pitfalls like trying to launch with LV-Ns or (as of 1.0) 909s. For most other engines, there\u0027s really not a lot of difference between atmospheric and vacuum performance anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs using vacuum Isp and dV numbers for planning purposes absolutely accurate? No. However, it does produce useful rules of thumb because the whole process is internally consistent and easily understood.

But do you get enough to make any real difference for gameplay purposes, in terms of cost? Probably not. Plus, you spend all that time worrying about just getting off the ground instead of actually going places. Maybe that\u0027s your thing and if so, rock on.

If you try to fly a pancake, it will burn more fuel than a needle of the same mass and theoretical dV on board. I suppose I could have put in a caveat about that, but OTOH I assume that most folks would be aware of this given the emphasis placed on the new aerodynamics. Still, however, the same processes work on all rockets during launch. Thus, all rockets should benefit in the same way from the same sorts of ascent path refinements, although the blunter rockets won\u0027t get as much benefit as the sleeker ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother design issue folks now need to be aware of in stock is the relative position of the CoM and the CoL, from which stability and the ability to control the rocket during launch derive. As with an arrow, the closer to the top the CoM, and the closer to the bottom the CoL, the better the rocket will fly. This is, however, not nearly such an issue as it is in NEAR/FAR. Classic KSP-style asparagus staging of multiple huge boosters, as shown in my pic above, is still quite possible, whereas it really isn\u0027t in NEAR/FAR. Also, if you need to move the CoL further aft in a stock rocket, you get a lot more bang for a smaller number of smaller tail fins than you do in NEAR/FAR. The upshot of this is that nowadays, as you build your rocket from the top down, you need to check the CoM/CoL placement of each stage that will be flying in the atmosphere and fix that prior to adding more stages below and to the sides, and checking them as well taking the pre-existing stages into account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose some folks will complain that the new air is a half-measure because it doesn\u0027t doom the classic KSP pancake lifter, it just imposes a few constraints that can be dealt with. To which I say, if somebody can make a pancake fly, and is willing to pay the price, good for them if that\u0027s what they consider fun. Besides, the way the new tech tree is laid out, combined with the need to level up multiple Kerbals at once, means that mission payloads grow faster than single stacks of the then-available rockets can support. Thus, you need to be able to do some asparagus, especially considering that you now have to buy several top-tier nodes to get all the parts needed to use 3.75m rockets. And that\u0027s all there is in stock.
