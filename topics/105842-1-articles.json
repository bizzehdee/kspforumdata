I\u0027m by no means done with this but here are some preliminary results.\n\n**EXPERIMENTS**\n\n1st Round\n\nI built a big rocket with 3184m/s (in vacuum) in the lifter part of it (it had other stages on top). The lifter portion was a central Mainsail core with 2 pairs of asparagus boosters using Skippers. I then launched this rocket repeatedly using MJ\u0027s ascent guidance using the following settings;\n\n\\* 65% curve shape in all tests (because this shape always worked best for me with FAR)\n\n\\* start turn at 1km above launchpad (best get started early with this curve)\n\n\\* varied the altitude to stop the turn from 70km down to 35km.\n\nWith each turn altitude, I did 2 launches and got the same result both times so I figure this is consistent.\n\nResults:\n\n70km turn stop required 3233m/s (measured on the vacuum side of the table for all results)\u002B\n\n50km turn stop required 3129m/s\n\n40km turn stop required 3071m/s\n\n35km turn stop required 3050m/s\n\n\u002B I only read the vacuum side because that\u0027s what I care about once it\u0027s up.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt\u0027s best to level out at 35km, which is just above the last noticeable blue in the pressure indicator.\n\n2nd Round\n\nI\u0027m in the habit of \u0022overlapping\u0022 my stages (it cuts down on pesky debris). By this I mean the last part of the lifter does the 1st part of the transfer burn so it ends up well away from LKO, then the actual transfer stage does the 1st part of the landing so it will be sure to crash. Thus, the ship in Round 1 above didn\u0027t have quite enough left in the lifter for my tastes, so I added some fuel to the 1st set of asparagus booster, keeping the same engines of a central Mainsail surrounded by 4 Skippers. This had 3438m/s (vac) in the lifter and an initial TWR of 1.33. I then launched this rocket using the 35km turn stop altitude obtained in round 1.\n\nResult: 3092m/s required to reach 100km, 346m/s left in the tank at 100km.\n\nI then swapped out the Skippers on the 1st (bigger) asparagus boosters for Mainsails, keeping everything else the same. This dropped the lifter dV down to 3307m/s (vac) but raised the TWR to 1.84. Again, launched with the same ascent profile (1km start, 65% curve, 35km stop).\n\nResult: 2789m/s required to reach 100km, 518m/s left in the tank at 100km.\n\nConclusion:\n\nFor a given flight profile, a higher TWR trumps a higher dV total, at least up to a point. The 3-Mainsail/2-Skipper version got some mach effects shortly before the Mainsail boosters dropped, which I\u0027m sure is inefficient. Plus, Kerbals don\u0027t like long periods of high Gs. Thus, it\u0027s probably not a good idea to overpower your rockets. FAR didn\u0027t like to exceed about 1.5 Gs for most of the launch, which is why I tried to keep my initial TWRs rather low.\n\n**BOTTOM LINE**\n\nAn ascent profile that has you level off about 35km will save you fuel. So will higher TWRs, even if you have less dV to start with. The main point, however, is that the \u0022new standard\u0022 of 3400m/s to LKO is way too high. It should be closer to 3000m/s, maybe even less. I can do it in 2800m/s if I try hard enough.\n\nFuture Study\n\nThe obvious next step is to vary the shape of the curve and also the altitude to start turning. I suspect (as it was in FAR) that a curve that starts slowly and finishes quickly (that is, \u003E 50%) will prove the best. The idea is to get through the thicker part of the atmosphere quickly, which probably explains wihy having a higher initial TWR also helps, then drop those engines for more fuel efficiency once you\u0027ve got some altitude and speed.\n\nNOTE: I\u0022m sure most vets have figured this out already. I say this for the benefit of the players, especially those coming in and seeing folks saying it takes 3400m/s to get to LKO.\n\nHere\u0027s a pic of my ridiculous test rocket in both 1-Mainsail / 4 Skipper side-by-side with the 3-Mainsail / 2-Skipper version. See for yourself.\n\n[![16683220894_2ae0783651_o.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7710/16683220894_2ae0783651_o.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/rqeSky)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:15:49Z","Content":"Seconding the modified profile.

Fuel lines run from the big boosters to the small boosters, and from the small boosters to the core.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I noticed mechjeb displyway too low dV numbers when you set all engines to fire at once and then drop some of the boosters in flight, like in your asparagus setup. Also what are the mechjeb ascend stats reporting?\n\nFor the purposes of training to figure out the most efficient launch profile, it doesn\u0027t matter how MJ calculates its numbers as long as it does its calculations the same way each time. This allows making relative comparisons between different launch profiles for the same rocket, which was the whole reason for running these tests. It\u0027s not the absolute numbers that matter, it\u0027s the trends.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is the important part; a limit is only so useful for planning purposes if people can\u0027t achieve it.\n\u003E MechJeb can be easily confused by multiple stages, so it may not be giving you an accurate reading (even though it\u0027s consistent with itself).\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, the 3400 m/sec figure is assuming vacuum Isp throughout the flight, which would yield a DV budget somewhat higher than what\u0027s actually used.\n\nRight, just like the old 4500m/s standard was based on the vacuum Isp. Which is a logical thing given that for the vast bulk of any space trip, it\u0027s the vacuum Isp that matters, starting with what\u0027s left in the tank immediately after launch. The goal, therefore, is to fly the launch in such a way that you have as much vacuum dV after launch as possible for whatever stage you\u0027re using for the next phase of the mission. Thus, unlike a spaceplane, with a rocket you really don\u0027t care about atmospheric Isp except to avoid the obvious pitfalls like trying to launch with LV-Ns or (as of 1.0) 909s. For most other engines, there\u0027s really not a lot of difference between atmospheric and vacuum performance anyway.\n\nIs using vacuum Isp and dV numbers for planning purposes absolutely accurate? No. However, it does produce useful rules of thumb because the whole process is internally consistent and easily understood. Now, if you want absolute accuracy, and to carefully design and perfectly fly a rocket right on your calculated path, you certainly can. And you just might get more efficiency that way. But do you get enough to make any real difference for gameplay purposes, in terms of cost? Probably not. Plus, you spend all that time worrying about just getting off the ground instead of actually going places. Maybe that\u0027s your thing and if so, rock on. But most folks just want to kick the tires and light the fires, so simple rules of thumb that reliably and accurately enough approximate the detailed calculations are good enough.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Besides the things already mentioned re: atmospheric Isp and thrust relationship, there\u0027s something else to consider:\n\u003E In the past it was easy to give a single number like 4500 m/s for the launch to Kerbin orbit because craft shape literally didn\u0027t matter. But now it does. That means differently shaped rockets are going to require different amounts of dV to orbit, even if they fly the exact same launch profile with the exact same TWR.\n\u003E \n\u003E Blanket figures are a lot less reliable now than they were in the past, and dV maps will 8and should) probably err towards the higher end of the range.\n\nThis is quite true. If you try to fly a pancake, it will burn more fuel than a needle of the same mass and theoretical dV on board. I suppose I could have put in a caveat about that, but OTOH I assume that most folks would be aware of this given the emphasis placed on the new aerodynamics. Still, however, the same processes work on all rockets during launch. Thus, all rockets should benefit in the same way from the same sorts of ascent path refinements, although the blunter rockets won\u0027t get as much benefit as the sleeker ones.\n\nAnother design issue folks now need to be aware of in stock is the relative position of the CoM and the CoL, from which stability and the ability to control the rocket during launch derive. As with an arrow, the closer to the top the CoM, and the closer to the bottom the CoL, the better the rocket will fly. This is, however, not nearly such an issue as it is in NEAR/FAR. Classic KSP-style asparagus staging of multiple huge boosters, as shown in my pic above, is still quite possible, whereas it really isn\u0027t in NEAR/FAR. Also, if you need to move the CoL further aft in a stock rocket, you get a lot more bang for a smaller number of smaller tail fins than you do in NEAR/FAR. The upshot of this is that nowadays, as you build your rocket from the top down, you need to check the CoM/CoL placement of each stage that will be flying in the atmosphere and fix that prior to adding more stages below and to the sides, and checking them as well taking the pre-existing stages into account.\n\nI suppose some folks will complain that the new air is a half-measure because it doesn\u0027t doom the classic KSP pancake lifter, it just imposes a few constraints that can be dealt with. To which I say, if somebody can make a pancake fly, and is willing to pay the price, good for them if that\u0027s what they consider fun. Besides, the way the new tech tree is laid out, combined with the need to level up multiple Kerbals at once, means that mission payloads grow faster than single stacks of the then-available rockets can support. Thus, you need to be able to do some asparagus, especially considering that you now have to buy several top-tier nodes to get all the parts needed to use 3.75m rockets. And that\u0027s all there is in stock. To avoid pancakes and apsaragus after that, you need a mod with 5m rockets.\n\nBut all the above just goes to show that how you can spiral off into all sorts of issues if you want to over-analyze the seemingly simple question of \u0022how much dV do I need to get off the ground?\u0022 I\u0027m just saying that even with all the new factors involved, you can still give this a simple answer, provided you make some underlying assumptions."},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:40:11Z","Content":"Great analysis OP, please keep us updated on the results of your further tests."},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T18:22:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have only made launches so far in science mode, but this does fit with what I observe.\n\u003E Done right, you can get out the atmosphere with less fuel than v0.90 but you need very fine timing on the burn to get the circular orbit.\n\u003E \n\u003E The single nose chute will land on hard ground with a service bay and heatshield.\n\u003E \n\u003E Battery management changes a lot with the need to keep close to retrograde alignment for re-entry.
