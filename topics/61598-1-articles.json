KSP is rooted firmly in the Unity Engine. The scale, physics, and orbital mechanics plugins that Squad make use of through it work out very, very well for our little Kerbalnauts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if they had (or at some future point) decided to use the Outerra engine? It\u0027s a planetary modeling engine which covers all the HQ detail from orbital view to ground level, has built in vehicle and aircraft physics, and procedural generation for the environment. It\u0027s so darn pretty, it makes me wonder what KSP \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E have looked like had this been on the plate 2-3 years ago. Granted, it would blow system requirements completely out of the water in comparison to current... But, oh my, the possibilities!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just stumbled upon a link to it reading Fark this morning, check it at outerra.com out if you\u0027re curious.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diewoe","CreatedById":34063,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T15:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI ran across the Outerra engine many years ago and the detail is out of this world. Had KSP used that engine instead of the cartoonish one they use now it would have looked beautiful but this engine makes the game more fun for a larger range of players. I can not even imagine the lag that Outerra\u0027s detail would cause seeing as we get enough in the unity engine.

But looking beyond that, just for the graphics quality, it sure would have been impressive \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIronically, considering lag or frame rates, I think the KSP would perform better in Outerra than it does Unity. Outerra natively supports multi threading through all available CPU cores and makes use of advanced GPU rendering abilities. The performance gulf current KSP players have between people with average PC\u0027s and monster Gaming Rigs would become a lot more noticable, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat looks something like SpaceEngine.

All you\u0027ll get is a glaringly bright milky-white ball. Think \u0022distance fog\u0022 in normal game engines, except the entire atmosphere is made of it.
