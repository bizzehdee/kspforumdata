Since I got this I have had loads to do and learnt alot in the process.\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t get this lander to the mun for the life of me (the fuel budget was too tight for someone as new as me I think) so I ended up putting it in orbit around the mun and sending up a refueling ship to dock with it. I had a bit of a hard time building a decent refueling ship but I finally got a big clumsy thing up there to dock with it. I realized once I had docked that I was going to have to deorbit the refueling ship - so I had to EVA all the kerbals into the moon rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI landed the moon rover fine but wanted to bring the kerbals back so I sent up a rescue mission - which landed about 30K away from the rover. I am currently driving the rover over to the rescue ship as I don\u0027t have enough fuel for my lander to take off and re-land any closer (I\u0027m actually slightly worried about whether I have enough to get back to Kerbin as is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drive so far has been very smooth although I must say it looks alot easier using mechjeb!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway thanks again for the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome story!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad you like it.
