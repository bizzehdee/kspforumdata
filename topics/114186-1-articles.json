Just warp to the Periapsis marker, then burn retrograde until your trajectory closes into an orbit. \n\nAnd **don\u0027t press** the Reset button. It\u0027s there for when you messed up badly. In your case the situation is perfectly manageable if somewhat unoptimal (very high periapsis)."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T13:26:21Z","Content":"burn retrograde at perapsis, assuming you\u0027ve got fuel left, you\u0027re doing fine"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T14:02:32Z","Content":"Let\u0027s try to describe it without any space-specific terms.\n\n- on the right side of your navball, there is a green curved line with a red \u0022X\u0022 button on the top. This belongs to your previous waypoint that you already have passed.\n\n You will not need it anymore, so click the red \u0022X\u0022.\n\n- now look at the map, at the bottom of the blue line - that icon - is your ship. There is a marker roughly at halfway of the blue line - thats your closest point to the Mun.\n\n The blue circle is where you will exit the Mun\u0027s area.\n\nOk, you want to get to Mun\u0027s orbit and if you don\u0027t do anything then you will do a flyby - which is not bad but you want to land there, do you?\n\nIn order to get to a Mun orbit - a closed and strable \u0022circle\u0022 around the Mun - you will need to \u0022break\u0022, best place to do this is at the closest point to the Mun.\n\n- you can accelerate time in the upper left corner, try to forward a bit until you are close to the marker with \u0022pe\u0022 on it. Or click the blue line and select \u0022warp here\u0022.\n\n- Now, point your ship backwards to your flight path. In the navball (lower middle), the circle that has the small green \u0022X\u0022 in it has to be in the middle - then you are flying backwards (the empty circle is pointing forward)\n\n- Now acceperate slowly and watch the blue orbit line changing. It will bend towards the Mun and finally form a circle.\n\n- stop your engines or you will further lower your flightpath and eventually crashland on Mun\n\nDont give up and let us know if you need more help.\n\nFjord"},{"CreatedByName":"modybird","CreatedById":146703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T17:07:56Z","Content":"Now im starting to get this alot, tried 4 times [http://imgur.com/yiqHADv](http://imgur.com/yiqHADv)"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T17:26:44Z","Content":"You should really try to describe what you are doing and what your problem is instead of making people guess what your picture should tell them.\n\nFrom what I can see you simply have to burn a bit radially to raise your periapsis and then burn retrograde at periapsis until you have an orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T18:24:01Z","Content":"For that one, you just need to follow Gene\u0027s instructions.

This isn\u0027t good. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) So do like the good Flight Director says, set up a maneuver node (click anywhere on the blue line in front of your ship) and experiment with dragging the blue handles until your orbit doesn\u0027t intersect the Mun any more."},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T18:55:52Z","Content":"I suggest watching tutorials on youtube while running the game on the side in windowed mode and doing everything exactly like in the video.

This is a game that takes patience and a willingness to learn.

The in-game tutorials, while fine, can be inadequate for some players. Personally myself I was able to learn the basics much quicker and easier by watching youtube vids instead of the in-game tutorials, plus they teach you a lot more stuff that\u0027s not found in the tutorials."}]}
