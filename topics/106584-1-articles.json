And try using a gimballed engine on your 2nd stage to have more control, here you used the LV30, wich just won\u0027t do for a 2nd stage in this configuration. And overall, start your gravity turn sooner ! And in order not to flip over, do not deviate from your prograde marker too much. \n\n(with that you should be able to get it in orbit)"}]}
