Prop engine types from both mods use mesh transformation, or in other words, once propeler start to spin at higher rates, propeler mesh is replaced with \u0022blured disk\u0022 mesh that mimics high speed propeler rotation. But such \u0022blured disk\u0022 is no longer real propeler made from small \u0022wings\u0022 and as such it does not create any phantom torque, only forward thrust.\n\nIt is easy to test, just create craft with fuselage and engine, without any wings. Put landing gears in such way that craft is easy to tip over when rotated, or at least on very soft springs. If engine create any torque it will be visible trough whole craft behaviour with brakes ON and engine at full throttle.\n\nOther, more accurate test can be made with IR mod and free move bearings. Create craft that stands on launch clamps and put bearing between fuselage and engine. You can put some small simetrical parts like thermometer or something to have some markings to observe possible rotation.\n\nOn the otehr hand, if you use powered bearings and \u0022propeler\u0022 made from control surfaces or small wings, torque is more than noticable."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-18T19:34:51Z","Content":"Yeah, there may be an advanced prop engine mod I\u0027m not aware of with torque, but traditional prop engine mods are just visual effects on top of normal engines - by which I mean fuel in, thrust out, end of matter.

And in this plane the center of gravity does not move a lot if at all.\n\u003E \n\nOne thing here is that I\u0027m generally used to flying spaceplanes, which is a different type of animal entirely. My designs usually have wing loading in the 0.4-0.5 tonnes/square meter range, which means higher takeoff and landing speeds than an subsonic aircraft like this one. I\u0027m also used to a negative \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAOA\u003C/abbr\u003E gear configuration (going all the way back to the topic in [keptin](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/47818-basic-aircraft-design-explained-simply-with-pictures/)\u0027s discussion), which once again lends itself to higher takeoff and landing speeds. So it\u0027s probably just how I was flying the plane/how I typically handle landings. Incidentally, I did try replacing the back gear with extra-large gears (so I\u0027d get the negative \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAOA\u003C/abbr\u003E gear configuration), and was able to land the plane just fine at around 90 m/s. The plane still wanted to bounce, but the fuselage was higher up off the ground so I didn\u0027t slam the tail into the ground in the process.\n\nThat all said, my observations concur with yours, in that the plane doesn\u0027t want to pitch up at speeds in the 80-100 m/s regime. Increasing the length of the horizontal stabilizer a little bit (i.e. improving pitch authority/torque/leverage by increasing the amount of force the tail generates) might help with that.\n\n![oBSA5Lz.png](https://i.imgur.com/oBSA5Lz.png)\n\nIn case you were curious. Not a bad set of curves at all.\n\nThis last screenie shows how the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E moves - the red \u0022dry center of mass\u0022 marker (courtesy of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Build Aid) actually shows it going forward and upwards. Forward moving \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E makes the plane more stable; a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E above the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E makes the plane maneuverable. Couldn\u0027t tell you if those two effects would cancel one another out or not as your fuel drained. As a diagnostic test that I\u0027m thinking about just now, you might want to try reducing your plane\u0027s fuel load to 5% to see what that does to your stability figures. I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s a potential issue there or not."},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-20T17:23:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, capi3101 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m also used to a negative \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAOA\u003C/abbr\u003E gear configuration (going all the way back to the topic in [keptin](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/47818-basic-aircraft-design-explained-simply-with-pictures/)\u0027s discussion), which once again lends itself to higher takeoff and landing speeds.\n\u003E \n\nI use landing gear configuration like that on almost each craft design, never have issue that I need higher craft speed for lift off just because of that. If you need more speed for takeoff with craft configured with nose pitching down on runway vs same craft but landing gear configured for zero nose pitch, you have issue elsewhere.\n\nAs for your craft on picture above, you simply don\u0027t have enough control surface authority. If you don\u0027t want to use procedural wings for whatever reason, try to use all moving control surfaces for elevators. Not enough surface area for elevators is one part of issue.\n\nSecond thing to improve take off, try to adjust control surfaces in a way that yellow line cross x axis at ~15 degree of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E with 100% of pitch.  \n\nWith zero pitch input from pilot, try to set yelow line to cross x axis at ~1-2 degree of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Plane looks really good too.\n\nI assume you\u0027re talking about a tail-less delta in your second sentence there. In general, those require larger pitching control surfaces with higher deflections than tailed deltas to offset the reduced leverage.\n\nLet me explain - torque is defined mathematically as the cross-product of a position vector and a force vector, which comes out to the magnitude of the position vector times the magnitude of the force vector times the sine of the angle between them. Increasing any one of those three values increases torque, which in an aircraft means more authority along any given axis. That\u0027s why in a typical tailed design you want the tail as far up and as far back as you can get it; by doing so, you\u0027ve increased the length of the lever arm (the distance between the control surface and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E of the plane, which acts as the fulcrum) and the angle between the two vectors. In a tail-less design, those control surfaces are in-line with the wing, which means there\u0027s a greater tendency for the two force vectors to line-up, which you don\u0027t want (sin0=0). So, to offset, your control surfaces need to be able to generate more force (hence the reason I suggest larger surfaces). The part about suggesting higher deflection values is also because maths. Higher thrust can also help, of course.\n\nI could be completely wrong here; sure would appreciate being refuted by a more senior \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E veteran if I am."},{"CreatedByName":"Surefoot","CreatedById":89084,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-11T16:15:51Z","Content":"Yeah i have 700 hours of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E KSP under my belt, i used to nail tailless delta SSTOs but i seem to have lost my mojo ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) I stopped playing for about a year and just started again, exactly thanks to [Atmosphere Autopilot](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/124417-12-atmosphereautopilot-158/) which allows exploring new flight characteristics.

Makes me think the real thing will be quite fearsome since they also seemed to improve a lot upon SU-27 family avionics."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-13T20:05:13Z","Content":"To be fair, western ACM doctrine does not include deliberately stalling so that type of trick aero is limited to research - I\u0027ve no doubt someone could build something like that, the cost of an actual combat aircraft would probably bankrupt nations though...\n\nI tend to build combat craft for BDA, which doesn\u0027t like regaining energy much - so I try not to lose it in the first place."},{"CreatedByName":"Surefoot","CreatedById":89084,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-13T23:49:33Z","Content":"The Rafale is also built for high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, so far in combat exercices it\u0027s superior to most alternatives, be it BVR or dogfight.

All things being equal, wing sweep affects performance at high speeds; the higher the degree of sweep, the better the craft performs at high speeds. If I understand it correctly, sweep shouldn\u0027t have the kind of effect you\u0027re looking for."}]}
