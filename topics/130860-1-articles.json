The problem with this is\u00A0you have to place thrusters exactly the at same distance from the centre\u00A0of gravity for them not to give you unwanted translations.\u00A0I think it would be nice if the thrust of\u00A0each thruster was balanced to give you\u00A0full translation or rotation instead. This way you could just place your rcs thrusters as far apart from each other as possible for maximum moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T23:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you enable fine control (default is capslock) the RCS will scale their thrust, and keeping level is a lot easier \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T01:16:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have any thoughts because I find docking mode useless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
