I can click on the gear in the hangar but when I am on the runway or flying I can\u0027t click on them.

I can raise and lower the gear and the brakes work too."},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T22:21:03Z","Content":"The spot you have to click for them is a little off.

It is simple in the hangar but they don\u0027t seem to exist outside the hangar."},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:43:35Z","Content":"Could you post a .craft file of your plane? It will allow us to troubleshoot with you. I wonder if the lander gear is clipped too far in."},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:58:20Z","Content":"Yeah, post the craft file.
