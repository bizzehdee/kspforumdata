As far as I know the only identifier of asteroid class is the \u0022size\u0022 value from DiscoveryInfo (0-4 for classes A-E). But regular vessels also have that value and once you dock to asteroid its value is overwritten by the vessel\u0027s size info, which I think defaults to 2. I\u0027m getting around this by classifying asteroids by mass, but that only works once the actual asteroid part has been loaded at least once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that should definitely be added (because it gets asked about every other page on this thread) is to work the altitudes for each scanner into the VAB tooltip. I think putting them into GetInfo (the right-click-for-more-info button) would be the best idea since it would accurately reflect any changes made by users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the MapTraq button should say \u0022Start Scanners\u0022 or something to that effect instead of \u0022Open Map\u0022, since it doesn\u0027t actually do that. Or you could make it actually open the map window. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, and I\u0027m not sure if anyone cares about this, if you collect science results, save the game then quit, I think those results will be erased. I don\u0027t think this matters much, but if you didn\u0027t have a transmitter for some reason, or aren\u0027t able to transmit your results this would mean you would have to make a return trip to Kerbin without saving and loading (adding an EVA data collection method is also an option). It\u0027s very easy to save this information to the persistent file and pull it out again upon loading. There is also a better way of transmitting data, using the current method, if your transmitters are all busy when you try to transmit SCANsat data it just won\u0027t be sent. It\u0027s not difficult to add data to the transmitter queue the way it\u0027s supposed to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there are some other things that will come to mind later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T16:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks technogeeky for showing the plan.

They know the reason they put SCANsat in all pods was to eliminate the need for the scanner part so I\u0027m pretty sure they\u0027d know why there is a scanning button but no part.
