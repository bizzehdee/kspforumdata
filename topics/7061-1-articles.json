I am new to the forums but have been playing Kerbal since last August. I have been working at this ship for a while and it has been made possible with the C7 flight pack and nova punch. I can get this sexy lady into space using two gigantic rockets on either side but as you might guess she has absolutely no maneuverability once up there and I can\\\u0027t get her into orbit. I\\\u0027m curious if any of you have tried this or what your suggestions might be. Anyways, this is my first post and I wanted to share! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eupdate: maybe if I put the craft file up here it will get more attention. It\\\u0027s super neat and fun to fly! She can make orbit or send her out of the solar system, plenty of fuel for any trip. I am now seeing what it can take into orbit. It is still amazingly stable with objects attached under the saucer section. As a bonus I made the saucer detachable and it can fly on its own engines! Note: flying out of the first stage boosters is just a little tricky, cut throttle on boosters before you run out of juice and then ease her on out of there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC7 flight pack and experimental\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovaPunch Remix\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-26T23:21:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-26T23:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClose enough!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pair of skis","CreatedById":16773,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-26T23:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESWOOSH!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPair of skis\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-27T00:10:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA fair while back, I read a science magazine article about how spaceworthy the ships of science fiction probably were.
