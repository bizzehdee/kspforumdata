I suspect that folding the arrangement for liftoff and unfolding at the destination would be frought with ways the thing could go wrong, and in a thin atmosphere, I\u0027m not sure it would be more effective than the structurally much simpler parachutes. And if you only had one rotor and it was powered, you\u0027d have to worry about the torque on the vehicle.
