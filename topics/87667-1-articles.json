I find it strange that The Space Shuttle is extremely underrepresented in the KSP community. Yes I am fully aware of the Tiberion Shuttles and KSO. Both are a lot of fun and I have used them extensively over my tenure playing KSP. However a proper Space Shuttle Mod does not really exist anymore. I am fully aware of the Component Space Shuttle mod. I have also used it quite a bit and that has what inspired me to write this post. It was such an exquisite mod but it is growing older and older with each update along with its dependences. Many of its dependences have even become outdated. Modders and users have taken up maintaing it but it just seems that it is destined to die like its real life counterpart. I mean there are so many extremely popular mods out there that represent real life rockets and ships, Soyuz, Skylab, Saturn V, Gemini, Mercury, Proton, Dragon, etc. I mean there are mods that exist for all of the real life probes and rovers, but something perfectly suited for KSP is not represented. I mean the Space Shuttle is a rocket and a plane, so much can be done with a proper space shuttle mod. I mean we also have countless mods for Space Station building wouldn\u0027t a shuttle be a great addition to space station construction? I am not a modder, I wish I was. If i possessed the skills I would have made a space shuttle mod a long time ago. I even downloaded blender thinking I could give it a go. I opened up the software cried and decided I would leave the modding to the people who are good at it. Anyway I am just looking for a good realistic Shuttle Mod. Anyone willing to give it a go?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECSS Mod Link:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71360-Component-Space-Shuttle-dev-thread-IMG-heavy%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71360-Component-Space-Shuttle-dev-thread-IMG-heavy%21\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-17T18:03:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2014 06:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sp1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T18:29:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENext version the Mk3 fuselage system is being updated and I think increased in size as well.
