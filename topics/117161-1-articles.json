It\u0027s not obsolete, but it offers a nice historical insight. It\u0027s also very informative. A book was published following the mini series. It was pretty huge with nice color images.\n\nI can only recommend it for everyone into planetary geology and Solar system exploration."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T12:20:05Z","Content":"Is it that one where they\u0027re in the ship?
