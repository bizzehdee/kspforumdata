So spamming intakes is no longer useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat also means that you need to use your rocket engines earlier and need to bring more oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo many wings will induce a lot of drag. From what I read in the Squadcast Summary, there is a bug with part occlusion that generates more drag then intended. Don\u0027t know if that applies to wings. From what I see in the screenshots, you don\u0027t have too many wings though. (I think)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have trouble breaking the soundbarrier, do the following. Climb to a high altitude, gain as much speed as you can, then go into a light dive to gain more speed. That way you can breach th sound barrier without additional engine power. When you reach mach 1.2, drag will decrease again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T14:44:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a RAPIER/Nuke design, but if you take the airframe and convert it to turbojets and LV-T45\u0027s it should work for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/E2XwW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
