If you want a black-and-white image sure (or even grayscale) you can pack multiples into a DXT for savings. Indeed you could even pack three 8bits into a DXT1 with some quality loss, for the usual 1/6 ratio. Though the shader code would have to unpack it, you\u0027d have to pass a shader var to say which channel to use (or, if \u0026lt;8b/channel of the desired image, which portion of the channel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(h/t to asmi who pointed out I was being incomplete before)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rbray89","CreatedById":48847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T03:15:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@rbray: I was thinking more about city lights and I was wondering...\u003Cp\u003E1) How hard would it be to run the city lights through a mask to decide to show them or not, based on a binary image (1 bit monochrome)?
