Activate Engine activates the engine and Run Test activates the engine. Also the controls are wack please add mouse and keyboard support. Might just refund the game and keep playing my basic 2D spaceflight simulator that actually works. Oh yeah and my question was how do i test my engine correctly or another question would be what is wrong with this game it was supposed to be good\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dbulhelix","CreatedById":196607,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-16T01:01:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany have reported these issues.

Perhaps the \u0027flea\u0027 isn\u0027t recognized any longer, because they\u0027ve updated it in recent builds. It seems to be happening to the Hammer too. Possibly all the solid fuel rockets?
