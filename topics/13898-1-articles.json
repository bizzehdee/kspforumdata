The dark side is a pain to land on, though I have done it myself. It\\\u0027s just harder to judge the latter stages of the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, always try to have a bit of spare fuel, just in case. No more than one small spare tank, though, otherwise it gets too heavy. You may want to try the stop and drop method. Once you get to about 60km above the Munar surface, click the little window displaying speed to calibrate it for surface. This means that it takes into account the Mun\\\u0027s rotation. Burn retrograde until your velocity is just about zero. This basically tries to control both descent speed and velocity relative to the surface at the same time, so that when you do the final descent, you won\\\u0027t end up flying sideways into a hill. Once you\\\u0027ve done this, reorient so that your ship is facing straight up, engines pointing downwards. Turn SAS on. It\\\u0027s a good idea to have ASAS so you needn\\\u0027t worry too much about keeping the craft oriented properly. You \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill\u003C/strong\u003E need RCS if you want to fine-tune your horizontal movement so you don\\\u0027t snap off any lander legs as you touch down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, wait until you get to around 20km up. You should still have your engines pointed directly down. Burn until your velocity is less than 50m/s. This allows you to keep the speed manageable, so you don\\\u0027t end up flying into the surface at 500m/s despite having full thrust. Then, wait once more. Wait until you\\\u0027re about 8km up. Then, burn again until you\\\u0027re going at less than 40m/s. Once you hit the 40m/s mark, adjust your thrust so you\\\u0027re just slowly decreasing your speed. Decrease speed at around 0.2m/s every few seconds. If you get below 10m/s while still a fair way off the ground, kill the throttle until you\\\u0027re up to around 25m/s again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that almost all of the Mun\\\u0027s surface will be above the 0m on the altitude meter. Some places get up to around 2,500m, so beware. Start a very controlled descent (keep your velocity between 2m/s and 10m/s) around 3,500m. Lower your landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your retrograde indicator is not directly upwards (the little dot in the very center of the blue region of the navball), make sure your rocket is oriented towards that dot, and activate RCS. Here\\\u0027s where you need it. By this point, the velocity meter should read \u0027surface\u0027, if you haven\\\u0027t bothered to change it yourself. Using the RCS translation controls (by default, I,J,K,L) to get your retrograde velocity indicator pointing directly up. The left and right (J and L) affect the indicator in reverse (using the Left -- J -- makes it move right and vice versa) whilst the forward/back (think of them as up/down on the navball) are not reversed. It\\\u0027s a bit confusing, but not difficult once you get the hang of it. Keep an eye on your velocity through this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you start noticing the terrain coming up slowly around you (it is REALLY noticeable, btw), then prepare to slow down below 3m/s. Stay below 3m/s if you can, cutting throttle if necessary to avoid going back up again. Any speed under 6m/s is pretty safe, but under 4m/s is ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-09T16:06:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ekknight13, what is going wrong and what does your ship look like? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I really don\\\u0027t like the stop-high-and-descend-straight method. There are too many ways to screw it up as you descend and descend and descend. Some of us like to bring periapsis down to about 3000m (on Mun), brake hard, and then bring remaining lateral speed to zero just by backwards-steering toward the retrograde marker. I don\\\u0027t want to muck with lateral RCS while I\\\u0027m already trying to steer, throttle, and watch terrain; it\\\u0027s just too many buttons to be mashing all at once. But I do use RCS at the last second, to brake from around 10m/s to 5 or less. I cut throttle about 1 ship-length from actual touchdown to prevent that *$^%! ship-killing bounce that the springy landing legs are prone to, and float down like a feather on RCS pulses, which are much more fine-controllable and responsive than the lagging throttle. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-09T19:16:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you think a better ship will help try out my MOONCRASHERs 2 or higher there stock and the MOONCRASHER 5 should be able to land you on minmus and the mun and maybe even back to another moon then back to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13373.msg220768#msg220768\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13373.msg220768#msg220768\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nomer","CreatedById":30789,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-09T19:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kknight13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kknight13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have yet to make a sucessful landing on the mun and i was wondering if i could get advice/assistance.
