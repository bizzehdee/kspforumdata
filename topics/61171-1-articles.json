It seems to attract engineers, astronomers, electricians, etc... and from all across the world. And because of this, I think the community in many cases reflects the professionalism that goes along with that. It encouraged me to learn more about aerodynamics and orbital mechanics not just for the game, but also to understand the concepts others were talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, Starbound just released a patch today. I\u0027ve been a bit disappointed about fall damage and jump height since it was heavily nerfed a while back, so I hopped onto the forums to see if someone had perhaps made a mod addressing this and was almost immediately dissolved in imploding vitriol and I immediately regretted being there. And I think it sort of shows something important\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACwhen you build an intelligent game, or at least one that rewards a certain degree of intelligence, you encourage intelligence in your community. Starbound is by no means a bad game, but at this stage its a very easy game and it takes very few brain cells to play. I would posit that because of this, the average post on their forums also takes very few brain cells to post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess whether or not you think that\u0027s funny really depends on your sense of humor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TimMartland","CreatedById":68334,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T14:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeh, your not the only one to notice this.

KSP is, quite frankly, a game that you will never really get anywhere with if you lack at least a modicum of intelligence.

I\u0027ve already known several people who bought KSP after seeing a few cool-looking ships and comedic YouTube videos, thinking this was some kind of Garry\u0027s Mod in which they could dash around in circles, spawning dynamite under ragdolls and guffawing endlessly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithin a week of purchase, they were loudly complaining to me that they couldn\u0027t even land on Mun; I naturally linked them to Scott Manley\u0027s beginner orbital tutorial, which was the only reason I ever made it to space because, like most complete novices, I thought you had to burn-up-until-space-then-go-sideways-lots.

I think most people stick to their forum of choice there, the tone is quite different from thread to thread.
