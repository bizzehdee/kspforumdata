So essentially adding engines does not increase delta V. Adding fuel obviously does. So for a noob the two factors in spaceflight rocket science are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. delta V corresponds to how far your vehicle can travel which roughly translates into how much fuel you\u0027ve got.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Delta-V, as I would explain it, is a measure of how much you can change your vector. Also, adding more fuel isn\u0027t the only solution to more delta-V since you\u0027re adding mass that your engines have to shift (change vector). Adding another engine along with fuel can often result in more delta-V since you\u0027re able to change your vector faster with stronger engines (and more fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022inigma\u0022 data-cite=\u0022inigma\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2.
