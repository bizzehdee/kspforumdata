The only problem is this: I don\u0027t know where to start! I could code it easily enough, but I don\u0027t know what tools I\u0027ll need, what resources from KSP I\u0027ll need to access/modify, etc. If someone could point me in the right direction on where to get started with this, I would appreciate it greatly.

There isn\u0027t really any \u0022getting started\u0022 topic here that flat-out tells you what software you need to code and compile a mod for KSP, at least that I could find. A couple of high-level ones like the \u0022help a fellow modder out\u0022 and \u0022debugging\u0022 topics, but that\u0027s definitely more advanced than someone who\u0027s completely unaware of where to start is going to be helped by.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T17:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis [thread=94638]thread[/thread] is primarily concerned with modeling, but at the bottom has a number of useful links for plugin development.
