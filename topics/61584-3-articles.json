Applied torques are point independent for a rigid body. Now, keep in mind that bodies in KSP are not perfectly rigid, so there may or may not be some whipping effect.

As far as benefiting scansat, I think that in general it adds an extra layer of challenge to the proceedings, since you must consume resources to maintain attitude. Perhaps this would allow the implementation of some sort of gravity gradient stabilization simulation (it\u0027d have to be faked since actual gravity gradient is no longer in the game) which would make planet-facing satellites possible. There are quite a few possibilities!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeroignite","CreatedById":1377,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T17:24:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m definitely interested in this... guilty here of warping to stop rotation of huge ships/asteroids.
