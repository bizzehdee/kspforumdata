The Tokomak size determines the kind of plasma density that can be achieved in the Tokomak but if you switch to He-3 or D/He-3 you\u0027ll get far fewer reactions compared to D/T. You\u0027re introducing atoms that have 2 protons instead of just 1, which leads to a vastly increased coulomb barrier, meaning fewer atoms undergo fusion. That leads to significantly reduced power output, D/He-3 is actually more fuel efficient than D/T because fuel consumption goes down even more than the power output does.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, thanks for the explanation, but why this effect doesn\u0027t happen in 1.25m and 0.625m reactors? 1.25m He-3 reactor has bigger output then 2.5m He-3 reactor \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"db48x","CreatedById":66108,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T18:26:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smunisto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smunisto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do you figure out the coordinates where you have to place the impactor sensors?

And thus greater net power output. This is one reason why current fusion reactors like the ITER being built in France are built as large as the budget allows. Interestingly, the opposite is true with a polywell design where a smaller vessel will typically be more efficient because of the higher plasma density and thus higher reaction rates (though those do not break even with current designs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: to be clear.
