What is the workaround for the ECLSS monopropellant bug? I know everyone isn\u0027t flying without RCS fuel or just not doing EVA. It seems the most simple solution would be giving Kerbals a full tank of RCS fuel without taking it from the craft. This mod inspired me to use life support and I\u0027m loving it! Great work guys!
