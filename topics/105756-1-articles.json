It seems like the parachutes create enormous drag in 1.0 and are indestructible. The drag level may actually be perfectly fine but since they are indestructible and parts do not seem hurt by massive G\u0027s there is no reason to bother with proper re-entries or heat shields. You can just slam your pod into the atmosphere and pop your chute and all will be okay no matter your velocity or altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:38:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBu then theres the problem of the new aero : if you launch a basic capsule\u002Bheatshield and small chute on a eccentric suborbital flight, the re-entry is pretty steep : while not using the chutes you decelerate WAY too slowly when not using a chute.

The atmosphere is thin so one of two things hapenned:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Parachutes didn\u0027t kill enough speed so there was a litho-brake with a big explosion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Parachutes were too big and opened too high which led to disassembly of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it took me a lot of fine-tuning to get working parameters.
