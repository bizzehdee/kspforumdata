Ships loading from previous game session when\u00A0loading up the game. I had completed a rescue mission returning the stranded kerbal to kerbin. I saved\u00A0and quit after that mission. Loaded the game a few hours later and the vessel was back in orbit but the mission was marked complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Unable to save. In orbit around Minmus I suddenly was unable to save, exit to menu, or return to space centre or tracking station. The game was not frozen just the buttons from the option menu did nothing when clicked. Only option was to close application. I assume the mission was a wash I didn\u0027t go back in to check.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Contracts disappearing from loaded saved games.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Unable to set a maneuver node when entering map mode. Had to reload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Old craft debris loaded into game, this was the craft from an old rescued kerbal, no kerbal in vessel. When I went to fly this vessel It\u00A0would not see the ship right beside it ( the rescue vessel I built and\u00A0sent up from a previous completed mission that shouldn\u0027t of been there as mentioned in 1st bug).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. No way to focus back on current ship after focussing on a planet. You have to go to the tracking station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. I was able to recover a vessel on the mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. Reverted flight from the launch pad to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E and lost jebidiah. Went to space centre view and the marker showed the craft was still on the launch pad. Tried a few things but couldn\u0027t get Jeb back,\u00A0he vanished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9. I got the dreaded stage scramble bug after an Eva orbiting minmus. This was during my inability to save, quit, go\u00A0to space centre or tracking station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrganizedChaos","CreatedById":179666,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-22T13:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223274521\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169944\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516591915\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168282\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Space Station 4 Crash\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Space Station 4 Crash said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.
