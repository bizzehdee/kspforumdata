You mentioned asking the guy from StageRecovery regarding drag numbers etc... Would you at all be interested in making a modular part that has everything needed for recovery? This would basically be an inline module cq nose-cone with drone core, parachutes, small battery and heatshield (just enough for 1st stage to make re-entry). Now I can hack the SAS and battery, and possibly even a heatshield into the cfg, but the chutes are the main issue I think.
