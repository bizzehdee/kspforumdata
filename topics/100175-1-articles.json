Sometimes 50kg will make a difference.\n\nThat\u0027s why I don\u0027t like weightless parts and weightless kerbals. Can we mark them as physics-less but include their weight in the simulation?"},{"CreatedByName":"PDCWolf","CreatedById":58026,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T04:40:59Z","Content":"Please guys, stop saying that fallacy that physicsless parts boost performance. They don\u0027t. They need to be loaded differently and on crash and timewarp they come in and out of the simulation causing hiccups or slowdowns."},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T05:37:54Z","Content":"The reason they are physicsless is BECAUSE of their weight"},{"CreatedByName":"Ingolifs","CreatedById":137617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T08:03:20Z","Content":"Surely the mass of physicsless parts can be added to the mass of the parent object which they are attached to."},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnV","CreatedById":79006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T13:51:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The reason they are physicsless is BECAUSE of their weight\n\nMaybe you\u0027re right in 0.9, but mass is no longer the only factor anymore when 1.0 is out with the new aero model"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T13:53:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Surely the mass of physicsless parts can be added to the mass of the parent object which they are attached to.\n\nHuh, that\u0027s a very interesting idea.

It\u0027s too small and weak to hold anything and since the joint is still strong, it just flexes wayyy too much and makes it bounce all over the place until obviously something explodes."}]}
