If your computer can take it of course. The ONLY limitation of this category is that the object carried must be DEAD WEIGHT - it cannot be used to help your vehicle move or ACTIVELY stay stable (wrecking ball/crane with cargo for mass distribution is permitted, but NO SAS/wings on the cargo)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.3g Specialist vehicles are allowed to have ALL wheel steering at an unrestricted angle. Go mad. The only restriction is that your wheels must not cause excess strain on the chassis while turning - meaning you will have to adjust your angles the closer you are to the middle of the truck.

Trailers are NOT part of the race - they are only required to demonstrate that your vehicle IS in fact a useable cargo transporter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your trailer may be a flatbed trailer if you prefer, however you DO need fixed railings on it to secure the load - use I-BEAMS or panels, that\u0027s up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No Powered wheels on the trailer for obvious reasons. We are measuring performance of the truck not the trailer after all\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Rear spoiler is to be mounted on a structure extending from the tail section of your truck. The thing you attach your back wing to must NOT be part of the \u0027\u0027load-bearing\u0027\u0027 Chassis or overall structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou said that your truck wheelies when you unlock the Klaw. It does sound like you need a 4 wheeled trailer, with a set of wheels at the front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, you need to change the structure of your truck so that the trailer and it\u0027s weight is spread OVER the back wheels, as opposed to BEHIND them. I will have to put that to the test myself to be honest but at least in theory it should work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like you are were going for a Class-6 truck - in which case a full 44.444 ton load will be a little bit much for your vehicle. Trucks overall have the CoG offset towards the front of the vehicle. This is perfectly natural - my truck during braking stands on the front wheels only due to KSP physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Koolkei\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll 6 of your truck wheels can (and I suspect due to competition between races, SHOULD) be powered. However, your trailer wheels should not be powered at all. Some might argue this is irrelevant since you are not racing with the trailer anyway - but in principle, you are not allowed powered wheels outside of your truck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the RCS placement, I meant the back of the truck itself, as in the overall structure or what is recognized as the \u0027\u0027tail\u0027\u0027 section. I might allow RCS placement on the cab or on TOP of the cab - if you want to have RCS coming out of your exhaust pipes, that\u0027s fine. Do it if you want to, it will look cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@42undead\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t say that you CAN\u0027T have a 6x2 layout. In fact, it is clearly indicated that this is a necessary feature of all vehicles with more than 4 wheels. You are allowed to have limited steering on the back wheels - you are limited to 0.35 on the Tweakable range. Your front wheels (you MAY have more than 2 front wheels, as I said, layout is unrestricted as long as they are arranged symmetrical) can use full 2.0 turn range, which is twice the regular amount of turn. Tweakables included in the pack allow this kind of a modification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApologies for not answering quicker, but I have just found a job and was rather busy at work today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-08T20:10:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2014 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GROOV3ST3R\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Banjo","CreatedById":106920,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T21:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations on the recently found job!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the tips.
