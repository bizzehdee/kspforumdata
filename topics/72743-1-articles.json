Then, the center of lift indicator pops up. If I place any parts, they will not go, and orient themselves at odd angles and do not place. If I try to leave, the button looks as if it has been clicked, but I go into a weird mode where I can mouse over things, but not click them or scroll the screen.

In either case, you should never have to Shift-Click to pickup or place parts. And like Taki said, you use ALT-Click to copy an existing part (but not to place it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I suppose that leads me to the question, are you using any mods? I think some of the editor extensions add hotkeys which toggle various symmetry and angle snap modes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T11:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taki117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taki117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you are trying to copy a part it\u0027s ALT\u002BClick, I have no idea what SHIFT\u002BClick does (If anything) also, pictures of the problem would really help here.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShift\u002Bclick selects the entire craft.
