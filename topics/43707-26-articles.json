Whenever I launch a rocket, even by just locking steering to R(0, 0, 180) and locking the throttle to 1, it tumbles over and does some flips. I use FAR, and I think that the interaction between the two mods is what is causing the issue (as, judging by the success of others, it is safe to assume this mod works). I use a great deal of other mods too, but I think FAR is the culprit.\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone else have experience running this mod with FAR?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple things that may cause flips. One is the fact that I can\u0027t make the ship ignore roll, the math is unexpectedly problematic. All ships start flipped 180 degrees (KSP default) and the UP vector has zero roll, so your ship may flip around wildly trying to meet that roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing is if you don\u0027t have enough torque, this happened during the Squad interview until we both realized he didn\u0027t have enough torque, and this was making his ship go crazy during the gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Payload","CreatedById":4540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T18:36:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk I\u0027ve noticed some disturbing things from this latest update.
