Naturally one of the first things I have tried on it is KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI loaded the official config, which seemed pretty much what I wanted the controls to be mapped to anyway, but the only problem is, the controls never switch away from \u0022Menu Controls\u0022. So when I load a flight, the joystick just moves the camera around and \u0022Y\u0022 increases timewarp, instead of activating \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the flight loads, I get a message in the top right hand corner that says [SteamController]: Flight mode - but the controls aren\u0027t switching. I also can\u0027t figure out how to manually switch the controls to flight mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, yes I could remap the Menu controls to flight controls, but it would be easier if it actually supported the different configurations, as that will just make navigating menus difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo am I missing a trick here? Is there something else I need to do? Is there a way to force the controller to switch modes (I wouldn\u0027t even mind that tbh)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a log if it helps: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/ivrtklna104p7ty/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ivrtklna104p7ty/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Never mind. I am a blithering idiot. My PS4 controller is ALSO configured as a Steam Controller, and I left it plugged in after playing F1 2016. Steam naturally defaulted to the wired connection, and the Steam Controller was being treated as secondary input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-03T10:44:03Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2017 10:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by severedsolo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
