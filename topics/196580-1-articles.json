Which means the same face of Duna and Ike always point toward each other. Which means that if you have a relay landed right in the middle of the Duna-facing side of Ike, then you are guaranteed to always be able to see it from the Ike-facing side of Duna. Which is half the planet. So, 50% permanent coverage with just one relay. Which should be able to see Kerbin 50% of the time. If you put a strong direct antenna on your Duna lander, then you will have a direct signal to Kerbin for something like 25% to\u00A050% of the rest of the time, when the relay is in a comm shadow. So as far as I\u0027m concerned, that\u0027s a heck of a lot of coverage for one dinky little relay that can even gather some Ike science while its there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-28T23:02:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelay coverage requirements depends on several things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n1) Your communication settings determine how many overlapping relays you might need. With default settings, a probe can see a relay even if it\u0027s slightly under the horizon. I\u0027ll often put a pair of identical relays in highly elliptical polar orbits above Duna, 1 above each pole. That covers the entire surface with only short blackout periods as a relay goes around periapsis. I prefer a pair of polar relays to a trio of equatorial relays, because the polar relays can be put into slightly sloppy orbits while the eq trio has to be carefully synced so all 3 orbital periods are identical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n2) Your probe control settings determine whether uncrewed missions can tolerate short blackouts. Default still lets you activate max throttle to get a rough orbit during a blackout, so your probe doesn\u0027t shoot past Duna. You can fine tune the orbit later when you have a comm link that lets you use precise throttle controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n3) Do you like to \u0022wing it\u0022 or do more careful mission planning? Loss of communication during a probe landing can be fatal. If you want to be able to land without much planning you want more relays to guarantee continuous coverage. If you like planning and are patient, probe landings can be done with just a single relay in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne way to build up a comm network over time is to include a relay and probe core on every new transfer stage. You\u0027ll gain an orbital relay for every new lander mission you send to Duna. When you have \u0022too many\u0022 relays at Duna, find an old transfer stage with extra fuel and relocate it to Ike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-29T08:11:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the simplest communication setup is\u00A0strong enough\u00A0direct antenna in the craft and planning/hoping to not lose contact at some critical moment.

Ike does pose a threat to anything orbiting Duna so stick with really high orbits to avoid it; for relaying around Jool one or two really powerful relays in polar orbits of Jool and smaller relays around each moon will probably be the best strategy.
