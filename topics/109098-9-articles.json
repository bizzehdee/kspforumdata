A particularly low TWR ship (e.g. a big Mk3 with only one nuke) may require a bit of extra RAPIER thrust during circularisation, but you still want to do as much as possible of the burn on the hyper-efficient LV-N. Nukes are unnecessary and counterproductive for LKO lifters, but if you\u0027re having to do 1,000m/s\u002B \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV transfer burns after you hit orbit the isp advantage pays off heavily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximum weight? No idea. But the single-engine ship shown in my earlier post is comfortably within the limits; notice how much runway it has to spare. If you want to push the limits and don\u0027t care about elegance, you can always just ski-jump off the end of the runway; so long as you start climbing before you crash into the ocean, you\u0027re all good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe top speed of an aircraft is the point at which thrust is balanced by drag; mass is irrelevant in that calculation, except for the fairly minor factor that more mass -\u0026gt; higher wing loading -\u0026gt; higher AoA -\u0026gt; slightly more drag. Higher jet TWR has relatively little effect on top speed; what you gain from extra engines is primarily acceleration rather than speed. Acceleration is fun, and you need enough to enable takeoff, but if you\u0027re going for range you want to be focussing on top speed rather than acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T17:16:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 05:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T08:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA long-range demonstrator:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/SZeUK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
