Nonetheless, I couldn\u0027t help but think this was a really cool idea, and wanted to have a complete and working one. Moreover, I noted the author of that mod was trying to bring a set of complete Star Trek ships into the game and while I\u0027m not at all saying that\u0027s not a good idea, I was hoping for something a bit more bare-bones and that would integrate more nicely and directly with the Kerbal vessels and parts I was used to playing with. And given I\u0027d already been dabbling in other directions with KSP modding, I thought I\u0027d try and roll another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHence, I present: \u0022Cochrane\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this take, the Star Trek-style nacelles-and-core design is employed, but it\u0027s been shrunk and modified to fit more nicely and integratedly onto a Kerbal rocket stack, as shown in this picture - note that I \u003Cem\u003Edo not yet have texturing\u003C/em\u003E done on the parts shown here (you can only see the nacelles - though the default colors I find work nice enough for such a preview screenie at least, and likely suggest that the final texture will aim to produce similar colors but with proper shading and also suitably glowy bits), it\u0027s just a rough illustration so far (hence WIP). The warp core in this one accepts a 1.25m connection to the rest of the stack, and in the testing rig pictured here is sandwiched between Nertea\u0027s damn fine parts, with a LqdDeuterium tank below and Antimatter containment above. The nacelles are surface-mount so you can place them wherever you please, and are made to project a little so there\u0027s some clearance to fit a bit of a wider stack between them than just the one to which they are attached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TO5xuky.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002259.75\u0022 height=\u0022673\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/TO5xuky.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what I really wanted to do here was get a consistent and methodically created mechanics, both in making it polished as well as more \u0022realistic\u0022 for suitably accommodating values of that term.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn particular, just like ST and TrekDrive it uses Warp Plasma as the energy conducting medium, but it does so with more refined calculations: namely, we take that each U of WarpPlasma stands for a certain amount of actual energy in joules (here I use 1 U = 1 GJ), and we provide proper and full integration with the Community Resource Pack by using the actual density values prescribed for the LqdDeuterium and Antimatter resources to calculate how annihilation aimed at a \u0022sensible\u0022 amount of power generation (okay: 1.21 GW \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E to break through Warp 1)\u003C/span\u003E will proceed in terms of consumption and generate the right amount of WarpPlasma accordingly. There will also be thermal effects: in particular a modest amount (relative to power consumed, given that we presume the phenomenal temperature of the plasma tap of an antimatter generator should make for theoretically ultra high efficiency) of waste heat to be dumped by radiators, though in the above screenshot and as of now that mechanic is not yet implemented - the radiators you see are for the bootstrapping reactor only. I plan to use Nertea\u0027s SystemHeat for the heat management because I find it \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E better than the stock CoreHeat system, in particular am a big fan of the \u0022heat loop\u0022 mechanic which makes you think about the plumbing in your vessel a bit more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, this mod is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E meant to be stand-alone: it is only meant to provide the coils (nacelles) and warpcores - there are no antimatter or deuterium tanks or heat management facilities provided because those things are already well-provided for with other mods, I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally one more screenshot from testing, showing the craft above after having flown at warp 1 for some time, at first having aimed toward the \u003Cem\u003EGalaxies Unbound\u003C/em\u003E star Surr 128, now flipped around and going back to Kerbin (That\u0027s still Kerbol there, by the way, in the distance - it would have taken much longer to reach the destination and right now the timewarp is not working when warp flight is in progress):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CWCGXf7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002259.75\u0022 height=\u0022673\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/CWCGXf7.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-10-21T17:49:44Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2022 05:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by shimmy00\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shimmy00","CreatedById":210859,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-10T03:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: Have gotten some edges filed in the code, and you can select your warp speed now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your viewing pleasure, 3195 \u0022G\u0022 from Kerbol, after certifying the drive to reach \u003Cstrong\u003Ewarp 1.5:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ha2tokn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002259.75\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ha2tokn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shimmy00","CreatedById":210859,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-12T07:54:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E (2022-05-11)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIT GLOWS!
