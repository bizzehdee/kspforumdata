In fact, I estimate the only place you can\u0027t land in and then return to kerbin is Tylo. Not because you can\u0027t lift off (you can without problems, I assure you), but because I doubt you can survive the descent, no atmosphere to break with and the KrakenDrive has issues with operation close to the ground, see below. Of course half (or more!) of the credit goes to Comrade Jenkens, the creator of the KrakenDrive, and let\u0027s let that clear right away: I just took an awesome idea and designed the package around it, suggesting minor improvements (i.e: I blatantly copied the idea, while stripping it into less than half the parts and SSTOing it, as usual ^^\u0027).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, technical details because there are many:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a VTOL SSTO, and launches as such. You could use one of the KrakenDrive modes for it (see below), but best results are achieved when you launch like a conventional SSTO until you achieve an apoapsis outside the atmosphere. Doesn\u0027t matter how fast you are traveling, just get to a point where you can quicksave. The VTOL SSTO system also doubles as landing system, allowing controlled landings optionally assisted by parachutes. In short, it is there to make your life easier, just like the RCS system for fine maneuvering and the docking ports. If the worst happens, hitting abort will decouple the capsule and deploy and emergency parachute to save your kerbal. Won\u0027t do much for him if you are doing several hundred km/s on a solar escape trajectory, but sometimes you just want to survive that landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and that\u0027s where the conventional instructions end and the KrakenDrive user manual begins. Hold on to your hats, because we are talking about handling primal forces with the power to either get you anywhere in the solar system, or spray you as a cloud of debris half across half the solar system. This is after a single test \u0022burn\u0022, I later went back to a ~700km circular orbit, then back to the ground:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/FtdJ0U6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FtdJ0U6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FtdJ0U6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, the KrakenDrive has two distinct modes of operation: liftoff, and in-space propulsion. For some highly theoretical inferred explanations, the best minds at R-SUV estimate that the bottled krakens in the drive, when engaged at low speeds close to a planet, fix themselves to the gravity well and push against it. This is the liftoff or ground effect setting of the drive, and its selection is automatic. Beware of this, because you might find yourself changing into this regime inadvertently (i.e: you break too much and go below the threshold of that planet, ~800m/s for kerbin) and the sudden coupling of your drive with the gravity well will rip you to shreds. Be very careful!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile using this \u0022ground effect\u0022 setting, the ship will lock itself with the ground, and start ascending at a steady 5m/s, indefinitely, without changing speed and with a negligible lateral drift if you get it firmly pointed upwards. The most amazing thing is that while ascending like this, you will remain synchronized with the ground, increasing your rotation velocity to stay precisely above the same spot of the planet. You can exploit this effect to get out of \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E gravity well in the game, provided you can engage the drive without ripping you to shred due to excessive velocity, and that you can endure the excruciatingly long climb to synchronous orbit altitude, which is where you can disengage the drive and find yourself in a stable orbit. Just like a space elevator! (Disclaimer:; not actually tested up to KerboSynchronous orbit, just 75kms, stuff might happen as you pick lateral speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what happens when you are going too fast for the drive to lock to the planet? Well, then the in-space setting applies. And boy what a setting. \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E18.9 Gs \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eat your fingertips!!!\u003C/strong\u003E Just point yourself in the desired direction of thrust, and engage the drive... well, sometimes. Let me explain: while the drive is very reliable in its ground setting (well, reliable if you don\u0027t engage it when going fast \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E), in space it has a tendency to... well, break. Like half the time you turn it on. You \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E repair the legs with a kerbal, don\u0027t worry about the fact that they snap as soon as you repair them, just press ESC just as you click the \u0022repair\u0022 option, and when the game pauses you can click the \u0022raise\u0022 option now available and the leg will rise fixed when you resume the game. But, the fastest thing is usually to just quickload before turning it on, and then just quickload until the legs hold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, not all the times the legs hold, sometimes they don\u0027t engage in quite the perfect symmetry and you get a huge torque you can\u0027t counteract with the reaction wheels, but that\u0027s just a matter of turning it off and on again until you get it right. In the end you manage to make a \u0022burn\u0022 about 10-15% of the times you turn it on. So I call it 100% reliable by kerbal standards. And considering that burn duration doesn\u0027t seem to matter, you can control the ship during burns perfectly if you can control it at all, and you do thrust at almost 20 G\u0027s... Yeah, you can still get anywhere with practice, and \u003Cem\u003Efast\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhew, that took some time to write, I hope there aren\u0027t too many typos and it makes sense!! So yeah, have a happy day harnessing the power of bugs, and fly safe!
