I play stock except for KER. I played many older versions of the game, and then I played 1.0.2 enough to get used to the new aero. I\u0027m not having a problem with rocket flipping or new ascent profiles.\n\nI downloaded 1.0.4 and decided to start a sandbox game because I played through Career in 1.0.2 and I don\u0027t see much reason to do so again. Decided to design a Laythe land-and-return mission. My first Laythe land-and-return was in about 0.19, so I\u0027ve done this before.\n\nNo problems with Kerbin ascent or interplanetary transfer. Planning to aerobrake at Jool, but I know they\u0027ve fiddled with the aero and the heating, so I brought nearly 2k \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv extra, just in case.\n\nGood thing I\u0027ve got the extra budget, because I found that even looking at Jool\u0027s atmo at interplanetary transfer speeds is instant death. I know the atmosphere runs out to 200k. I\u0027m aiming at 195k periapsis, and burning up about a second after touching the atmosphere, at about 199,800m.\n\nTried burning to slow down before atmospheric contact, and found that it didn\u0027t make enough difference. Wound up plotting a Flyby of Jool (no atmospheric contact), leading to a Laythe encounter, burning all but the last few drops of fuel to slow down enough, and managing aerocapture at Laythe.\n\nAside -- this current heating / drag model makes interplanetary application of aerobraking all but completely useless. The game says Jool has no atmosphere (none, nada, zilch) above 200km. But at 199.8km, so much that I\u0027m fried to a crisp in under a second. Yet friction with atmosphere at that altitude wouldn\u0027t even begin to slow me down below escape velocity. Is aerobraking just not a thing we do anymore?\n\nAnyway, was able to land on Laythe, with the lander being entirely undamaged and on-budget for the mission. It\u0027s packing ~2800\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv and ~1.3 TWR on Laythe (atmospheric asl) according to KER.\n\nI plant my flag, get back in, and blast off. Only to find that I\u0027m way WAY short of making orbit. My next stage (intended for Hohmann transfer back to Kerbin) doesn\u0027t have much TWR, but does have a bit of extra \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv in the budget, but I\u0027m nowhere near close enough to orbit for the pitiful engine to make it.\n\nI tried the launch multiple times, with multiple ascent profiles. I tried a full-speed straight up and turn. I tried a 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 auto-gravity-turn slant. I tried keeping my speed lower for longer. Nothing I could do got anywhere close to orbit. My from-the-hip estimate is that I\u0027m at least 1k \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv short, probably more like 1,500 or 2k short. I get up to a 50km parabola and run out of fuel just as I\u0027m turning to circularize.\n\nI went back and checked, both in flight mode and in the VAB, and KER says I have just over 2800\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv (atmospheric) on Laythe.\n\nNow, my lander craft isn\u0027t particularly aerodynamic. It\u0027s not a brick, but it\u0027s short and wide (as a lander should be). It\u0027s got landing legs and fuel lines and about a dozen struts.\n\nI guess my question is, is this a problem with KER, or am I really 1,000 or more \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv short because of aerodynamic drag? Did they change Laythe\u0027s atmosphere in a recent update that\u0027s not reflected on the Wiki? It seems to be really thick for a really long time, on ascent. Did the new aero values in 1.0.4 make Laythe require significantly more \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for surface-to-orbit, or throw off KER\u0027s calculations somehow?\n\nHere\u0027s my [craft](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5r4Eq1EYOb6Vl91MHNNSng4S1U/view?usp=sharing). That\u0027s the whole mission, not just the lander in question, but it should be easy enough to pull out. It\u0027s the four stages with ~1.3 TWR on Laythe, at sea level.\n\nIs it just me, or does Laythe now take more like 4k \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv surface-to-orbit?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T21:25:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 09:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Anglave**"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T21:22:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E -snip-\n\nI don\u0027t immediately have access to KSP right now so downloading your craft isnt gonna help much.

If it\u0027s thick enough that I\u0027m burning up, then there\u0027s a place higher that it\u0027ll still slow me down but I won\u0027t burn. However, in the game I can\u0027t brake at 210km, because the atmosphere STOPS at 200km. A heat shield might make my 190km maneuver more survivable (though I have my doubts), but it\u0027s not going to resolve this fundamental flaw, which the 1.0.4 changes make considerably more severe.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Older delta-V maps show Laythe requiring 3.2km/s to orbit.

I realize values will have changed as of the new aero, but it was my understanding that generally speaking values have gone down.

It would be nice if their atmosphere tops were raised to their pressure asymptotes. which seems to be the case at Kerbin.

That includes flipping from a 120^ (as in retrograde and inclined) inclination to Jool after passing Tylo, which cost a bit less than 500m/s to finally get settled down at Laythe.\n\nExpect to hit Laythe at anything from 3500-4500m/s whether you go straight into it from Kerbin or bank off Tylo.

A similar test would be to ensure you have exactly the same surface velocity in all cases, since that will eliminate the effect of velocity on the strength of the flames (the flames are proportional to the 0.75 power of density and the cube of velocity)."},{"CreatedByName":"Anglave","CreatedById":62706,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T18:45:14Z","Content":"**Update since OP**\n\nI redesigned my [craft](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5r4Eq1EYOb6VEU5NG1FUjV4ZmJPQUJBUk44ZlQtdUFxRndV/view?usp=sharing), bringing more \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv and slightly higher TWR in the lander stage, and switching to LV-N on the interplanetary stage, so I could bring enough \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to push the heavier lander, while retaining the same Kerbin lifter design. The interplanetary stage uses an LV-N / Poodle hybrid compromise between \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv and thrust. I realize a lower thrust (carrying less engine mass, just one pair of LV-N ideally) would be more efficient, but 20\u002B minute burns to get out of LKO are not acceptable. Even doing multiple periapsis kicks, you end up on escape trajectory with entirely too much burn time remaining, leading to much less efficient transfers.\n\nAfter landing at Laythe, I did on-site tweak the aerospikes to 60% thrust limit, in order to provide more relative vectored thrust at lower throttle settings during ascent.\n\nMy mission was a success, completely ignoring aerocapture at Jool, and instead burning the engines to slow down and establish a survivable aerocapture encounter with Laythe.\n\nThe return portion of the mission (from Laythe surface back to Kerbin) worked flawlessly, and I confirm that it does take about 3400 \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to get from Laythe surface to orbit. Shall we edit the [Wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Laythe)? The ~2800 \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv number stated there will absolutely strand you.\n\nAlso, regarding aerobraking in 1.0.x, from a related thread:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, it seems to be as I predicted it would be. Tweaking [the game] to make reentry from LKO somewhat dangerous makes just barely touching a significant atmosphere at interplanetary speeds pretty much instant death. I blame density, which is significantly greater at higher altitudes than pre-1.0, and which the arbitrary caps placed on atmosphere heights exacerbates by lopping off the upper, thinner layers you\u0027d normally be aerobraking in.\n\u003E I\u0027m thinking the only way to fix this is to run the atmospheric density curves out to their asymptotes and let that determine the heights of atmospheres, which I suspect will be GREATLY higher than they are now.\n\nThis is a clear and concise statement of my observations in 1.0.4 as well. Until this is addressed by fixing the heating math, or fixing the atmospheric density slopes, or raising the arbitrary atmospheric height caps, I plan to play with my heat setting at a much lower value. Reentry from Mun and LKO is already easy. Making it even easier doesn\u0027t concern me, but making aerobraking from interplanetary speeds even *possible* is of much greater interest to me.\n\nScreenshots added:\n\n![N32EXQw.png](http://i.imgur.com/N32EXQw.png)\n\nNote that the lander stage *looks* much the same, but the (mostly cosmetic) adapter cones have been replaced by fuel containing cones.\n\n![acxiFnL.png](http://i.imgur.com/acxiFnL.png)\n\n![XIr8f2x.png](http://i.imgur.com/XIr8f2x.png)\n\n![DuWOeJw.png](http://i.imgur.com/DuWOeJw.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T19:41:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 07:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Anglave**\n  \nScreenshots Added"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T11:20:44Z","Content":"I\u0027m currently running a Laythe mission with an interplanetary spaceplane, and had planned a direct aerobrake at Laythe. Unfortunately, I could only choose between burning up and not capturing. So I used a Tylo slingshot to capture and set up an encounter with Laythe, then used that encounter as another slingshot to further reduce encounter speed before aerobraking for capture at Laythe on the next go round. Even then, it took multiple passes to lower to a near circular orbit.\n\nI\u0027m having the same problem on return to Kerbin, a direct aerobraking capture either burns up or fails to shed enough speed.
