I play stock except for KER. I played many older versions of the game, and then I played 1.0.2 enough to get used to the new aero. I\u0027m not having a problem with rocket flipping or new ascent profiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI downloaded 1.0.4 and decided to start a sandbox game because I played through Career in 1.0.2 and I don\u0027t see much reason to do so again. Decided to design a Laythe land-and-return mission. My first Laythe land-and-return was in about 0.19, so I\u0027ve done this before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo problems with Kerbin ascent or interplanetary transfer. Planning to aerobrake at Jool, but I know they\u0027ve fiddled with the aero and the heating, so I brought nearly 2k \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv extra, just in case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood thing I\u0027ve got the extra budget, because I found that even looking at Jool\u0027s atmo at interplanetary transfer speeds is instant death. I know the atmosphere runs out to 200k. I\u0027m aiming at 195k periapsis, and burning up about a second after touching the atmosphere, at about 199,800m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried burning to slow down before atmospheric contact, and found that it didn\u0027t make enough difference. Wound up plotting a Flyby of Jool (no atmospheric contact), leading to a Laythe encounter, burning all but the last few drops of fuel to slow down enough, and managing aerocapture at Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside -- this current heating / drag model makes interplanetary application of aerobraking all but completely useless. The game says Jool has no atmosphere (none, nada, zilch) above 200km. But at 199.8km, so much that I\u0027m fried to a crisp in under a second. Yet friction with atmosphere at that altitude wouldn\u0027t even begin to slow me down below escape velocity. Is aerobraking just not a thing we do anymore?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, was able to land on Laythe, with the lander being entirely undamaged and on-budget for the mission. It\u0027s packing ~2800\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv and ~1.3 TWR on Laythe (atmospheric asl) according to KER.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plant my flag, get back in, and blast off. Only to find that I\u0027m way WAY short of making orbit. My next stage (intended for Hohmann transfer back to Kerbin) doesn\u0027t have much TWR, but does have a bit of extra \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv in the budget, but I\u0027m nowhere near close enough to orbit for the pitiful engine to make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried the launch multiple times, with multiple ascent profiles. I tried a full-speed straight up and turn. I tried a 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 auto-gravity-turn slant. I tried keeping my speed lower for longer. Nothing I could do got anywhere close to orbit. My from-the-hip estimate is that I\u0027m at least 1k \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv short, probably more like 1,500 or 2k short. I get up to a 50km parabola and run out of fuel just as I\u0027m turning to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went back and checked, both in flight mode and in the VAB, and KER says I have just over 2800\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv (atmospheric) on Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, my lander craft isn\u0027t particularly aerodynamic. It\u0027s not a brick, but it\u0027s short and wide (as a lander should be). It\u0027s got landing legs and fuel lines and about a dozen struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess my question is, is this a problem with KER, or am I really 1,000 or more \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv short because of aerodynamic drag? Did they change Laythe\u0027s atmosphere in a recent update that\u0027s not reflected on the Wiki? It seems to be really thick for a really long time, on ascent. Did the new aero values in 1.0.4 make Laythe require significantly more \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for surface-to-orbit, or throw off KER\u0027s calculations somehow?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5r4Eq1EYOb6Vl91MHNNSng4S1U/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecraft\u003C/a\u003E. That\u0027s the whole mission, not just the lander in question, but it should be easy enough to pull out.

At any substantial level of reentry heat setting, Jool is often instantly fatal except for small things all wrapped up in fairings and heat shields.

I think the worst-case scenario for this would be in the neighborhood of 600-800m/s based on some observations of highly non-optimal arrangements, on top of what you normally bring with you. That includes flipping from a 120^ (as in retrograde and inclined) inclination to Jool after passing Tylo, which cost a bit less than 500m/s to finally get settled down at Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpect to hit Laythe at anything from 3500-4500m/s whether you go straight into it from Kerbin or bank off Tylo.
