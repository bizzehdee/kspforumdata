However, I did notice that when I removed the MechJeb part, the msg went away, so its tied to MJ somehow.

Since MechJeb contains a control script, it\u0027s defaulting to the MechJeb core. I would suggest pointing that out to the mod developer, I\u0027m sure it is accidental behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mallock","CreatedById":107548,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T19:46:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen this message as well. It\u0027s just a confusion on the part of KSP for having MJ act as a command module. You can safely ignore it if it\u0027s because of your AR202 module. I\u0027ve not tested having multiple actual command pods on a craft yet though, such as a dockable lander.
