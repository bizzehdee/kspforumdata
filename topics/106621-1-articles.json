It must have the same rotation as the root part or it may result in a misaligned navball.\u0022\n\nFirst, I thought the command module *was* the root part. Second, I\u0027ve tried to rotate the command module, but still get the msg. Doesn\u0027t seem to be a major issue, just curious. Thanks...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T18:12:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 06:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve58**\n  \nsee post #3 in this thread."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:56:04Z","Content":"Hmm. Hit \u00224\u0022 to activate Root Part Select mode, then click somewhere 1 part away from the command pod on your ship, then on the command pod.

However, I did notice that when I removed the MechJeb part, the msg went away, so its tied to MJ somehow.

Since MechJeb contains a control script, it\u0027s defaulting to the MechJeb core. I would suggest pointing that out to the mod developer, I\u0027m sure it is accidental behavior."},{"CreatedByName":"Mallock","CreatedById":107548,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T19:46:53Z","Content":"I\u0027ve seen this message as well. It\u0027s just a confusion on the part of KSP for having MJ act as a command module. You can safely ignore it if it\u0027s because of your AR202 module. I\u0027ve not tested having multiple actual command pods on a craft yet though, such as a dockable lander. Don\u0027t know if the message appears in that situation as well."},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T06:12:24Z","Content":"I know this is a dead thread, but I was just confused by this issue and found out some interesting stuff that may help someone in the future doing a search. It has nothing to do with MechJeb, at least in my case. I am playing unmodded. I think it has more to do with rotating your command pod so it isn\u0027t facing north in the VAB, then the launch pad. My navball was 90 degrees off when I put a command pod on a flea and rotated it in the VAB and then tried to launch it."},{"CreatedByName":"CosmicCharlie","CreatedById":150762,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T14:31:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I know this is a dead thread, but I was just confused by this issue and found out some interesting stuff that may help someone in the future doing a search.

No MechJeb, no message.\n\nNot saying you\u0027re wrong about rotated command pods, I\u0027m saying MEchJeb does it too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T14:49:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CosmicCharlie**"}]}
