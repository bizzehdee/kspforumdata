Recently while perusing these forums i came across a post which posed the following question,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Is Ksp stable enough to keep it running 24/7? \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd subsequent discussion on whether it would be possible to run a space program in Real time. So i decided to try it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwitch.tv/tinweasele\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what i have setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will keep the stream going as close to 24/7 as possible considering the ways of the internet and electronics. This is a scenario game that runs as realistically as possible. What that means is that i have included nearly every mod out there that i believe adds realism to the game(list to follow). I am working on a budget which is to say that efficiency in construction is a must. And finally that i will attempt to start up at least 1 mission every single day( assuming i have the funds), and Finally to minimize warp time as much as possible (only on flights that will take over a month if i dont have the funds to keep launching alternative missions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking for input on how to make the stream not as boring to watch over long periods of time, i have MY musical tastes but they may not appeal to some people, and i cant keep music going 24/7 cause i DO like to play other games at times, and i dont understand the broadcast software well enough to specifically state which sound to route to the stream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Scenario:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scenario is mostly based upon \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24770-Repost-of-XLordStimpyX-Stimpy-s-grand-Campaign-Campaign-mode-homebrew-ruleset\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24770-Repost-of-XLordStimpyX-Stimpy-s-grand-Campaign-Campaign-mode-homebrew-ruleset\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the following changes. No base 50% cost return for successful mission ships. I get 75% back on everything that survives to the ground. I must purchase mod \u0022contracts\u0022 in order to unlock using their parts.
