The community is too large for its attitudes to be affected once they\u0027re set, and at that point there is no reason to waste time fighting something that can\u0027t be fought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis should be considered feedback!\u003Cp\u003ELesson learned: User don\u0027t understand why modders need to throw a dialog at them all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d actually argue this isn\u0027t the case.

There should be some \u0022About\u0022 button. It should explain the user why such a dialog is necessary for modders and mods to exist (just a tiny click for you vs hours for the modders because of bad bug reports; especially for more popular mods; even experienced users/modders have written such false reports in the past; incompatible mods can appear to work but break later or even other stuff; modders could disable but won\u0027t to be nice to user, so user pls just bear with the click; did i miss any argument?).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I mentioned, most don\u0027t listen to it.

Why not allow some cfg file to silence a specific mod version for a specific KSP version. In a way that\u0027s more work for the average user than just clicking ok all the time. CC would probably not \u0022work\u0022 with people doing this anyway. The only alternative i see is pushing mods using CC to include some license allowing users to share a recompiled version with CC removed/updated.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see two other alternatives: 1) a user takes over the mod, and it is no longer dead. All the problems are solved in the process. 2) The mod dies, rather than staying in a state of un-death.
