I\u0027ll point to \u0022MechJeb for All\u0022 as an example of that. Other instances might be a set of fuel tanks, and again nothing has really changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, there are some mods that really do need an update to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith v1.7 some older stuff might look a little worse but that\u0027s not \u0022broken\u0022. But if you\u0027re responsible for one of those lasting Mods, it makes sense that you update the .version file, maybe once a year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI checked my record, KSP v1.4.0\u00A0 was a little bit more than a year ago, v1.5.0 roughly six months ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have some older-than-that mods that work fine, I\u0027m happy to alter a .version file to stop the warnings. But do any of us want to frighten off new KSP players?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tonka Crash","CreatedById":189552,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-13T12:54:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can disable the nag messages if you update to the full KSP-AVC instead of relying on the bundled MiniAVC a lot of mods include.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason some mods break between versions is that Squad changes the API from time to time. The API are the software interfaces for how mods that include a .dll for functionality interact with the underlying game code. If an API changes the mod breaks and needs at least a recompile if not some actual changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPure parts packs and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E scripts don\u0027t have this problem as much, so they tend to work across more versions. You can still have problems as Squad changes the attributes of parts. We saw problems in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E at 1.6 because the bulkheadProfiles attribute became more important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
