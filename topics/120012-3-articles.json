(it\u0027s in the second screen of the imgur album in that link). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a 3.75 to 2.5 and 3.75 to 3.75m variant finished as meshes so far. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also made a tiny side mount pilot blister that provides a single seat, very high visibility from a hemispherical set of dome windows, an airlock and a little integrated KIS container. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m about 90% done with the mesh for a variant of the 2.5-3.75 cupola that is intended for use in large stations as the pilot housing. It\u0027s going to have integrated reaction wheels, battery, monoprop and thrusters, an integrated version of the pilot blister and a single small side mounted docking port. It loses half the window space for the thruster/monoprop/blister/port integration. It\u0027s intended to have space for 5 pilots - one in the blister and 4 in the main body. If I ever get an IVA made for this, the idea is that one pilot is flying the craft from the blister and the other 4 acting as navigators from radial couches in the 4 remaining window sectors. I haven\u0027t decided if it should have an integrated power source such as some surface mount solar or a small emergency RTG to ensure that there\u0027s always power for control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext on the list is an engineering pod and a science pod in large format. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineering pod would have integrated airlocks, radial docking ports and be a large volume integrated KIS container. Not settled on the radial docking port config yet but I was planning on 4-6x small ports. However, reading your comments, it might make more sense to have something like 2-4x small docking ports and 2x 2.5m docking ports. I haven\u0027t even started the rough design yet but it\u0027s going to be a large diameter, flat format. This one will probably be a 5m core with variants for 5m to 5m and 5m to 3.75m. Not sure if I want to have integrated reaction wheels or not. The intended crew capacity is going to be 6-8ish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science pod is pretty simple, just another 5m core with options for 5-5 and 5-3.75 endcaps. Possibly a couple of integrated docking ports. It would have a large amount of integrated battery and possibly an integrated communication comm system. I\u0027m thinking a ring of Universal Storage docking sites to integrate science instruments would be a good idea as well. It would probably have a max scientist capacity of 8-12 with a minimal complement of 4. Large stored science and data capacity as well. Probably at least 1000 incoming science data storage and at least 5000 produced science capacity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill a looong way to go as I haven\u0027t started the colliders, texture mapping or any of the other stuff necessary for bringing it into KSP yet and I literally just started learning Blender a week ago.
