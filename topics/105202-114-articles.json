To quote the wiki:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So the fact that the part has a *seating* capacity of zero doesn\u0027t mean that it\u0027s *crew recycle* capacity can\u0027t be 1, or 5, or 10, or whatever, and the guidance should apply to that.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If the part is multi-purpose, you should decide how much mass is dedicated to each part of the purpose and calculate based on that.  So, if your part is combination recycler and storage ideally some of the mass should be dedicated to handling the \u0027storage\u0027 and not included in the formula.  For example a 2.5 ton part that includes a storage bay might decide that 0.5 tons is dedicated to holding the storage, and then if you decided that it had a crew recycle capacity of 5 it\u0027s percent would be 0.4.  (2/5)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I hope that helps and clears things up.
