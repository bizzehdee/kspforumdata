The only other part that came near the ground is the recycle bin at one end of the station. I knew that spot might be a point of failure and it would fall off but ironically that wasn\u0027t the part that was blowing up upon loading. It was both the hitchhiker modules that would blow up on the other end of it past the root node of the base. But to boot when they blew up the game recognized the destruction but then also it didn\u0027t. The stuff attached to them were still attached but whenever I moved away from it and came back (like going to the space center) then the base didn\u0027t load because of unknown parts errors...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy original base was in direct contact and I had a huge bounce whenever the game loaded and/or it came out of time warp so that\u0027s when I added landing struts as the \u0022stand\u0022. It worked great on minmus but the same design on eve was epic failure. Probably due to higher gravity and thicker atmo... I thought maybe it was because the base was on a slight hill so I drove nearly 41km to find a flatter spot and I did and that spot was even worse than the first spot (that\u0027s where the kerbal was sucked into eve). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured it was a stock bug because I knew your mod didn\u0027t simulate the flexing but I don\u0027t know how or when they\u0027ll fix it (or if they plan to fix it.) Technically you\u0027re not supposed to be able to build a base the size I have on the ground since there\u0027d be no way to land it safely. Not in one piece I\u0027m sure. Which means you\u0027d have to connect the pieces with docking ports or something I imagine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I need a new method of building ground bases where I don\u0027t have to build it as one single piece. My original minmus base had the KAS fuel ports on it but every time I time warped using those connected together the same problem happened. There was huge bouncing going on and if you time warp with things attached together with pipes while they\u0027re in mid-bounce then the docking ports \u0022slide off\u0022 and make it impossible to remove them. They somehow become to root of that part of the vehicle instead of being something that\u0027s surface attached. It keeps saying that something is attached to it and you can\u0027t unattach it. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch clamps I hadn\u0027t thought of but I may give that a shot to see if it helps. Those would keep the base level I\u0027ll bet but the sheer size of the base itself may be a problem because it\u0027ll take so many of them to keep it in the air without flexing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second problem will be getting into a base in the air on launch clamps.

Having to set up a base, carry all the initial \u0022seed\u0022 resources, create the resource chain, etc etc, takes a lot of time and provides a lot of fun. The extra time required to build rockets is just unnecessary, in my opinion and reduces the fun in favour of realism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re concerned about needing Kerbals, which is very valid and a point I like, then why not optionally make it so that you need X number of Engineers, Scientists and Pilots to insta-build rockets at full efficiency? If the player has less than those numbers, then the rockets would cost more to build, but it wouldn\u0027t affect the construction time. You could even take Stupidity into consideration for this. Think of it like this: The stupid, unskilled Kerbals are more likely to waste resources in the Kerbal trial-and-error brand of engineering building the same rocket compared to specialists and smarter Kerbals with more experience. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
