VPP assumes a lot of things, such as 1g. That fact results in things like landers that like to slide uphill on the Mun. PhysX has some intentional limitations. And Unity makes a lot of assumptions as well (that match up with changes to PhysX).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing right off the bat is that the new Unity/PhysX wheel system is actually a step in in terms of individual behavior. The problem is that it assumes a lot of things and isn\u0027t particularly flexible \u0022on the fly.\u0022 VPP adds a lot of functionality, but is also predicated on \u0022make car X, tune car X, live with car X for ever.\u0022 KSP isn\u0027t built that way, so it\u0027s rather difficult to get an \u0022across the board\u0022 balance, because of how everything interacts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdd to that the other issues that have been discovered within Unity, and it becomes a complex web to untangle and work around.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ve been aggressively attacking memory leaks and working to speed up code everywhere.
