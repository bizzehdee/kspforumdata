That\u0027s how it works. You can still make lots and lots of different fairing shapes, but the game just says \u0022No, you can\u0027t do that\u0022 to some designs.

It\u0027s annoyingly hard to see for everybody and I would imagine impossible if you are colorblind. The text hovering over the middle screen changes colors when you can place it. Placement restrictions have nothing to do with aero, only clipping. It tries to prevent you from clipping the fairing inside the payload accidentally.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T21:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it is detecting a clipping problem, then it should auto-expand when you try to go past that point.
