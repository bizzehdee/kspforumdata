One thing I did not take into consideration was the electrical draw of the antennas and I find my satellite losing power during the \u0022night,\u0022 or rather when Kerbol is eclipsed/occulted by Kerbin... I was wondering if anyone might have an idea on calculating the duration of darkness so I can pack adequate batteries for the next satellite.\n\nOr perhaps I should just establish my comm network at different altitude...\n\nAny input is appreciated!

However, as a point on the ground moves into darkness, a satellite several hundred kilometres above that point will still be in full sunlight. Likewise at dawn, the satellite will enter daylight some time before the point on the ground below it does so. \n\nTo calculate how much time is spent in darkness you need to know how much of the orbit circumference falls in the shadow cast by Kerbin, the width of which will be equal to Kerbin\u0027s diameter. The speed of your satellite can then be used to work out how long it will spend in this shadow area."},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T06:29:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I just went with a rough estimate based off time warping and came up with about 20 minutes of orbit darkness time for a keosynchronous orbit. Ill have to see how close I was now!\n\nPretty close actually. Dark period for 2869 altitude orbit around Kerbin is a maximum of 1195 seconds (19.92 minutes).\n\nI tend to do a lot of part welding with UbioZur where I combine a probe core, reaction wheel and batteries. So my probe core usually ends up as something with at least 2400 battery capacity and usually 4-8k capacity. Batteries in stock KSP are very light for what they offer.\n\nA satellite at KEO and 4000 battery capacity can support up to 3.35 energy/second. The Comm-16 only draws 0.13 and the Comm-32 and directional antennas draw 0.75-0.93 per second. That means I can easily run (1) Comm-16 plus (3) directionals without having power issues.\n\n...\n\n2869km orbits...\n\nMoho - 36 minutes of darkness\n\nEve - 16 minutes\n\nKerbin - 20 minutes\n\nMun - 46 minutes (but you never orbit out that far, plan on 38 minutes)\n\nMinmus - 81 minutes (but you never orbit out that far, plan on 68 minutes)\n\nDuna - 35 minutes\n\nDres - 55 minutes\n\nSo worst-case is roughly 68 minutes of darkness for the inner bodies. And only if you are orbiting at 2000\u002B km altitude around Minmus. That means for a power draw of 2.93/s you need about 12000 battery capacity to survive for 68 minutes. The same satellite around Dres at 2869km would require 9600 battery capacity."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T09:32:11Z","Content":"circumference = 2\\*pi\\* radius\n\nThe satelite will go that distance in 6 hours... \n\nThis will give you the orbital velocity at geosynchronous orbit if you know the radius (although I guess you arelady know how fast your probe orbits)\n\nAssuming a point light source infinitely far away (such that light rays are parallel)...
