One thing I did not take into consideration was the electrical draw of the antennas and I find my satellite losing power during the \u0022night,\u0022 or rather when Kerbol is eclipsed/occulted by Kerbin... I was wondering if anyone might have an idea on calculating the duration of darkness so I can pack adequate batteries for the next satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr perhaps I should just establish my comm network at different altitude...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny input is appreciated!

However, as a point on the ground moves into darkness, a satellite several hundred kilometres above that point will still be in full sunlight. Likewise at dawn, the satellite will enter daylight some time before the point on the ground below it does so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo calculate how much time is spent in darkness you need to know how much of the orbit circumference falls in the shadow cast by Kerbin, the width of which will be equal to Kerbin\u0027s diameter. The speed of your satellite can then be used to work out how long it will spend in this shadow area.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T06:29:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dubdubak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dubdubak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI just went with a rough estimate based off time warping and came up with about 20 minutes of orbit darkness time for a keosynchronous orbit.

Dark period for 2869 altitude orbit around Kerbin is a maximum of 1195 seconds (19.92 minutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to do a lot of part welding with UbioZur where I combine a probe core, reaction wheel and batteries. So my probe core usually ends up as something with at least 2400 battery capacity and usually 4-8k capacity. Batteries in stock KSP are very light for what they offer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA satellite at KEO and 4000 battery capacity can support up to 3.35 energy/second. The Comm-16 only draws 0.13 and the Comm-32 and directional antennas draw 0.75-0.93 per second.
