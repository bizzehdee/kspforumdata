As such, I can not use any quotes from the Kerbals unless they are really simple words, because backwards spanish]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe camera starts at mission control, stating that everything is nominal in kerbal voices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u0022Boom\u0022 can be heard, and red sirens and klaxxons start beeping and buzzing and everything!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we zoom into the IVA Cameras, where we see Bill and Bob panicking, Jebediah grinning, and Valentina frowning at Jeb. Zoom out of the rocketship, and we see that an Apollo-esque spacecraft exploded on it\u0027s way back from the Mun or Minmus or something. Gene gabbers into his mic. Bobak runs around screaming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb stops grinning, and listens intently to what Gene has to say. He then nods, agrees, and grabs the controls. He points the engines toward a vector, and turns on the engine. There\u0027s an offset CoT, so Jeb has to give a bumpy ride, further aggravating Bill and Bob. Valentina stole the controls away. She yells \u0022No\u0022 (in backwards spanish) at Jeb, and attempts a less bumpy ride. Jeb crosses his arms and looks away, upset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina Looks out the window, and they\u0027re getting really close to Kerbin. She mentions this. The cabin begins to shake. The capsule is re-entering. Jeb grins. Bob and Bill Panic. Valentina remains neutral.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe capsule crashes into the desert. The Kerbals get out of the capsule. Jeb is wearing sunglasses, and he pops out, walks forward, followed by Bill and Bob. Kinda like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2WwO6e7peE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Valentina pops out and slaps Jeb for being stupid. He falls over into Bill, who is still too dumb to be paying attention to anything. He then wonders why they haven\u0027t been recovered yet. He gabs at Jeb and Bob, and they go over to the command pod. Bill opens up a hatch on the pod, where a machine called \u0022Recovery Transponder\u0022 is very clearly broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina meanwhile has already setup a camp fire, smiling and waving at the others, and takes out a gun. Jeb tells her not to shoot! Valentina gives him a look like \u0022duh! it\u0027s a flaregun\u0022 and then it\u0027s a flaregun and a flare-rocket is shot up, which turns into the KSP logo rocket, into the ending of the video.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T15:54:33Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 03:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
