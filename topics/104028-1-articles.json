The asteroing is a D class and its eventual target is Gilly so I would like to capture it before intercept and use Kerbin for some slingshot. I am capable of setting up a burn from Kerbin\u0027s orbit that will get me to within a few hundred kilometer of an intercept, and then fine tune to much closer. However when I get close I require a massive burn to match speed with the target.\n\nCan anyone describe, from launch to capture, an optimal (in delta-v) strategy for lassoing asteroids?"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T08:32:11Z","Content":"Sadly I don\u0027t have a lot of time on my hands atm, however I will just quote myself\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ARM missions can be hard... \n\u003E As Randazzo says, the best way is get your relative velocity at closest approach to a minimum.\n\u003E \n\u003E Eg you could get a kerbin escape, then adjust your solar orbit to intersect the asteroids orbit before it enters Kerbins SOI. This should significantly reduce the dV costs, as only a small velocity change is required to alter the ateroids course when you are further away from Kerbin.\n\u003E \n\u003E If however the asteroid is inside kerbins SOI your best option might be to launch to an orbit wich is going the same way as the ateroid will when it passes Kerbin, taking account of the inclination, as launching to an inclined orbit is cheaper than making an inclination change burn while in LKO. Once in LKO you could raise your ap and then try getting a close approach to the asteroid as far from Kerbin as possible.\n\nand link you to [thread=114501]this Thread[/thread].\n\nThe biggest problem with D-Class Potatoes is that they are very heavy, meaning they will reduce a ship with say 4000 m/s dV to a few hundred at best."},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T10:37:23Z","Content":"I heartily recommend Claw\u0027s excellent tutorial: [link](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75759-Asteroid-Rendezvous-Outside-of-Kerbin%E2%80%99s-SOI?p=1076130)"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T13:33:39Z","Content":"Ok, that was what I was doing before.

Generally it\u0027s important to make sure your time-to-target is always greater than the minimum time at max thrust you\u0027d need to align and cancel your relative velocity. For example, if you\u0027re closing on an asteroid 200m away, and your relative velocity is 20 m/s, you have 10 seconds to counterthrust.

If you can thrust at 20 m/s (2 gees, not that hard to do really) then you should wait until you are 1 second away to thrust.\n\nIt also helps to not aim directly at the thing, so if you mistime it you pass a little, not crash ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
