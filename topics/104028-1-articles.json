The asteroing is a D class and its eventual target is Gilly so I would like to capture it before intercept and use Kerbin for some slingshot. I am capable of setting up a burn from Kerbin\u0027s orbit that will get me to within a few hundred kilometer of an intercept, and then fine tune to much closer. However when I get close I require a massive burn to match speed with the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone describe, from launch to capture, an optimal (in delta-v) strategy for lassoing asteroids?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T08:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESadly I don\u0027t have a lot of time on my hands atm, however I will just quote myself\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheXRuler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheXRuler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EARM missions can be hard... \u003Cp\u003EAs Randazzo says, the best way is get your relative velocity at closest approach to a minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEg you could get a kerbin escape, then adjust your solar orbit to intersect the asteroids orbit before it enters Kerbins SOI. This should significantly reduce the dV costs, as only a small velocity change is required to alter the ateroids course when you are further away from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf however the asteroid is inside kerbins SOI your best option might be to launch to an orbit wich is going the same way as the ateroid will when it passes Kerbin, taking account of the inclination, as launching to an inclined orbit is cheaper than making an inclination change burn while in LKO. Once in LKO you could raise your ap and then try getting a close approach to the asteroid as far from Kerbin as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cp\u003Eand link you to [thread=114501]this Thread[/thread].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem with D-Class Potatoes is that they are very heavy, meaning they will reduce a ship with say 4000 m/s dV to a few hundred at best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T10:37:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI heartily recommend Claw\u0027s excellent tutorial: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75759-Asteroid-Rendezvous-Outside-of-Kerbin%E2%80%99s-SOI?p=1076130\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T13:33:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, that was what I was doing before.

On the navball, you will \u0022push\u0022 the retrogade marker towards target heading as you approach, thus reducing velocity and correcting heading at the same time. If approaching at ~1km/s I like to decelerate to ~100m/s within 20km, and steadily decrease until I am closing at ~10m/s with 2km to go and ~1m/s within 100m.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thadisjones","CreatedById":134649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T19:14:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kuzzter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kuzzter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBest practice to rendezvous with anything is to reduce relative velocity to zero as you reduce distance to zero.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is more than a best practice, it\u0027s pretty essential.
