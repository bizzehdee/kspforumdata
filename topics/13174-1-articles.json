Im no expert but I will launch full throttle straight up to 20-25km. At this point I will angle down the 90 degree heading to a 45 degree angle. I keep this heading until my peak altitude (I can remember off the top of my head periopsis or apopsis ) but around 100km. I cut power and drift to about 5km from that peak point. Then I will full throttle at a 0degree inclination on the 90degree heading still. Lookin at the map view I watch the flight path until it is the shape and altitude I want. Your velocity at this point should be about 2300m/sec to maintain your orbit but thats not a big deal if you aren\\\u0027t planning on staying there, we don\\\u0027t we are adventurers and the mun is on our mind. With throttle cut drift until you see the mun just crest earths horizon and full throttle at your yellow circle which is the direction of velocity. It should be right around the 0degree inclination point since you got into orbit in this direction. Also make sure you are at 90 degrees still. Watching map view control your ship until you see your trajectory intercept the mun. It is important you have the X key ready to immediately kill throttle when you intercept. If you intercept but over shoot before you kill throttle no big deal. Simply kill throttle, direct your ship to the yellow circle with an X to reverse burn. You don\\\u0027t need much throttle at all. Watch map view and stop when you intercept again. Now fast forward until you actually enter the orbit. This is where it is tricky. You will need to burn and reverse burn to get orbit. It takes practice and I can think of how to explain it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat in short is my method of mun orbit and I can do it most of the time. You will develop your own procedure that works but I hope mine gets you started. Some things ive learned try keeping your 90 degree heading at precise as possible over time as you are off a few degrees it is magnified when you get to the mun. Your orbit will be different. Not a huge deal but it is something to think about. Good luck all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EO and if you keep burning out of earth orbit like I was explaining and burn past the mun you will intercept minimus as well.

My best explanation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking from above, position yourself in the 6 o clock and the Mun in the 2 o clock position (rotate the camera/wait on your low orbit to come to it).

Since KSP is currently a sandbox game, for serious missions I tend to build in ridiculous levels of redundancy and extra fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hunter558","CreatedById":28116,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-29T01:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can wait for the mun to rise or just burn at 90 once you reach about 70k until the apoapsis reaches the mun\\\u0027s orbital path and then just warp around on your orbit until you come to a mun encounter or collision course with the mun. At which point your gonna want to burn retrograde at varying intervals until you land. Thats what i do anyways and im not pro but it gets me to where im going(Mun, Minmus, and Kerbin if the need be).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shhhilent1","CreatedById":28278,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-29T02:27:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Menelmacar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Menelmacar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE.F Kranz I\\\u0027d like to ask (politely) how you land on the Mun in map view, how do you do that when the altimeter doesn\\\u0027t show distance to surface? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBear in mind some people are new and don\\\u0027t know how to circularise an orbit, or that they\\\u0027re just wasting fuel heading west from Kerbin unless their mission requires it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUm for some reason, the replies your post didnt show untill i entered here, forum getting glitchy?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
