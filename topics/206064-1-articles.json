Amusingly enough, their human male creator (in the story no less) made them simply because he liked the idea of warrior women, so he decided to engineer a whole race of them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause he designed them to only give birth to females, they literally must coexist with mankind to continue to exist at all. Meaning they either must keep men around for mating or marry and intermix into human society itself.... which they do not do so that makes them resort to using or buying men as mere chattel for reproductive purposes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat is an example of a symbiotic human offshoot species.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhether the author realized it or not, there is a clever reason for making a race of amazon women who only give birth to females.... far beyond any trivial fetish.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt ensures that the newly created amazon warrior race will never exterminate humanity. Since doing that would make themselves go extinct.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first concern of any species engineer is to NOT engineer a species of living things that will one day wipe out or conquer your entire species.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo that end there are various genetic ways of coding a lifeform so they won\u0027t present an intolerable threat to their creators.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn nature, it is well known that in the ocean several life forms die either shortly after giving birth or a few months after mating. With insects the process is often more brutal.... since life is more disposable the way they see it. Which is why insects lay so many eggs to compensate for the high losses of insect life.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGenetic coding similar to this, such as a shorter lifespan or one that ends a few months after sex, are brutal but effective ways of ensuring that a human offshoot is unlikely to defeat humanity one day.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe very idea or reasoning behind making a human offshoot race is to \u0027improve\u0027 upon the original. Stronger, faster, smarter, more beautiful, or something else we wish original humans were better at. Some way to make them uber or super, otherwise why bother? Which is why it behooves any human bio-engineer to make \u0027failsafes\u0027 to ensure uber human offshoots never wipe out the originals.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nApparently many ancient powerful races in scifi goofed up on this... although they had to for plot so that is a given.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nVulcans from Star Trek, while not an offshoot in the show, would and could fit an example of a human offshoot.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYet the flaw is that they are not used... logically I think. A cold dispassionate race that valued logical reasoning above all would without doubt be more powerful than the Vulcans ever are in politics on the star trek shows. So often the solo vulcan on a starfleet vessel is presented as one of the smartest people on the ship. And you\u0027re telling me there is a whole planet of them and they are not one of the major players in the galaxy?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey are ALWAYS major players in the microcosm of starship life, so they should be as well in the macrocosm of interplanetary life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-12-22T04:54:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2021 04:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-22T05:01:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterstellar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-22T06:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea is stillborn.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWho needs a dominant woman race without men to humiliate?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now about the leather spacesuits for Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacescifi","CreatedById":197504,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-22T07:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224068221\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206064\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221640152890\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea is stillborn.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWho needs a dominant woman race without men to humiliate?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now about the leather spacesuits for Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell... to bio-engineer an offshoot race is arguably the most meta thing a human could possibly do so....\u00A0 and the world is not a vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost scifi renditions of Earth are based upon reality or at least was at some point in their distant pasts.

species\u00A0 and give them an emotion that motivates them to preserve their creators. if they get a feeling of disgust every time they do something that goes against their creators, or a feeling of joy or fulfilment if they do something to benefit their creator.\u00A0 this is probibly not the best approach for a warrior race, perhaps a worker subspecies. of course you still have to treat such a race well, if you traumatize them then their emotional imperatives get distorted and you lose control of them. so you need to keep them in a good state of mental health. it makes a good story, they work out for hundreds or thousands of years, but then humans start treating them poorly and all the sudden are dealing with a mob of crazies that will fight you with reckless

individuals under control. religion also comes with other baggage as well, so expect to waste a lot of time carrying out rituals who\u0027s only purpose is reinforcing the religion of the offshoot. and you might also end up with a religion so good you are converting your own people to it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthen you got chemical dependency. this is what they used in jurassic park as a fail safe so the dinosaurs would die if not given a supplement (the lysine contingency). the aforementioned jem\u0027hadar were also made chemically dependent in addition to their engineered religion. in either case this did not work very well. the gem\u0027hadar frequently had logistics issues with their ketracel white. and the enemy could easily cut supply lines and the soldiers on the front would die from withdrawl. this made their race very disposable. you also have the problem of what if they can come up with their own supply. or wean themselves off of the dope (this happened in one episode).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nengineered emotional imperative is another approach. the mammalian brain evolved to make better means of reproduction possible. the emotions evolved so as to make early mamals invest a lot of energy into caring for young, which they would not have done otherwise. most life before mammals used the scatter technique to increase the number of chances of successful reproduction. lets say you engineer a derivative species\u00A0 and give them an emotion that motivates them to preserve their creators. if they get a feeling of disgust every time they do something that goes against their creators, or a feeling of joy or fulfilment if they do something to benefit their creator.\u00A0 this is probibly not the best approach for a warrior race, perhaps a worker subspecies. of course you still have to treat such a race well, if you traumatize them then their emotional imperatives get distorted and you lose control of them. so you need to keep them in a good state of mental health. it makes a good story, they work out for hundreds or thousands of years, but then humans start treating them poorly and all the sudden are dealing with a mob of crazies that will fight you with reckless abandon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni think a better question is: why let them reproduce? using laboratory produced clones might be a better option, as they would be unable to reproduce without our direct intervention. so any revolt could be fought off through attrition alone. the details of the cloning process would probibly become a state/corporate secret. no one worker would hold all the secrets, its sort of like the eye guy in blade runner.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the natural world reproduction
