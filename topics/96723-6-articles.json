Dihedral, incidence and things like the relative position and angle of main wing vs tail stabilizers are all factors that make for more stable planes, incidentally stock ignores all of this (by ignoring wings except when the Z axis is not exactly vertical), which means at all times you are trying to make a cylinder fly horizontally, so when transitioning to FAR, one still expects wings to have almost no effect, even if not knowing it, it\u0027s like a cognitive continuity thing. In FAR, all those factors come into play and yeah, you can\u0027t just slap wings anywhere, and this is what most people -i believe- find difficult, but it doesn\u0027t come from FAR, it comes from stock aero being bad (or rather nonexistant).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GreeningGalaxy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GreeningGalaxy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERecently I spent a while figuring out how to make a very maneuverable fighter jet, and I did eventually succeed for the most part (analysis of the Firehound helped), but it was a challenge.
