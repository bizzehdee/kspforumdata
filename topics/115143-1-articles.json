Maybe others have had better luck with it, but I seem to destroy the universe (or other problem) every time I try to use one. Not even doing anything fancy. I make a simple rocket with a klaw on the front, grapple the stayputnik in straightforward fashion... and suddenly my craft has a slow but steady phantom acceleration that builds up until my craft suddenly explodes. And then any other vessel I switch to also does the same thing. Even if I re-load from save. Can\u0027t fix it unless I totally exit KSP and re-start the program. Bottom line: the klaw is \u003Cem\u003Ebad news\u003C/em\u003E(at least for me), and I will not touch one ever again until and unless Squad has the bandwidth to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why I resorted to editing the save file.
