You can also put them on a couple parts in your main stack to keep the ship a bit more rigid while rising through the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use \u0022Grandparent\u0022 on ALL docking ports so whenever you dock, the ships latch on with an extra strut from that docking port to whatever the other port is attached to. I also use them on ALL boosters attached with radial decouplers, so they get an extra thing attaching them to the center stack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use \u0022Heaviest part\u0022 infrequently, but it works well for asteroids as that will always be the heaviest part and it\u0027s frequently attached otherwise quite poorly to your vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe implications are about the same as if you used a regular strut, except there is one less part, and nothing to add mass or drag to your vessel. However, you don\u0027t get to pick HOW they attach and it\u0027s always from the center of one part to the center of another part. If you can live with that restriction (and in 99% of cases you can) the autostruts are ALWAYS the way to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t overdo them though as too many struts (of any kind) can confuse the engine and cause uncontrolled wobbling that can tear a ship apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-08T08:35:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2018 08:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-08T13:25:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have ever used KJR, then \u0022Grandparent\u0022 is basically the same as what KJR does automatically. It is the safest kind of autostrut -- the least likely to make your ship destroy itself through stress buildup. If you want to stiffen up an entire section of your craft, then you (obviously) need to use it on at least every other part in your subassembly, so you typically need a lot of grandparent autostruts when you use them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoot and Heaviest work for quickly\u00A0making long-distance struts. Such as from the tip of a wing back to your fuselage. This can add a lot of strength and stiffness using very few autostruts. If you think you may end up in a situation where you have to turn off all the autostruts on your craft, then having very few of them is extremely helpful. If one section of a space station is going all wobbly, then putting a Root or Heaviest autostrut from that section back to some more sturdy part of your station can stop the wobblies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, Root and Heaviest autostruts are also very dangerous -- especially for stations and bases. When you dock two vessels together, the root part and/or heaviest part of the combined craft may suddenly change. This will cause all existing Root and Heaviest autostruts to forcibly disconnect and then reconnect to the new correct part, one by one. This process can involve large forces, and can easily be violent enough to destroy a craft. So it may be necessary to manually disable a bunch of autostruts before doing a docking. (Note that landing legs and wheels automatically use \u0022Heaviest\u0022 autostruts, always.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs 5th Horseman said -- especially for Root and Heaviest autostruts, be careful not to overuse them because they can easily store stress in a craft that will destroy the craft. My rule of thumb is that 5 is usually safe enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-08T14:53:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat posts. Just to break it down even more simply - root and heaviest can change in flight and when docking, and have been the cause of many space station kraken strikes.
