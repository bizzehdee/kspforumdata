I have build several of my own (mostly failures) but got one working one into orbit. I have also read a few things about them on the forums and looked at some designs, but pretty much all SSTO\u0027s are single seaters non cargo capable planes. I am more a man of functionality and am looking for a way to launch things into orbit (2m wide parts max) without creating any debris and SSTO seems to be the way to go. I just need a design that is capable of that and it appears to be impossible to do with stock parts.I have a few mods like B9 Aerospace Pack to help me out with cargo bays etc. But i am still lacking a good design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far what I have learned is to launch the SSTO vertically, that way i dont have to worry about C.o.M. and C.o.L. being unbalanced (which will happen as the cargo changes) as long as the C.o.T. is lined up with the C.o.M. Then once the payload is released It could land like a plane again. Thats pretty much all I got for designs, could anyone give me any more tips about larger sstos? I am still stumped about what engines to use, and whether I should ditch jet engines as they don\u0027t seem to do as well during vertical launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T09:14:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESSTO Spaceplanes are not very good for lifting payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T09:41:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, they\u0027re quite good at efficiently lifting cargo, just not very much of it.
