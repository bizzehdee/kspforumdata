So whenever the craft is loaded the game checks which part is the first part that is hit there and attaches the strut there. So to resolve a \u0022stuck strut\u0022 issue you need to trigger a re-evaluation of the strut. One way to do this in the editor is to remove and \u0026lt;CRTL\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;Z\u0026gt; the part it was attached to, another way is to switch the editor between the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E (and back).

They can be set to form invisible streets to the heaviest part, root part or grandparent part (2 parts closer to the root) and don\u2019t add mass or drag. For boosters, the best way I have found is to lock the boosters to the heaviest part to keep them stable,, any fuel tanks on top of that (if you aren\u2019t doing that, why not?) are locked to the grandparent part which locks the booster stacks together tightly and the nosecones on top to the root part which prevents the boosters wobbling around as if they\u2019re one single unit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding fuel tanks to boosters gives you more range for your core stage with relatively low cost, if done right the fuel gets drained before the booster burns out and then the empty tanks get dumped with the empty boosters. Switch cross feed on on your booster decouplers so the fuel can actually get to your main engines, unless you\u2019re using liquid fuelled strap on boosters in which case fuel ducts are required and not crossfeed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-11T08:39:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2020 08:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by jimmymcgoochie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
