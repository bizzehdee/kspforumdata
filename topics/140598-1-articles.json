So, with wheels in 1.1.2, I cant seem to make an airplane go straight long enough to take off, dang thing always spins out. Im assuming thats the wheel bug and not my horrible aeroplane designs. so question is, in RP-0 on hard mode, is it feasable to just ignore all the plane contracts and the SPH altogether and still progress decently?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phineas Freak","CreatedById":146521,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T13:10:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first i had the same issue but then i tweaked a bit the wheel parameters and it worked (dropped the Friction Control and increased the Spring and Damper strength values). Be careful with the landings though since they like to explode if you push them too hard (compared with the previous KSP versions).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EliasDanger","CreatedById":151803,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T03:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146521-phineas-freak/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022146521\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146521-phineas-freak/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Phineas Freak\u003C/a\u003E, thanks! i tried that and it is a lot better, not perfect, but at least i can now keep it straight enough down the runway to take off.

Yeah it seems I just need to be more willing to fiddle with part settings and placement. I actually did manage to land a plane in RO...but not on a runway, lol. Somethings I don\u0027t have enough patience for. I love doing the rockets, not so much a fan of planes, but those plane contracts never go away and I hate ignoring them, lol. I feel like I gotta do them for the full experience, just gotta put the time in to get it working well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a separate note, I want to point something out. Not sure which mod in particular controls this, but I\u0027ve been launching from the space center in Brazil cuz its on the equator (figured it\u0027d save me a big headache), but when I launch planes on the runway, the end of the runway you start on is actually under ground level and my plane blows up when I start rolling. Had decided to do my planes from Cape Canaveral and rockets from Brazil to get around this, but wanted to point it out incase that was something easy to fix or worth fixing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
