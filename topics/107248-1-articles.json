Every discussion I\u0027ve read about applications of the EM drive are talking about how its potential comes from the ability to run it constantly through a mission, propelling towards the destination for the first half then slowing down again for the second. With the mechanics of KSP as they are you\u0027d have to run all your missions in real-time...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T20:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENASA may have conducted a few preliminary experiments, but the results are far too inconclusive to immediately declare them as a viable means of spacecraft propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would personally prefer that EM Drives not be included in KSP until they have already seen substantial use in real-life applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk first thing is we don\u0027t even know whether it is real of an experiment error.
