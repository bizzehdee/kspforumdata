I know it has been over a month since you posted but if you haven\u0027t already found out. You can use the map decal function in Kerbal Konstructs to make a flat space for your base. Map decals can also be used to deform the terrain into other shapes too. The changes you make will only apply as long as you have KK installed. Once the instances have been created it is best to keep them in a folder outside the KK folder but within the GameData folder as KK has quirk that sometimes shifts the coordinate data of instances that are stored within it\u0027s folder structure. Your newly created instances config files can be found in the newinstances folder within the KK folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asap1","CreatedById":209758,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-04T13:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwould be very cool underground bases shielded from radiation underground caves just think of the possibilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso terrain editing parts would be great.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
