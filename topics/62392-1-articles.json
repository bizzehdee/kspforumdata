The random load screen flavor text will keep changing so the game doesn\u0027t seem to be frozen, but just doesn\u0027t want to load this part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game loads with no issues when\u003Cem\u003E only \u003C/em\u003Ethe B9 folder is removed from GameData, even leaving the Firespitter, ExsurgentEngineering, KineTechAnimation, and ResGen files (along with 15-20 other mods), the game still loads fine. I even used the Texture_Reducer file that came with the file and still no dice. Also I tried using a separate texture reducer from BoulderCo and still nothing working.
