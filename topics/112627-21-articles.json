And given comma is used in other places while dot is used only in scale, it would be a lot easier to make editor read dot than vice versa. Also careful when saving the tree.\n\nEdit: I will just later do a text replace, but expect an update from me regarding ETT Today or tomorrow where I will add ALL mods from my list\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-09T09:27:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2016 09:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Grunf911**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grunf911","CreatedById":102151,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-09T13:07:31Z","Content":"Yay, created my first Git pull request, adding Cormorant Aeronology pack.

It might be related to the fact that I had installed some mod parts that were used on existing rockets and then decided to remove those mods later.  This took me down a few rabbit holes last night to try and figure out what was going on, but here\u0027s one of the holes I went down.\n\nI was a bit curious how the EngTechTree.cfg file works, so I downloaded the latest version from git and started poking around in it.  While looking around, I noticed in a few of the nodes, that there were parts with duplicate names.  This got me to thinking how many parts are duplicated in the tree.  Would having duplicate part names cause issues to where parts would be missing in the VAB?\n\nHere\u0027s the list of parts along with how many times they are duplicated.\n\n       9 |
