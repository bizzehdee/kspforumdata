Suprisingly, we were right, because after a few questions he spilled the beans and explained that these were prototype drone tugs for assembling a space station. They were designing them and he was only checking to see if they fit into the Persephones cargo hold before he would have taken off with them and the spaceplanes blueprints. We were only angry for about a second until we noticed that we had totally stolen some awesome tech from KASA without\u00A0even noticing!

They also told us that they copied the anti-tumbling system we had in the planes to keep the satellite stable since it didn\u0027t have any propulsion and that they had installed docking ports for the tugs and different ones for the cargo plane. When it was finished they fastened it into the cargo bay and gave our pilots an old game controller. Meanwhile we reminded them to take their jetpacks along. Then the Persephone took off again for a nocturnal flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KlJD41M.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022357\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KlJD41M.png\u0022 width=\u0022635\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter arriving in space, both of our pilots now didn\u0027t know how to find the tugs again. We also only broadly knew where they were. That information didn\u0027t seem of much use to them though, since \u0022somewhere above Kerbin\u0022 was deemed \u0022not helpful\u0022. Telssa came up with the idea to ping their signal and then follow the blip they gave off.

It seemed that they did an incredibly well timed launch just by pure luck. They boosted themselves closer to it and once they got under about 2500 meters, the tugs automatically established a connection to the satellite in the cargo hold. Now the pilots found out what the controller had been for. Elbart began to remotely steer the tugs closer with it. Then he undocked them from each other and to the freshly released satellites docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022N0yhxlh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022357\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N0yhxlh.png\u0022 width=\u0022635\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bTKam3E.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022357\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bTKam3E.png\u0022 width=\u0022635\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe turned out to be an absolute pro on the controller. We theorized he had played a lot of videogames and Telssa said she thought the same. Elbart didn\u0027t comment but instead did the docking flawlessly and with minimal fuel usage. It seemed we now had a real, actual space station, albeit a very small one.

They told us in no uncertain terms that they knew about the theft (which gave us a small shock, until we noticed they were only talking about the tugs) and that they were offering to write them off if we did something for them. They knew we had awesome planes and they \u0022kind of lost\u0022 two of their people in orbit, so they asked us to go pick them up since they would need much more time to mount a rescue mission. Of course we agreed but then noticed that the Traveller was just accelerating into orbit. So we told Telssa and Elbart to get back down quickly and our engineers to throw together a passenger cabin we could stick into the cargo hold of the Persephone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuicker than we thought possible the retrofit was done with another piece of unused plane fuselage.

Just after entering Kerbins shadow they met up with a science officer who introduced herself as Debty when she came on board and thanked everyone involved with her rescue.

Elbart took the controller again to steer one of the tugs since their payload was supposed to be added to the station. It was a fuel tank which would supply the Persephone for a planned M\u00FCn flyby. Despite Mirella and Debtys ideas, we weren\u0027t doing this for science, but for fame.

A retractable solar panel and several battery banks were added to both planes, which allowed the crew compartement of the Traveller to recieve a major upgrade in flight comfort with an entertainement system and a mini-fridge. While it was still grounded on account of it beeing cut in half and not quite in the process of beeing welded together again, the girls did the refueling run (they also snuck a mini-fridge aboard the Persephone and thought we would not notice it disappearing from the break room - we did, but only because our root beers had been in there).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QwLQYJv.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022357\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QwLQYJv.png\u0022 width=\u0022635\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022t0xGa33.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022358\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t0xGa33.png\u0022 width=\u0022635\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey actually had some fuel left over, which made us plan on adding two more tanks.

We wouldn\u0027t do that, but he gave us an idea - we could use a plane just for space which would be parked at the station. It could use a more efficient rocket engine and it wouldn\u0027t need jet engines at all, making it very light. Of course it wouldn\u0027t be able to get up to space by itself, so it would have to be carried up.

While she did the docking maneuver (slow, precise and resourceful) we heard him say that the station was their \u0022Sternenhafen\u0022 now.

So we got another coffee and then walked over there. Luckily we only interrupted some routine maintenance work. He started explaining that he had some made contact to important people in the aeronautics industry from when he worked with KASA and was offered a good deal on new high performance airplane parts because they thought he still was with them. We immediately told him to throw out whatever lie he needed to, because airplane parts are what we always needed. So he went off to get us cool stuff through good old-fashioned deceit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen we got out, the Traveller was already back, so we shoved in some more tourists and fuel and sent it back into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AQ8a4XOl.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AQ8a4XOl.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe didn\u0027t have to wait long for Macner to call in.

Our old rocket engines would be exchanged with aerospike engines that ... well, Macner kept talking and we were just nodding along at this point. We would take whatever upgrade we could get. Annoying KASA was a bonus. Our crew was told to upgrade the Persephone right away. Of course we wanted to see a test flight as soon as our pilots were back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTelssa turned out to be more than willing to snatch the maiden flight away from Mortimer for once. She listened to the specs, dragged Elbart into the cockpit and took off. It turned out the intial ascent became quite a bit easier since they went up quite steep, gaining speed all the way and only flattened out 14 km up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221ewFM78l.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1ewFM78l.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TZ3uxL5l.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TZ3uxL5l.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new engines pushed the Persephone higher and faster before the rocket engines had to take over at 20 km above sea level.

It turned out to be from orbit as well. A female, claminig to be a pilot at KASA, asked for our help.

We had to remind them that they were using the wrong plane for that. But luckily the Traveller was already beeing finished with its upgrades so we sent them down to change over. Another advantage of our planes - they were quickly made ready. In no time our pilots were on intercept course with the unknown pilot. Only after they took off we noticed that Debty was sitting in the passenger compartement.

She sounded excited and very happy when we informed her that she was about to be picked up. Her name was Daster, she explained, and that she was testing a spaceplane for KASA that developed quite severe problems on the way up that ended in a slight complete disassembly by explosion. When the Traveller got closer, it turned out she was drifting in a spaceplane cockpit designed very much like ours. We were about to be mad about the obvious design theft by KASA, but we do buy these parts stock - so anybody could do the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince Daster had her very own jetpack, she just disembarked her wreck and flew over to climb aboard.

It seemed those guys took horrible care of their people - they did tend to get lost in space and saved by us. Telssa introduced herself and Elbart and started to talk about piloting and planes.

She will make a great addition to our team we think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next stop was Sternenhafen, where Debty disembarked with quite some luggage.

Since there were always more tourists, we quickly got another fully booked orbital trip to send it back into space. It seemed Telssa and Daster had a talk in the meantime, because the latter was now in the cockpit together with Elbart and Telssa had thrown her feet up in our airport food court.

She did say \u0022Daster with an \u0027a\u0027\u0022, but we think she just misspelled \u0027Duster\u0027.

It would be pretty hard to make these timed launches and rendezvous then. Although with the money the tourist contracts are bringing in and the low costs of the spaceplane launch (its less than 2k for 75km orbit and back) the spaceport could buy its very own tracking station - if they were willing to part with the cash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-26T19:35:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2018 07:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Cherubiel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cherubiel","CreatedById":164793,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-30T19:55:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve made a 24 seater plane and I very much got to the limits of the stock contract system.
