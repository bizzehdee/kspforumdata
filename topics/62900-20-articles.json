This bug was EXTREMELY noticeable with KCT since it relies so heavily on the Space Center scene for interaction. The fix I used is simply disabling the ability to click on any KSC buildings (through a stock function). If the Build List is visible, hovering over it will enable the lock. When pretty much any other KCT window is visible, the lock is activated (hovering over the window or not). Unfortunately, for some moronic idea the lock that simply makes you not be able to enter a building, also pauses the game. No idea how that makes any sense, but it\u0027s what I\u0027m stuck with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Hovering over the build list pauses the game (stock bug) as a side effect of getting around another stock bug that would be worse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Advacar","CreatedById":115472,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T19:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, cool, glad I know what\u0027s causing it.

This one has a message during the first run window that alerts you to the stock bug that causes time to freeze while hovering over the Build List. It also changes the tech unlock time message to use the current time settings (Kerbin Time vs. Earth Time). Additionally, it has in-depth support for StageRecovery using the new StageRecovery API. When the two are installed together, KCT doesn\u0027t perform any of the booster recovery code but instead lets StageRecovery handle it. If a stage is successfully recovered, KCT receives the list of parts as if it had done it\u0027s own recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis let\u0027s you use StageRecovery\u0027s features without requiring KCT to do anything superfluous, and if I add code to SR to handle rocket based landings I don\u0027t need to do anything for KCT to recover the parts (since I\u0027m probably not adding powered landings directly to KCT, sorry). Currently, there is an advantage to using SR if you have a command pod on a stage, as SR will recover the kerbals (if you enable that feature) and will return 100% of the stock value as opposed to KCT\u0027s default 75%. Once powered landings and deadly reentry support are added to SR, it will be a perfect companion to enhance the booster recovery mechanics present in KCT.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T18:34:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to turn off the message spam every time a stage is recovered?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T19:42:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022severedsolo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022severedsolo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there a way to turn off the message spam every time a stage is recovered?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should only be one message per stage and only on a successful recovery.
