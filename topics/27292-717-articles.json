Upon arrival at Eve and numerous aerobraking orbits, and after running landing simulations a few times it has been decided that an actual landing with the ship as it is would be much too perilous. So the decision has been taken to repurpose the ship into an orbital station where it will conduct experiments in space instead of on the planet\u0027s surface. A window to launch a new Eve lander opens in about 180 days and there is plenty of time to fulfill the Explore Eve contract, so the higher ups at Mission Control agree, and are now calling for the engineers to design a new ship. The newly re-christened \u0027Eve StayShun\u0027 has recalled its two Gilly landers, gathered science from the upper Eve atmosphere and is now conducting experiments and transmitting the results back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/career/Eve%20Mission/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-18%20at%207.51.32%20AM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen%20Shot%202015-08-18%20at%207.51.32%20AM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, a quick check on the progress at the newly landed \u0027Duna Bass\u0027 revealed that its experiments are progressing nicely, and as the engineer went outside to repack the parachutes she noticed she was right on time to witness a full eclipse.
