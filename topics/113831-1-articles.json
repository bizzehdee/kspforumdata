It is one of those on the side mounted boosters you see below. I\u0027ll link you my craft aswell. Have a nice day Mr. developer! (Windows 8.1 64 Bit - Steam Edition - 353.30 Nvidia driver) Just btw. my GPU usage does weird stuff when I right click it. It goes from steady 30% to a wild zick zack. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGPU usage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/87c5I7e.png\u0022 alt=\u002287c5I7e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy craft \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/k5h5vnd745jr1u8/Space_Shuttle_1_0_3_fps.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/k5h5vnd745jr1u8/Space_Shuttle_1_0_3_fps.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fEfIBBx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fEfIBBx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS.

Placing 24 for example on an orange tank the frames drop allready to 25 - 30. I think this is not intended. This might also explain the insane lagg which was introduced with a recent update I had with my Shuttle but that is pure speculation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T11:08:03Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 11:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerbalEssences\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T06:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see a few other similar reports.

There is a memory leak in the tweakable GUI when the sliders are put in certain positions. It usually manifests itself as lag when the right-click options are open (as you described).
