My first Mun landing was successful except that I chose a fuel tank that was too small...I didn\u0027t have enough fuel to get back into orbit. I had to build a better lander and go rescue my crew. Landing near (600 meters away) the first lander was very hard for me and I wasted a ton of fuel, but I was able to pull it off. The first lander is still sitting on the Mun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T16:21:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Precision\u0027 lander (and within 1km counts) is a neat skill to have aquired.

Kept some break but now with 0.9 started again playing in Carreer mode as I like that best. Previously have had some mun/minimus trips succesfully and some rendeavouz in mun and earth orbit. I hope those would be just a bit easier. I though installed 2 mods (Kerbal Enginer and Mehjeb 2 or so). I have not tried rendeavouz with them yet, but I think they will help the process.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
