I\u0027ve also tried to make it fairly easy for others to add stuff in (custom models, or existing stuff from mods; both as engines or mounts), as JoseEduardo will likely attest to. Sure, I\u0027ll be using some of it in my releases... but likely only a small portion of what it is capable of (I have a tendency to go big when I\u0027m designing systems; often much more feature-filled than is needed for my own current needs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that note, I\u0027m thinking of adding a couple more capabilities to the engine cluster module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first would be free-scaling of the engine spacing, through a slider control in the editor right-click menu. So you could adjust the spacing of any engine layout if you didn\u0027t like the default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second would be free-scaling of the engine mount. The mount would use the default scale provided in the config definition, but would then be re-scalable to various diameters through in-editor gui controls. This addition would remove the necessity to have multiple mount-entries for different scales on the same mount, and would generally clean up the config/setup/configurability of the mount system quite a bit. Would also play in well with the upcoming upper stages, and might more eaisly allow me to design some upper-stage specific mounts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022riocrokite\u0022 data-cite=\u0022riocrokite\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAgreed about 1.875 specific size part Shadow, working on too many parts might quickly deplete your motivation and energy. \u003Cp\u003EMaybe it could be worth to limit number of parts for now on the account of wrapping up the whole mod.

I think as soon as I get the upper stage stuff implemented, the Ship-Core series of parts will likely be at that point. Mostly holding out as I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ll be breaking things a few more times before it is all done (still learning new things daily), and neither want to inconvenience people with broken saves, nor deal with the support for breaking them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent plan is to finish up one or two more engines (the J-2, and a small lifter engine if I can find one... perhaps a Merlin-1 variant), and start working on the geometry and plugin stuff for the upper-stages. After that I intend to open up a public-release thread where I will post the \u0027stable\u0027 releases (likely once a month or so), where I will attempt to not break things between releases. Weekly dev/testing releases will still be posted here and will continue with the current dev cycle and setup. I aim to have things to this state sometime -before- 1.1 is released (eta - Christmas); that way there is something to use/play with while waiting for everyone to update all the broken-ness that 1.1 will bring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, the eventual scope of the mod will be quite expansive. If you\u0027ve looked at the \u0027plans\u0027 section in the OP, I\u0027ve got things detailed out clear up to the 1.x version (feature/part complete). I have plans to do a series of station parts, land-based habitat/base parts, and even a set of rover parts. About the only thing I\u0027m not planning to do is aero/airplane parts; mostly because the symmetry needed for aero-craft works against the part-reduction theme pretty heavily. Though, I might still sneak in some prop-based motors and helicopter rotors at some point (both fueled and electric) (did I ever mention that one of my other hobbies is building and flying RC aircraft, helicopters, and quadcopters.... from scratch).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T20:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe RL10A3 clusters have the thrust of only 1 engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T21:40:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022_Augustus_\u0022 data-cite=\u0022_Augustus_\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe RL10A3 clusters have the thrust of only 1 engine.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENoted, and fixed in dev version.
