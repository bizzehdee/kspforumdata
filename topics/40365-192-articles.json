The unupgraded radiators never get hot enough to cause generator efficiency to go to zero but, of course, they do still cool the ship far more slowly. I think that is why there is some confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, reactors produce WasteHeat equal to their ThermalPower and generators consume an amount of WasteHeat equal to their electrical output. This is basically assuming that 100% of the energy that becomes electrical power does something useful and the rest is useless. Thermal rockets use up all the WasteHeat that their reactor is producing to power them, meaning they can always be powered without heat buildup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radiators calculate their temperature based on either the minimum reactor temperature or their own maximum temperature, whichever is higher. They start at the ambient temperature and then increase in temperature and thus WasteHeat dissipation until they hit the maximum temperature they can achieve - the amount they radiate at any given moment is determined by how full the WasteHeat bar is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor realistic power generation systems in space, the golden rule is that 50% of the system mass is radiators. If you want to run the 3.75m reactor in space at 100% power, then you will find that that is approximately correct in the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, you don\u0027t neccessarily need to run the system at 100% power - because thermal rockets have open cycle cooling you can make use of the reactor at 30% power for electrical purposes and still be able to run the reactor at 100% throttle without ever having WasteHeat issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy general approach has been to build unupgraded nuclear rockets that only dissipate the resting 30% WasteHeat because then you only need 30% of the radiator mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the power scaling, the smaller reactors are a little easier to cool with their associated radiator size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about emissivity differences? As I pointed out, the Stefan-Boltzmann Equation includes a term for emissivity (effectively how capable a given material is at radiating or absorbing heat), and Graphene radiators have a much higher emissivity than metal radiators in real life? My number-crunching before seemed to indicate the Graphene radiators had a roughly 25% greater emissivity (their maximum thermal radiance is higher than you would expect just from extrapolating the metal radiators to higher temperature ranges), which sounds reasonable...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to sound like a nag- but did you look at my numbers before? I agree, the station I discussed before did not have enough radiator area to deal with all the WasteHeat produced (nor did the 3.75m reactor with only 4 medium radiators- which can radiate up to 560 MW power, but produced 900 MW of heat on standby mode), but the generator efficiency still did decline MUCH more quickly than mathematical prediction indicates it properly should *IF* WasteHeat = 100% is when the maximum radiator/reactor temperatures are both reached... (and not before)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(the reactor doesn\u0027t necessarily need to be on all the time- the station is manned, and I\u0027m willing to turn off the reactor at regular intervals- but the efficiency plummeting much more quickly than it should with WasteHeat accumulation makes this strategy much less feasible)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MainSailor","CreatedById":74050,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T14:45:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this has been covered, but with 478 pages thus far it\u0027s kind of hard to search through the whole thread...but are there any plans to add science definitions and points to the parts that don\u0027t have them (i.e., the liquid chromatograph and the gamma ray spectrometer)?

Also, is it possible you could get an original texture for them? I find the resized Route-10 booster texture currently in use (in the version I am running, at least) to be quite ugly, as well as the Aluminum Hybrid Rocket Engines to be almost unusably large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, please don\u0027t forget about the emissivity issue I raised before. If the radiators don\u0027t already reflect emissivity differences, they should- and Graphene radiators should radiate more heat at a given temperature (relative to metal radiators) as a result of their higher emissivity... Look up emissivity with regards to the Stefan-Boltzmann Equation if you\u0027re not sure what I\u0027m talking about- no material is a perfect black-body, and the emissivity reflects how closely a material approaches being one (Graphene is a much better black body than most metals).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T14:51:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MainSailor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MainSailor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe this has been covered, but with 478 pages thus far it\u0027s kind of hard to search through the whole thread...but are there any plans to add science definitions and points to the parts that don\u0027t have them (i.e., the liquid chromatograph and the gamma ray spectrometer)?

Never the less I really like KSP and have enjoyed every minute of playing it. My point is that some of us just prefer to play using guides because that\u0027s our play style and as a casual gamer who really wants to learn how to use this mod effectively, a dedicated guide and up to date data base for all players would be extremely helpful, especially for such a massive mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T19:19:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor that matter, why are you getting rid of the Atmospheric Scoop Intakes, Fractal? I hate clutter in my resource display, and it was so nice to have an intake that produced ONLY the IntakeAtm that I needed to run the turbojets (which I am trying to use on Duna as well) rather than both IntakeAtm *AND* IntakeAir- the latter of which most of my designs don\u0027t use (and the intakes don\u0027t produce on Duna anyways...)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause they 1) Have an intake area 4x too large, 2) Don\u0027t produce any drag and 3) Don\u0027t produce both IntakeAtm and IntakeAir (which is totally illogical).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment, the module that produces IntakeAtm is ideally suited to being attached to existing stock and modded intakes because the stock intake module takes care of the drag calculations.

As I pointed out, the Stefan-Boltzmann Equation includes a term for emissivity (effectively how capable a given material is at radiating or absorbing heat), and Graphene radiators have a much higher emissivity than metal radiators in real life? My number-crunching before seemed to indicate the Graphene radiators had a roughly 25% greater emissivity (their maximum thermal radiance is higher than you would expect just from extrapolating the metal radiators to higher temperature ranges), which sounds reasonable...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment all radiators are assumed to have emissivity = 1. My impression is that, in space radiator systems, the practical emissivity is almost always very close to 1 and that choice of material actually makes only the most marginal difference. The value would start comfortably over 0.9 for the unupgraded radiators (most likely even higher than 0.95) so I don\u0027t really see the point of modelling it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lightwarrior\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lightwarrior\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, and i fully agree with this if we are talking about work.

At the start of career mode, why is the player given ammonia/water tanks and then given thermal rockets and reactors much later? These extra resources confused me at first and made me feel like I was missing something while I frantically searched for what these mystery parts/resources were for.

When I got the reactors, thermal rockets, and combinations of fuel (liquid/LFO/Kethane/etc), I did not know how to accurately predict the thrust with each combination.
