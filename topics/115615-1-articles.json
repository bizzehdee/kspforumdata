It processes too slowly to be useful earlier in career mode, and has too little capacity later on. Its science production is too powerful to ignore, but to use it requires constant babysitting. DSD Mobile Labs is designed to address these concerns.[/td]\n\n [td=\u0022width:128][![ctt_small.png](http://www.areadenialgames.com/ksp/ctt_small.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385)[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]Vanilla MPL changes\n\nThe stock MPL has received a weight reduction and a nerf to its data-to-science conversion rate. To compensate, the peak processing speed has been dramatically increased.\n\nNew Parts\n\n**DSD-I MPL** \n\nThe DSD-I is has a better data-to-science conversion ratio than the stock MPL, but converts at a slower rate. It is heavier than the stock MPL as well, and uses quite a bit more electricity. In general it is probably an upgrade to the stock version except in situations where you aren\u0027t expecting much more than 500 data and/or have serious weight restrictions. Has facilities for a single scientist.\n\n**DSD-II MPL** \n\nThe DSD-II maintains its predecessors data to science conversion rate, while significantly enhancing available data storage, science storage, and peak processing rate. The downside is significant weight, and an even greater electrical footprint. Has facilities for a single scientist.[/td]\n\n [td]\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Field Experience corrects this oversight, allow your scientists to increase their level \u0022in the field.\u0022\n\nMod Compatibility\n\nI am not aware of any incompatibility at the moment, but any more that modifies the stock MPL will probably have some issues.

O\\_o\n\nIs active MPL research a mod? I tried googling it but came up blank. \n\nAs for the research rate, yes. I know it seems shockingly high compared to stock, but there *is* a reason. I\u0027ve balanced the mod to have much higher return rates, but with comparatively low data-to-science rates. For example, without the mod, the MPL will give you five science for every one data but *it will take well over a year* to process, which basically means your primary limit to science return is time. \n\nWith DSD installed, you only get two or three science per data at best, but you will be able to process the majority of your data in weeks or even days in most cases. This adjustment shifts the limit on science return over to the production of data itself; you\u0027ll need more experiments to create more data, because you\u0027ll exhaust your existing data more quickly with less return.\n\n(Granted, you could always just have more labs and convert the same experiments multiple times, but that\u0027s super cheesey, and I\u0027m not balancing my mod around cheese ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) )\n\nAs for the \u0022low consumption rate\u0022 you mentioned, remember that the data-to-science *ratio* doesn\u0027t change or scale in any way. (I.E., in stock, 1 data will always produce 5 science) What changes is how long that conversion requires, which in the end gives us our science-per-day.\n\nStill, if you think the rates should be adjusted, you can make a module manager patch with your own rates very easily. The part names for the labs are Large\\_Crewed\\_Lab, DSD1, and DSD2.\n\n    @PART[Large_Crewed_Lab]:AFTER[DSD]{\t@MODULE[ModuleScienceConverter]\t{\t\t@researchTime = 5\t   \t//Stock = 7    Scales the time research takes exponentially (larger numbers equal longer research)\t\t@scienceMultiplier = 2\t\t//Stock = 5    The data-to-science return ratio\t\t@scientistBonus = .4266\t//Stock = .25  The star multiplier for scientist skill\t}}\n\nAdjust the values how you like, save that in a new text file, put it in gamedata, and name it something like DSDconfig.cfg (If you\u0027re curious how the science-per-day is calculated, I have a post on the [WIP thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127234-WIP-1-04-DSD-Mobile-Labs-With-more-Data-Storage-than-you-can-shake-an-experiment-at%21?p=2067546\u0026viewfull=1#post2067546) that details the formula.)\n\nAlso, if you come up with some rates you really like, let me know! The mod is stable, but I\u0027m always open to balance suggestions and testing ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nHope that helps you out! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T16:51:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 04:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JDCollie**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gosye","CreatedById":134899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T17:54:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is active MPL research a mod? I tried googling it but came up blank.\n\nNo, I\u0027ve meant that I had lab orbiting Minmus fully loaded with data and researching. As for the rates I tried to play with them for a bit, but completely messed up something at the end and got like 0.5 science per day in last tries =). \n\nIn my opinion to make science return balanced we have to cut down science per data to quite low numbers to compensate for quick processing speed or increase the processing time. For example with your basic rates fully loaded MPL will produce 1000\u002B science in around 2-3 weeks which is kinda OP it just makes science trips from Kerbal and back worthless. In stock high amount of return x5 balanced with very long processing speed so you can choose eather to fly from Kerbin to planet on science mission return back with it and get instant amount of science or fill MPL with data and wait for gradual return.\n\nFor my taste 2 science per data with 4-7 weeks processing time is still faster than stock one and leaves time for different missions while lab is working. With rates to high you will be just gathering science from station to station all the time and refilling them with new data. As for Scientist star rates I was wondering why .4266 and not just .4?\n\nAnyway those are just my thoughts since I\u0027ve felt your rates made the game feel easy and you can lay back and get your science heh."},{"CreatedByName":"Jivaii","CreatedById":75048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T00:15:28Z","Content":"I\u0027ve added a CLS patch to my install of DSD, if anyone else wants to use it, here it is.\n\n    @PART[DSD1]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]] {    MODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace\t\tpassable = true\t}}@PART[DSD2]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]] {    MODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace\t\tpassable = true\t}}\n\nI play with CLS and Ship Manifest, so having this entry makes my life alot easier."},{"CreatedByName":"Shaggygoblin","CreatedById":138214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T07:02:36Z","Content":"[Better Science Labs Continued](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125193-Better-Science-Labs-Continued) and this should team up!
