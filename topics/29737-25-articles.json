I\u0027ve come up with a solution that works pretty well. Since the ablative shielding is so effective, just nerf your heat shields. If you change the ablative shielding on the mk 1-2 pod to 250, this is what you get. With Ap of 2500km: Pe 25\u002Bkm=safe, Pe 20km=shield failure, pod is safe but you might lose parachutes, Pe 0km=death by fire. I\u0027m using FAR, btw. The Mk 1 pod is harder to nerf because it slows down so fast (higher surface/volume ratio). I\u0027ll let y\u0027all know if I find a good way to modify it without detracting from realism.
