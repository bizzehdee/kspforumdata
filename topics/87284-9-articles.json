The \u003Cstrong\u003E*GREATLY*\u003C/strong\u003E reduced TWR of stock engines even compared to LH2/LOX burning engines (which have a much higher ISP) as well as the reduced total thrust for the cross-sectional area (important for ballistic coefficient- meaning stock rockets cannot be built as tall off rocket engines at their base, and thus suffer increased drag) means that a KSP rocket of even the same diameter as a real-life rocket will under-perform it. \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENot to mention\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that the KSP rocket parts are LESS than 64% the scale of their real-life analogs (between 40 and 50%, usually). So, if you\u0027re aiming to maintain the relationship of rocket size to planet size, you should probably only be using a 5x-sized Kerbin (the stock Kerbin is 1/11th the diameter of Earth, not 1/10th, by the way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you install Real Fuels \u002B Stockalike, the mass of the stock engines is reduced to bring the TWR in line with real engines, and the ISP is adjusted to match real fuel mixes- but the total thrust is still much lower. So, even then, the engines still are greatly out-performed by their real life analogs. And, if you use FAR, then a 50%-scale rocket experiences MORE than 50% the total drag of the rocket it is based on, due to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESquare-Cube Law\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Like mentioned above, Kerbin is actually only 1/11th the scale of Earth. so to get a 64% scale, you\u0027d need to create a slightly larger than 7x scale Kerbin. \u003Cstrong\u003EPLEASE DON\u0027T\u003C/strong\u003E change the scale to make it even larger though- like I\u0027ve already pointed out, the stock rocket parts are actually only 40-50% the scale of their real counterparts (which would correlate to a 4.4x - 5.5x sized Kerbin system).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m saying, in short, is that in *some* ways RSS 6.4x scale is actually HARDER than real life. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe only thing that saves it from being a more challenging experience overall than full-sized RSS with Realism Overhaul is the beauty of the Rocket Equation\u003C/strong\u003E: 70-75% the Delta-V to orbit (7.5 - 8 km/s in 6.4x Kerbin, vs 10-11 km/s in real life) with a 50%-scale rocket and under-powered engines \u003Cstrong\u003Eis NOT\u003C/strong\u003E as hard as 100% the Delta-V to orbit on a realistic-sized rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it this way: you have to stack something slightly smaller than a rocket capable of making orbit on stock-sized Kerbin (3.5 km/s with FAR) \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eon top of\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E a rocket capable of making orbit in 6.4x Kerbin, in order to get a rocket that can make orbit in 100%-scale Earth. Even with under-powered Real Fuels \u002B Stockalike engines, and Procedural Parts Real Fuels Tanks, this is *STILL* an at least slightly more difficult task. And you also need to lift more payload to orbit to go anywhere beyond LKO in the 100% scale RSS game...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJust some thoughts really.\u003C/strong\u003E I hope you learned at least a few valuable tidbits out of my monlogue. \u003Cstrong\u003EHonestly, I\u0027m thrilled that somebody took up the mantle and made a all-in-one RSS 6.4x version\u003C/strong\u003E: stock KSP is just *WAY* too small for me (I\u0027d prefer the 3.2x scale config, actually, even if it\u0027s much easier than real life- but it does silly things I don\u0027t like such as giving Dres a rotational speed fast enough to completely eliminate all surface-gravity there similar to in Krag\u0027s \u0022Inaccessible\u0022...) And despite some of my personal play preferences for something a *little* smaller, \u003Cstrong\u003EI think it\u0027s GREAT work you\u0027ve been doing with the 64K config, and I hope you\u0027ll continue it well into the future!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-24T07:31:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2014 07:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mtshaw113","CreatedById":115693,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T18:14:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs 6.4x updated to 0.90 RSS yet?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EatVacuum","CreatedById":72754,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T03:13:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Paul Kingtiger\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to think all of that too, but actually there are a few things wrong with those statements:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Stock parts are actually almost all *LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO* 50% the scale of real life parts...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, he mispoke. from what I recall of discussion in the forums around the time of KSP 0.19 or so, the 0.64x scale \u0022rule\u0022 was worked out by modders based on the fact that the Kerbals were just over 1m tall and so approximately 64% the size of humans - a little shorter, but wider with those oversized heads and the proportionately huge helmets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the size of parts, ignoring modders (who are all individuals so I can\u0027t say what they base their decisions on) and the NASA parts which came later (and were made to be one size larger than the \u0022large\u0022 2.5m parts, not to accurately represent a particular scaling of real life), let\u0027s look at the stock parts. It seems to me that the stock parts are sized to fit the original Mk 1 and 1-2 capsules, and those capsules are 64% of the linear dimensions of their real world equivalents;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMk 1 pod is 1.25m diameter, which when you compare it to the Mercury capsule real world equivalent is pretty close to 0.64x the diameter.

They certainly didn\u0027t make the effort to scale their rocket engines or part weights to be proportionate to the scale of the capsules. Stock rocket parts are overweight and underpowered compared to their real world equivalents. And most other parts are way over weight as well, the reason for that was discussed somewhere in the forums a year or two back. If I recall correctly, a Squad dev explained that the weights and thrusts were balanced to make it necessary to build rockets that \u0022looked right\u0022 to get into orbit or to the Mun. (Can anyone find that thread?). So it was all about game balance and appearances, not about realistic scaling. That also explains why the atmosphere is as thick as soup - it increases the delta vee requirements to get to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd since someone is undoubtedly going to question my overweight comment, here\u0027s the weight calculations for the capsules;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMercury capsule weighed 1.5t, Mk 1 pod weighs 0.8t, about 0.53 x the weight.
