Their own weight is enough. Even with severe strutting, they shear the moment physics come in. They\u0027re probably intended to sit safely atop a rocket, but we all know I work a bit differently.\n\nJust to clarify, here: This isn\u0027t a gripe, and I ain\u0027t asking for things to change back to what they were. To me, this is an added layer of high difficulty that I gladly embrace. This will make things MUCH MUCH harder to build big!\n\nIn Whackjob land, science recommences.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI think I found the problem!\n\nDown below, in the inline storage protective bay thing, I put one battery of max radius, and an RCS can. They kinda fit. Apparently collision goes nuts if anything completely fills the interior. Doing more tests now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T17:58:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 05:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Whackjob**"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T18:12:42Z","Content":"I see where this is going... and i like it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T18:13:28Z","Content":"Meh, still 30min-24hours for the download to complete.\n\nI would ask though, are the struts snapping, the girders failing, or the a new mechanic in struts which changes effectiveness in compression / tension."},{"CreatedByName":"daffy","CreatedById":76045,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T18:17:14Z","Content":".....Should I say it????????? ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T18:20:22Z","Content":"Nope, none of those, Fel.
