Right now I am down to the FIFTH probe there and they always end up crashing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to various sources, Gilly maximum elevation is 6400 meters; so I always make sure to be at least 6500 meters high. As example, my last (the fourth one) probe was on a PE - 7200m / AP - 8500m orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was never able to witness the probe crashing, I just realize at some point it is no longer there... It usually takes a while (more than 100 Kerbin days for sure).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach time I had a probe, I waited several orbit just to be sure it was stable and it seemed stable. Yet they all ended up crashing so far. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy fifth one is in way higher orbit I\u0027d like (PE - 21000m / AP 25000m) to give it a chance to last (but even then I wonder if it will...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like the problem may be caused by the various physic engine imprecision; a difference of orbital speed of 0.5m/s around Gilly would be enough to down a probe (20.5m/s -\u0026gt; ~6700m orbit VS 20.0m/s -\u0026gt; crash) but I was never able to prove that theory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also observed that the orbit of the probe is ALWAYS wobbly around Gilly. The very same probe is stable around Eve, Duna or Ike but around Gilly, PE and AP move back and forth (even if the orbit is NOT perfectly circular). So another theory is that each \u0022wobble\u0022 cause imprecision that are eating decimals until the probe is not longer in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I the first one to experiment that kind of issues?
