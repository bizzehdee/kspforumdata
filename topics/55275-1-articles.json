I have exactly the same problem and it\u0027s really infuriating. It seems that KSP only allows you to make more resource files of a very specific limited few types - you can make meshes and textures for the sake of part files. Those it will scan through the GameData files looking for. But you can\u0027t just make any arbitrary Unity resources (like fonts) and have them get loaded, it seems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the frustration is that the only help you ever get from online forums about Unity all start from the presumption that you\u0027re in full control of the software from the ground up and and can design your Unity project in the Unity editor. For someone making a mod for KSP, that\u0027s just not true. You have to live with the design SQUAD made. THEY didn\u0027t add the font you want to THEIR resources, so you have to add it on the fly at runtime.
