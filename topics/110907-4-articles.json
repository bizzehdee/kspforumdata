Thank you for assuming that even though you don\u0027t know me.me . \n\u003E Now, I use KER and EVE, but I consider myself a stock player. And I probably play that way until I\u0027ll get bored (I can stop playing completely by that point, though) there\u0027s a number of reasons for that:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1) I have experience playing heavy-modded Minecraft, so I know how it feels. At some point I stopped playing Minecraft and started playing RedPower, IndustrialCraft, Thermal Expansion, etc. While that\u0027s nice, I can\u0027t get back and play vanilla anymore, it became a different game for me. I might get there at some point, but while stock works for me, I\u0027ll play stock.\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) I don\u0027t want to bother with managing all the stuff, updating, running out of memory, finding which mod caused that nasty bug, etc. \n\u003E \n\u003E 3) Now this is a bit too global, but still, I want to respect developers work and give some feedback. It\u0027s quite often to point some balance issue or suggest a feature, and get a response like \u0022use [mod name]\u0022. You are not helping! It\u0027s like suggesting to devs to abandon all development except for the engine and bugfixing, and I think I have actually seen such suggestions. No! Stock should be playable as it is without mods so if I think there\u0027s an issue with it, I point it out. For the \u0022respect\u0022 part it is just making me cringe when people start discussing how worthless Squad is because fairings don\u0027t separate in two parts. Seriously...\n\u003E \n\u003E Answering from mobile so sorry for stupid mistakes and bad English.\n\nI didn\u0027t assume that, and didn\u0027t really get that vibe from anyone else but I can be pretty dense sometimes too. Ignore any haters either way, those are all perfectly valid reasons to play stock. That\u0027s what makes this game great is that you can play it or mod it just about any way you see fit and that the problem some of the time is that some people have their own idea how to play and everyone else should do the same. Of course I think this is really just a small vocal minority, most people seem to have a live and let play attitude."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T20:25:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You use the exact same reasoning for using KER (automate something you could do, but don\u0027t think you should have to do) as others give for Mechjeb, but somehow your particular choice is more legit?\n\nIt\u0027s really perfectly consistent. I make no comment about whether KER, MJ or anything else is \u0027legit\u0027. I\u0027m merely saying that if you let the computer do it for you, you can\u0027t take any credit for having done it. I certainly don\u0027t expect anyone to be impressed that I know how much dV my ship has if KER told me the answer--though if I were doing those calcs in my head, while burning, I might be a little pleased with myself. Similarly, I\u0027ll applaud a pilot who can nail a dead-stick landing on the runway from orbit or dock to a ship with naught but a whiff of mono (or, none at all!) But if MJ does those things for you? Well, then bully for MJ.

Forgive me for cheating.\n\nCheat - verb\n\n1. act dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage, especially in a game or examination.\n\nI can\u0027t for the life of me understand why playing a game designed to accept mods with mods is cheating. Cheating doesn\u0027t apply in a single-player game with no competition. It\u0027s a sandbox game, it\u0027s impossible to cheat a sandbox game. Using MechJeb isn\u0027t dishonest, nor is it unfair, nor does it give you an advantage over another.\n\nYeah, if you\u0027re doing a challenge and use mods you\u0027re not supposed to, that\u0027s cheating... because it\u0027s no longer a single-player experience.\n\nPlay the game how you want to, and let others play how they want to. Nobody is hurting anybody until they start degrading others for how they play.\n\nSometimes I like playing stock because it feels like I\u0027m doing everything. I\u0027m running a space agency, and piloting the crafts, and calculating transfers and delta-v. Other times I like playing with something like MechJeb, because then I can act more like a higher-up. I don\u0027t specifically do the piloting, I may plan a maneuver and then just tell my pilot to execute it. \n\nIt\u0027s a great game with many different flavors.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T20:35:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LittleBlueGaming**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T20:32:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As to why that attitude persists, I think it\u0027s because for many flying is the *raison d\u0027\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00AAtre* of the game and doing natural logarithms is not.\n\nThat\u0027s true, but the thing I don\u0027t get is those who think other parts of the game are the *raison d\u0027\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00AAtre*, like building or planning, don\u0027t look down their noses at those who don\u0027t do those things themselves.

First, building: there is no fully automated MJ equivalent--you either build your own ships or you download someone else\u0027s craft. Since everyone would agree that taking credit for someone else\u0027s craft is plagiarism, we only post awesome builds that we ourselves have made. \n\nPlanning is similar; there are tools like KER and the online transfer window calculators, but they only do a small part of the job. Something big and rep-worthy like an orbital assembly or Grand Tour mission takes independent thought that no one else can do for you. So, we post our plans and can say \u0022look at my awesome space program!\u0022\n\nThat leaves piloting. I think part of the trouble here is that MJ is so darn good at it; in a lot of cases we measure a human\u0027s piloting skill by how close (say, in ascent dV) he can come to MechJeb. For a human to be able to do what MJ does takes hours of practice, trial and a great deal of error. Take docking. For those that do it manually, how long did it take you to be able to plot a close rendezvous using maneuver nodes? How long after that to maneuver the ships in visual range, with the navball? How long after THAT to line the ports up, cancel relative velocity, and get that oh-so-satisfying \u0027click\u0027? Anyone who has done all that is rightly proud of the achievement, and knows that every routine dock that comes afterward is only possible because of the hours spent doing the first one. If you\u0027re that kind of pilot, then a big part of your \u0022look at my awesome space program!\u0022 will be the ships rescued from the brink of disaster, the tricky orbital assemblies, that Tylo landing you pulled off with not enough TWR and vapor left in the tank. We want to compare ourselves against each others\u0027 awesome space programs--and we can\u0027t compare our piloting to that of players who use MechJeb, because MechJeb does the piloting."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T21:27:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maybe so, but I haven\u0027t seen it.

The difference is the level of vehemence when it comes to piloting, and the disdain for those who choose to automate it. I can\u0027t think of a time when someone wrote \u0022Well, that\u0027s no accomplishment because you used procedurals and KER\u0022, but the position \u0022There is no accomplishment using MechJeb\u0022 is hardly uncommon.\n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe it is just a pilot thing, who knows? Anyway, not trying to turn this into an eventually-locked MechJeb thread, I think we can all agree that stock players are not cheaters. (Except those who part clip...or edit saves...or use the debug menu...or exploit glitches...aw, nuts.)\n\nRIC,\n\n If I had to guess, it would be because piloting is the active hands-on gameplay portion of KSP. Using MJ to pilot your craft is kinda like using an AI to control your character while playing a FPS. People are bound to call it \u0022cheating\u0022, especially if it performs better than an actual human player.\n\n Not sayin\u0027 \\*I\\* consider it cheating, mind you.
