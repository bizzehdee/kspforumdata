The Russians had all of ONE operational manned rocket design (the R-7 family) throughout the space race and even to today, and that very same launch system gripped a large portion of the Russian unmanned launch industry as well, with only Kosmos and Proton really even coming close. Meanwhile, the Americans put astronauts on Redstone, Atlas, Titan, Saturn rockets and the Shuttle, and launched satellites on all of these (or derivatives) as well as Vanguard, Scout, Thor/Delta, and several others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always took the wider number of US boosters to have started out as a case of the US engaging in parallel development of \u0027low-risk\u0027 and \u0027high-risk\u0027 designs for the same requirement, as most clearly seen in the parallel development of the \u0027low-risk\u0027 Atlas and the \u0027high-risk\u0027 Titan I (which, ironically, was more conservative in most ways--but it did require that airstart worked!), then gradually turned into a case of having this wide range of boosters available, so smaller payloads would get launched on the smaller boosters designed for shorter-range work, because they cost less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I\u0027m oversimplifying; it\u0027s just a case where it\u0027s interesting that in many ways, the Soviets had competition going for their space launch program to a great degree more than the US one that was dominated by von Braun. Perhaps part of the reason for that perception was the relative openness of the US program, where contractors knew what their competitors were doing, so they wouldn\u0027t keep developing their design after someone else got the contract?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EChelomei\u0027s flyby proposal and Korolev\u0027s landing were BOTH batted around a bit, but eventually Korolev\u0027s route WAS selected.

It MIGHT have helped things go smoother after Korolev\u0027s death and perhaps keep the project from getting cancelled after Apollo\u0027s victory, since Chelomei would\u0027ve been there to take charge, but that might have backfired as well if Chelomei was as bitter as Glushko seemed to be (I don\u0027t know enough about the man to make that judgement).\u003Cp\u003ENow, the other way around, having OKB-1 help out with the more modest flyby proposal... now THAT probably would\u0027ve worked out, and they probably would\u0027ve beaten the Americans to it there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was true; Brezhnev\u0027s *initial* solution to the problem was to give the flyby to Chelomei and the landing to Korolev, which qualifies as the sort of clusterfuck decision that only a government can make. Of course, the decision to pull the plug on Chelomei\u0027s flyby mission wasn\u0027t made until 1968, after they\u0027d completed several unmanned Zond flybys. (And it was probably the right call, given that Zond was a modified Voshkod, and Voshkod was a deathtrap that they got VERY lucky with for the three flights before they ran away.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIronically, even if the Soviets had put everything behind the flyby proposal and completed that first, the US would still have claimed victory, since Kennedy\u0027s challenge wasn\u0027t to fly by the moon, but to *land*, and the Soviets wouldn\u0027t have completed that. Honestly, the only way that I really thought OKB-52 *directly* working on the landing program would have helped was having a bit more manpower to throw at the engineering, and maybe forcing Glushko to work with Korolev despite the personality conflicts. My meaning was more that the mere presence of OKB-52 divided the Soviet program\u0027s focus and funding; if not for OKB-52, it\u0027s entirely possible that Korolev would have been able to get some test stands built for the N1 and gotten ground testing in so that Mishin wouldn\u0027t have been having to try to beg Brezhnev not to cancel the project after each in-flight failure that *should* have been solved in ground testing, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think Saturn was nearly as cheap as you think it was.

It could not be elevated whole, and thus required vertical assembly which again requires more labor to work on. It relied on several different manufacturers, and if you\u0027ve ever been to the Boeing Everett plant and looked at the 787 production line vs. the 747 line, you can easily see why this can be extremely problematic for large-scale production.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I meant in a relative sense; the R\u0026amp;D cost and tooling costs had been paid, so now it was just incremental costs, the actual direct cost of building and flying the booster, as the overhead had been paid by the Apollo program.

(The thinking on the INT-20 was that the use of the three-engine version of the S-IC as a first stage would have allowed them to shut down the S-IB production line and gain increased economies of scale by using the same line for both the heavy-lift and medium-lift Saturns.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd of course, there\u0027s always the chance that it would end up going the route that the Shuttle did, with some fatal disaster occurring SOMEWHERE down the line (which is sorta bound to happen after you start racking up dozens upon dozens of launches), resulting in a big hearing and a whole slew of expensive and unrelated safety measures that drive your per-mission costs through the roof, and also inflicts a prolonged period of downtime as well.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, that would have happened, for certain.

Over at Everett, they\u0027re shipping in fuselage sections and all sorts of other components from different manufacturers all over the world, bringing them in and trying to fit them all together on a slow, makeshift non-moving assembly line. They get roughly two out per MONTH, for about $200 million apiece.
