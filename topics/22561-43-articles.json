Most characters are being padded with 0x00 correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the workaround we used was to funnel all uses of Event.current.character through a function that looks for when the high byte of the unicode is 0xff, and if it is it turns it into 0x00 instead. There\u0027s *hopefully* no keyboards out there that actually use the unicode characters in the range 0xff00 through 0xffff so this should be okay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI posted about the problem over on the Unity forums and it seems to definitely be a bug in Unity.

Under 3 fps and a high physics load on a ship with less than 150 parts. Space centre, VAB \u0026amp; Tracking station all worked fine, the problem was only apparent when controlling a vessle or in map view.
