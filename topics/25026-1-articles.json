I\u0027m trying to get to around 88 deg for mapping purposes, and my current orbital inclination is around 94 deg. I don\u0027t have a protractor laying around that I could hold up to the monitor, so I\u0027m really hoping that there\u0027s an in-game way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatBum","CreatedById":57405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T21:26:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/protractor-for-ksp-0-18/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProtractor\u003C/a\u003E mod.

I think there was a misunderstanding, or perhaps I wasn\u0027t quite clear. Lemme try again. Right now, I\u0027m in orbit around Minimus. My orbital angle is ~94 deg. I want to get it to ~88 deg. So, when I\u0027m plotting a course by putting down a node, is there a way to see the angle of my projected path? That is, the angle of the dotted orange line. Sorry, not entirely up on the terminology, and if Protractor does indeed do that, then my bad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatBum","CreatedById":57405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T21:58:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb 2 can plan maneuvers to adjust exact inclination, something MechJeb 1 can\u0027t do.
