Alright, killing processes doesn\u0027t look like it\u0027s going to get us anywhere. We\u0027re going to need to fiddle with the settings just a tad. Upon a reboot, the processes should start again, so if you\u0027ve not already done that by this time, please do. Open up the NVIDIA Experience control panel -- you should be able to do this from its taskbar icon. Look for KSP in its list of games, and disable Shadowplay, as shown here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://international.download.nvidia.com/geforce-com/international/images/geforce-gtx-780/geforce-experience-shadowplay-preview-1.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://international.download.nvidia.com/geforce-com/international/images/geforce-gtx-780/geforce-experience-shadowplay-preview-1.png\u003C/a\u003E (click the switch at the left of the smaller dialog box)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fayer3","CreatedById":134878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T10:45:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you mean I should only disable Shadowplay then I have this already disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is because I run in Nvidia Surround but at 1920x1080, and it is not possible to use Shadowplay when using Surround.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
