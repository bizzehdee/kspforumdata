It can take some fiddly manual save editing, and there\u0027s no guarantee every craft can be preserved - in particular anything landed may go boom when you switch to it if the planet terrain has changed. But the overall save should be able to stay.\n\nPS: And so far so good for KSP 1.1.2, Kop 1.0.3, and NH 1.7. The system loads and is playable. There are a few glitches - I just ran over to Leouch on fuelhack and the atmosphere is physically present but visually invisible.\n\nAnd then the game crashed during the atmo descent, but I believe that *that* is a general crash issue on Linux independent of the mods. Sadly even if NH works fine, that crashing could well nix my KSPing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-04T00:37:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2016 12:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by cantab**"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimumSky5","CreatedById":115138,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T01:24:44Z","Content":"As for compatibility, 6.4k now uses Sigma Dimensions, not Kopernicus, so if you want to use both delete the compatibility fiefdom new Horizons, it\u0027s not needed any more."},{"CreatedByName":"MisterFister","CreatedById":85686,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T15:27:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On \u200E2016\u200E-\u200E04\u200E-\u200E26 at 4:52 AM, Dombi said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yup it is.

Going in to manually delete GameData folders after a delete spree is a good idea, but I think it\u0027s a better idea to fully uninstall KSP, manually delete the Kerbal Space Program folder from Steam, and then reinstall from Steam, just to ensure that you have a solid working copy clean of partially-uninstalled mods.
