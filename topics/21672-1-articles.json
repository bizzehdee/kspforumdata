It get\u0027s better. The fuel they are working on is a combination of a hydrogen isotope called deuterium, and a lithium isotope called Li6, in a crystalline structure. Yeah, that\u0027s right, Dilithium Crystals.

From Kepler dreaming about walking on the moon, to Jules Verne writing about an all electric powered submarine decades before it was possible. Steve Jobs didn\u0027t invent the idea of the iPad either, that was thought up in the 1930\u0027s and you can even see a working concept of a flat digital interface device in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Karel Capek, in the 1920\u0027s, wrote about sentient androids he called Robots. Arthur C. Clarke also predicted that we would have geosynchronous satellites back in the 1950\u0027s. Ever read \u0027A Brave New World\u0027? Aldous Huxley predicted we would map the human genome and be able to manipulate it and artificially conceive babies.

NASA has barely been mentioned in presidential campaigning in the past, and it isn\u0027t a focus of any significant public debate. There\u0027s the war driver (which is what got man on the moon, it was not for the sake of pure science), but there\u0027s also the economic driver (see Planetary Resources). There\u0027s a future in space without the war driver and it all hinges upon lowering the cost of getting things into space, which is what a lot of companies are trying to achieve in different ways, for both cargo and humans. However, war is still a driver. Neil deGrasse Tyson often jokes that if China say they want to establish a military base on Mars the US would be there in 10 months. 1 month to design and build the spacecraft and 9 months to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
