Especially when there is a high gravity. The only thing i can suggest is to try to dock the parts on a mostly flat surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI somewhere so a mod that rebalances the wheels so that the vehicle is horizontally when possible.

Configuration: rotating hub, radial attachment point, some structural fuselages for distance, desired KPBS part (attached by its top node to have the floor pointing outward). Apply symmetry as desired.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBeside planetary bases, for this use it is very nice to have crew parts that are designed to work in an environment with gravity (even though the artificial gravity has no actual gameplay effect).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nA minor issue with this setup is that while the centrifuge is spinning, the IVA meshes seem to ignore the motion of the parts they belong to. But I suspect this is a stock bug - I\u0026#39;ve seen the same happen with stock IVAs when a long craft wobbles significantly. (The IVA stays put at its original position, while the exterior of the craft (visible through the window) wobbles around.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks for the great mod!\n"}]}
