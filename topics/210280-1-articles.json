I have, however, run into an odd issue with aircraft. I have a design that works just fine and flies perfectly, but during stable, level flight the wings will just randomly explode. Examining the F3 log states that the wings broke apart due to g-forces, exceeded g-force tolerance. This is weird as they aren\u0027t experiencing any undue g\u0027s at the time. I\u0027m not 100% sure, but it seems to be happening consistently during a mission where I\u0027m flying to the south pole and start decelerating, but I can\u0027t quite pin down the inciting factor that destroys the wings.\u00A0 Strangely, its also exploding with the Part G-force Limits difficulty setting unticked.

It should tell you they are damaged. An engineer can repair the damage. I don\u2019t recall if I made that require repair parts or not. The damage is in levels and the higher the damage the higher the skill required.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: the way it\u2019s coded is that tolerances are degraded commiserate with damage level. The greater the damage, the less resistant the part has to withstand forces. It\u2019s actually supposed to fall off before destruction but that never worked right\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething else occurred to me. Those wings might have TPS upgrades.
