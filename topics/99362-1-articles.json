I loaded the ship and was just thinking, wow that\u0027s pretty smart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShape actually doesnt matter with boats, nor does short circuting. the problem is that KSP\u0027s water is harder than land - it will tear a ship apart if it hits too hard. It\u0027s because while hitting land the parts that break slow you down, but water does not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solutions of ships is to use high- impact parts on the water - that means don\u0027t let fuel tanks and engines touch it. The ship\u0027s shape doesnt need to be pointed, it can be square even, just as long as it sits well - I just make the pointed shape to make it look better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the bottom is left open to reduce drag, because a closed hull isn\u0027t needed in KSP - the parts themselves float enough to work. also, putting radial intakes on the bottom of the hull (the parts under the water) reduces drag, which is really important on a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s boats in a nutshell - there\u0027s a lot more to it (like nuclear power and submarines), but you might not understand it at this point - but if you need help just ask me, I\u0027m First Sea Lord for a reason \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Zekes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7luwkSl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227luwkSl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T23:36:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Little Katie:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas that your first attempt at a boat? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E Looks nice!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMine was bad:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7XNt8L4.png\u0022 alt=\u00227XNt8L4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough, my second was better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nIRRBX9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nIRRBX9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELove the paddlewheel.
