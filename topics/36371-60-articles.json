With that in mind, perhaps you should turn it upside down and put it above the adapter holding the LV-N, then connect the lower stage to the interstage and leave the LV-N hanging like that?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-13T08:55:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2014 08:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sean Mirrsen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T13:48:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FenrirWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FenrirWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think I understand how the interstage adapter works. I\u0027m trying to use it to create a wider engine fairing for the LV-N. The adapter shows up as a decoupler in the staging view, but when I activate it via staging it doesn\u0027t come apart. Here\u0027s a pic of the setup I\u0027m going for, with 2 of the fairings removed for examination\u0027s sake:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GP7i1d7.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/GP7i1d7.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo idea. I\u0027ve used almost that exact setup before, with no problems. Though my fairing top height tends to be a bit wider than yours, so you might look into the clipping theory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
