Pulling up too fast will cost you velocity, and not getting to a safe altitude fast enough will make you overheat and explode at such high speeds. I usually break the sound barrier at an altitude near 15km, then pull up so I hit 1200m/s or so at 25km, switching over to rocket propulsion shortly after, as the air thins out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main issue is making sure you get out of the lower atmosphere before drag from hypersonic flight pulls your spaceplane apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dogface","CreatedById":75396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T17:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I will try that.

It has uses in reentry, but there are plenty of ways of dealing with that without flying a piece of Styrofoam. Use utility/cargo bays and only attach radially what you need. (gear, wings, ladders, and engine nacelles) Use as few of the largest wrong pieces you can for your lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerobic thrust is your enabler. Jet dV is cheap in every sense.
