I can keep the speed down, but then I dont get near an Ap of 70km. \n\nMy nose is made up of air intakes, for obvious reasons.

Pulling up too fast will cost you velocity, and not getting to a safe altitude fast enough will make you overheat and explode at such high speeds. I usually break the sound barrier at an altitude near 15km, then pull up so I hit 1200m/s or so at 25km, switching over to rocket propulsion shortly after, as the air thins out.\n\nThe main issue is making sure you get out of the lower atmosphere before drag from hypersonic flight pulls your spaceplane apart."},{"CreatedByName":"Dogface","CreatedById":75396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T17:35:41Z","Content":"Thanks, I will try that.

Then have enough anaerobic dV to reach orbit.\n\nIt is hard to survive maxing out the aerobic velocity of a space plane SSTO because you want as much acceleration in high Mach as possible for a better final aerobic speed. (balanced against the alternative of more fuel mass to get that speed in anaerobic mode) Optimal ascent should see you redline before temperatures drop as you climb out of the atmosphere. The relevant variables are many more than old aero.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T21:02:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 09:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T21:14:10Z","Content":"Ram Air intake has the highest heat resistance, only use that, no Shock Intakes or anything.\n\nGo up about 7km, reach about mach 1.5, start a slow incline, maybe 10 degrees, make sure your incline does not reduce your acceleration too much.\n\nWhen you reach mach 2 tip higher at about 20-30 degrees, it will start to overheat but once you reach 25km up the air resistance will be low enough for you to stop heating up.

This may allow you to take off before the runway\u0027s end, but too little lift can increase your drag when you have to maintain to high an AoA for lift.\n\nDrag saps your dV and increases your thrust requirements. It has uses in reentry, but there are plenty of ways of dealing with that without flying a piece of Styrofoam. Use utility/cargo bays and only attach radially what you need. (gear, wings, ladders, and engine nacelles) Use as few of the largest wrong pieces you can for your lift.\n\nAerobic thrust is your enabler. Jet dV is cheap in every sense. You want enough thrust to go fast before you run out of air or blow up. Too much though is wasted mass.\n\nAnaerobic dV is how you go from airplane to space plane. 1.8 Km/s vacuum should get you to an 80x80 orbit from 1 Km/s @ 18 Km. You still want a respectable thrust here, but it is a more relaxed requirement."},{"CreatedByName":"Dogface","CreatedById":75396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T19:11:37Z","Content":"Thanks guys.

My crashes were happening after an ascent, so it makes sense that temp may have been playing a role. \n\nI also managed to get my SSTO back to Kerbin without exploding any parts. I mostly just dropped the Pe to 50km and aimed prograde, I opened my airbrakes (10) and burned RCS thrusters backwards (not sure that did much, but it gave me something to do). So it is a proven SSTO. I seem to have experienced less heat on the reentry than I did on the ascent. \n\nThank you all very much for your advice. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIf you are having SSTO problems and looking for design hints, I used a heavily modified version of this ship...\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/02waGk1xlNY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T16:34:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 04:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dogface**"}]}
