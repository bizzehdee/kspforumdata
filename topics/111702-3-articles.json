I\u0027m not going to stitch together podcasts, devnotes, tweats, reddit, forums, and such. So you can take my word for it, or not, but I believe this is how it came to pass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-There was a deliberate decision to include fairings in the game to include with the pending aero changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Somewhere in the initial testing/design for fairings, it was decided that procedural fairings were the way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Procedural fairings were implemented, deliberately confetti style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Procedural confetti syle fairings went through some level of testing, after which PA pictures were released. (I don\u0027t recall if this was at the end of QA or during Experimentals.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Enter community lashback, some constructive, some not (but that\u0027s another topic)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-After some time, community feedback was considered and another statement (linked above) was made. The decision to leave the confetti style for now was made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn coding my fairing work, I see evidence that the consideration for clamshell style fairings, but not the full imlementation. There is a Field variable (called something like panelGrouping) that is unused. It appears that this would have been a variable that would be the number of vertical panels to lump together, so you could increment in steps from full confetti style to full clamshell...just like you can with the number of panels around the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt believe, based on timing of testing/release and the timing of public statements, that they chose to focus on other work (such as bug fixes or aero balance), rather than implement the code changes to incorporate the panelGrouping option. It does require code changes, namely the inclusion of the actual variable to flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I\u0027d prefer to not siderack this thread too much, which I myself am now guilty of.
