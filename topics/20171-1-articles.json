I use 2m rocket parts as the shuttle is meant to have a crewtank onboard. This is to facillitate passenger transfers to the Mun and back. It\u0027s supposed to be reusable, thus it can only have one stage. Refuelling is not a problem. That can be taken care of. Basicly, I need to know how to make a spaceplane that follows the specified conditions below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 1 Stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Nothing that has to be decoupled (No SRBs etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Has enough fuel at start to get into orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Has at least 1 Crew Tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Must have landing/takeoff capabilities\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Must be able to go to the Mun and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all. For the record I use the Down Under Aerospace and Party Supplies Pack, Crewtank, Deep Space Parts Pack, NovaPunch Remix pack, Shuttle Booster System and MMI\u0027s Payload Pack as my core mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for anyone who can help. I can upload pictures of my current design if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I mean refueling as in on the ground refueling. Refueling can be done in orbit as well once I get my satellite up there, so don\u0027t count on that one. When I manage to establish a Mun Base that will also have a refueling station.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-24T11:57:41Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2012 11:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by T-Pilot395\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T12:18:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight be a while before we see some good SSTO designs out there. Since everyone is off to the planets at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were a few Mun return capable craft around in 0.16. However, with the.... change... in 0.17, I don\u0027t expect to see many of those doing repeat trips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, with the new NERVA engine, I actually think a Mun return capable SSTO is now easier - no refueling needed. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a great mix to be discovered of jets, aerospikes and NERVAs to give you a great TWR profile for ascent, and a nice high ISP for a large delta-V once in orbit. Looking forward to seeing the designs and building myself... just after this next Duna visit... and some Jool missions... and... those moons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-24T12:21:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2012 12:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by bsalis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Pilot395","CreatedById":42189,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T04:13:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never thought of using multiple engine types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try that out soon.
