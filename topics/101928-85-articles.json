I looked through about 15 of the 70 pages before I decided to just ask again. I love KIS, I use it all the time. However, suddenly the Inventory button doesn\u0027t appear on my Kerbals in EVA, and if I click on the Inventory button on a container the menu just flashes for a second without remaining open. I haven\u0027t installed any new mods. I\u0027ve taken as many mods out as I can before I start having part loading issues.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Any idea what may be the culprit? (I have a full base packed up and landed, no way to unpack it. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022))\n\u003E \n\nThis one was driving me nuts because it was seemingly intermittent. I think I finally figured out what was the cause so I wanted to give an update in case anyone else is having this issue. I use the mod \u0022Quickstart\u0022. If I load up the last saved vessel, KIS will not work. However, if I go the spacecenter and back to the vessel it all works. Easy fix for alot of frustration."},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos Rast","CreatedById":157420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T23:35:12Z","Content":"So I\u0027ve been having some issues with \u0022allowPartAttach.\u0022 No matter the value I set it to (1 or 2), it says it requires a tool to detach it.
