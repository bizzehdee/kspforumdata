With control surfaces conventionally placed at the rear, pitching up pushes the rear end down, which invariably caused a splashdown. I added a control surface at the front and set it to respond to pitch, and disabled pitch on the two rear control surfaces. Now pitching up causes the front to rise and I can pull up without the rear end striking the water."},{"CreatedByName":"Hunter3081","CreatedById":61490,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T05:42:50Z","Content":"Here\u0027s my entry:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

View full album](//imgur.com/a/GqGtH)\n\nGiven:\n\n- A request to build a Moller Skycar\n\n- A challenge to land on the island runway without breaking 150m\n\n- A challenge to land a VTOL on the island hangar and then on the VAB\n\nI concluded if I can build a Skycar, surely it can complete both of those challenges easily enough, including the bonus of reaching zero altitude on the way. How hard could it be? Oh, the hubris of ambitious engineers...\n\nThe hardest part of this one was getting onto the end of the runway without busting the ceiling, which drove me to redesign the Skycar to make this easier. Even so it was an exercise in jet-lag VTOL bouncing around the berm at the end of the runway until I could get over the edge but under the virtual limbo bar. I\u0027m told the Benny Hill theme should be playing over this section of the video.\n\nLowest altitude: After using the retro jets to slow down, I took the time to dip into the ocean before climbing onto the runway. It looks like it settled half a meter into the water but the altimeter stops at zero. I thought it would be cool to jetski up onto the island and then hop up to the runway, but the engine pods shear off too easily.\n\nFlawless completion: The Skycar not only survived, but went on to complete the Island VTOL race in the same flight.\n\nThis video is an engineering demonstration of the craft completing the challenges. My pilots have not practiced the run to find the fastest time possible. Craft and aero are stock. Time of completion was 8:07.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/zRdEfhBVS30?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T20:42:10Z","Content":"Here is mine.
