Among the events were performances by The Smoking SRB\u0027s s,the Great Flaming Mainsails and that bard from on top of that one hill on the far side of kerbin named Gregsby There were many games for the children like Toss the Booster, bob for mini boosters(cans of Kola in a miniaturized Booster Bay(kiddie Pool) among others others.Jeb was to give a lecture on the early days of the space program There were also to be several eating events featuring teams of celebrity kerbals like the disastrous 3(Jeb, Bill, Bob) on one team and Emand Kerman ( first kerbal to go faster than 2.5 km/s in a jet powered plane) and Munfred Kerman (the first kerbal to land on Duna) on the other team.The first of these events was the Speed Snack Eating Contest, next was the Mint Ice Cream Contest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart II\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Disastrous 3 having won the coin toss to decide which team went first, elected to do the Speed Snack Eating Contest. The team of Emand and Munfred elected to do the Mint Ice Cream Eating Contest. The three were set up at a long table made Out of scrap metal on the launch pad. They were each provided with one basketof 100 MkI Snacks. The Mk I snack is a ball of fried dough covered in a special sauce made from distilled Kraken Tears. The contestants were to eat 100 MkI snacks, the one who completed the task first would win glory(and enough snacks to last a llifetime!). The contestants sat down and at the signal from Billy-BobDorf the refere for this particular event got started eating....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart III \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETom.Part III Never had anyone on kerbin seen the ferocity at which the three contestants battled for victory. The special sauce was thrown everywhere, the cook who made the snacks complained\u0022 it took me 6 months to get to Bop to get tears from the dying kraken to make that sauce!\u0022 To no avail. The contestants seemed evenly mached at first but as the competition dragged on Bob seemed lacking in his speed eating skills and dropped out after only finishing 37 MkI snacks. When asked how he felt Bob quipped \u0022I prefer the MkII snack with its delightful cheese sauce\u0022. Then bob got stuffed after 73 MkII snacks leaving Jeb to be the Winner. After finishing Jeb was quoted as saying \u0022Why did I win?

So was Gregsby and the Smoking SRB\u0027s. but the highlight of the second day of the festival was Jeb(who was still recovering from a belly ache from the eating contest) giving his lecture on the early days of the Space Program. The highlights were Kerbal I the first orbital rocket in the space program. It was crewed by Jeb himself to an orbit just safe enough to not dip into the atmosphere. Another highlight was M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn I(kerbals need better mission namers if you ask me) which was piloted by Jeb with Bob as his co-pilot with Bill acting as science officer.Jeb ended the lecture by recounting his part in the assembling of Space Station I( these kerbals weren\u0027t really imaginative, were they?)the first kerbal manned station in orbit around kerbin. After the lecture much snacks (of various Mk\u0027s I-V) were had by the guests and it was agreed that it was one of the best nights they would ever have. Or was it?....The Final Part of the first arc! The Mint Ice Cream Contest between Emand and Munfred went similarly to that of the disastrous 3\u0027s snack eating contest. The contestants were set up a the same table on the launchpad as the previous nights contest and sat down. They were to eat 25 pounds of Mint ice cream,the fastest to do so being the winner. At the signal from the referee Billy-Bob-Dorf the contestants started eating their ice cream with virulent ferocity. The two kerbals were going at a similar pace when Munfred started to have cramps and a bulging stomach from the sheer amount of cold deliciousness passing though his body. He swelled to a point then exploded outward sending a giant ball of mint ice cream hurling out of the KSC at orbital velocity. The object hardened in the extreme cold of deep space and slowed to a highly elliptical orbit around kerbin pasts its first moon, M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. This new moon was immidietly cristened Minmus and the space program was given a grant to send a manned mission to go land on it.The End.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second story arc, detailing the exploration of the new Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart VI\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh what a glorious day it was on the Minmus Mission lanch day, the wind was going just so and the sun was behind the clouds.The rocket was a gleaming pile of pancaked asparagus mainsails and BACC-10\u0027s held Toghether with struts and tape. The M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6tley Cr\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ABw of this mission was Jeb,Bill and Jebs cousin from the country Jedebediah.They boarded they\u0027re craft in the mid morning to the cheers of those assembled (the entire population of the planet kerbin). Their rocket thundered off the pad at a slow rate as Jeb was keeping the mainsails at a low throttle making the BACC-10\u0027s do most of the work. \u0022Kchush\u0022 the BACC-10\u0027s were separated with a thud and the mainsails were throttled up to 75% riding terminal velocity to first liquid sep. \u0022kchush\u0022 the first liquid boosters were separated as the rocket climbed skyward to 10 km and began its gravity turn to get orbit around kerbin. Another seperation followed leaving the core stage fulley fueled for the rest of the trip. \u0022 oh wow look at that view!\u0022 Quipped Jed, whose word were immediately transferred to stations around kerbin Through the ship antenna.
