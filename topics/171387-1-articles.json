And then, the landing site was plunged in the dark upon arrival so, Kerbals had to wait in orbit during almost 30 days until it goes back into daylight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe base has\u00A0more than 300 parts. The fps was terrible, I had to speed up the videos to around 3:1 - 4:1, so that a second lasts a real second. Next time, I\u0027ll assemble a more compact thing in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and haul it whole to target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless, the contract system gave me insane amounts of money to finance that. Extract ore, plant a flag, build a teeny-weeny base with a solar panel, 4 seats, an antenna and a docking port, take measurements here and there... It all summed to almost 4.5 million funds and\u00A0I\u0027ve only used a fraction of that...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow to the video!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTJjonKejx8?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy launches,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSnaky_le_Vrai\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
