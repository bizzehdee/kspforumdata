Some of those ideas include designs such as internal confinement plasma rockets, solid and gas core fission rockets, fission rockets which utilize water-ice as fuel, solar thermal rockets and various electric propulsion (Though this will take a back seat due to the Near Future Propulsion addon already available). I\u0027d also like to have you guys suggest things that are unique or innovative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that out of the way, I\u0027d like to go ahead and say one more thing: I am not going to be doing stockalike parts or cartoonish systems. I\u0027ve got an OCD complex which forces me to always model things that look realistic and have rational engineering ideas (iow, I avoid pipes and other details that don\u0027t look as if they\u0027d serve any real purpose). This means that my poly counts and maps will likely be somewhat larger than what you may be used to and as such, the pack will likely be released in segments as so that the end-user can pick and choose which systems he/she would like to utilize. I\u0027m open to discussion on that idea however. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread is simply for the discussion of ideas and a new thread will be created once we move past the discussion phase and into the construction stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit]: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to add some rocket body and fuel tanks to allow for some more realistic craft as well.

I wish that mod and its creators the best of luck - ultimately, Interstellar was the mod that made me want to do this! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoenix1583","CreatedById":84915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T04:32:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat would you folks recommend be the maximum polycount for these objects:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel Tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMisc.
