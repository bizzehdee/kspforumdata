Close up of Callisto\u0027s terrain when flying close by, the textures are not clear enough, with SSRSS the textures where fantastic. But as you said 1 pixel has to cover a larger area so its a stretch must be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Also Titan close up was horrid. very blurry terrain, could not make nothing out.
