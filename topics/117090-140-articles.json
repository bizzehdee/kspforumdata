The community was toxic, the API even less stable than KSPs (and not even part of the game, was a third party \u0027hack\u0027 (forge) tacked on), and the game updates were far more breaking for mods than KSP\u0027s.  To put it in perspective; nearly two years after leaving the MC forums, I still receive weekly hate-mail from MCForum users that are angry that I never added the siege engines back in to the 1.7.x versions.  Have gotten more than a few of them banned from the forums for their abusive posts/messages.
