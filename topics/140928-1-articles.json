To try to build smarter rockets and planes, I\u0027m trying again with FAR 0.15.6.3 installed. Rockets are fine, but\u00A0I\u0027m having trouble getting a basic plane\u00A0design that worked in 1.1.2 to behave with FAR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI figured I should learn how to fly planes that work well with FAR first. The Stock Aeris 3A so far is OK, but I need to learn to use flaps and air brakes so I can land, and none of the stock craft have those enabled by default. Rather than mess with the stock craft, is there a selection of planes with flaps and such made by others? I think that would help me learn to fly properly, using flaps and air brakes, then I can start building planes properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Edit: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/47818-basic-aircraft-design-explained-simply-with-pictures/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EFound this afterward\u003C/a\u003E.

Learning how to fly before you start building\u00A0is stupid imo. The main differences in flight from stock to FAR from a pilots perspective is the relative lack of drag, the need for airbrakes, and needing to be more careful at higher speeds. There is also the fact that stalling is actually a thing, but this just means that stupid things that did not work very well in stock wont work at all. Once you figure out how to read the Data\u002BStability derivatives screen, you have figured most of it out.
