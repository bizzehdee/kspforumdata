My Kerbin network is very strong I have full coverage within the Kerbin SOI but as soon as I leave it (as in between planets not moons those connections are fine) I lose connection. I have several relays that have plenty of range. Line of site, range and power are not issues. The problem must be how I am targeting the dishes.

You might want to see about either relaying around minmus (smaller, so orbits will be smaller) or using an intermediate antenna that has a wider cone until the ship is further out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jsantarosa","CreatedById":138799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T07:25:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou seem to be right and Thank you it is so simple and yet evaded me.
