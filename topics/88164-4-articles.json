In game code it may be implemented that way but (presuming they\u0027re smart in how they present in game), it will, in fact, be kerbals learning how to drive better, not the engine getting more horsepower. Is the effect between the engine increasing horsepower and the kerbal flying better effectively the same? Sure, which is why, if one is thinking about how to code it, you may very well do it from the parts end.
