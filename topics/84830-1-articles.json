It should be done top stage as 0 then work downwards. In the same way as you would say T minus 5 minutes. Not just say 5 minutes untill launch. I would imagine professionals start at 0, when your not and you look at the rocket, the first stage that fires, you naturally assume is the first stage. When building a rocket, the 1st stage is the smallest stage usually at the top, then u build the 2nd and join them together, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts basically a mix up.

The last thing to stay is always stage 0, regardless, of how many stages you dropped while getting to that state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine you have a 5-stage rocket, spend two stages getting it to orbit, then build another 5-stage rocket, get it to orbit as well, and dock with the first rocket making it into another 5-stage rocket.

Professional-grade rocket/missile trajectory simulators (at least the ones I\u0027ve worked with, to the best of my recollection) all use the same sort of stage numbering: start at 0 or 1 for the final payload, and increment stage number in reverse order of separation (so the highest-numbered stage is the first section to get dropped on the way up).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
