It standardizes certain resource definitions, so that when three different mods all get the idea to implement the same resource, they will all be automatically compatible with one another. Beyond that, CRP does nothing. It does not add any parts, it does not let you mine these resources. It\u0027s just a reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to use these resources, you need to install mods that do stuff with them. For example, Karborundum is implemented by the \u0022Karbonite Plus\u0022 mod, while Minerals, Substrate and Water are implemented by \u0022USI Colonization System\u0022. There might also be other mods that implement them too - that\u0027s the whole point of the CRP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T07:52:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can implement any resources you want into the game right now if you wanted.
