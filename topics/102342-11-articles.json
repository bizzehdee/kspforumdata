I do hope that most people realised that Squad would never do this sort of a thing, and that we support our community, and like I said in the private message I hope we can all look back at this, and realise that perhaps we can hit that donate button for our favorite mod or YouTube channel \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn light of the easy confusion I\u0027ve added a small print to the announcement post and removed it from the articles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe do plan to update the forums in the future, as we discussed in the devnotes a while ago.
