I think to start I\u0027ll quote a reply I wrote to someone who messaged me about this.\n\u003E After the first reactions came I realised that people actually thought it\u0027d be possible that a company in the games industry would in fact do something along these lines, and that\u0027s a sad realisation. However, I understand that when the April 1st reference isn\u0027t immediately clear then of course this announcement becomes a ridiculous proposition. I do hope that most people realised that Squad would never do this sort of a thing, and that we support our community, and like I said in the private message I hope we can all look back at this, and realise that perhaps we can hit that donate button for our favorite mod or YouTube channel ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E In light of the easy confusion I\u0027ve added a small print to the announcement post and removed it from the articles. \n\u003E \n\u003E P.S.\n\u003E \n\u003E We do plan to update the forums in the future, as we discussed in the devnotes a while ago. That\u0027s still very much a thing but of course we\u0027d be looking to improve the community, rather than to destroy it.\n\u003E \n\u003E P.P.S.\n\u003E \n\u003E vent all you wish ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nYes, thats true. While I expect it possible for a company to do that, do notice I will abandon ship at first opportunity and boycott the company in question to the end of time.\n\nEA is currently under this, and the *entire genre of early access.*\n\nPretty much the most likely to do this... I believe KSP is the only EA title I ever bought. Not a decision I regret in any way... luckily.\n\n...but still. If this had gone through coupled with Curse, a rushed 1.0 and a halt in development for KSP, a release of a new game would still be enough to make me hate Squad for all eternity. I will not stop hoping all will go well though.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E AAAaaaaaaha! Now I get it!!! SQUAD\u0027s \u0022*we\u0027re uncomfortable with being in EA, so we\u0027re releasing 1.0 ASAP with heaps of new features without proper beta, grindy science and career and nothing to do on planets*\u0022 is obviously also an April fools joke that they thought of late last year.
