Pressing E will use wind resistance to increase the craft\u0027s rotational momentum, and will also make the craft fall faster. Pressing Q will slow the craft by using up the stored kinetic energy. Essentially E makes you fall faster, and when you near the ground, Q will slow you down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CM4YEIR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CM4YEIR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zFR9Qui.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zFR9Qui.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E15 Gs!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W61qKpS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022W61qKpS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YkygND3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YkygND3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It weighs so little, that with 4 seperatrons, you can de-orbit it from about 120,000 M. Once re-entry is complete, if holding E, the craft will hit terminal velocity at about 500 m/s. When you slow down from that speed, the craft will pull 15 Gs until it is around a nice 10 m/s (on Kerbin) and then will hit the ground with no problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My plan with this one was that it\u0027d be the most lightweight way to get someone from space to the ground. Obviously it only really works on Kerbin, Duna and a few others, but why would you want to conquer a planet with no air anyways? Also, it should be noted that it is a son of a Jeb to get up out of an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If anybody really wants this thing, i could put up a link, but its pretty easy to design yourself\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SofusRud","CreatedById":59276,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T06:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe Danny2462 did something like this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/srggpVC7qgE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecool design though\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ledogen","CreatedById":78740,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T06:21:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh, so someone beat me to it.
