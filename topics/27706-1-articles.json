After some calculations based on my ship, I found out that getting there is no problem. STAYING there (i.e. getting into orbit) requires some tricks. Either aerobraking, gravitational breaking or both. AND even if this works, the delta-V to get back could be not enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo: Is it possible to send a tanker along with the actual vessel, rendevous (and dock) in transit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine that it would be quite easy, IF I could send them at the same moment. Which I can\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHm... maybe I can try to tackle it like there was no gravity. Orbits of that size (i.e. transfer orbits) look pretty straight, if looked at on a closer scale. AND I have quite a long time to get it to work. Haven\u0027t checked, but the transfer to Jool should be well over a year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas and/or tips on this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t try that right now myself.
