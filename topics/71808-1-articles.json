Realistically though you\u0027re probably going to want to reduce the humans down to a compact, lightweight form that can be stored for long periods. Even travelling at superluminal speeds the travel time is likely to be very long, possibly longer than a human lifespan. Candidates for that include things like frozen embryos and digitised brain scans. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother point to consider is that unmodified Earth humans are unlikely to be compatible with the environment of an exoplanet. Unless you fancy living in a bubble for all eternity you\u0027re likely to have to make modifications for things like gravity, atmospheric gas mix and the specific microbes and pathogens of your destination. Permanent settlement implies a genetically customised population (in the same way our current genome is customised for Earth). To pull this off would require considerable study of the destination, so there would likely be a fair amount of infrastructure already available at the other end.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FREEFALL1984","CreatedById":104993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T09:00:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efirstly the number of humans would depend on the nature of the mission, if the mission was to set up a small colony and terraform the planet, then perhaps only a few hundred would be sent in some kind of stasis. However if the mission was to populate and colonize an already habitable planet then there would likely be a few thousand, as well as donor DNA to ensure genetic diversity. The mission would require a crew capable of being woken from stasis at the first sign of a problem and be fully up to speed with the ships systems although the bulk of operations would be automated, at the same time the colony or cargo could be kept in stasis for the bulk of the voyage. The crew would be able to live in an artificial gravity environment provided be a huge centrifuge. The types of people selected would be naturally physically fit, highly intelligent people from excellent genetic stock, they would all be extensively screened for recessive congenital genes to ensure no genetic imperfections or diseases reached the target planet. The stock of colonists would be split about 60% females and 40% males to encourage reproduction and genetic diversity. The voyage could operate at about 10% light speed and reach the nearest systems in about 60 - 80 years. Although the first and manned phase of the mission where the crew remain active would last about 2 or 3 years as the vessel uses numerous gravity assists to build up the speed to leave our system likely making several passes around Jupiters moons and the inner planets. It would likely use some form of high efficiency microwave resonance chambers to provide a small amount of thrust in interstellar space. While for the departure it would use a series of conventionally fueled booster stages to gain speed while a simple RCS system would ensure the vessel meets its transfer keyholes. When arriving at the target system the vessel would use the gravity of other orbiting bodies to reduce its speed to achieve an orbit around the planets sun, it would then transfer to the target planet at the next viable window using the microwave resonance engines to provide just enough thrust. on arriving at the planet it would initially use the microwave resonance engines to slow its decent and use the planets moons to provide additional braking allowing it to brush across the target planets atmosphere and perform a gentle aerobrake into a circular orbit. Now there would be extensive surveying while the colonists are woken, and a network of communications satellites would be deployed to provide a communications grid and allow 2 way communication with earth (although there would be an 12-16 year delay so internet browsing would be limited to microsoft internet explorer) An alternative would be to develop a communication system based on quantum entanglement which in theory would allow instant communications with earth although this is entirely theoretical since quantum entanglement cannot be maintained for extended periods (yet)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the colonists start making there way down to the surface in drop ships, each of which is capable of permanently housing several hundred colonists, These would all land withing a few hundred meters of each other on a site best determined from orbit. The main mothership, which would now be little more than an oversized laticework of space junk and communications relays would extend vast solar panels and a microwave beam to send power to each of the colony ships while retreating to a geostationary orbit. This should be able to provide power throughout the nights. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach of the colonists would be trained in basic survival in hostile environments as well as the maintenance of the drop ships themselves, They would be trained in farming, resource gathering and the many other skills to survive on the long term. The drop ships would each be packed with large quantity of GM seeds, designed to survive in the planets soil, as well as a diverse selection of livestock DNA which could be synthesized in an artificial womb, The DNA itself could also be modified to ensure the livestock can best survive its new environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis of course is assuming that the target planet is perfectly habitable, and is an almost perfect analogue with earth (ie abundant fresh water, breathable air, oceans, tides, and wind and precipitation)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-09T09:10:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2014 09:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FREEFALL1984\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T09:34:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Duckytrask\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Duckytrask\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EImagine that one day the Human race pooled together all of our resources and we had a reason to build a ship that could take enough humans to a habitable planet. \u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m asking is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow many humans would make the trip (From departure from Earth)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho goes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould the passengers be in cryogenic sleep, or active as in awake and need life support?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe destination?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming the passengers were awake, would there be gravity and how?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would food be supplied, water, power, oxygen?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPropulsion?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESub light or faster?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to and another concerns you would like to add.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt kind of depends on how far this habitable planet is. In your title you state interplanetary, so within the same solar system. That\u0027s a stone trow away in cosmic terms, a trip from earth to Mars takes about 7 months with a simple Hohmann transfer. So you wouldn\u0027t have to muck about with cryogenics or anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets say we desperately want to establish a human colony on Mars for whatever reason. Mars is convenient for a colony since it doesn\u0027t have to be self sufficient. It is close enough that we can regularly ship goods from earth to Mars until they get their own production lines into gear. This means the colony could start out small and slowly build over time. Therefore your life support can be bare bones and you can work with a skeleton crew. You wouldn\u0027t need anyone specialized into construction or catering in such a setting, you can just send over scientists and geologists to gather scientific data. You also don\u0027t need to worry about artificial gravity along the trip, or making the life support completely closed loop. So colonists would likely live like people in the ISS during the trip. With lots of daily exercise and with a relatively normal day-night rhythm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ISS would be a good example of how such a base would look. A 6 man crew mostly focused on science. As the base grows larger with added modules you can ship over specialists for those modules as needed. The first 2 things you need to make such a base self sufficient would be agriculture and a production line. This means your first modules will likely be inflatable greenhouses to lessen the amount of food resupplies you need. You also need some kind of mobile scoop to gather metal ores to serve as the basis of your production line. This also marks the point where you are going to need a nuclear reactor as a power core. Melting ores in an arc furnace is too expensive in energy to rely on solar or radiothermal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo at this point you have a base with about a dozen inhabitants that is half self sufficient in terms of life support and capable of building structural systems. From here on out things can go much faster. Since your base can make its own structural bits you don\u0027t have to worry about room and the framework for your tech. So you can send much more tech and crew per supply run. This means you can quickly snowball the production capability and carrying capacity of your base. Now you need to start worrying about genetic diversity. You\u0027re going to need about 4000 individuals to have enough diversity to allow for a sustainable population. Since it is very expensive to ship that many people to Mars I suspect they\u0027d just send frozen embryos instead. At this point the colony would be truly self sufficient. If the earth suddenly got destroyed humanity would live on. A long term goal could be to terraform Mars, but that\u0027s optional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a interstellar colony things get a lot harder. You need to do all of the above steps, but without any contact or supplies with Earth. This is a very hard challenge that will probably require universal constructors to reliably pull it off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-09T09:38:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2014 09:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ralathon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T09:53:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei prefer to aim to for a massive ice dwarf sized generation ship built out of an actual ice dwarf. the reasons are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealmost the whole thing can be used as propellant (thinking nerva or mpd)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esome of it can be used to fuel fusion* reactors to power life support/engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany remaining materials can be used to build and maintain infrastructure or simply thrown overboard\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eits easy to build tunnel complexes which protect passengers from radiation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplenty of room inside and on the surface for habitation and food production\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* fission can be used but it is unlikely an ice dwarf would have very much fissile material on board, so this needs to be pre-stocked prior to the voyage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T11:18:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMars Colonial Transporter, being worked on by SpaceX.
