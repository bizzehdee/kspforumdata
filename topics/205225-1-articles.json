I know Rocketlab uses electric motors to spin their pumps, so I was wondering if there might be utility in an electric starter motor for turbopumps, like a car\u0027s internal combusion engine starter. Perhaps it would be useful for situations where you have a turbopump-fed engine and want an arbitrarily high amount of restarts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meecrob","CreatedById":104543,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-11T18:47:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis excerpt is from blog.nasa.gov on the RS-25:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022The most complex part of the engine is its four turbopumps which are responsible for accelerating fuel and oxidizer to those insanely high flow rates.

Perhaps their tap-off cycle makes this easier. This starter motor thing would likely only be practical for small engines though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meecrob","CreatedById":104543,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-11T21:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrue, but car starters only spin the engine up to a fraction of operating RPM to start as well (those old timey videos of people hand cranking their cars would be a lot more interesting if they had to get to 1000 RPM!!). I just wanted to illustrate there is an order of magnitude difference in operating regimes of the engines.\u00A0 And its a pretty cool article. Having said that, I\u0027m thinking the main obstacle here is the fact that (as you say) this would only be practical on smaller engines, and thus they currently cannot lift enough fuel to utilize practically unlimited restarts. Let\u0027s keep our eyes out when they get orbital refueling down, because that will eliminate this constraint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-12T10:52:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224042111\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205225\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221633976707\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145622\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EnderKid2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, EnderKid2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps it would be useful for situations where you have a turbopump-fed engine and want an arbitrarily high amount of restarts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe intersection between large restart counts and engines powerful enough to merit turbopumps is pretty small.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Agena upper stage, developed by Lockheed, had an auxiliary or integrated secondary propulsion system for roll control during the firing of the main Agena engine and also for some attitude control during the subsequent coast period. Initially this secondary sytem had small thrusters, its own small high-pressure propellant tanks with positive expulsion features, and a pressurized inert gas tank of its own. Later the propellants were obtained directly from the main engine\u0027s propellant tanks, which were at a much lower tank pressure and were pumped by a small set of \u003Cstrong\u003Egear pumps\u003C/strong\u003E driven by an electric motor through magnetic (nonleak) couplings. This eliminated the separate heavy pressurized tank system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
