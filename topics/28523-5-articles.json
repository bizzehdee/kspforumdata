Unfortunately you\u0027ve gone far over my head with that, as I do not code C/C\u002B\u002B/C#/ObjC at *all*. I have the barest notion of what you\u0027re getting at, but see, the thing is, most of the gripes have nothing to do with how well or badly the mods are coded, and everything to do with player expectations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe player doesn\u0027t care about how well or badly something is coded (heck, look at Minecraft\u0027s popularity for the real litmus test), only that it does work. My point was that KSP plays VERY well and has a very polished feel for an alpha, and that tends to skew the mindset of the players who have little care for the code behind it all. Unfortunately because of that very polished feel, they also come to expect that things that have been working fine for quite some time will continue to do so across updates, regardless of where the functionality came from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo their minds, there\u0027s no difference between the mod or the game; it\u0027s all the same thing, and the thing that changed (the game update that broke the mods) is the thing to blame for disrupting their play. They don\u0027t get that mods aren\u0027t officially vetted by the game devs, and that there\u0027s no internal review process to guarantee they\u0027ll work as advertised. The see something they like, and if it works before the update, it should just work after as well, no excuses. Sadly that simplistic view is far too common, and For those particular aspects, I thank Apple and what it has become most venomously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I have a lot of public interaction in the field of technology, I understand their interpretations of how things work, which is why I\u0027ve been putting so much effort into trying to help others through education and walking through the process of finding a culprit where I can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shiva","CreatedById":42474,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T07:04:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWorks fine for me, no bugs, just saying.
