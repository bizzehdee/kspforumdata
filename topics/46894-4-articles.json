I\u0027ve watched the video, so I know it\u0027s supposed to be in structures, but the only parts I have are some new struts and the big adapters. There is no faring base, nose cone, or sidewalls that I can find, and I also find no new engines of any kind. I also cant find the \u0022ships\u0022 folder the installation directions refer to at all.

I can understand your desire not to create engines that are overpowered but as it is, they are incredibly weak when compared to the 2.5m stock parts and that means your payload fraction collapses when using your 3.75m parts. One of the main reasons that I like this pack is because it allows the boosting of larger creations into orbit but that advantage is massively dimished if I have to use a rocket with a stupid number of stages because the payload fraction is terrible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of describing the problem qualitatively though, let me put some numbers to the issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA stock LV-T45 has 200KN of thrust and a mass of 1.5 - TWR = 13.6, Vacuum Isp = 370s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA stock Mainsail has 1500KN of thrust and mass of 6 - TWR = 25.5, Vacuum Isp = 330s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR has gone up and Isp has gone down, that\u0027s all good. Using 4 LV-T45s is a very very different experience to using 1 Mainsail as everyone who has played KSP will know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow look at the Mainsail and the Griffon XX:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA stock Mainsail has 1500KN of thrust and mass of 6 - TWR = 25.5, Vacuum Isp = 330s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Griffon XX has 3800KN of thrust and mass of 20 - TWR = 19.36, Vacuum Isp = 310s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time, despite having a bigger part, both TWR \u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E Isp have gone down. This is a problem because now, you aren\u0027t offering any unique capability for using your parts, you\u0027re better off in every way to use two Mainsails and that\u0027s a real shame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we look at the Titan too:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Titan has 2700KN of thrust and mass of 14 - TWR = 19.65, Vacuum Isp = 315s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis still has both a worse TWR and Isp than the Mainsail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf both of these engines were better than the Mainsail in terms of efficiency (Isp) that wouldn\u0027t be a problem but they aren\u0027t, you are simply objectively better off by having two mainsails instead of one of these 3.57m KW Rocketry engines. KSP is already hampered by excessive part count so it isn\u0027t good that people are being encouraged to add unneccessary parts to their ships to get a better performing rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight I suggest that a a good method of balancing would be in terms of Thrust Power/weight ratio. The Mainsail actually has a much better Thrust Power/Weight ratio than the LV-45 but let\u0027s say that you don\u0027t want to risk making an overpowered part, so you kept the same ratio for the 3.75m parts. Mainsail thrust power/weight ratio = 404,662.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would mean for the Griffon XX thrust power = 8,093,250 (=404,662.5*20) and Titan 1 thrust power = 5,665,275 (=404,662.5*14). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanted to keep the existing Isp values, that would give the Griffon XX Thrust = 2*8093250/310/9.81 = \u003Cstrong\u003E5322KN\u003C/strong\u003E @ 310s Isp and Titan 1 Thrust = 2*5665275/315/9.81 = \u003Cstrong\u003E3667KN\u003C/strong\u003E @ 315s Isp.
