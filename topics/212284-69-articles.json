They do but, either I forgot how to fly them. Or the fuel bug witch is still present is worse. I build marginal stuff, with the bugs they are just on the wrong side of the margin. I think that was my final mission for ksp2. I can not deal with the impersicsion of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E calculations. There\u0027s not enough parts, the collisions still are unpredictable. I don\u0027t know what I was expecting, but playable final product was the hope.
