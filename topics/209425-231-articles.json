You complain about VR-Latency, but why should faster Ethernet help with that? 1gbit Ethernet is allready fast enough for everything with gaming, similary as far as i know the video signal to VR setups comes from the GPU, so faster USB on your mainboard isnt solving any bandwidth-problem since there is none. The i7 8086k is quite fast, while the 5800X is even better i doubt you will notice much of an improvement in almost all games, as they are usualy limited by GPU-Speed.

The i7 8086k is quite fast, while the 5800X is even better i doubt you will notice much of an improvement in almost all games, as they are usualy limited by GPU-Speed.
