Especially with SP\u002B style stuff, you \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E to extend the ladders in order to make sure that they\u0027re angled right. And I\u0027m routinely finding that I can\u0027t get them extended again when it comes time to take the showroom screenshots in front of the Kerbodyne banner. Right nuisance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a visual cue on the ladders, but it\u0027s very subtle; there\u0027s a tiny little sticky-out bit that faces down. You have to zoom in to see it, though. And that still doesn\u0027t help with tilt on the other axis; Kerbals don\u0027t like climbing backwards-leaning ladders. Or, more accurately, they climb them just fine; what they can\u0027t do is get off at the top without falling back down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
