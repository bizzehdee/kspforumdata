I am porting my engine stats that vary from Frizzank\u0027s original CFGs. Please note, NONE of the below settings work without copying Frizzank\u0027s CFGs.

Later the plans for the E-1 were enlarged and updated and became the Apollo F-1 engine.

It is slightly OP (less mass than a similar thrust LR-87) but it is close to proposed specs. I also re-scaled the S-II engine plate to 3.75m for use on the Saturn I 1st stage...

I can\u0027t tell which because it happens too fast for me to really tell. The decouplers either had their directions changed (IE, pushing the interstage into the next stage rather than away), had the directions changed in another way (IE, pushing off to the left or right rather than down), or the decoupler force on the backend has been tweaked somewhere (or got messed up in the transition from .04 to .05) and its too strong now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think its an issue with the exploding decouplers that the silent update fixed, because with the interstages you typically can\u0027t start your engine until you have separation due to the engine stowage mechanic. And given how the interstages work, typically they shouldn\u0027t even be getting hit by heat until after they\u0027ve separated away anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T02:20:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlayed with it more, the interstages, as well as the LES and the CM Top are decoupling and being forced off to the side, regardless of how much force the decouple has.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T04:36:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are having the same issue with decouplers / fairings with 1.0.5 and Chaka... it\u0027s a mess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T18:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually fairly certain it was something that was done during the silent update.

To fix not-working payload fairings, interstages or whatever parts which used non-convex colliders, you remove the mesh collider component from the model, add an empty gameobject and add a cube or another basic collider to it. With those basic colliders, you cover your object. I\u0027ve used 20 smaller colliders, cutted out from my original mesh, and arranged them correctly to cover my fairing. It is a bit annoying, but it works, and in 1.1 we would have to change this anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
