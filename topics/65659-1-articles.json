They are badly balanced towards each other and there isn\u0027t much reason to use one over the other. Let\u0027s take the smallest antenna, the Communotron 16. It is light and requires the least amount of power to transmit scientific data. It\u0027s low mass allows it to be placed asymmetrically and its power requirements won\u0027t drain your batteries too heavily. It\u0027s only downside is that it\u0027s slower in transmitting. Then there\u0027s the Communotron 88-88. It unfolds into a large dish, is five times as heavy as the 16 and requires twice as much power when broadcasting. Luckily - I say sarcastically - it\u0027s somewhat more than twice as fast. The third part, the DTS-M1, is not much better. It takes up more space than the other two, is slightly heavier than the 88-88 and is in between the 16 and 88-88 in terms of transmission speed and power cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs should be apparent, there\u0027s little reason not to only use the Communotron 16. It\u0027s the lightest, the least power-hungry and only takes up a small space on your craft. It\u0027s only drawback? It\u0027s marginally slower than the other two. To show how insignificant that is I made a table. The largest experiment in terms of transmission size is the Atmosphere Analysis (the old avionics nosecone part). It is 200 so-called Mits large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[table=width: 500, class: grid]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]\u003Cstrong\u003EPart\u003C/strong\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]\u003Cstrong\u003ETransmission Time\u003C/strong\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]\u003Cstrong\u003EElectricalCharge Consumption\u003C/strong\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]Communotron 16[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]40 seconds[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]5000[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]Communotron 88-88[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]18 seconds[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]22222[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]Comms DTS-M1[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]30 seconds[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]10000[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/table]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see the amount of time is pitiful compared to the increased power cost. It gets even worse when you consider that the Atmosphere Analysis is an outlier with its 200 Mit size. The average of all the other experiments is about 20 Mits. The difference between the antennas then barely becomes noticeable (just divide the results of the table above by ten).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simple solution to this would be to make the antennas that are heavier, be more power efficient. Not draining your batteries is a big advantage and much more important than speed (which in almost every situation will be irrelevant). I would also argue to make the DTS-M1 lighter than the 88-88. It\u0027s smaller when unfolded and in the other stats is also in between the 88-88 and the 16.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above solution solves the problem of the first unlocked part (in career) being the better option. But what to do once you\u0027ve unlocked all the antenna parts? Then the 16 and DTS-M1 are generally less useful than the 88-88. This can be solved by introducing range. The mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56440-0-23-AntennaRange-Enforce-and-Encourage-Antenna-Diversity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAntennaRange\u003C/a\u003E does a great job of showing how wonderful such a thing can be. All the antennas have a range. The 16 can transmit data back to Kerbin from a Keosynchronous orbit. If you want to transmit something from the Mun or Minmus, you\u0027ll need a DTS-M1. Want to go even further, then you\u0027ll have to use the 88-88. Additionally, antennas can act as simple relays. Nothing complicated, like RemoteTech, but a simple \u0027if there is chain of antennas in each other\u0027s range that can connect to Kerbin, then I can send my scientific data\u0027. This allows fun situations in which you can have a light-weight Communotron 16 on your rover on the surface of Duna connect with the heavier 88-88 on an orbiting probe. This is similar to how for example Curiosity communicates to Earth using the 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter as a relay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruedii","CreatedById":57704,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T14:01:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to adjust the time by adjusting the packet size.

Perhaps only 10% of the power at longer ranges. The antennas should not have a maximum range. After all, we have used an omni antenna to control the Galileo spacecraft to Jupiter. It was just a much reduced speed and much higher power. (Galileo was the one where the dish got stuck during launch and could not deploy.
