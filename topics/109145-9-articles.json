M2X Version 1.4.5 for KSP 1.03, on the other hand, I can replicate your error, and after two hours of experimentation, I\u0027m no closer to discovering why. The only thing I\u0027ve managed to discover so far is that in 1.03, KSP apparently really dislikes the Module Sciencelab being on or added to any part other than the stock science lab. I\u0027ll keep poking at it, but I don\u0027t know how long it\u0027ll take to solve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DiamondHawk427","CreatedById":134015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T03:24:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EY dis mod not work\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T04:31:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EY dis mod not work \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould be any number of reasons.
