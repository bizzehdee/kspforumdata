It depends entirely on what impact the disease would have on quality of life. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I went for genetic advice before trying for a second child after my first was born blind it wasn\u0027t to decide whether to have the child or not, it was to be prepared if it was likely to happen again. If it turned out it was likely we still would have had the child, raised it well and made sure they were loved and turned into a valuable member of society. I wouldn\u0027t class blindness as being a severe enough disability to not have the child. I would feel differently if it was a condition which resulted in significant pain, suffering or a shortened lifespan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes all disease are different and some are certainly not so problematic to live with but being disabled is \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Enot fun, nor a community\u003C/span\u003E LOL and ignoring that for any reason is really bad no argue possible about that for me, and I\u0027m not sure i can see in any way how taking the risk to get a disabled child (wich means you consciously impairs him in a way or at least do not care) might be percieved as the best for my child. And for what? why is it better than adoption? Because you have your own genes in another human being? Wow great, thats ridiculous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it doesn\u0027t mean that a disabled person cannot have a good life or be smart or useful or whatever.
