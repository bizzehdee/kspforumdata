But I\u0027m still not interested in really overpowered parts and since I\u0027ve not got hours upon hours to research and go through trial and error, can I ask for some suggestions? What mods look fantastic and are filled with extremely fair and balanced extra parts in your estimation?

If you want a hodge-podge of stockalike stuff, look up SXT (by Lack, who does LLL). This pack includes 3,75m stockalike fuel tanks and an adapter. For a few extra goodies bound for stock very soon, grab KSPX. It adds some radial cylindical and spherical fuel tanks, a smaller 2.5m RCS tank, an escape tower, and a 2.5m reaction wheel (no SAS) and some other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re big into ion engines and cool future-ish stuff, go get Near Future Propulsion, which adds all kinds of engines, reactors, and solar panels, as well as huge batteries and capacitors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry is great if you find yourself wanting heavy lift capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think one way to cure stock boredom without adding parts is some visual enhancement mods.

WARNING: There is a good chance you may become highly dependent on some of these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot live without Enhanced Navball, EditorExtensions, SelectRoot, and TweakableEverything, among some other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mainly use a bunch of plugin only mods many small part mods, which add a handful of convenience items like the 6S service compartments, and a few parts packs.

If you\u0027re looking to make things a bit more challenging, mods like Ferram Aerospace Research and Deadly Re-entry will almost force you to re-learn how to fly in a more realistic atmosphere.
