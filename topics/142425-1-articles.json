It then did not show the orbit kerbin contract. I Googled it and all i saw was that it happens when your reputation is low, but i never failed any missions and i did all of them perfectly, i also tried doing some side contracts but it did not do anything. I started a new game and it gave me the orbit contract, but then it did not give me the mun contracts, so again i tried doing some more contracts and it did nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-24T21:10:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea how to \u0022make\u0022 contracts appear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll get the mun contract ,and not the minmus contract, and the game\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0give me a mission to duna, but I have \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E seen a mission offered to another body that i haven\u0027t already previously went to out of pocket, even after years of playing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy best guess is that contracts are sentient and completely do what they want. great career realism if you ask me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodari","CreatedById":157578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-24T21:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbit Kerbin should show up right away when you first start a new career.\u00A0 However, it also expires after 4 days, so if you didn\u0027t accept it by then(or if you decline it), it\u0027ll go away.\u00A0 And like all of the world first contracts, once it\u0027s gone, it\u0027s gone and it won\u0027t come up again.\u00A0 Most of the other world first contracts will have certain conditions that have to be met before they can show up(minimum reputation, previous accomplishments, certain tech needed etc) but then once you do have it unlocked, it\u0027s still random when it will show up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AdamSweitzer","CreatedById":140769,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-26T02:53:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks Hodari, It makes sense.
