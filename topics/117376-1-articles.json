But if you are simply switching coils on and off, induction will probably do more damage to final speed than what you get from stronger field. So if you are using a very simple switching system, then you should probably just have a plastic tube for a barrel, and have wire coils wound around it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroEngy","CreatedById":92772,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T01:55:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.deltaveng.com/gauss-machine-gun/design/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis guys website\u003C/a\u003E.
