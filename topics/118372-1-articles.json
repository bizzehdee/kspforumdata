Once you know the initial velocity, the mass of the ship, the engine thrust and the body\u0027s gravitational pull, you can work out the maximum acceleration of your ship. The reason acceleration is important is because it tells you how many seconds you need to change your speed from x to y. Any TWR above 1 is capable of stopping the decent completely but only if you have time for it, else the ground will bleed off your remaining speed. So know your max acceleration and you can tell if there is time to come to a safe landing speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Admac","CreatedById":126280,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T16:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, Theorycrafing aside, take 1.5 \u002B local TWR for vacuum landers.
