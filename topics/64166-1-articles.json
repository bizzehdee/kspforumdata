Why not start up the first KSP virtual airline? The airline would consist of pilots who would land cargo and passengers at destinations throughout the Kerbal system, and along the way, receive promotions and, when multiplayer is implemented, receive science/money which would be reinvested into more planes/airports (Using the city mod). With higher rank, you would fly longer routes and later craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, a Second Officer would fly routes carrying cargo to the Island Airport near KSC while a Senior Captian would fly spaceplanes and supplies to a Duna base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe airline would work like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be a \u0022Roster\u0022 of jobs that would need to be completed that would be hosted on a thread. The \u0022roster\u0022 would be updated daily. A pilot would select a job from the roster and post on the thread their intention to do it. After their claim is received, their username is written beside the flight title. The pilot would then fly the job (And deliver any needed cargo) submit a few screenshots, then receive points which can be used for promotions/upgraded craft. The airline would also hire craft builders from the Spacecraft Exchange to design planes for use for the airline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch an airline ferry service could go into full swing once multiplayer is implemented, and deliver supplies and crew to bases while the player is away supervising a Eeloo mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe airline could also establish bases on other celestial bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, any feedback from the KSP community?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m interested\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE TO MODS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not Roleplay, for the following reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
