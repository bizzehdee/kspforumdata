They are just incredibly careless and disregard personal safety. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey get really excited to explore space that they forget to put on space suits before EVAing, hence the reminder that they need to put on a suit before opening a hatch.

But they can\u0027t really control the enthusiasm of other Kerbals going out into space. You know how Kerbonauts are; they get really, really excited and reckless when they go to space, they either grin like idiots or panic.

In fact: it wouldn\u0027t have. In fact, Squad\u0027s attempt to KEEP the game predictable was used as an argument against it, and really, formed the entire basis that the functionality broke physics in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the point is to create differences in Kerbals, that give you certain advantages, while also keeping the game predictable. That\u0027s why Level 3 Jeb can drive more efficiently than Level 2 Bill. But that opens up problems: namely that if Bill\u0027s inefficiency is actually expressed in game, he will literally not go where the player tells him to go. That can be both frustrating and introduces the problem of random error. To solve that problem, they allow the ship to go where the player wants to, but basically credits better pilots with an efficiency fuel bonus. That way, if you build a ship, and you know Bill will fly it instead of Jeb, you KNOW how much of a penalty you will get that you can knowingly and predictably build into the craft. Literally nothing has changed except the amount of dV (or whatever attribute got enhanced or deducted) needed. Your ability to land on the Mun isn\u0027t impacted. Your ability to burn accurately isn\u0027t impacted. Your ability to get a good intercept isn\u0027t impacted. Your ability to fly a ship with \u0022flawless execution\u0022 is, frankly, not impacted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with implementing it this way is what people who are against it point out: you end up having variations in fuel usage or dV usage, while the start point, path, and end point are identical, even if the enhancements are supposed to imply a more or less efficient burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we see the problem with the whole exercise: If you want kerbals to be different, and you want that expressed in their ability to fly, you essentially have two choices, neither of them supported by players (apparently): You either introduce random errors, which \u003Cstrong\u003Ewould\u003C/strong\u003E impact Cpt. Kipard\u0027s ability to personally execute his planning and execution, or you apply a buff, but which in practical expression in game creates a \u0022violating physics\u0022 problem. Now, I had no problem with essentially simulating a more efficient pilot, but clearly that\u0027s the minority view here. But I think it was a good faith effort to at least split the difference and come up with a compromise solution. Clearly not even that is even remotely acceptable to most here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me back to why I think Kerbal Expressions, as thus far envisioned, is likely going to have to be scrapped: there is just no way to implement it without either making similar compromises elsewhere, or making the \u0022gains\u0022 you get completely pointless. Color me completely unthrilled with the idea that a Kerbal can now go out and fix a solar panel as some sort of actual \u0022skill\u0022 that I\u0027m ever going to actually use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just to add, I\u0027m not sure Kerbals being stupid or reckless need be part of that discussion. It\u0027s simply that Jeb is a better pilot than Bill, and that is expressed by a fuel or ISP credit while not actually violating the player\u0027s control of the craft. As I said, it was a good idea. Clearly I (and Squad) is in the majority in believing that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve thought about some of the alternate ways kerbal experiences could work, and I think the most promising is the need to have more experienced kerbals in order to use technology that is further down the tech tree, with experienced either gained from missions, or by spending reputation to train kerbals. Maybe you always have to spend reputation to train kerbals, but it costs less for higher level Kerbals. I think such a system actually brings significant purpose to Kerbal XP levels while, at least on first blush, seemingly violating anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA close cousin to this is requiring higher level Kerbals to go on certain missions, but after thinking on it, this idea has a somewhat fatal flaw: such constrictions would have be done on the contract level. For example, the Explore Jool contract could require a Level 3 Kerbal or higher on board to be completed. But otherwise, the game can\u0027t stop you from sending a ship full of Level 1 kerbals to Jool if you want. So that idea ends up not being so great. Meanwhile, the parts-based idea can be enforced regardless of the situation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-23T13:00:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2014 01:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FleetAdmiralJ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ebecause I can\u0026#039;t not typo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trentendegreth","CreatedById":86953,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T12:55:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FleetAdmiralJ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FleetAdmiralJ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me back to why I think Kerbal Expressions, as thus far envisioned, is likely going to have to be scrapped: there is just no way to implement it without either making similar compromises elsewhere, or making the \u0022gains\u0022 you get completely pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis i my thought as well, if its just science gains thru transmission or whatever than in my opinion its a waste of time... use the admin building. though there have been some thought out solutions. not all of which i agree on but, as ive said before \u0022opinions are opinions\u0022 and mine falls in the minority this time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T13:00:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FleetAdmiralJ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FleetAdmiralJ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...So we see the problem with the whole exercise: If you want kerbals to be different, and you want that expressed in their ability to fly, you essentially have two choices, neither of them supported by players (apparently): You either introduce random errors, which \u003Cstrong\u003Ewould\u003C/strong\u003E impact Cpt.

I also don\u0027t think Squad believes their original idea was a mistake either. But they do recognize that including a feature that incites such widespread criticism \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E a mistake. Squad hasn\u0027t been afraid to include features that many in the community disliked before, but the discussion was often more split on those features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Trentendegreth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Trentendegreth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eand i agree on that over complication, however if an individual Kerbal can \u0022multi class\u0022 or multitask then that significantly reduces the crew needed, and its not unheard of in that respect, in the military we shared \u0022training\u0022 between MOs\u0027s so that infantry guy could pick up my radio and use it, and know what he was doing.\u003Cp\u003Eso for instance your engine specialist could also be an electrical engineer as well, giving individual kerbals a uniqness to them as well,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei also think that training them may not nessisarily have to be limited to Rep ether but funds as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that could be a way to deal with. Perhaps Up to Level 3, kerbals can only focus on a single class, but perhaps they can add additional specializations with classes 4 and 5, so you can reduce the number of required kerbals you need by including higher ranked Kerbals.
