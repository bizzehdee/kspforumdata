The idea of traveling faster than light itself. The idea has been prominent throughout science fiction for more than a century. He never knew this day would come in the first place. It was accompanied by the national anthem of the United Nations of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nLater, the voice of Joseph Steele, the leader of the UNK delivered a message to his own people on live television stating:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Citizens of Kerbin, today is a new day. The last decade our fellow scientists have been developing the so called \u0022Impossible Drive\u0022, which actually exploited several existing phenomena. It is no longer impossible to surpass light itself. Initially conceived by physicists Dr. Michael Alkubb and Dr. Harald Bright half a decade ago, it was met with skepticism from fellow colleagues saying it was a mere \u0022childish fantasy\u0022 and \u0022a dream which will never come true\u0022. They were wrong. It caught our attention, we were fascinated by the idea of a FTL drive especially during the height of the second space race between us and Duna to the nearest star of Proxima Kentauri, we were skeptical at first, but we decided to fund their project. Eventually the technology was invented 2 years ago. We began to build a FTL-capable spacecraft which we named \u0022Voyager\u0022, construction has been completed. Now only the crew is missing. 8 PM West Jebistan Time/WJT this Monday is when the crew will be launched towards the Tycho orbital shipyard, which is where the spacecraft is docked, aboard a Condor-class \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. So stay tuned. This is Joseph Steele, signing off.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe words \u0022Serve the UNK, Serve the common good\u0022 appeared on the screen afterwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s already a game over for Duna.\u0022 said James afterwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe Dunaeans have been constructing a massive Daedalus spacecraft for the last 3 years named \u0022Supremacy\u0022. James felt sympathetic to Dunaeans because their spacecraft took a lot of effort to build. Especially when your rival built a small FTL spacecraft in only a few weeks compared to your massive slower than light spacecraft which took 3 years to build and fuel it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n8 hours later, James began watching live feed of the launch. This launch will be one that makes history. The first time Kerbals travel faster the speed of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe countdown began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u002210,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0 and bon voyage!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter some time they eventually rendezvoused with the shipyard. The Condor then docked with the shipyard, the astronauts then were transferred to Voyager. Followed by several system checks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter final checks were made, the Voyager undocked with the shipyard. The ship then rapidly accelerated away from the shipyard. It was time to fire up the drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFor a split second a \u0022bubble\u0022 briefly appeared around the ship followed by the ship vanishing from view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nKerbin has won the second space race to Proxima Kentauri. No one expected them to considering Duna has the technological advantage over Kerbin. By the time the Voyager was launched, the Supremacy was in the middle of the months long acceleration burn. By the time the crew arrived at their destination, it has been colonized and Duna has long accepted defeat. How unfortunate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMeanwhile, weeks after it was launched, Voyager returned with it\u0027s precious data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nA new era of exploration has begun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt was time to exit the Kerbol system and cross the vast interstellar medium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJames would later join the UNK marine corps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
