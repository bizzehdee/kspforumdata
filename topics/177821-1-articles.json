In reality, reducing friction is not an option, let alone desired. If, as a vehicle engineer I have to rely on the behaviour of my tyres to specifically lose traction at a certain moment to keep my vehicle stable, then there is something seriously wrong in my design. So, recommending just this method, to slap a baby buggy\u0027s rubber wheel on an airplane instead of the regular landing gear so that it starts slipping when it exceeds a certain amount of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornering_force\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecornering force\u003C/a\u003E just to prevent it from performing the litho dance, does not sound sane, practical, or realistic, let alone self-evident or intuitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-21T13:01:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2018 01:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Andersenman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"natsirt721","CreatedById":117557,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-24T19:09:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy advice here is: don\u0027t land with the brakes on.\u00A0 Wait until your aft gear are solidly down, then active the brakes.\u00A0 If one wheel touches down first, with brakes that is going to apply a good amount of torque to the airframe before the other wheel touches down.\u00A0 Aircraft aren\u0027t nearly as stable in the yaw direction, especially at low speed, so it doesn\u0027t take much of a disturbance to induce a spin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: did not check the timestamps, hope this thread isn\u0027t too necrotic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-24T19:10:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/24/2018 07:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 24, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by natsirt721\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow","CreatedById":65767,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-26T12:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnwanted sliding all over the place has pretty much been a feature in KSP ever since Squad introduced the ability to adjust spring/damper/friction rates for wheels.\u00A0 I spend almost as much time trying to tweak the settings to get my craft to behave as I do in designing and building the craft in the first place.\u00A0 It\u0027s a pain in the proverbial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-26T17:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223475758\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177821\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221540556863\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002265767\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Scarecrow said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnwanted sliding all over the place has pretty much been a feature in KSP ever since Squad introduced the ability to adjust spring/damper/friction rates for wheels.\u00A0 I spend almost as much time trying to tweak the settings to get my craft to behave as I do in designing and building the craft in the first place.\u00A0 It\u0027s a pain in the proverbial.\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe adjustment sliders are not the cause. They were added as a workaround due to the wholly unacceptable default behaviour of wheels when the game\u0027s wheel system got \u0027upgraded\u0027.
