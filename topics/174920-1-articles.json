Even though I\u0027ve used computers regularly for most of 52 years on this rock, I\u0027ve never really cared or concerned myself with owning a \u0022gaming\u0022 machine. That said, I\u0027m not stupid. I know about RAM and processors and disk drives, but not much about graphics cards. So...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy work desktop is a fairly new Dell Optiplex 7050, Win 10 Pro 64bit, i7 3.6 GHz, 16 GB DDR4, AMD Radeon R7 450, and it plays KSP great. Like, smooth. Granted, I\u0027m early into replaying this game, so I haven\u0027t built any huge part count ships yet, but so far it\u0027s been sweet. Anyway, of those specs I listed on more work machine, which is doing the most to enhance the performance of KSP? As far as buying a new desktop for home, I am budgeting $750-1000. That will not get me my work machine, so what specs would you recommend I focus on in that price range?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yeah, I\u0027ll be playing some modded minecraft as well, but it seems like that game is a little more forgiving than KSP is. Just FYI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: It occurs to me this may not be the correct forum. If not, where?
