After falling off a prototype rocket and hitting his head on a toilet, he had a vision of the Fluks Kapacitor, a device that could apparently harness the Kraken\u0027s mysterious energy. It took him 30 years and, coincidentally, Jeb\u0027s teen-aged father Marty Jebediah McKerbal to realize his vision. Quite by accident, Marty was driving a little to fast on the freeway with the prototype K-Drive in the back on his way to drop it of at the Doc\u0027s workshop. Once he hit 88 mph, Marty suddenly found himself warping uncontrollably through the space-time continuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a three-part adventure, Marty finally made it back to his time without screwing up the universe too badly. And even though the original prototype K-Drive was destroyed in the process, Doc Brown built another one. After further experimentation yielded more craters and creepies (Bob Kerman apparently got a hold of a K-Drive, and let\u0027s just say his family tree forms a loop now) than operational craft, official use of the K-Drive was banned. However, some \u0022shady\u0022 parts manufacturing companies, in the interest of making a better name for themselves, occasionally sneak a K-Drive into their products for surreptitious testing. The occasional dinosaur fossil with a space-suited Kerbal inside it\u0027s stomach and Neadrakerbal cave drawings that say \u0022HELP! SEND SNACKS AND ROCKET PARTS!\u0022 are more than enough evidence to indicate that not all rocket disasters are from \u0026lt;s\u0026gt;leaky\u0026lt;/s\u0026gt; fuel lines and \u0026lt;s\u0026gt;cut rate\u0026lt;/s\u0026gt; parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo one is quite sure what will set off a K-Drive. It can be a hapless teenager going 88 mph in a car or a spacecraft zooming along at 800 m/s. The only thing known for sure is that, if the K-Drive doesn\u0027t instantly vaporize you to atoms then you\u0027re going to be in for one wild ride.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythic_fci","CreatedById":58577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T15:10:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmazing!
