Then the craft will load, except the game will again, freeze for like a minute at a time, and only load a single frame. It\u0027s really frustrating!!!! I loaded the Aeris A-3, a completely stock, small craft, and the same thing happened. I installed\u00A0a few mods, launched a craft, it happened. Thinking that the mods must be causing it, I uninstalled the mods completely, and yet, it\u0027s still happening.
