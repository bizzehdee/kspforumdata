Been a while since I\u0027ve had a craft to post. I\u0027ve recently begun work on my FIRST EVER successful series of SSTO\u0027s. I\u0027ve tried something like this about a billion times, but I always shoot for very large cargo carrying SSTO\u0027s using not enough jet engines with not enough intakes and too many aerospikes for ascent, and they always failed to achieve full orbit. So I decided to start small, and try a different approach- a good thrust to weight ratio with jet engines and nuclear thrusters for final ascent and circularization. I broke down and started using air hogging (something I was never a huge fan of) and this was the result:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHoenir Mk1:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i758.photobucket.com/albums/xx226/chunkblaster/KSP%20-%20Hoenir%20Mk1%20SSTO/screenshot10_zpsbe53a790.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot10_zpsbe53a790.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i758.photobucket.com/albums/xx226/chunkblaster/KSP%20-%20Hoenir%20Mk1%20SSTO/screenshot17_zps2a20e01c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot17_zps2a20e01c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe First of the Hoenir Series, and my first successful SSTO!

It can scream into orbit at least 5 minutes faster than it\u0027s predecessor (haven\u0027t actually crunched the numbers yet). I had allot of fuel flow and nose heavy issues at first, so now it just flows in the linear front-to-back method. Works well enough, but if you come in for a landing from orbit and your really low on fuel, you may want to move some of it forward. Other than that, its a very stable aircraft with enough range to possibly make a 1 way trip to duna (not tested yet). It is allot more parts intensive than I had desired for (40 intakes doesn\u0027t help =\\ ), so the Hoenir Mk3 will be attempting to rectify that issue.
