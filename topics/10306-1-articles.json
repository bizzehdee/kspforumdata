I found one example but it didn\\\u0027t work past .13\n\nKnowing very little of unity and C#, I sought out some help from the community in IRC, and managed to bug Innsewerants into helping out. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSo, a massive amount of credit needs to be directed at Innsewerants, who set this up for me, and really helped me grasp some best practices. \n\nI\\\u0027ve updated the plugin to include an on/off switch so annoying is no longer a factor. I also adjusted some of the landing values. Now, it won\\\u0027t trigger an audible alert unless death is imminent, and immediate action is required. \n\nCurrently includes three audible warning triggers; \n\n[list type=decimal]\n\n[li]Vessel altitude is \u003C 200 meters **plays** *\u0027Warning Tone\u0027* [/li]\n\n[li]Vessel vertical speed exceeds -2 m/s and altitude is \u003C 150m plays *\u0027Whoop Whoop Pull Up\u0027*[/li]\n\n[li] Vessel alt \u003C120 and vspeed is not 0, plays landing tones [/li]\n\nA fourth sound for distress signalling has been added, but currently does not work correctly. \n\nScreenshots\n\n\u003E ![U2qyo.png](http://i.imgur.com/U2qyo.png)\n\nVideo\n\n\u003E \n\u003E v.01\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsexknbfwJU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E v.012\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/inTHquZbyg4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nAlso added system messages;\n\nALL SYS NOMINAL - no detection / triggers\n\nTERRAIN - prints when height about ground level triggers audible alert\n\nPULL UP - prints when alert is triggered\n\nORBIT OPS - Alt \u003E 70k (I know, not very practical but an alert nonetheless) \n\nDISTRESS - triggered when the distress button is pressed, using this for a later idea (not working completely)\n\nUsage:\n\nFor lack of blender skills, the part model is a copy of the Linear RCS module.
