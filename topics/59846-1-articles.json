The most biggest change was how I built my rockets and landers. After I learned about delta V and the wiki telling u how much you need to do this and get there. I found myself trying to build rockets specifically able to go to one place or the other. Like I need 850 DV to go to moon, so I would plan around having double that to get there and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not how I used to play before I knew all this stuff, I used to just build rockets and then fly them out into space and go exploring. I never used to care if I had too much fuel left over after going to a place thinking, I didn\u0027t really need that fuel canister. Also things with science in that, once I learned how to collect science in a efficient manner as some call it on the forums, I started building rockets around that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why I am asking, trying to find the fun again, rather than have it feel like I\u0027m doing a maths puzzle.
