That temperature gage being developed looks like a great edition, on that note I just wanted to reaffirm does this mod work properly with 1.0.2 and is it still being updated?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso ever since I started using this mod I\u0027ve wanted to see these gauges in IVA mode (I\u0027d imagine like many other users have), now I\u0027m aware of the difficulty involved in changing IVA cockpits and I\u0027m not suggesting this (unless it has already been done that is). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever as a user of RasterProp Monitor I\u0027ve always wondered if anyone had considered adding the ability of this mod to integrate with it, and allow a form of customisable clustering of these gauges on RasterProp\u0027s IVA cockpit monitors. That way the integration of IVA changes is handed off essentially to RasterProp, while improving overall functionality along the way an example being the Docking Port Alignment Indicator mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis seems to me to be an easier way to add IVA functionally without the compatibility work required to maintain custom IVA cockpit changes, but I\u0027m not yet a KSP modder (maybe one day if time/ideas allow) so I might be completely wrong about this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T02:37:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 02:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ziggsta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trueborn","CreatedById":65830,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T03:06:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=131b3d0db2b5645e!112815\u0026amp;authkey=!AEFxRk1P_iQ3X_o\u0026amp;ithint=file%2Czip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVersion 1.7.0d\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed the alignment error, ablation gauge now works, you can resize the gauge (currently at the cost of the rendezvous gauge, which I doubt anyone uses), and the HUD technology is now in the config file. It should be set to the first tech, so should be available at all times, but I might change it back for the release. Feedback?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZiggsta, I\u0027ve been asked about IVA several times, and besides not being a modeler, modding all the cockpits out there would be super painful. Using RPM is a possibility that I haven\u0027t really looked into. I\u0027m sure it would be possible to replicate the gauges in RPM, but I don\u0027t know how customizable they would be. I would also be worried that you would really only be able to fit one per page and still have them legible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziggsta","CreatedById":144620,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T03:29:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the response and again an awesome mod, Legibility with RPM I\u0027d imagine would come down to the games display resolution primarily. Customisation and the ability to cluster more then one per display in RPM would be nice if legibility at a typical 1080p HD\u002B resolution would allow it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain just an idea I know many times in IVA with RPM I think to myself how much I miss your gauges and how I have all these displays under utilised even one gauge per display would be a great edition, if your willing to investigate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeedback for your changes the I remember using your rendezvous gauge extensively when I was teaching myself how to do one the first time manually (without automation such as MechJeb), so I\u0027d miss it but many other mods provide this info its true. On the tech tree how deep it was it previously? I think I remember having to unlock it but my last use was months ago.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trueborn","CreatedById":65830,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T11:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt used to be available when \u0022Electronics\u0022 was researched.

Maybe to get real estate back you can replace the sliders with percentage textboxes or a set of increase/decrease buttons?

No changes with any of the current analog gauges, but if I had to, I would see fit they all stay the same size (therefore, just one size control for all those analog gauges, but a different size control for the HUD please).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
