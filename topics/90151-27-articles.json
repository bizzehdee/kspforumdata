Many of the dependent mods in RO specifically state that they do not support the windows 64-bit client. The issue with the 32-bit client is that it is limited to 3GBs of ram so having 16 available makes no difference. The linux 64-bit client however is stable and it functions fairly well. I am even able to use the 8k DDS RSS textures. I am currently using it and testing RP-0. The only big issue I have run into is that texture replacer disables the RP-0 contracts for some reason, but you don\u0027t need to install it so its all good.

Iv tried re-installing several times over the last few days with a clean install of ksp but the same issue keeps coming up. Everything else fits together though. (Only stock parts in this install). I cant seem to find anything on how to fix this issue. Have all parts been properly re-sized for 0.90?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlmightyR","CreatedById":73989,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T18:35:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hoaz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hoaz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehow am I using too much ram?

If your rockets are flipping over then you have to reevaluate your design and/or your ascent profile. As for the shaking... Nothing much you can do about that other then limit your control authority so that mechjeb won\u0027t shake too much. ( I disable the ascent guidance a third into the launch anyway ).
