In particular in trying out a ship where multiple girder segments are forced through a child part (effectively part clipping, although I don\u0027t have part clipping enabled). See image here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F6WZ6vd.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/F6WZ6vd.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that design i set up all the girders, attached the uppermost mk2 tank to the uppermost girder, and then connected subsequent tanks downward from the topmost tank so that they were forced to go through the girders. The top girder is connected, however the middle and lower girder segments aren\u0027t actually connected to the tanks. Again I know this is how the game is set up to work, but is there any way (mods, editing the craft file, etc.) to make multiple connections work like this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T23:24:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, the only way to do it would be with either struts or some docking-port shenanigans.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
