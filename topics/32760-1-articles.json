I can make a reasonably circular orbit. For the time being im also working in vanilla.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat im wondering is, i\u0027ve seen video\u0027s of people who have space stations in an almost exactly circular, 100 kilometer orbit, with less than .3 m/s in altitude change. Im wondering how this is done. As i come close to my circular orbit, my apoapsis and periapsis start to spin around my orbit, and any point in my orbit which i had already fixed at 100 kilometers deviates from it. Whenever i try to correct one part of my orbit back to 100 kilometers, another part of my orbit will deviate from it. I can manage to get my apoapsis and periapsis around the same altitude, but i never manage to put them at any even close to round number. How do i get these round-numbered orbits without having to put my kerbals in space for months/years? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main problem here is the not being able to control the altitudes of my final orbit, rather than being unable to perfectly circulising it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T10:47:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spyritdragon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spyritdragon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor the time being im also working in vanilla.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich I take it you mean no mods? There\u0027s your problem right there. I only use Engineer Redux that gives me flight info, in which case I can finetune my orbits with RCS, but it doesn\u0027t result in perfect orbits. Then again, a few meters off doesn\u0027t matter much. If you want perfectly round numbers I suspect MechJeb and its autopilot part are the way to go, that\u0027s probably how people do it. As you\u0027ve already found out, manually doing it in \u0027vanilla\u0027 is hard.

It doesn\u0027t make rendez-vous or docking any easier and the slightest nudge during docking, or a simple rotation will change your orbit. In real-life, NASA considers that an orbit that has less than 100km difference between Ap and Pe is circular.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiliconPyro","CreatedById":19734,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T12:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne trick that might make the process a little quicker for you is a mid-point adjustment. When you are equal distances from your AP and PE, a radial burn can adjust both at once. If you\u0027re heading toward your AP, point your craft toward the planet at -90 and burn or use RCS. Your AP will decrease and your PE will increase. I used to be pretty OCD about my orbits, but now if they\u0027re within .005km, I\u0027m good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spyritdragon","CreatedById":70515,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T12:06:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Norcalairman Wow, thanks, ill try that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.

Something with a bunch of fuel and RCS. Then pay close attention to where you are and where you\u0027re pointing and watch how your orbit changes. Try various types of burns at different points on your orbit, then try combining them. I promise you\u0027ll learn best that way and when you really need to know off the cuff how to get your orbit changed, you\u0027ll just point and burn instead of hopping over to the forums while your game is paused or using MechJeb.
