Speaking from the perspective of an experienced player who does a LOT of refueling, gravity-assists, and aerobraking; all to save fuel and Delta-V, I thought I\u0027d try and clear this topic up a little for new players. Sorry if it drags on a little- I first wrote this at roughly 2:30-2:50 AM, though I\u0027ve done my best to clean it up since...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETECHNICALLY, it costs more Delta-V to do a refueling stop, and then continue on your way to your destination, than just to make a straight transfer, all other things being equal- but there are several EXTREMELY important exceptions to this that can make it a lot more worthwhile:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(1) You can save a lot of fuel if the body you make your refueling stop around has an atmosphere.\u003C/strong\u003E This may not seem intuitive, but aero-\u0022braking\u0022 can actually be used to ACCELERATE your ship towards your destination. Let me explain this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Take the example of Duna, for instance. If you set up a fuel depot in low orbit around Duna, and send a spacecraft from low-altitude orbit around Kerbin to Duna via a low-energy transfer; Duna will be traveling a lot FASTER relative to the Sun than your spacecraft by the time it gets that far away from the Sun... Now, when you enter Duna\u0027s SOI, you will have a large velocity difference, and appear to be traveling very \u0022fast\u0022 relative to the planet- but from the point of reference of the Sun, it is actually DUNA that is traveling very fast relative to YOU. If you dip into the atmosphere around Duna, it will exert acceleration on your spacecraft to bring it closer to Duna\u0027s speed. In essence, you are performing an aero-boost, so to speak, relative to your final target Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Now, if you got your fuel into Duna orbit in the same way (low-energy transfer and aerocapture) you will have saved quite a bit of fuel, as it is approximately 900 less Delta-V to make an ideal transfer to Duna than to make an ideal transfer to Jool (this ISN\u0027T counting fuel-savings from a Munar gravity assist- which will save you close to the same amount of Delta-V on either trip if you perform it right). Now, it does cost approximately 1350 Delta-V to make a transfer from circular low Duna orbit to Jool- but you can make up quite a bit of that extra 450 Delta-V with a gravity-assist from Ike. Additionally, your approach speed at Jool will be lower when transferring from Duna instead of Kerbin (so it will take a lot loss fuel/aerobraking to capture) and you can make a MUCH more precise burn from Duna than from Kerbin (the burn-time will be shorter), which will more than make up the rest of that Delta-V in terms of reduced steering losses, reduced approach velocity, and less need for course corrections (especially if you are using NERVA engines...) Of course, this is where (2) comes in...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For BONUS fuel-savings, don\u0027t perform an aerocapture to Duna orbit- perform one to Ike. It\u0027s a bit tricky to pull off, but if you set you aerobrake such that your exit trajectory comes out with an apoapsis appropriately-oriented to Ike, you can perform an easy capture there, and save a lot more Delta-V than from capturing to Duna orbit- as it takes less Delta-V to make it from Ike orbit to Jool if you make appropriate use of the Oberth effect... (see below)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(2) Craft design and the Oberth Effect:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The first, and most important thing you need to know about efficient spacecraft design is, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe fuel-efficiency of your craft is *STRONGLY* connected to its fuel fraction.\u003C/strong\u003E That is, it\u0027s not efficient to push around a bunch of empty fuel tanks or excessive numbers of decouplers. \u003Cstrong\u003EOne of the main reasons off-world refueling is profitable is because it allows you to maximize the fuel-fraction of your spacecraft without a bunch of staging\u003C/strong\u003E (which is both expensive and heavy- a 2.5 meter inline decoupler weighs and costs a LOT more than a Clamp-O-Tron docking port. And radial decouplers tend to be even worse...) \u003Cstrong\u003ECreating a partway stop for refueling along your mission route enables you to consolidate the number of vessels moving along the route from a larger into a smaller number as fuel is consumed\u003C/strong\u003E- even if it\u0027s just a single fuel tanker and your interplanetary mission ship. \u003Cstrong\u003EDocking and fuel-consolidation has the same effect as staging: but is usually much lighter and cheaper.\u003C/strong\u003E (you can dock two 100-ton vessels with nothing but a Clamp-O-Tron Jr: try using THAT to connect two 100-ton fuel sections in your mission vehicle, and see what happens...) Setting up a fuel-depot is of course heavy and expensive, but that\u0027s more of a one-time investment that you make for convenience, and isn\u0027t strictly necessary- your fuel tanker(s) *can* wait on their own at the refueling stop, and hook up with your mission vehicle directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Second, getting an accurate transfer burn to Jool from low Kerbin orbit is hard. More likely than not, you will need to perform a long, slow burn around Kerbin; followed by a shorter adjustment burn somewhere in interstellar space (MechJeb can help you find the optimal location for these adjustment burns, to minimize Delta-V costs. You could theoretically determine this yourself, but the mathematical equations required are nothing to sneeze at, and it will take a LONG time to locate the optimal adjustment points if you utilize trial-and-error course-plotting instead...) The fact is, the shorter a burn you have to make to get somewhere from Kerbin, the more accurate it is likely to be- simply by virtue of gravity having less time to curve you off-course during your transfer-burn. Additionally, there is something important you need to know about called the \u0022Oberth Effect\u0022...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Oberth Effect is a mathematical phenomenon that is EXTREMELY important to orbital mechanics. Without going into too much detail about it, you should know the basic result of it: \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe faster you are going when you burn your engines, the more energy you get out of it.\u003C/strong\u003E What this basically means, in game-terms, is that \u003Cstrong\u003Eit takes a LOT less Delta-V to get somewhere from a departure-point where you are already moving fast than in does to get there when you start out moving slowly\u003C/strong\u003E. For this reason, you cannot simply find the difference between your current velocity and the velocity you need to be going at when you arrive at your destination to calculate Delta-V costs. The larger the Delta-V of a transfer burn from planetary orbit, the relatively less Delta-V it costs you compared to the final total kinetic and potential energy you will have at your final destination- as you will be moving quite quickly towards the end of your transfer burn. If you make a transfer burn from low above Kerbin, it costs you less Delta-V than if you first raise your orbit to the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, and then make the transfer from there. It is actually for this reason that an *ideal* straight transfer (with no steering-losses: though such burns are, in practice, *impossible*) to Jool from Kerbin *theoretically* costs you less than a burn to Duna and then from there to Jool, assuming you didn\u0027t make use of Duna\u0027s atmosphere to provide you with a portion of your velocity. \u003Cstrong\u003EHowever, the Oberth Effect leads to one other important point you need to know about in order to understand why refueling (at Duna or anywhere else) can actually make sense:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B \u003Cstrong\u003EDue to the way the Oberth effect works, the higher your acceleration is relative to the local gravity when you make a transfer burn, the less Delta-V it is going to cost you.\u003C/strong\u003E This is actually for a rather simple reason, really- \u003Cstrong\u003Eif your acceleration is much lower, your burn will be much longer, and you will make a greater portion of it in a more distant orbit from the celestial body you are departing. This means your average velocity during the burn will be lower\u003C/strong\u003E (the further you are from a body, the lower your orbital velocity). Put another way, you have already lost a portion of you velocity from the beginning of your burn to gravity by the time you are nearing the end of your burn. I don\u0027t know how to explain this better- the greater your TWR, the less Delta-V you will spend reaching your destination, even before you account for the greater steering-losses to compensate for gravity-turning due to longer-burn time that a lower TWR also inevitably entails...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B For obvious reasons (Duna\u0027s gravity is less than 1/3 Kerbin\u0027s), \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe same exact craft will have a much greater TWR around Duna than around Kerbin.\u003C/strong\u003E What this means is, you will come a LOT closer to the idealized transfer of 1350 Delta-V from low Duna orbit to Jool\u0027s SOI than you will to the idealized transfer of 1915 Delta-V from low Kerbin orbit to Jool (you will lose less of your velocity to gravity over a burn of the same length- and thus your average velocity will be higher). Put simply, when you combine this with reduced steering-losses it\u0027s not 1915 Delta-v vs. 1060 \u002B 1350 Delta-V (idealized transfers), it\u0027s more often 2100 Delta-V vs. 1150 \u002B 1420 Delta-V. Just from this fact alone you will save some Delta-V with the same craft design, even before you account for the additional gravity-assist that Ike offers you the opportunity to make (from Duna orbit), or the opportunity to aerobrake directly into an Ike-intecept, and refuel around Ike rather than around Duna, which will make your Delta-V savings even greater...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I mentioned craft design earlier, and this is really another important factor to consider. \u003Cstrong\u003EIn order to make a reasonably-accurate burn to another planetary system, you generally want to keep your burn-times to no more than 5-6 minutes\u003C/strong\u003E (shorter if your departure orbit around Kerbin is REALLY low- I usually depart from at least 100 km or higher in order to make my transfer burns more accurate, and give my ships a little more breathing room to make rendezvous with fuel tankers or space stations for fuel, and sometimes crew, transfers before departure). Consider the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B A craft with a TWR of 1 around Kerbin can accelerate at a little under 10 m/s^2. To make a transfer to Duna at that TWR would take a little over 2 minutes (assuming an expenditure of 1200 m/s Delta-V with steering-losses). For the same craft to make a transfer to Jool it would have to burn for at least 4 minutes (assuming an expenditure of almost 2400 m/s to Jool). This is ignoring the effect of staging and increasing TWR with fuel-losses of course, but in reality the TWR of NERVA upper-stages is also likely to be quite a bit lower...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B Let\u0027s say your craft is of such mass as to have a TWR of 0.25 around Kerbin with a single LV-N (NERVA) engine. To raise that to 1.5 would take MORE than 6 LV-N\u0027s- as each additional engine adds a not-insignificant mass to the vessel. Additionally, each additional LV-N also reduces your available Delta-V budget for the same reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B The factor of craft structural stability and design-flexibility also comes into play. To make a reasonably-accurate burn to Duna, you won\u0027t need as high a TWR as to make an accurate burn to Jool. This means your craft will be placed under fewer Kerbin-G\u0027s of acceleration for the transfer burns if you make the refueling stop at Duna (the aerobraking, on the other hand, might place your craft under quite a few G\u0027s- but this step isn\u0027t strictly-required), or better yet, Ike (if you can, *ALWAYS* make the refueling stop at Ike, never make the stop at Duna- you will save a lot more Delta-V this way if you can still pull it off with an aerobrake, and especially, if you can\u0027t- say if your craft is too flimsy to survive aerobraking...) This gives you more options for craft-design: a craft that doesn\u0027t need to pull as many G\u0027s, and can get by with less thrust, has a lot more options for its design than one than needs to cram in 6 or 8 LN-N engines... You can even utilize some of the more thrust-anemic, but higher-ISP options than NERVA\u0027s this way, especially if you are using mods: for instance KSP-Interstellar\u0027s ATTILA engines, or NearFuture pack\u0027s HydrogenGas plasmodynamic thrusters (which are basically upsized ion engines that utilize a much less dense reactive propellant in the form of hydrogen gas, rather than Xenon, but benefit from improved ISP *and* TWR as a result- compared to stock ion engines...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B For those of you wondering how you could get a craft into orbit around Kerbin than couldn\u0027t survive at least 1 Kerbin-G of acceleration, there are two answers to this question: the first is that even with stock gameplay, you can construct large multi-part vessels through docking in-orbit that are often much more flimsy as a whole than their individual modules. The second answer is that with modded gameplay, certain mods (such as Orbital Construction and Extraplanetary Launchpads) actually allow you to construct spacecraft in-orbit out of parts (resources) that you ultimately hauled from the ground on Kerbin or produced from locally-available resources off-planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Finally, it should be obvious to you that there is an upper-limit to the size of your spaceships. This is determined both by the limits of the game itself (i.e. part-count and strain on the physics engine), and by your ability to construct a structurally-sound vessel that isn\u0027t so complicated as to cause even you, its designer, to forget how to use it properly. Personally, I use mods like NovaPunch2 and StretchyTanks to scale up the maximum size of my craft (by providing larger-diameter parts, I can build larger vessels with reasonable part-counts), and sometimes I really push the limits of part-count sanity nonetheless; but I still make use of refueling stops to allow me to bring larger vessels to more distant destinations... (in fact, I often utilize refueling around the Mun or even Minmus just to reach Duna with many of my craft designs- usually because of one design constraint or another, such as their ability to act as a high-performance plane on Duna, or a frankly insane 240-ton payload size meant to help me establish a large colony on Duna that I simply couldn\u0027t build a big enough rocket to move to Duna without refueling...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(3) In-Situ Resource Utilization:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027ll be brief on this one. It (hopefully) goes without needing too much explanation that it is much lighter, and thus costs a LOT less fuel from Kerbin, to send a craft to another celestial body (such as the Mun or Duna) to produce and refine resources there (such as Kethane, or KSP-Interstellar\u0027s ability to perform electrolysis of Muna regoltih for Aluminum and Oxidizer), than it does to simply send all the fuel you need from Kerbin. In order to make use of these resources, you\u0027re going to either need to make refueling stops at the production location, or send fuel tankers from the production location to somewhere less out-of-the-way for your interplanetary vessel. Often, you\u0027ll make use of a combination of the two- for instance mining regolith on the Mun or Kethane on Duna, and then launching the resources to a fuel depot in orbit- which is the actual vessel your interplanetary ship will dock with and refuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With enough mods installed, you can produce resources virtually anywhere. The five most important resource-utilization mods I know of are KSP-Interstellar, Kethane Pack, Karbonite, Extraplanetary Launchpads, and (indirectly) NearFuture mod. KSP-I offers a wide variety of resources in appropriate locations, ranging from Munar regolith to LFO mix (presumed to represent combustible ratios of cryogenically-stored Hydrogen and Oxygen gas) extracted from electrolyzing water from Vall\u0027s (presumed) ice deposits. Kethane offers, well, Kethane- wihch can be refined directly into LFO, Monopropellent, and even Xenon. Karbonite does pretty much the same thing, but with a different (slightly better) system. Extraplanetary Launchpads offers a three-step resource system in which you mine Ore, then refine it into metal, then again into RocketParts, and finally use a craft-construction part on an existing base or vessel to construct additional ships like at the VAB or SPH, except off-world. Finally, there is NearFuture mod. It doesn\u0027t directly give you any ISRU capabilities- but its *HUGE* solar panels (ranging as large as the newest, 250 EC/s, \u0022solar blankets\u0022) are the only *practical* way to make large-scale use of KSP-Interstellar\u0027s beamed microwave-power system to create solar electricity-farms in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It also goes without saying that In-Situ Resource Utilization is the *ONLY* way you will ever set up sustainable long-term operations on other planets. It simply takes too many fuel tanker launches to send all the fuel you need to do all the things you want to do otherwise- and it\u0027s going to get even worse when they introduce in-game economy, and you have to pay for all these fuel tanker launches as well. I especially recommend Extraplanetary Launchpads and Orbital Construction mods for this purpose (please note, Orbital Construction does not provide a way to manufacture RocketParts on its own- you\u0027ll need to also install Extraplanetary Launchpads if you want this functionality- and in fact Extraplanetary Launchpads offers its own orbital-construction mechanic that is slowly making Orbital Construction mod obsolete, if not for the much larger RocketParts \u0022warehouse\u0022 modules it offers...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.

This works best in combination with In-Situ-Resource Utilization, as it costs quite a bit of fuel for the refueling base on Duna...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Instead of aerocapturing to a low orbit, or to Ike orbit, aerocapture to a highly elliptical orbit with an apoapsis close to the edge of Duna\u0027s SOI. \u003Cstrong\u003EDO NOT\u003C/strong\u003E unthinkingly make your aerocapture into a prograde orbit relative to Duna\u0027s rotation, or you might end up waiting a longer time to make your eventual ejection burn. Make your atmospheric pass on whichever side of Duna is closest to the sun (the orbital direction will thus vary depending on your approach trajectory- this aerocapture will place you into a retrograde orbit if approaching from behind Duna relative to its orbit, but a prograde orbit if approaching from in front...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Raise the periapsis of your orbit above the atmosphere. You won\u0027t want an additional atmospheric pass slowing you down. If you have enough fuel, this is also a good time to make a phase shift to your orbit by making a low-intensity burn radially outward from Duna at apoapsis, or radially inward at periapsis. Your phase shift should change the major axis of your obit so it points more in the direction of Duna\u0027s movement relative to the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) To refuel the spacecraft, send a tanker from Duna or Ike orbit. It will cost quite a bit of fuel for the tanker, but will save fuel on the ejection burn of the main vessel vs. aerocapturing to a lower circular orbit around Duna or Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) Eject the newly refueled interplanetary vessel from Duna\u0027s orbit, making the majority of the burn at periapsis with Duna to make maximal use of the Oberth Effect. For bonus fuel savings, and awesomeness, grab a gravity assist from Ike. The major axis of your elliptical orbit will be pointed mostly radially outward away from the sun, and perhaps also a bit retrograde relative to Duna\u0027s orbit around Kerbol, so you will need to either perform a phase shift first to shift the direction of your major axis (burn radially outward near apoapsis, or radially inward near periapsis- though be careful, it\u0027s easy to accidentally introduce a component in other directions to your burn during the phase shift, creating accidental undesirable orbit changes), or correct for the degree to which your major axis is off by introducing an extra prograde or radial inward/outward component to your ejection burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main benefit of this method is, as you can see, is that it saves you a LOT of Delta-V on your ejection burn (up to about 500 m/s worth- if you remember, the base cost of the two part transfer is only 450 m/s more if you make the 2nd burn FROM LOW DUNA ORBIT- so you make up the cost difference this way even before you account for some of the other sources of fuel savings such as shorter and more accurate ejection burns...)

How low of a periapsis is fuel-optimal depends on how far away your target is from Kerbin Delta-V wise (and how fast of a transfer trajectory you opt for- if you opt for speed over fuel-efficiency).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) At or near periapsis with Kerbin, perform your transfer burn towards your intended destination (obviously, this requires some planning in advance such that your burn/periapsis is at the correct Angle to Prograde)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe large fuel-savings from both the Oberth Effect and the high velocity you will already have when beginning your ejection burn make this method extremely effective. Note that you will still need a substantial TWR for an accurate ejection burn (lower TWR will require a large adjustment burn later- though this may be worth the reduced engine mass, and corresponding increase in Delta-V) despite the small Delta-V of the ejection burn, as your Angular Velocity will be VERY high at periapsis, leaving you a very short window to make an accurate burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor even more fuel-critical missions (I\u0027ve utilized this method once before when I was sending a SSTDABK-capable spaceplane to Duna on a very suboptimal transfer window) you can set up a full fuel tanker in the same orbit around Minmus, but at a slightly later phase- such that there will be enough time to switch to it and perform an identical ejection burn from Minmus when in reaches the same Angle to Prograde as your interplanetary vessel made its ejection burn...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou then have the fuel tanker match the transfer burn near Kerbin, and rendezvous with the interplanetary vessel as it is on its outbound trajectory to provide the necessary fuel for the adjustment and capture burns at the destination (any fuel needed for the return voyage can be more easily/cheaply provided be fuel tankers in orbit of the destination- which can be sent either ahead of or behind the interplanetary vessel, with much lower TWR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this will require substantial skill/knowledge in both orbital maneuvering (MechJeb will help, but even then you need to know how to make use of some of the more advanced maneuvers it can plot) and rendezvous, as well as as a high TWR on the fuel tanker to help it make an accurate burn to follow/rendezvous with your outbound interplanetary vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual docking is no more difficult than one in a normal orbit though- simply match velocities at closest approach (by burning along the retrograde vector of relative velocity in \u0022Target\u0022 mode), get closer, match velocities again, and repeat ad-infinitum as usual until you\u0027re close enough to dock the two vessel with a simple burst of thrust (from the frame of reference of the fuel tanker/ interplanetary vessel, the two vessels will be stationary relative to each other when their velocity is matched and distance is small, even if hurtling towards the edge of the solar system at thousands of meters/second).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-08T22:10:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2014 10:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torrack","CreatedById":114210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T08:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t yet work for NASA, you should.

Theoretically, a slingshot can be a lot more effective- it can add up to twice the orbital velocity of a planet around the Sun or a moon around a planet to your spacecraft, *if approached from the correct trajectory and angle*. However, achieving the angles and velocities necessary relative to the Sun for that kind of an assist are so difficult and/or expensive in terms of Delta-V that you\u0027re MUCH better off with an aerocapture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practical terms, an aerocapture is much easier and should be more than enough. For instance, if you aerocapture into an elliptical orbit around Duna with a periapsis *just above* the edge of Duna\u0027s atmosphere (you\u0027ll need to perform a *slight* prograde burn at apoapsis to achieve this periapsis), and an apoapsis at the very edge of the SOI; then you could theoretically gain up to the escape velocity of the planet (which for Duna is 1372 m/s) towards your next leg of the journey further out, if your target was far enough out that your escape burn ensured you lost almost no velocity on the way out from Duna... (this would mean a burn for a transfer to a different *star system* however- in practical terms, your gains are more likely going to be limited to around maybe 700 or 800 m/s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as I stated before, aerobraking at Duna to get to Jool would actually cost *more fuel* if you looked strictly at Delta-V costs (you would have to travel to a destination significantly further out than Jool for a Duna aerobrake to save Delta-V directly: think a trip to the Sentar system in Krag\u0027s Planet Factor...) The main benefit is that you can perform a much more ACCURATE pair of transfers this way than if you just went directly to Jool- which means you can use lighter engines (which increases your total Delta-V budget) and subject your rocket to fewer G\u0027s of acceleration. And the equation changes ENTIRELY if you\u0027re using ISRU- in which case the total rocket mass you need to launch from Kerbin orbit becomes MUCH smaller (than a direct transfer, or refueling around Duna using tankers) if you can build a reusable fuel infrastructure around Duna...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Decent Weasel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Decent Weasel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2) how would TWR factor into maneuvers made in freefall?

That is \u003Cstrong\u003Epositively\u003C/strong\u003E related to the strength of the gravity field, and thus the velocity of your starting orbit.

This in \u003Cstrong\u003Enegatively\u003C/strong\u003E related to the strength of the gravity gradient. The stronger gravity is, and the less sharply it falls off as you leave the planet (a larger planet with a lower density and the same surface gravity is more challenging in this regard- hence one of the many reasons Real Solar System is so much harder than stock despite Earth/bigger Kerbin having EXACTLY the same surface gravity as stock Kerbin...), the more kinetic energy you\u0027ll lose from the start to the finish of the burn. This is due to two factors: stronger gravity fields are less forgiving of long burn times, and your burn time will need to be longer in order to escape the gravity field in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first of these there is nothing you can do to change, other than launching from a lower orbit around a more massive body.
