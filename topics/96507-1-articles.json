I haven\u0027t played career mode much (I mainly test out ideas in sandbox) but I think I can answer your questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurface samples and EVA capabilities require a building upgrade (which can be done by right clicking a building, there should be an upgrade button). Offhand I think that because they involve kerbals on EVA, they might require astronaut facility upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding upgrades cost a lot of money, though, so you may have to do a lot of contracts (especially in hard mode) before you have enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll also find that other things (there are limits on how heavy you can build a rocket on the launch pad, certain tracking capabilities, like maneuver nodes, which are very helpful) also require building upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe in-game tutorials don\u0027t cover too much, so as further reading I recommend the official wiki, very helpful if you\u0027re wondering about specifics of say, a specific planet, or part. (They also have tutorials, which are very helpful for early goals, such as getting to orbit, landing on the Mun (moon), etc.) \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor if you prefer videos, Scott Manley has excellent informational/good videos: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg\u003C/a\u003E including tutorials for more advanced topics, like docking, landing on other planets, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you can\u0027t find any tutorials to help you in a specific case, or just need help, the gameplay questions forum is always happy to help. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/15-Gameplay-Questions-and-Tutorials\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/15-Gameplay-Questions-and-Tutorials\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you have fun playing Kerbal Space Program!
