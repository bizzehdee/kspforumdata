A relay antenna won\u0027t use a\u00A0direct antenna on the same vessel to send data. In other words, a relay antenna is a one-in-all deal and won\u0027t \u0022cooperate\u0022 with other antennae on the same ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUp until now I just winged it and it worked... no idea why or who, but it worked... doesn\u0027t help that SQUAD doesn\u0027t include precise and simple instructions... but anyhow, I have this ship on Dres orbit. The idea was to have a rover down there and a relay satellite. The rover has a Com-16 and the satellite has an HG-5 and a 88-88.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy reasoning being that the connection would be\u00A0Kerbin\u00A0\u0026lt;\u0026gt; 88-88 on one hand, and HG-5 \u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u00A0Comm 16 on the other... But apparently not. I\u0027m guessing that the HG-5 want to talk to Kerbin and it can\u0027t?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-18T00:16:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, small relay\u002Bbig direct does not equal a big relay...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-18T00:20:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222891665\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153651\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221482020179\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022142946\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FancyMouse\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, FancyMouse said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, small relay\u002Bbig direct does not equal a big relay...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...in the game.

Things relay or are direct. The only time you can have a direct antenna is at the endpoint, never in between.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes I wish there were no \u0022relay antennas\u0022 and instead half of the advanced probe cores were extra massive and had the ability to relay. Plus maybe a part that allowed relaying. Then, you\u0027d need 2 antennas to relay and the ship automatically figured out which to use for sending and receiving based on the situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
