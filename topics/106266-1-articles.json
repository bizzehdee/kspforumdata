It has no docking collar, no engine and no parachute. Rescue requires that the Kerbal trapped inside spacewalk to the rescuing ship to be returned to Kerbin.\n\nRather than always only using a single crewed part, more complex debris could be generated by taking one of the stock spacecraft and deleting parts at random until it is non-functional. One could be an Aeris 4A that has lost one wing and the corresponding engine, for example.\n\n2: Escape pod\n\nA step up from the debris, this is a Mk 1 Lander Can with a docking collar on the bottom, a parachute on the top, and two expended Sepratrons on the sides. Basically, it\u0027s an escape pod that failed to hit the atmosphere and can be rescued with a spacewalk, or by docking a ship with it and transferring the crew across, or by docking with it and flying the entire pod back to Kerbin. Some of these could have Kerbins who don\u0027t have a spacesuit, requiring that you use the second or third rescue method.\n\n3: Out of gas\n\nA step up again, this is a small rocket or spaceplane with a working engine and a docking collar, but no fuel. It can be rescued the same ways as the escape pod, but it can also be rescued by docking with it and transferring enough fuel for it to fly home under its own power."},{"CreatedByName":"Tabris","CreatedById":122933,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T12:54:55Z","Content":"these are actually in game (not #3 though) i selects a random crewable part and plops it in some orbit (or on the surface)"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T13:02:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E these are actually in game (not #3 though) i selects a random crewable part and plops it in some orbit (or on the surface)\n\n*A* part, yes?

Sure. But far, far , far fewer of them. Most missions in my list are now rescues, it\u0027s absurd. They should be varied and RARE.
