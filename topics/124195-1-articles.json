The only save files are the ones in the save directory. It\u0027s a good habit to make frequent named saves so that you have multiple revert options in case of PIBKAC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for future reference: be aware that the game always immediately does an automatic save to persistent.sfs whenever you switch back to KSC. So if you ever have an oh-crap moment when you need to make-it-didn\u0027t-happen, and you realize immediately that you goofed, the thing to do is to switch out of KSP immediately and just kill the process, then restart the game.
