Top-most a Coms-Satelite with the pizza-box probe core and two antennas. The little Communotron that do not extend, and the medium one that do fold out into a large dish. Under this and after a decoupler, a little lander also with a pizza-box probe-core and two antennas. The little extendable Communotron, and the HG-5 dish that pivots out. All antennas with such ability were extended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter separating the two craft, the Coms-Sat would work fine, parts manager says Fully Operational. The lander however I could not control. Probe core said No Comms Connection. Clearly a bug as I believe both the Communtron extendable antenna AND certainly the HG-5 dish should have the range to reach \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E from orbit around the Mun (with line of sight even).
