That would mean a velocity of 1.1*10^5 m/s. If the free fall along a 100 m horizontal vacuum tube, they will have a vertical displacement of 4 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5m. But after 100 m the positron beam would have a very big radius in the order of meter. So it is impossible to measure if they went up or down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEspecially if you consider that the smallest electric charge in the area of the experiment would displace the beam much farther.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T01:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne can set up an antimatter fountain.
