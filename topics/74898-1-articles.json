Fast forward to a few weeks ago and when I saw it on steam and saw the progress that the Squad team had made, I just had to buy it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally after buying a new game, the next few hours are bliss as I learn the game and everything is new and shiny... After 1.5 hours and approximately 30 crashes and a max altitude of about 30km, I gave up. I did persist and use youtube a lot (props to those people who are able to explain things so well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince them I\u0027m pleased to say I\u0027ve progressed to interplanetary travel, landings on most bodies (Jool is next). Can\u0027t dock worth a damn, but then again when I first started the game i couldn\u0027t get into orbit and that\u0027s easy as pie now! Practice and knowledge is definitely key. Looking forward to more adventures in the near future. Tonight I\u0027m planning to send another manned mission into Kerbol space (for SCIENCE!).
