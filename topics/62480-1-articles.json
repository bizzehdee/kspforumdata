I\u0027m Fidget, I\u0027m really bad at flying planes, and I get most of my designs from watching youtubers. I tend to play KSP while screen sharing it via skype with my best friend, and we kind of screw up on our designs together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I don\u0027t really have many questions, though I guess there\u0027s one: How much in the way of visual improvements are planned? Like making the oceans less of a constant pattern? I understand it not being a priority (physics are way more important), but y\u0027know, it\u0027d be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T23:54:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Fidget98160. The graphics are re-worked periodically (Mun just got a makeover), and the others will be getting additional \u0022art passes\u0022 as well. I don\u0027t know if specific, final goals have been set yet, though. We\u0027ll also get new parts and replacements for old parts from time to time.
