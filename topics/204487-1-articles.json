The ones that say \u0022Rocket Fuel Tank\u0022 have the liquid fuel and oxidizer mixed at the right proportion so that they should drain everything evenly. The tanks that just say \u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022 don\u0027t have any oxidizer in them and are meant to be used with jet engines and the nuclear Nerv engine because they don\u0027t use oxidizer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith most rocket engines any extra liquid fuel on your craft won\u0027t get burned because there isn\u0027t enough oxidizer on board to mix it with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-24T19:18:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthere is no engine or anything whatsoever that uses more oxidizer than liquid fuel. there is no way in game to burn more oxidizer than fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis leaves a few options still on the table:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- you actually loaded less than the full capacity of liquid fuel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- you misspoke and you actually run out of liquid fuel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noname_hero","CreatedById":201680,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-24T20:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother possibility that comes to mind is that maybe the craft uses Rapier engines in air-breathing mode for a part of the flight?
