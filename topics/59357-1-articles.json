I\u0027ll be posting another later tonight as I work on preliminary design sketch builds and some proof of concept stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line is I have yet to decide where to put it. The station itself is meant to be a space dock for large utility ships and interplanetary missions to Duna, Jool, and maybe Eve. For more info beyond that, read the blog post. I was tossing around some ideas and have roughly settled on 3-4 potential orbits. These currently are 350x350, 500x500, 1,000,000x1,000,000, and ~1,500,000x1,500,000. The station is an orbital construction space dock meant as a staging ground for missions. Missions are often sent up empty (or close to it, enough for rendezvous) and fueled at the docks. The dock\u0027s fuel supply comes from my Mun and Minmus kethane operations. I need an orbit that is good for receiving crafts inbound from Munar orbital altitude as well as from Kerbin. Bear in mind the Mun orbits somewhere around 5,000,000km up. So, suggestions? I\u0027m looking to launch the first of the three gantry sections tomorrow. The gantry itself is fairly easily moved so if I can\u0027t get a solid answer in a day, I can always push it around some. That aside, there is no moving it once I start building the respective facilities on the ends of the gantry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T23:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest 700km, that way you can time warp fully.

I am also trying to situate it low enough to get some benefit from Oberth while still being able to get the advantages of less dV to escape velocity and being in closer proximity to the Mun and Minmus. In my experience, the first 50% of your Munar transfer dV is in the first 25% of orbital altitude. Being up in the million km range shaves a huge amount off the fuel requirements of the tankers to get back to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alistone","CreatedById":60032,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T02:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d recommend the 350x350. The further out the orbit the more time you spend trying to wait for the launch window. A lower orbit makes the windows occur more frequently making docking easier (in my opinion). Similarly when you are getting ready to leave you don\u0027t want to be waiting two weeks for your orbit to circle around to the correct phase angle for your ejection burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI played around with this tool \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E by picking a target and moving the parking orbit (that you leave from) at different alititudes and discovered that the optimal parking orbit depends on how far you are going. For close objects (Duna) it is helpful to leave from a higher orbit. For distant targets it is better to leave from lower orbit to better utilize the oberth effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt less than 100km orbits I sometimes had issues with the daocking target \u0022spinning\u0022 as it progressed around it\u0027s orbital path while I was trying to line up the clampotrons. Higher orbits reduce and would support a higher orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I think it doesn\u0027t matter much. By the time you get atomic engines you usually have dV to spare and as long as you do your maneuvers correctly you\u0027ll be fine. Consider though that the gain you get from leaving from a higher orbit could easily be lost by using a non-ideal launch window because you weren\u0027t in the right part of your orbit place when the planets aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-09T02:20:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2014 02:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alistone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T03:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Soda Popinski\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Soda Popinski\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is the question of, is will you have more delta-V to spare if you start from LKO, or if you start from a high orbit fully fueled from Minmus / Mun sources? \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be very interested in seeing this calculated.
