Is to make the easter eggs hidden around the solar system movable. Give them a weight and make it so you can grab them and move them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would give another dimension to the game, you would have the option of retrieving them and putting them where you want to. Make different sizes, different weights or make them all the same weight, doesn\u0027t matter. But either way COLLECTING things is always fun, and the challenge of grabbing a 2ton obelisk off of eve, and returning it to kerbal would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest regards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T19:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this suggestion quite a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T18:01:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of them wouldn\u0027t make sense, like the Mun arches, but the UFO in the north pole of Kerbin might be cool\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thourion","CreatedById":47430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T22:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah i like this concept.
