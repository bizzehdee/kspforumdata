Or is it that the planet is pitching downwards?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example, a craft that\u0026#39;s in orbit will keep the same absolute orientation (if you don\u0026#39;t manually rotate it or tell SAS to hold a particular orbit-relative direction). So if you point the nose prograde, and then just hands-off the keyboard, the nose will appear to \u0022pitch up\u0022, but the craft isn\u0026#39;t rotating at all-- it\u0026#39;s just that the navball is displaying the orientation relative to the [I][U]planet[/U][/I], which of course changes as you follow the curve of the orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs it possible that there\u0026#39;s something similar going on with aircraft as well? Not sure whether the game has a code switch to make \u0022hold orientation\u0022 mean surface-relative rather than orbit-relative, or whether this would be relevant at all due to aerodynamic forces on the craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr is this a particular effect of the aircraft design? Do you notice this on all aircraft, or only certain designs?
