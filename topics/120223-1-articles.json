I\u0027d only landed on Eve once before, and it was a wild ride. Learning from that mistake, I simply sent additional aerobraking measures, to ensure I don\u0027t burn up on entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat worked fine, no problem there. But the issue I\u0027m finding is that it\u0027s really quite difficult to land with precision. On a non-atmospheric body, precision landing is as easy as bringing your trajectory down low over the target, killing horizontal speed, then proceeding with a standard issue landing like you would any other day of the week. Duna\u0027s atmosphere doesn\u0027t seem to be much impediment to anything, and on Kerbin you really only care so much - after all, if you land 20km from KSC rather than 2km, who truly cares (unless it\u0027s a landing challenge, but that\u0027s on you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously that method isn\u0027t so great on Eve, since LEO is 3000m/s\u002B, way more dV than I think most would like to spend, and you \u0022aim\u0022 from 90km\u002B. Aerobraking makes it difficult to aim, since the change in trajectory will be in largely outside your control. After are dozen or two attempts, I got within a few km of the landing zone, which is fine since I have ground vehicles; I got a little feel for it (else I would never have landed where I wanted), but it felt too much like luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some secret to this? I found an old (2013) aerobrake landing chart giving Pe values to place over landing sites, but I have no reason to think the old values still apply. I\u0027ve tossed around the idea of a \u0022cargo plane\u0022 delivery system that could fly/glide to the destination after deorbiting, and while that sounds cool to make, it strikes me that there are some obvious payload limits and launching difficulties with such a craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone mastered this and want to share?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-07T18:05:41Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2015 06:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hagen von Tronje\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kobymaru","CreatedById":107372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T22:39:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, there\u0027s a secret and it\u0027s a mod called \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104694-1-0-4-Trajectories-v1-4-3-%282015-06-20%29-atmospheric-predictions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETrajectories\u003C/a\u003E: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt shows you the exact landing position, depending on your crafts AoA.
