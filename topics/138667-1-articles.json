I dont know if it\u0027s been done before like this to essentialy have the viewers be a multi layered mission control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Any mission in the solar system as long as planetary and lunar voyages are realtime, interplanetary voyages can use time lapse.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-no quicksaving or reloading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-All mods are usable, mechjeb could really help in communal\u00A0flight planning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Teams can be formed for different mission stages.\u00A0Total collaboration and coordinated voting for decision making. Out of stream module making by different teams, and submitted live.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A showcase of designs for a pre determined mission can be voted on before launch, either during the stream or before.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The host streamer can play as a pilot, be apart of a crew team, or maybe just as Gene. The host streamer can be changed for each event, allowing viewers to glimpse others creations, stations, bases, which can be used for the communal mission for refueling, crew transfer, survival ect.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-More than one streaming community can take part as a competition, mock space race.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Looking for more ideas for incentive for mission completion and if something goes wrong, incentive for bringing back the Kerbal to Kerbin. Besides the fun roleplay value..\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Viewers can leave and come back as events might be ridiculously long. Mission and pre flight planning, design and decision voting, the actual journey..\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea is to have hopes of something going wrong, anxiety filled moments, people working together. I currently dont have means to stream myself and would like to find people willing to do this. If this is something people want to try there needs to be a discussion about additional rules and ideas. I think it would be exciting to have the first\u00A050 submitted craft designs to go through\u00A0a layered vote, whittling down\u00A0to top 25-top-10-3.. And seeing other peoples methods. I want arguments, stress, team work,\u00A0drama, betrayal, friendship... maybe not betrayal but you get it. there will have to be patience involved.. I personally would like to see one launch lunar missions, at least to start, to avoid using timelapse at all. Im not sure if it should go deeper and use career mode, that might be too much could be interesting to have communal career modes competing with each other for an out of game point system?... Let me know if this is feasible. thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-01T18:10:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2016 06:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tyjokhu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
