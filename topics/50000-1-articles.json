I tend to like the sillier parts of Kerbal \u0022engineering\u0022 so I figured a large shipping container would be a fun thing to create. To a Kerbal, this is a high capacity transport module, or a Mun base, or maybe(with something like KAS) a bulk intergalactic part storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts still a very rough WIP although the modeling is just about finished. I\u0027d like to add a few more details to the doors and then animate them. It needs to be UV unwrapped and then have a texture with the typical container labeling and some weathering applied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m aware its probably not the most useful or pretty part, but I wanted something fairly simple for a first part so hopefully people like it. I\u0027ll probably export it to Unity later this week and then work on getting it into KSP so I can post a file for playtesting. Let me know what you think!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tVvy7Rrl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tVvy7Rrl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobhendly","CreatedById":70841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T03:58:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I recall, Someone else made shipping containers..

I envisioned this mostly being dropped by sky crane onto a planet surface so I didn\u0027t intend to make any adapters for it, but modeling some decouplers/adapters should be easy enough. The dimensions are 2.5x2.5x6.5m so it should fit nicely onto an orange tank. I\u0027m not familiar with Unity at all so that may be a stumbling point, but hopefully I\u0027ll have something useable by the weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boberts314","CreatedById":69216,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T00:11:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bobhendly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bobhendly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf I recall, Someone else made shipping containers..
