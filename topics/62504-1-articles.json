As you get further and further away from the planet the level of detail decreases. First the textures of the planet decrease, then one by one the level of detail gets lesser and lesser to lessen the strain on the system. This image is the last bit. That is the least level of detail texture to represent Kerbin. Say youre on Moho and u look in Kerbins direction, that blueish dot is what you\u0027d see in the night sky. That said it\u0027s indeed that is always there. Just the size of the image gets larger or smaller based on your distance to the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe texture it self is not a bug.
