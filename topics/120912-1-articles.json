Disclaimer - I am not an IP attorney (still less a US attorney) and would always recommend consulting one if you have any doubts or queries. With that said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you\u0027re in the business of selling software, copyright probably isn\u0027t going to help you that much. However, if you are thinking of selling software or any other creative works (manuals, other printed material etc.), then he good news is that copyright is granted automatically at no charge and only needs to be registered if you plan to enforce it, i.e. sue third parties for infringement. The registration fee is $55 and can be as low as $35 under certain circumstances. The US \u003Ca href=\u0022http://copyright.gov/index.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECopyright Office\u003C/a\u003E has more information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrademarks serve to identify the goods or services provided by a given company. They are a powerful tool for establishing branding and corporate identity and are likely to be your most valuable piece of IP. The US Patents and Trademark Office (USPTO) has a lot of useful information on their \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.uspto.gov/trademark\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewebsite\u003C/a\u003E to get you started and it may be possible (I haven\u0027t checked) to register your trademarks yourself without using an attorney. However, because your trademark is likely to be a significant company asset, I would definitely consult a professional trademark attorney - he/she will ensure that your mark is registered properly and generally fit for purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUtility patents. What most people think of when they hear the word \u0027patent\u0027 and used to protect the technical details of new inventions. Expensive, fairly complicated the first time around, and probably not something you need to be concerned about right now unless your PCs include some novel bit of tech. If the internals are all off-the-shelf components, then there may not be much (or anything) you can file a utility patent for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign patents. See \u0027Apple\u0027s rounded corner\u0027 patents and all the internet angst that went with them. Equivalent to design rights or registered design rights in other parts of the world, a design patent will only protect the \u0027look and feel\u0027 or \u0027industrial design\u0027 of an article. These might be worth looking into in more detail (consult an attorney!), particularly if your PCs come in a particularly distinctive case or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps a bit and good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
