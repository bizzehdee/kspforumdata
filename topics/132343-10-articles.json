All of this annoyance came rushing out with the closure of Kerbalstuff, and given the topic of this thread ended up being vented here.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0In any case I think the discussion has gone around and around a couple times at this point so do we really need to keep going at it. \u00A0 \u00A0I think we could just close this one up and move along, squad will take what we have all said and use it or not, it is at the end of the day up to them. \u00A0Please don\u0027t forget\u00A0really\u00A0we all just want Squad to do what is best for KSP, to make it as appealing to as many users as possible, and all the passion is around various visions of how that could be done. \u00A0So really are we not truly all on the same team after all?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T07:14:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wouldn\u0027t have got to this circular argument

The CurseForge search works a bit better than the Curse.com search and is being improved. Once the code base CurseForge is built on is ready (I have no idea what\u0027s left) it will be used to replace the Curse.com backend and fix a lot of the current issues Curse.com has while adding the improvements CurseForge already has.

A few ads on 1 site does not cover author rewards,\u00A0server costs and salaries for\u00A0coders, admins, reviewers, moderators, etc \u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E have profit left over. Most people seem ok with the idea of ads as long as its offsetting the \u003Cem\u003Epersonal\u003C/em\u003E cost for a single person running 1 site. I am unsure why people get annoyed by ads offsetting the cost for a team of people maintaining multiple sites and giving the community content creators who host with us some reward for their time and creativity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ETLDR\u003C/em\u003E: The ads on Curse.com are\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.)

People complain if anything goes wrong (understandably) and if everything is working, it often feels as if no one appreciates the volunteer work. Being paid a salary means someone like me doesn\u0027t burn out reviewing hundreds of files a day, monitoring 8 different forums for problems, and answering support questions that are frequently abusive.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have made content that was used by millions of people with no appreciation and tons of complaints. I have been a volunteer for community sites. In fact, that\u0027s where Curse found me, volunteering as a site admin/manager and content creator for Minecraft. Then they offered to pay me to do the same thing but on a schedule. Having worked with both sides volunteer and employment, while I like the idea of community sites, I prefer the stability of sites where the admins/moderators are paid a living wage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommunity Hosted and Run Platform:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Usually 1 person covers the costs - meaning they have to work a job too\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Volunteer staff: frequent burn out, difficulty scheduling coverage, has to take a back seat to real life and real jobs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Susceptible to closure when the founder gets bored, is tired, loses interest or any number of other issues that could occur\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProfessional Platform with paid staff:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Cost is not restricted to 1 person\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The staff are paid, they don\u0027t have to worry about feeding their kids or having shelter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Since staff are paid, if staff get bored with the topic, it doesn\u0027t matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Easier to schedule coverage\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- More stable, less likely to have service interruption\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Highly unlikely to vanish (I\u0027d say impossible, but I try to never say that)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am sad that the founder of KerbalStuff felt it was time to move on.
