Probably the easiest way is to expand your apoapsis to muns orbit and wait for the mun to come by. That will take a lot of time, if you are unlucky, you will need much mun orbits to hit its SOI.\n\nIf you expand your apoapsis above muns orbit, you have two shots every round.\n\nAnd if you don\u0027t care, you could do the maneuver node for it in sandbox mode and remember how and when you need to fire up"},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T20:39:51Z","Content":"Both of these will ultimately work, however SpeedDaemon\u0027s answer is the correct one. Basically around the time the moon rises your burn will get you to the proper point. This is how I tend to do it as I like to hold off upgrading facilities until it is absolutely necessary, but it is perfectly possible to get Mun and Minimus encounters with this method, giving you access to HUGE amounts of science since both locations have many biomes."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:38:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Any good tutorial how to do Mun flyby before waypoints/patched conics are available?\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Mun_Landing](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Mun_Landing)"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:45:34Z","Content":"While it is possible for the experienced player to get a flyby without the Maneuver Mode, you should easily be able to accumulate enough funds in a couple of early Career missions to unlock the LV-909 and purchase the upgrades needed.

It\u0027s what I did this playthrough and once the SOI change happened my course was going right through the center of the Mun.\n\nYou probably will require a bit more dV than you do with conics, because you won\u0027t be able to see your course relative to the Mun until you enter its SOI. Course changes that were pretty close to free near Kerbin will have a noticeable cost that close to the Mun."},{"CreatedByName":"pearldrumbum","CreatedById":133163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T23:02:39Z","Content":"First circularize in LKO. Then I zoom out my map view until I can see all of the Mun\u0027s orbit and spin it so that the Mun is between 1 and 2 o\u0027clock and wait until my ship is at 6 o\u0027clock. Burn prograde until my Ap is just shy of touching Mun\u0027s orbit. Once the SOI changes to the Mun\u0027s burn retrograde at Pe until circularized or the orbit you want is attained. Normal/Antinormal and radial burns are a little harder, but I usually roll my ship until the navball shows the horizon as actually horizontal and that helps me orient myself to figure out which way I need to burn to make small adjustments in trajectory/orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"MechaLynx","CreatedById":108866,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:43:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This. It\u0027s what I did this playthrough and once the SOI change happened my course was going right through the center of the Mun.\n\nI was practicing for this mission in sandbox and this is exactly what happened to me on the first try - I just kept burning from periapsis and i got my orbit to pass right through the Mun - thankfully I had enough \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to correct and get back.\n\nOverall, I think the only difficulty in getting to the Mun or Minmus without maneuver nodes is figuring out leading angles. For the Mun its 110 degrees if I\u0027m not mistaken, better to start your burn when the angle is higher than that if you\u0027re just eyeballing it, rather than late, since that puts you an entire orbit behind.\n\nDefinitely possible though - I\u0027ve got a craft that with a lvl1 vab and lvl2 launch site can escape Kerbin if I wanted. All you need is the leading angle and you\u0027re set."}]}
