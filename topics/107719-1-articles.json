Basically around the time the moon rises your burn will get you to the proper point. This is how I tend to do it as I like to hold off upgrading facilities until it is absolutely necessary, but it is perfectly possible to get Mun and Minimus encounters with this method, giving you access to HUGE amounts of science since both locations have many biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00220x7be\u0022 data-cite=\u00220x7be\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny good tutorial how to do Mun flyby before waypoints/patched conics are available?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Mun_Landing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Mun_Landing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:45:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile it is possible for the experienced player to get a flyby without the Maneuver Mode, you should easily be able to accumulate enough funds in a couple of early Career missions to unlock the LV-909 and purchase the upgrades needed.

Then I zoom out my map view until I can see all of the Mun\u0027s orbit and spin it so that the Mun is between 1 and 2 o\u0027clock and wait until my ship is at 6 o\u0027clock. Burn prograde until my Ap is just shy of touching Mun\u0027s orbit. Once the SOI changes to the Mun\u0027s burn retrograde at Pe until circularized or the orbit you want is attained. Normal/Antinormal and radial burns are a little harder, but I usually roll my ship until the navball shows the horizon as actually horizontal and that helps me orient myself to figure out which way I need to burn to make small adjustments in trajectory/orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechaLynx","CreatedById":108866,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:43:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tsotha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tsotha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis.

For the Mun its 110 degrees if I\u0027m not mistaken, better to start your burn when the angle is higher than that if you\u0027re just eyeballing it, rather than late, since that puts you an entire orbit behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely possible though - I\u0027ve got a craft that with a lvl1 vab and lvl2 launch site can escape Kerbin if I wanted.
