For example 5 ton crane skeleton is able to lift 70t\u002B (using steel cables). Now in KSP we can\u0027t use cables system or to very limited degree (via KAS) so in order to have comparative stiffness when lifting 70t the IR parts themselves have to weight 40-80t depending on how complicated model is and how long the boom extends \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StahnAileron","CreatedById":139783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T11:38:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I got to testing IR Rotatrons once more.
