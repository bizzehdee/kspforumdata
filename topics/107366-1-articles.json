Was just looking through some old screenshots I had, and found a picture of a space station that I build back in 0.24 I believe!\n\nIt was made in career mode and is probably still my best creation. It look a lot of time, a lot of journeys and some very precise orbital maneuvering to get in place!\n\nIt is 99% stock, the only thing I added was some extra struts that you can apply in EVA, but I don\u0027t think that is cheating as it was integrated into the unlocking, and I needed to bring them up there too. Ohh, and the clouds of course ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAfter that I took a break from the game, but with the release of 1.0 I have returned, and plan to do a long career mode again, with space stations, rovers and other interplanetary fun!\n\nPlease share your space stations if you have any photos of it!\n\n![screenshot73_zpsjfyxgnaw.png](http://i1369.photobucket.com/albums/ag229/The-MathMog/screenshot73_zpsjfyxgnaw.png)\n\n![screenshot78_zpslw5yikvt.png](http://i1369.photobucket.com/albums/ag229/The-MathMog/screenshot78_zpslw5yikvt.png)"}]}
