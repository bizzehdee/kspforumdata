Even the simplest solid chem-missile can reach comparable speeds to a railgun round. Only it doesn\u0027t have to be built to withstand 20,000G\u0027s and a huge electric arc going through it during launch, which means you can put on it things that aren\u0027t solid-state electronics packaged in ultra-hard foam, like a fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the sub idea, it\u0027s like the third time I see it. An interesting form of MAD, if your railgun is capable of interplanetary shots... only at those scales of war, your sub is \u003Cem\u003Ejust as immobile as a fixed installation\u003C/em\u003E. In the interplanetary total war that we seem to be discussing here, I can just threaten to drop enough rocks to significantly evaporate the ocean your sub hides in. Not to destroy the sub, mind you, though it\u0027ll probably work for that too: diverting a couple big asteroids ensures that the guys that built the sub also die with your citizens in the exchange of weapons of mass destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn interplanetary missile on the sub would offer pretty much the same level of MAD, just like it would on an underground bunker, only a missile shot would be able to maneuver somewhat to avoid interception during the \u003Cem\u003Emonths\u003C/em\u003E of cruise before it hits. And for extra cost-effectiveness, a bunch of small probes attached to hefty asteroids with a small reactor, and a way to use the asteroid for reaction mass, spread throughout space where any attack against them will be clearly seen by your telescopes. Those are probably cheaper to build than a nuclear sub (cost of an ARM mission on a Atlas V vs cost for a Ohio-class sub... I think even a SLS-launched ARM is cheaper than those monsters).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESome interesting assumptions.\u003Cp\u003EMirrors aren\u0027t 100% reflective; even dielectric mirrors don\u0027t ever quite reach a true 100% - plus they have to be designed for a certain wavelength or it becomes destructive rather than reflective. Thus a pulse laser - rather than the continuous wave laser that most people assume would be weaponized - coupled with the ability to adjust its wavelength even just a little, would quickly make a bunch of highly absorptive black marks on the mirror that would cause it to overheat and melt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, it would be effective... unfortunately only for a short period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s not much point in a small RCS (and especially no point in a tiny ion engine) in a projectile at the velocities we\u0027re talking about. Sensor inaccuracies alone would dictate any firing solution be at ranges close enough that RCS on a projectile would be pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact anti-starship railguns are more likely to carry proximity laser fused explosive tungsten continuous rod warheads due to their ability to cut things in half. A direct hit with one would be nothing short of spectacular (large portions of the ship would simply disintegrate), whereas a near miss would result in much less dramatic but no less effective similar catastrophic damage. It would also be equally as impressive in the anti-missile role as it would in the anti-swarm role. Its use as a direct hit kinetic weapon would likely be a tertiary use of the weapon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for hitting something in other orbits: just because you can lob a projectile fast enough to intercept an orbit the planet/moon\u0027s SOI doesn\u0027t mean the projectile becomes \u003Cem\u003Ecaptured\u003C/em\u003E. There\u0027s a reason there\u0027s a capture/insertion burn after a vessel is in the Mun\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, an area denial weapon that uses a railgun to put it in orbit could have an explosive or fuel-type \u0022charge\u0022 with enough delta V to put a cloud of particles in the anticipated path of a target (we are assuming the target\u0027s orbital path can be predicted because it isn\u0027t drunkwalking). If the projectile wasn\u0027t detected then the target flies into the path of the particles and bad things happen to it. Or the target detects the cloud and adjusts its orbit appropriately.... perhaps into the path of another cloud of particles that hadn\u0027t been noticed. The idea being to deplete the fuel of attackers/defenders before the final engagement... or even just to force them into predictable orbits when their delta V budget becomes really tight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact where I really see them shining is when the enemy is attempting to refuel - then you have multiple targets on predictable paths. Just spit out a few area denial shells and watch the two of them constantly adjusting their paths until the warship runs out of fuel and becomes easy pickin\u0027s, or the two are committed in an intercept and you take out both the warship and the tanker. Heck, you can do it when they\u0027re on the other side of the planet and can\u0027t detect the area denial detonations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone should make a mod for that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI woudl say \u002B1... almost. That \u0022cutting things in half\u0022 comment. If there is enough energy in the railgun round to cut something in half, then the laser fed by the same powerplant can \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E cut things in half, and at a bigger range. And way before that, it can blind the targeting sensors on the enemy, so the enemy won\u0027t be able to fire in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArea-denial weapons like those debris-seeding ideas come into a few problems, too: a) space is big, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E detection is dumb easy, and c) you only need miligees to sidestep them, considering your reaction time. So maybe if you are fighting a very long war, seeding the enemy\u0027s planet orbit with debris will be a viable idea to hurt his economic output... but it\u0027ll do nothing in the short term against a particular attack, and we are seeing that space warfare with fixed infrastructures is more akin to MAD, where conflicts that go into that scale pretty much guarantee the death of most civilians on both sides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd anyhow, the range of laserstars means there won\u0027t be enemy combatants around the same rock for long.

A missile could be built to have some sort of single-use ultra-capacitor that burns out after discharge, and have enough stored energy to power many kinds of payloads. Things like mini-railguns that fire kinetic impactors, small laser cannons, EMP generators, or even stuff like asphalt cement ejectors (gunks up exposed sensors, radiators, and solar panels), high-voltage electrostatic nets (shorts out sensors/antennas sticking out), or maybe chemical payloads designed to heavily corrode metals.\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, missiles (as in, self-correcting munitions) are just small spacecrafts intended to get close to the target and do things that harm or impair the target. How it actually does it is something that\u0027s very flexible, and can be adjusted to counter various types of defensive measures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHalf of those assume you couldn\u0027t get a bigger destructive potential with an inert warhead.

Again, not a lot of fuel to dodge (though more than burning at apo/peri)... but if you force the enemy vessel to drunkwalk to counter future area denial attacks, then it will eventually significantly reduce the dV of the enemy vessel and limit its tactical options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, that whole thing is simply a what-if example of the possible use of area denial weaponry, and I\u0027ve deliberately avoided the whole Kessler Syndrome issue because that is just as likely a reason not to use those types of weapons as is the favoured laser only doctrine. After all it\u0027s basically mine-laying but using a canister to spew something the size of shotgun pellets and exploit the fantastic relative velocities rather than an explosive contact device, to force the enemy to react. I imagine it would be rare for a vessel to actually hit them... satellites, though, might make the perfect victims. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, lasers or KE weapons aside, MAD sure seems like the outcome of any real space battle. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rune\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rune\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003EOne comment, though: with lasers, your primary sensor ports will be the laser turrets themselves, they are by definition awesome optical telescopes.

This way, it can traverse faster than the main turret, an obvious advantage when acquiring a target within a very limited time frame. It also means that the missile can carry several targeting turrets rather than relying on the main laser turret, which means the anti-sensor laser now has several eyes to blind, increasing the chances of the sensors acquiring a target before it gets blinded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that I used \u003Cem\u003Efairings\u003C/em\u003E, not \u003Cem\u003Eshutters\u003C/em\u003E. An ablative fairing similar to aerodynamic fairings used in orbital booster rockets can be simpler to build and open than a shutter system. Coupled with the fact that the laser turret won\u0027t survive firing the laser (due to having no radiators, resulting in it, along with its power source, overheating to Hell), the ablative covering doesn\u0027t need to be closed again, rendering the point of shutters moot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can even imagine a nastier version. Replace the directional optical sensor turrets with a passive omnidirectional sensor. When its fairing pops open, it lets itself get fired upon by anti-sensor lasers, thereby acquiring the position of the anti-sensor laser turrets. Train the main laser turret to this location, and pop the ablative fairing microseconds before firing. The target ship would have lost one of its laser turrets (possibly along with a few other things), opening the way to more devastating weapons that are more reliant on sensors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-17T11:47:36Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2015 11:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by shynung\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T12:11:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022baggers\u0022 data-cite=\u0022baggers\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActual small railguns are able to suborbital shots.
