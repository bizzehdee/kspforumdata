Having made up my mind on which one, I set off with a simple lander to see if I could get anywhere near it. For some players this may be an easy task, but for me on my first attempt, I was gobsmacked to finally land 1.7KM away from my target! No mechjeb, etc, just stock parts and me!!\n\nThis game keeps grabbing me in further and further (and I love it!!)\n\nPlease excuse the graphics, however I did this on my laptop, not my usual gaming PC.
