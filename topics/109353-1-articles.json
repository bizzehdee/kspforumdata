My guess (I can\u0027t say for sure as I\u0027m not part of the development team!) is that they\u0027re going to tie the science multiplier for celestial bodies to the cost of a given destination on the itinerary, and also add a basic trip-logic algorithm that actually looks at the destination(s) the tourist wants to reach and calculates the states they need to go through to get there when pricing out how much their trip will cost. The current system seems to be a roll of all possible destinations, picking 2 to 6 of them out of the hat depending on the contract complexity, meaning at the moment you can theoretically get completely unreasonable requests like a trip to Moho\u0027s, Eve\u0027s, and Eeloo\u0027s surfaces all in one trip. What we\u0027ll probably see once those contracts get revised is a system where there are 1 to 3 major destinations, with prices factored based on the destinations you have to visit in order to get to those final destinations. Likely it will be limited to one destination per celestial body, too.

DANGER!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science multiplier is a poor choice as a cost multiplier - it doesn\u0027t reflect the difficulty/expense of getting to a place very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, the Mun has a lower multiplier than Minmus, yet any vet player knows that Minmus is a much easier destination ( ~990 to get there, including a small, far-from-kerbin adjustment if it\u0027s not at the AN/DN, 150 to enter orbit, 400 to land/takeoff, and ~170 to return for a total of ~1710, vs the Mun at 860\u002B200\u002B1280\u002B270 = 2,610... The surface/orbit multipliers are 5/4 for Minmus and 4/3 for the Mun). Another example is that Eve and Moho orbit multipliers are almost the same (7 vs 8), yet Eve orbit is practically the closest destination, whereas Moho is a nasty little space potato deep in the grav well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGonna need a potato peeler for all these angry space potatoes at this rate..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T21:54:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LongbowEOD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LongbowEOD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVirtrude here, for example, wants to orbit around Kerbin, but doesn\u0027t want to pay for a suborbital spaceflight on Kerbin.
