In the below example, the parameter charge is 8,775, and the completion bonus is 26,325 per parameter (3 x 26,325 = 78,975; 4 x 26,325 = 105,300). So far so good.\n\n[![ZpryCGb.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZpryCGb.png)](http://imgur.com/ZpryCGb)\n\nThe first part that bugs me is they get to cheat on picking which parameters they want to pay for! Virtrude here, for example, wants to orbit around Kerbin, but doesn\u0027t want to pay for a suborbital spaceflight on Kerbin. That\u0027s a little like me saying I\u0027ll pay for the Tokyo bullet train, but I don\u0027t want to pay for the flight to Tokyo.\n\nThe second problem is that it makes it makes identical flight plans cost different amounts. Compare Lezy and Barsan. Both want a suborbital spaceflight on the Mun, which I\u0027d call the hardest (or maybe \u0022furthest\u0022) part of the itinerary. But Lezy omits the orbit around the Mun and so pays less than Barsan. Both of them decline to pay for the orbit around Kerbin that\u0027d be required."},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T14:12:40Z","Content":"Yeah, that\u0027s a point.

I\u0027m sure SQUAD is already considering how to deal with it. My guess (I can\u0027t say for sure as I\u0027m not part of the development team!) is that they\u0027re going to tie the science multiplier for celestial bodies to the cost of a given destination on the itinerary, and also add a basic trip-logic algorithm that actually looks at the destination(s) the tourist wants to reach and calculates the states they need to go through to get there when pricing out how much their trip will cost. The current system seems to be a roll of all possible destinations, picking 2 to 6 of them out of the hat depending on the contract complexity, meaning at the moment you can theoretically get completely unreasonable requests like a trip to Moho\u0027s, Eve\u0027s, and Eeloo\u0027s surfaces all in one trip. What we\u0027ll probably see once those contracts get revised is a system where there are 1 to 3 major destinations, with prices factored based on the destinations you have to visit in order to get to those final destinations. Likely it will be limited to one destination per celestial body, too.

And anything with a suborbital trajectory should have a \u0022lowest approach\u0022 of something proportionally like a 10km flight on kerbin (i.e. 10km on kerbin is X% ASL pressure. Ykm on Duna would be X% duna ASL pressure.)\n\nJust having a suborbital trajectory can easily be achieved while still being safely in vacuum. Reworking them to be \u0022periapsis below Ykm\u0022 \u0022low altitude flyby of planetoid Z\u0022 would be nifty.\n\nAs for the payouts for each; I believe that the contract should only pay for the end-point mission for each separate body. i.e. if you\u0027re going for a 9km low pass over the mun, don\u0027t include orbit of kerbin in the contract (if launching from kerbin.)\n\nOf course, the payouts for each end point in the contract will reflect the dV cost to get there (plus some \u0022scenery fee\u0022 for \u0022dramatic\u0022 planets aka a flyby of saturn would be neater than a flyby of venus.)\n\nOne thing that would also be neat; is a \u0022tourism / ferry\u0022 contract.
