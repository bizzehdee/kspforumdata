It\u0027s also about materials and part supply lines. For example, the issue with the Russian Nauka MLM is that the entire fuel system, including the 6 side-mounted bladder tanks, were contaminated with metal shavings and corrosion. Nobody can make these tanks any more because the tooling is gone, the parts to make the valves and the material to make the bladders are no longer available. The idea of fitting other tanks that they had available didn\u0027t work. So the latest plan is to cut open each tank to clean it out, and weld them back together. The plan to deal with the corrosion is to file down the corroded metal and then to check that the tank walls are still thick enough to hold the pressure. If it isn\u0027t, the tanks are scrap and the last option is to either scrap Nauka, or to spend millions of rubles on designing and certifying new tanks, with tooling and procedures, for a total run of 6 units.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same is true for all of these old designs. If a part is no longer available, you need to redesign it again, which includes new CAD/CAM drawings, new materials with different properties, new manufacturing procedures, unit testing and integration testing. In many cases, you wouldn\u0027t simply replicate the design as it was, but you would probably want to improve it and the way it interfaces with the parts around it, and redesign those at the same time.
