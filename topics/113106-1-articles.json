The film of water, evaporates, absorbing almost all of the heat transferred from the metal. This buys you a little time before your skin gets hot enough to cause injury.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is pretty much exactly how ablative heat shields work: for a brief exposure to high heat fluxes, the vast majority of the heat will be sunk into vaporizing the ablative material. On the other hand, an evaporative cooling system like sweat can actually reduce an object\u0027s temperature by absorbing heat from that object and evaporating. If you tried using an ablator to deal with internal waste heat, you\u0027d end up cooking yourself since most ablative materials are also excellent thermal insulators, and would heat up from the inside out. On the other hand, ablative cooling is used to deal with waste heat in some rocket engines, like the RS-68. However, ablative cooling is only useful for rocket engines because the nature of the design means the combustion chamber and nozzle are exposed to a fast-moving stream of very hot gas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"B787_300","CreatedById":31055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T17:06:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shynung\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shynung\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey\u0027re not, they\u0027re mainly heat sinks.

The reason the Shuttle did not use ablative materials on the underside (the top side white fabric looking thing is an ablator, but normally doesn\u0027t get hot enough for it to start ablating) is that an ablator will not hold a very aerodynamic shape when it is ablating.
