The water absorbs heat from your skin and the air around you. When the water absorbs enough heat, it evaporates and caries that heat energy away from your body. In this example the water is the \u0022ablative material\u0022\n\nTechnically, IIRC ablative cooling only involves the vaporization or melting of a solid. What you\u0027re describing is [evaporative cooling,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooler) which involves the use of a liquid.\n\nIncidentally, the human body automatically \u0022sprays\u0022 water on its skin to cool down. That\u0027s what sweating is.\n\nA better water-based analogy for an ablative heat shield would be if you wet your finger before touching it to a dangerously hot surface (such as a red hot metal bar). The film of water, evaporates, absorbing almost all of the heat transferred from the metal. This buys you a little time before your skin gets hot enough to cause injury.\n\nThis is pretty much exactly how ablative heat shields work: for a brief exposure to high heat fluxes, the vast majority of the heat will be sunk into vaporizing the ablative material. On the other hand, an evaporative cooling system like sweat can actually reduce an object\u0027s temperature by absorbing heat from that object and evaporating. If you tried using an ablator to deal with internal waste heat, you\u0027d end up cooking yourself since most ablative materials are also excellent thermal insulators, and would heat up from the inside out. On the other hand, ablative cooling is used to deal with waste heat in some rocket engines, like the RS-68. However, ablative cooling is only useful for rocket engines because the nature of the design means the combustion chamber and nozzle are exposed to a fast-moving stream of very hot gas."},{"CreatedByName":"B787_300","CreatedById":31055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T17:06:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They\u0027re not, they\u0027re mainly heat sinks. Also doubles as insulation.\n\nthey are NOT heat sinks... they are just really really good insulators.\n\nAn ablative is any substance that burns away and releases gas. The benefit of the gas is that it helps carry heat away from the structure being protected and the char is a decent insulator until it gets blasted off by the air. The reason the Shuttle did not use ablative materials on the underside (the top side white fabric looking thing is an ablator, but normally doesn\u0027t get hot enough for it to start ablating) is that an ablator will not hold a very aerodynamic shape when it is ablating. IE the ablator will not burn off equally and leave divots and pits in the material which are really really bad for aerodynamics. On simple capsule designs maintaining such a perfect aerodynamic \u0022mold line\u0022 is not as important. \n\nThere were old ideas on using large metal (copper normally) heat sinks that would just absorb the heat, but were much to heavy.\n\nIf you want to read more there is a free EBook by NASA on the subject that can be found at [https://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/coming_home_detail.html](https://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/coming_home_detail.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T17:12:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E they are NOT heat sinks... they are just really really good insulators.\n\nIt actually is.

Yes you are right that the shuttle had to be left to cool down, that is because the interior of the blocks heated up and stayed heated. There are plenty of you tube videos of people holding the red hot blocks of shuttle tiles shortly after they came out of an furnace. a true heat sink would cool down much much faster and would not be able to be held."}]}
