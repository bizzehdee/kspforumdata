The process isnt all that difficult, it\u0027s more cleaning it all up so it prints well. Now that I have that under control I will be printing out pretty much an entire Vehicle Assembly Building interior. Since it is being changed, it would be nice to have a memento of the old building in 3D form, with some kerbals working away at building a rocket. I used to make many miniature dioramas but have not in a very long time, so it will be fun to start crafting all the pieces for the VAB. I will have some kerbals with construction gear on etc, some climbing rockets, strapping stuff on, and will probably have a kerbal strapped to a rocket too at some point lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally for these kerbals, I will be printing them out in several pieces, both so they are easier to paint and also so I can make them modular and give them movable arms and removable helmets. So what you are seeing here is basically \u0022can I get this thing from my pc into a slicer, convert it to gcode, then xg3 and then actually print the thing\u0022 and the answer obviously is below \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I now need to clean up this model and smooth it all out properly, the size seems pretty decent, and for this particular print it was 81 minutes in total, and about 25 mins to paint it quickly, so all up under 2 hours. The green isnt quite right, the model itself is a bit stock still, so its fairly edgy, I will get them looking a bit plumper and have some more interesting facial prints. This is just the first in a very long line, I will post my progress as I make it. You can see in the video I use a pencil to hold up part of the print for a second, I chose to print this without the internal support for the helmet to save both plastic and time, and it was almost a success with the exception of some small underhand on the lid of the top of the helmet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am planning on clear helmets, just waiting on my clear ABS plastic to come in the post, which it should tomorrow or the next day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarwars (second series) standard size figure for comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.devogeninteractive.com/picup/image.php?id=0C10_51C80061\u0026amp;jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.php?id=0C10_51C80061\u0026amp;jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ZPcoooUR0U?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-24T08:27:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2013 08:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Devo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T08:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat sort of 3-d printer did you use?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"keanukeno21","CreatedById":47588,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T08:28:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot bad! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T08:36:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mekan1k\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mekan1k\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat sort of 3-d printer did you use?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReplicator 2 dualstrusion, but I have it set pretty low resolution at the moment, I did that kerbal on 0.25mm, but can go down to 0.05.
