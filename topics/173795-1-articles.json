But in some cases (or, most cases) the new unlocked part is not very useful or it doesn\u0027t help to improve the design. it is more like to allow you build larger and heavier crafts. So i have an suggestion: can we allow some research to improve the existing parts? For example, found a new type of fuel which can improve the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of thrusters. Or some new light weighted material can reduce the mass of fuselage. So the research is not only about build massive vehicle but also improves existing design.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd further more, maybe we can connect these upgrades to the mineral in other planets! For example, to get the research of improved fuel, you must land and use the mining tools to collect the minerals on moon to unlock it.
