I gather that one of the important functions of moderators is to respond to the ~~Bat-Signal~~ reported post and take appropriate action.  But I have no idea how that works out in practice for the moderators.\n\nIn particular, I\u0027m curious about two things:\n\nFirst, **how often does it happen?**  Order of magnitude, how many posts a day get reported?  Or put another way, for a typical moderator on patrol, how many reports per hour do you respond to?  (My personal impression is that it must be very low-- I get the impression that the KSP forums are a freakishly well-behaved online community full of atypically nice people, and I very rarely see a post that I think of as \u0022report-worthy.\u0022  However, I have no idea if that impression is an accurate one.  Maybe the forums where I spend most of my time just happen to be the most well-behaved ones.  Or maybe the moderators are so ruthlessly efficient that the \u0022rotten apples\u0022 get cleaned up before I have a chance to see them.)\n\nMy other question is:  when you do respond to reported posts, **what\u0027s the signal-to-noise ratio?**  i.e. when you look at the reported post, I could imagine several possible outcomes:\n\n- A \u0022good report\u0022:  you decide that it\u0027s actually something where some sort of moderator action is indicated\n- An innocent \u0022false alarm\u0022:  i.e. the reporter meant well and was acting in good faith, but was a little over-eager and you decide that no action is required\n- Abuse:  either someone\u0027s deliberately spamming the report feature to try to cause trouble or inconvenience (either for the reported person or for the moderators), or else a habitual whiner who just tends to be quick-on-the-trigger to report people all the time.\n\n...What does the frequency breakdown look like for the above categories?  What fraction of the reports are \u0022good\u0022 ones?  Are there enough false alarms (and/or abuse) that it\u0027s a problem for you, i.e. wastes too much of your time?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-10T16:49:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2016 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T17:01:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 minutes ago, Snark said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E First, **how often does it happen?**  Order of magnitude, how many posts a day get reported?

Some people interpret the rules more strictly than we enforce them, so there is a significant fraction (maybe half?) that we decide require no moderation action.\n\nThere are also reports generated when someone clicks \u0022Report post\u0022 rather than \u0022Quote\u0022, happens more often than one would expect and can be confusing when the report text is \u0022Thanks.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T18:23:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Red Iron Crown said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Typically half a dozen or so per day, but some days we get none and others we might get a lot more (especially if there are contentious threads ongoing).
