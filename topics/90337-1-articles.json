I know kerbpaint does exactly what I want, but, frankly, it\u0027s old and outdated, with no-one updating the actual plugin. It is also now incredible buggy. I\u0027m thinking chances are the next release will break it. To all Kerbpaint fans, of whom I once was, I also speak for you. The mod Is too old to work reliably. Below I have some points of what I would like in the new Kerbpaint (Or whatever we call it):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to create a preset, to quickly apply colours to parts and a custom colour bar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A button (Or shortcut) to paint all parts, and a reset all button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Not the ability to paint in flight (Unless with a part? Makes it more realistic)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The ability to automatically make mod parts paintable, but only if it\u0027s possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Make sure all parts painted the same colour are painted the same colour. (Possibly wipe the texture where paint is to be applied before it is painted, but if unpainted, restore it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Look in the original Kerbpaint thread for inspiration if need be.

It might be easier to have many people working on this, or bring it to the attention of SQUAD, so maybe they\u0027ll add the feature to the stock game. Then, there wouldn\u0027t be a need to make mods auto compatible, they\u0027d be paintable too! Again, thanks on behalf of all Kerbpaint fans, and myself for any effort made to fulfil this request, wanted by many. Also, I know you\u0027ve always wanted your lander to be painted bright pink, just for laughs. Or was that just me... Maybe another fluro colour? No?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Naten","CreatedById":70923,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T18:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, but I can not write anything similar to KerbPaint.

Internally, Kerbal Space Program didn\u0027t seem to be tracking what renderer objects were associated to certain parts, which is reflected in the highlighting behaviour- when a part was highlit by KSP, the game either lights only the direct renderer on the part object (for small parts, fuel storage, etc, this is fine) but doesn\u0027t properly highlight more complex, multiple renderer parts such as cargo bays and landing gears. For occasions when it does highlight them, it highlights everything hierarchically below the part in question, such as for selecting and dragging whole groups of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe short of this was, ultimately, I couldn\u0027t isolate on a per-part basis what was actually being colored. This lead to a number of issues, most noticably paint being inconsistent based on load order, landing gears or other non-colorable parts being colorable if child to a recursively colorable part, and a generally unpleasant experience with cruxes of unavoidable issues (Like particle effects having shaders swapped conditionally, symmetry breaks on docked ships, etc). Until that is resolved I\u0027m probably not going to be updating Kerbpaint, as it wouldn\u0027t be possible to resolve it in a featurecomplete way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, addressing Espresso\u0027s points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E-Ability to create a preset, to quickly apply colours to parts and a custom colour bar.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoable, but presets were rather dodgy as a whole. Quality recoloring is actually a Set Hue, Multiply Value, Shift Saturation, so the reference colors provided in presets were entirely irrespective of what they would actually do (Hence why, for instance, orange fueltanks recolour in dodgy ways, that still look good, but obviously not the implied result)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E-A button (Or shortcut) to paint all parts, and a reset all button.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresumably fairly easy. Under the hood, it\u0027s just module manager adding a component to parts that KerbPaint then looks for. Only difficulty I can think of is making sure that you only grab parts from a given vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E-Not the ability to paint in flight (Unless with a part? Makes it more realistic)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, what dictates the paint is strictly the component on the part, it\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve looked but that should be fairly straightfoward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E-The ability to automatically make mod parts paintable, but only if it\u0027s possible.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how to do this one. Kerbpaint is a component on a part, as such, you\u0027d need some way of adding it to all parts, which may have unintended effects. Additionally without paint masks, the recoloring wouldn\u0027t be particularly meaningful, at that point your almost better off just multiplying the color on an object, which can be done much more easily (I think material.color works with KSP\u0027s default shaders, for example)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E-Make sure all parts painted the same colour are painted the same colour. (Possibly wipe the texture where paint is to be applied before it is painted, but if unpainted, restore it)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe recoloring method is one I developed with my professional work, based on Setting Hue, Multiplying Value, and Shifting Saturation. It\u0027s main advantage is, it always looks pretty good and provides quality recoloring without banding or artefacting, or the typical darkening of multiplicative methods (It\u0027s close to how the color blend in photoshop works) - The caveat to this, is you can\u0027t set the color of a thing (Would end up with just a big, flat colored texture then), and there ultimately is not a good way around this. Ideally, if a feature like Kerbpaint were integrated into the base game, it would do all major coloring and base textures would be authored accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone is seriously interested in continuing the project, the shader sources were not included in KerbPaint, and while I\u0027m doubtful as to how much the community would understand them, I\u0027ll happily provide the old sources and answer questions to my implementation on request.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klakh","CreatedById":92356,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T17:12:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi guys. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPosting here because I\u0027m also interested in this mod, even if I did remove it because of its bugs \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50008-0-23-KerbPaint-Paint-layering-for-parts-%28September-23rd%29-%28Same-Old-Still-Works%21%29?p=1484379\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1484379\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E(I posted on the official thread some times ago)\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to paint parts \u003Cem\u003E-I think-\u003C/em\u003E would now be extremely apreciated in the community, given the mod is not too buggy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso because I just had an approximate idea on how you could \u003Cem\u003Eautomatically make mod parts paintable\u003C/em\u003E (I\u0027m no coder, but I know some basics) :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think for that you\u0027d have to make an external .dll that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- analyzes the color ranges on a part\u0027s texture, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- replaces the 3 major color ranges (I\u0027d say white, black and red-orange-yellow ?), leaving the rest transparent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- generates a color map based on these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, on the same \u003Cem\u003E-or another-\u003C/em\u003E .dll (my knowledge would stop here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- roughly analyzing the unity model,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- defining which setting to apply to each one,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- generate the text to add to .cfg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t that be possible ?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-22T17:15:27Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2014 05:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Klakh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Espresso","CreatedById":68432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T21:08:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds like it could work, however, I\u0027m clueless when it comes to coding...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vindaloo","CreatedById":134734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T14:54:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs KerbPaint going to be updated or is someone working on a new mod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Espresso","CreatedById":68432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T21:21:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETexel was going to update it, but I don\u0027t know where that went...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vindaloo","CreatedById":134734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T13:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Espresso\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Espresso\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETexel was going to update it, but I don\u0027t know where that went...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy understanding from his last post above is that he would be willing to give over all the source files for someone to take over the mod, not that he would continue it on his own.
