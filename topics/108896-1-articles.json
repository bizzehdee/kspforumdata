The reason for this, as we all know, is because our computer cannot necessarily cope with performing all the physics calculations the game requires 100,000 times faster than usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, we don\u0027t need all those physics calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStructural stresses: Ion engines produce very little thrust - a maximum of 2 kN (and even that can be reverted back to its previous lower value once we have the ability to perform realistic ion burns). Since we are only allowing time acceleration when that thrust is acting through the CoG we don\u0027t have to worry about centripetal force as it starts spinning out of control, and that force is not enough to break any part or join while not under timewarp, we can simply ignore structural stresses, just as we do in timewarp right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging Mass and CoG: Ion engines use very little fuel mass - a maximum of 1/20th of a kilogram per second. Simply ignoring this change in mass and CoG until you come back out of timewarp would do very little to change your flight path, and the effect of this approximation assuming your ship is slightly heavier than it is would only be a penalty so it cannot be exploited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy Proposal:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In addition to the current requirements to engage timewarp, allow timewarp if the only active engines are Ion engines AND the summed thrust vector of all those active Ion engines passes sufficiently close to the ship\u0027s current center of gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If this requirement is met and timewarp is used, calculate the ship\u0027s displacement over time during timewarp using two and only two acceleration vectors - the gravitation force applied by whatever celestial body\u0027s SoI the ship currently occupies, and a constant ion thrust vector based on the ship\u0027s mass, CoG and thrust at the time timewarp was entered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If the ship runs out of xenon or electricity, revert to non-timewarp as normal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T13:40:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, constant thrust trajectories would be cool. The big issue might not be time warp, but in calculating the spiral to show in map mode when planning a maneuver, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you want a low-thrust trajectory to Jool. Right now you drag a transfer, and do the burn. The specifics don\u0027t matter, it\u0027s X dv required. For a low-thrust trajectory, it\u0027s not the total dv that matters to show it, it\u0027s how that is applied over time. With the spacecraft mass changing, so it\u0027s not just the engines currently active. I suppose you could take total craft mass, and current active constant acceleration engines, and have it use a guess for dv added per second, and expect to have to do periodic corrections as the craft mass decreases (as you will no longer match the mapped trajectory).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hobbsyoyo","CreatedById":89917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T13:44:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d support this fully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027d also like to see an SAS system that could actually handle the trajectory while on rails.
