Maybe I\u0027ll mess with using one Rapier mounted in the craft, and then two externals I drop after I get my apoapsis. That might make more sense.\u003Cp\u003EI think it was designed with that in mind. So was the ship I created. Extra fuel pods are only the beginning \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, the carrier I designed to take it around the solar system was designed to be modular itself too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sent most of the ship up dry, so as soon as I got to minmus it was time to refuel. That meant taking out the various modules of the carrier, and strapping them to the dropship to fill up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nDW1uio.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/nDW1uio.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the dropship outfitted for Kethane mining. The carrier was mostly full at this point and only the RCS and one fuel pod were left to fill, so I chose to take both at once. This is the reason I crammed so many reaction wheels on it. It\u0027s completely stable up to about 85% throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rAbDBA0.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/rAbDBA0.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem I found with a fully modular system is that you have to micromanage the ship a LOT. Especially if you do what I did and don\u0027t even put RCS on it, and instead rely on external tugs to move it around. I think just refueling and going to moho I probably docked and undocked those tugs at least fifty times messing around with various modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually got annoyed enough with it that I went back to the SPH and gave the dropship some RCS of its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESweet it\u0027s all coming together. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Generally it pays to pack a bit of RCS on the lander, usually I only add around 80 units of RCS which is more then enough really.

I know it takes at least 4 turbojets to lift a fully fueled Tadpole off the ground.

They work with far less air than the turbo jets. Plus, they switch automatically. Those intakes I see you guys slapping all over your crafts are just dead weight. At some point, each one is only buying you 50m altitude. The secrets is to point them in the right direction and only use ram air ones. A 4:1 ratio easily gets me up to 30k\u002B at 1700ms horizontal velocity. If you face them all the right direction, you can use far fewer of them. You can still clip them and hide them but they at least need to be facing the right direction to get the most out of them\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022barrenwaste\u0022 data-cite=\u0022barrenwaste\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHuh, I get better performance out of the jets, as long as you throttle down handsomely you should be able to gain speed and altitude even at .00 air intake. Maybe it\u0027s just because I know jets and their character better. I\u0027m also not impressed by how slow, weak, and thirsty the rapiers are, especially at lower altitudes and during the switch. I\u0027m a bit guilty of slapping on to many air intakes, no joke, but the added weight doesn\u0027t matter because of how much more powerful the jets are. A jet/rocket combo dual mounted with a small square strut has far better performance in all the builds I\u0027ve tried. To each their own, I suppose, but for now I remain an oldschool flyer.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still not convinced about the Rapiers, but maybe I do need to give them another chance. As far as the intakes go, in my case they\u0027re an important aesthetic feature of the craft as much as anything else, despite being mostly comprised of the less efficient variety. My feeling with intakes in general is that it\u0027s better to have more then less, the weight difference is negligible really and I\u0027m not sure having a few less intakes will drastically affect the performance of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have tried to do in more recent models is to mount some of the intakes on the drop tanks to get a bit a performance boost there. From what I\u0027ve found though 1 turbo jet will get you to the Mun and back, 2 will get you a return ticket to Laythe/Duna and 4.. well I\u0027ll get back to you on that! But my point is I don\u0027t think having less intakes will affect these benchmarks a great deal. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECupcake...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KissSh0t","CreatedById":57142,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T07:50:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the little rcs thingies that the kerbals can ride.. they are heaps cool..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The14th","CreatedById":82126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T21:42:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cupcake...\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cupcake...\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ll upload those little space scooters I made sometime, something to get the ball rolling.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KissSh0t\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KissSh0t\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like the little rcs thingies that the kerbals can ride.. they are heaps cool..\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotally! /signed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
