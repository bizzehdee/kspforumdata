I typically either put the control core inside a procedural fairing base on a radial attach point (tweakscale helps here) or in a surface attached pod on the side of the rocket near the CoM. \u003Cp\u003EThe reason this works is KSP measures orientation from the root part, unfortunately \u0022control from here\u0022 doesn\u0027t move that (potential mod idea?) so if your control position is on either end of the rocket, any small perturbation becomes is magnified around the center of mass into a large angular displacement for your controlling core. The controller tries to correct this, but typically fails and overcorrects, amplifying the displacement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy placing your controlling root part near the center of mass you eliminate the angular -\u0026gt; linear part of the displacement due to flexing of the rocket, preventing overcorrection in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou really helped me a lot.
