I think I read somewhere that if you visit several bodies you get a value multiplied to your science. If I am doing research on Minmus should I try to hit the Mun on the way back every time?

In kerbal orbit where the multiplier is exactly 1x you\u0027ll recieve 5 science for doing a crew report. The Mun\u0027s orbit has a better multiplier, 3x. That means that any experiment done in Mun orbit will give 3 times the experiment\u0027s base science, so a crew report taken from low or high Mun orbit is worth 15 science points. The surface of the Mun is even better, experiment\u0027s done there are valued at 4x. And if you fly all the way to Tylo the experiments done on its surface will be worth 11x their base value (55 science for a crew report!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T16:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may be thinking of the extra research you get for recovering a craft that visited multiple bodies.
