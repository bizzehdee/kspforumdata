Real rockets exceed Mach 1 very soon after launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have tail-fins, I would say definitely avoid low altitude super-sonic flight. The reason is the tendency for the air resistance to overwhelm your controls and cause your rocket to flip. If you have tail-fins, go for a fast and energetic launch - but that also means having to use control-inputs to steer your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I\u0027m really liking the lower thrust / authentic gravity turn (rather than the control-input-heavy gravity-turn-like ascent profiles we loved in 0.90) ascent profiles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:21:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022A_name\u0022 data-cite=\u0022A_name\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(...)Does MechJeb know how to 1.0?

Mechjeb can follow the ascent profile very accurate, keeping the AOA very small.
