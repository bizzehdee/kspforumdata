Some of them can still be turned into data in that lab, so I\u0027d like to keep them there as \u0027fuel\u0027 for it. Others have been used up, so I\u0027d like to return them to Kerbin for the recovery science. However, I can\u0027t figure out any way to split them up- I can only seem to remove them all as a group, leaving the lab empty. Any suggestions?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T18:32:38Z","Content":"Is the science still in the science modules (mystery goo, thermometer etc)? Than you can get a scientist to take that science and store it in another command pod wich you can recover on Kerbin. \n\nHope this helps"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T19:18:01Z","Content":"Explanation is below, but the TL;DR is: You don\u0027t need to worry about this, go ahead and take them out of the science lab, it won\u0027t hurt anything.\n\nReason:\n\nThere\u0027s the science *data*, and then there\u0027s the *science**.* \n\nThe *science* is the thing you pull out of an instrument and store it wherever (could be in a command pod, could be in a science lab, wherever). This is the thing that gives you science points when you retrieve it on Kerbin, and which is consumed in the process.\n\nThe *science data* is what goes into the science lab when you click the yellow \u0022analyze\u0022 button on the science report. This is the thing that the lab can only hold 500 of. This is the thing that the lab uses when it runs continuously to generate science points over time.\n\nThe important thing to understand is that these are *completely separate things*. The science lab only cares about *science data*. It doesn\u0027t care about actual *science* at all. It happens to be the case that you can store the science in the lab if you want to (just as you can store it in a command pod, if you want to)... but the science lab neither needs nor uses it in any way.\n\nSo here\u0027s how your science-gathering operation should look like:\n\n1. Acquire science (via instrument, crew report, EVA, or surface sample).\n\n2. Put that science somewhere that is physically connected to a science lab. Doesn\u0027t have to be *in* the lab. It could be stored in a command pod of a vessel that\u0027s docked to the vessel that has the science lab, for example.\n\n3. Review the science data. If it hasn\u0027t been analyzed yet by that particular science lab, then the \u0022review science\u0022 UI will have a yellow \u0022analyze\u0022 button. Click that. This uploads the data for that science result into the lab.\n\n4. Repeat #3 for all of your science results.\n\n5. At this point, the science lab has received all of the science data and no longer cares about any of the actual science results.\n\n6. Return your science results to Kerbin and retrieve them to get points you can now spend on the tech tree."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T19:35:05Z","Content":"I understand that you want to split the science data used in the lab from the data you still can use in the lab. That is not possible. The thing is you hardly need to. Science lab is so overpowered right now that a single lab with 6 scientists gave me enough points to complete the tree just from KSC data and Kerbin data... After that i collected everything from minmus and put it in a landed lab with 10 scientists... The result was terrifying... With each 500 science giving me 50k kerbal money i got up to 10mil just from minmus ![-_-](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_sleep.png) All you gotta do is to fast forward and keep adding science data and you don\u0027t even need to return the data since they seem trivial compared to the science you gain from the lab with scientists."},{"CreatedByName":"mrklaw","CreatedById":143639,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T20:00:25Z","Content":"But you can\u0027t process any experiments that take you over 500 science data.
