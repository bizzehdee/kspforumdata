These tanks should not be connected to any engine used during the ascent stage and should be full. Make the most efficient launch and ascent stages. Once in 500 km orbit, decouple launch and/or ascent stage, and only have an interplanetary stage (i.e, 1 or 2 engines, and as many tanks as possible connected using fuel lines to the interplanetary stage engines, you shouldn\u0027t actually have to use that stage for this challenge so all tanks should be full). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhoever can get the most fuel into orbit, wins!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse stock parts only!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T23:23:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is going to promote huge spaceships and not necessarily efficient ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T22:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah it\u0027s really a race of computing power, just recently i managed to get 202tons of \u0022cargo\u0022 into 77km orbit (with 5800l of fuel left).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately it\u0027s not enough for this challenge (managed to get 500km-200km orbit) but in 202t there were 175t of fuel (35000L).
