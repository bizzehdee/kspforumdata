After all, unlocking technology isn\u0027t the only important part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see contracts be more even from one to the next as far as difficulty vs. payout. Sometimes I get contracts that pay a small fraction of the price of the parts I need to use to complete it, while I have others that pay large sums for very elementary tasks. I like having some variety, but I think there is a little too much variety currently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T14:09:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that balancing the Contract alone won\u0027t solve this problem without creating a new one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way 0;24 is now, Contract is the only source of money, and so \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Emust be failsafe\u003C/span\u003E in order to allow to regain fund or just be able to build a rocket from scratch to fulfill any contract.

However, I dislike how little time you have to take them and then a huge amount of time to complete them. I think the balance on time should be changed. I\u0027d like to see the contracts sit in the contract place for longer, but then give you a shorter time to complete them. - Depending on the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, testing a parachute should maybe sit in the contract place for a month but then only give you a week to complete once taken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example would be the rescue mission. I love that its there, but it should be a short contract to both take and complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is still early access however, so odds are they intend to change the contracts around and right now they just want to give everyone a chance to play with the contracts just like they originally gave everyone sandbox mode and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
