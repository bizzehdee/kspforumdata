I believe that KSP will run with an SLI setup, but SLI will not increase your FPS. The biggest FPS gain in KSP would be a decent multi-core processor, with quick single cores (most of the FPS drop in KSP comes from the single-threaded physics calculations; and other game overhead that is difficult to multithread.)\n\nSLI/Crossfire is a method to pair two video cards to increase your FPS."},{"CreatedByName":"Patrick Kerbivan","CreatedById":114804,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:06:05Z","Content":"I can confirm that KSP doesn\u0027t use SLI; when I look at my video cards\u0027 load monitor while running KSP there\u0027s only load on one card. This is while using the optimized profile for KSP as applied by the NVIDIA GeForce Experience application. Someone with a bit more advanced knowledge might know of some trick for forcing SLI, but I agree with KrazyKrl that KSP\u0027s performance is generally going to be limited by your CPU performance rather than your video card."},{"CreatedByName":"Morashtak","CreatedById":88400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T14:57:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Someone with a bit more advanced knowledge might know of some trick for forcing SLI...\n\nThe trick is to use FAFR2. \n\nFirst start by using the \u00223D Settings\u0022 drop down menu and turn on \u0022Show SLI Visual Indicator\u0022. Then fire up KSP and confirm that the indicator shows no hint of SLI usage (it shouldn\u0027t with typical settings).\n\nThen in your NVIDIA Control panel go to \u0022Manage 3D Settings\u0022, select KSP as the program to customize and try the following changes to force SLI;\n\n- Feature....................................Settings\n- Multi-display/mixed-GPU acceleration.......**Multi display performance mode** *(choose this even if you only have one monitor)*\n- SLI rendering mode.........................**Force alternate frame rendering 2**\n- Threaded optimization......................**On**\n\nFire up KSP and check that the SLI indicator is showing some SLI usage (it won\u0027t show much at all, sometimes virtually none which confirms it is advisable to upgrade your CPU vs your GPU for better performance). Turn off the SLI indicator and stop/start KSP to stop showing the indicator in game.\n\nBTW, the FPS increase is just about negligible on my rig tho\u0027 your mileage may vary.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T15:00:04Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Morashtak**\n  \n\u0022It passed the spell check\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T15:11:28Z","Content":"As others have said: FPS effect meager at best. Also, this would be a Unity feature, not KSP in particular."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T22:36:03Z","Content":"Better idea: use second GPU as dedicated PhysX processor.\n\nOh, wait, KSP can\u0027t use GPU accelerated PhysX. What a shame.\n\nI guess we\u0027re stuck with lousy performance and that second GPU will just sit there twiddling its thumbs while your CPU melts.\n\nKSP, please utilise available hardware properly. I am tired of awful performance on high-end machines."},{"CreatedByName":"Canberra Gaming","CreatedById":147308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T00:22:29Z","Content":"Hopefully when KSP moves to Unity 5 (1.1 I\u0027ve been hearing? needs clarification) it will fix a lot of the hardware problems. I\u0027m on a decently high end machine and I\u0027m still hitting a lag wall at about 300ish parts. My Specs are AMD Athlon X4 860K, GTX 960 4GB, and 8GB of RAM but I feel the pain. Again hopefully Unity 5 fixes these lag walls."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T00:53:54Z","Content":"Meh. As I understand it, U5 implements PhysX 3.3... which supports GPU acceleration for Nvidia cards on Windows. But it\u0027s only used for cloth simulation, which is no good to us anyway.\n\nPerformance across the board should improve, but it looks like it\u0027s still unable to utilise more than one thread for a group of connected rigidbodies... which means one thread per craft. Which means performance will still suck, but maybe not quite so hard.\n\nThere are cross-platform GPU accelerated physics engines available (bullet springs to mind) but *someone* appears to be intent on using only stock Unity functionality. \n\nPersonally, I\u0027m not expecting any huge performance boost. But we shall see."}]}
