However, it can be a bit tedious making a custom fairing for your oddly-shaped payload, especially since getting a reference can be a bit difficult, and every part is a decoupler, which means that you get your staging list filled with useless decouplers, just like with NovaPunch. Also, you need to modify the .cfgs to make them work in 0.20.x.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rockhem","CreatedById":57141,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T16:40:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk is there a way to get just the fairing part of KW?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Free Trader Beowulf","CreatedById":62689,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T20:15:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rockhem\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rockhem\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk is there a way to get just the fairing part of KW?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload the whole thing and just delete the parts you don\u0027t want.
