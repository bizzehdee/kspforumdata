In the next version, it should just be \u0022PersistentEngine\u0022, because I will be moving the navigation controls out of the engine part, so it can access all sails or persistent engines in the vessel. At the moment, the module only uses the engine that it is attached to. That\u0027s the only restriction I know of, unless a module modifies an engine in a way that\u0027s incompatible. I haven\u0027t tried making it work in planetary orbits, so there may be some unexpected behavior if you try. Planetary maneuvers are on my TODO list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re just using the \u0022PersistentThrust\u0022 features, and have the controls off, it should work in planetary orbits, you just won\u0027t get a trajectory preview. Combined with something like \u0022Persistent Rotation\u0022, you could use time warp to raise/lower an orbit by matching the vessel rotation to the gas giant\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne issue I currently have is keeping track of resource consumption other than propellant mass. For some reason, my solar electric test vehicle didn\u0027t seem to be balancing energy use by the ion engine with energy generation by the solar arrays correctly at high time warp levels. But, it kept following the trajectory, even if it dropped to 0 ElectricCharge on the batteries.
