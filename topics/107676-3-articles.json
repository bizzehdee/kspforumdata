At the current moment, until KSP-CKAN updates, you will need to download the addon from Kerbalstuff or Github, and install Module Manager. \n\n\u003E A few questions if you don\u0027t mind: Is it currently possible to specify the engines that can employ the plugin with MM? I would love to use all those Near Future Propulsion engines with realistic thrust. Are there any limitations with regards to the engines that could be used currently? Thinking of more complicated things like VASIMRs for example... How far is this capable of operating in a planetary reference frame at the moment?

In the next version, it should just be \u0022PersistentEngine\u0022, because I will be moving the navigation controls out of the engine part, so it can access all sails or persistent engines in the vessel. At the moment, the module only uses the engine that it is attached to. That\u0027s the only restriction I know of, unless a module modifies an engine in a way that\u0027s incompatible. I haven\u0027t tried making it work in planetary orbits, so there may be some unexpected behavior if you try. Planetary maneuvers are on my TODO list.\n\nIf you\u0027re just using the \u0022PersistentThrust\u0022 features, and have the controls off, it should work in planetary orbits, you just won\u0027t get a trajectory preview. Combined with something like \u0022Persistent Rotation\u0022, you could use time warp to raise/lower an orbit by matching the vessel rotation to the gas giant\u0027s surface.\n\nOne issue I currently have is keeping track of resource consumption other than propellant mass. For some reason, my solar electric test vehicle didn\u0027t seem to be balancing energy use by the ion engine with energy generation by the solar arrays correctly at high time warp levels. But, it kept following the trajectory, even if it dropped to 0 ElectricCharge on the batteries. I haven\u0027t figured out why that\u0027s happening."},{"CreatedByName":"John Nowak","CreatedById":67890,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T10:55:21Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t touched ion drives yet precisely because they\u0027re so buffed, and it looks like this fills that hole.

For some context, I\u0027m hoping to deploy this as one of our recommended mods for Realism Overhaul.\n\nOne thing that\u0027s going to present some difficulty is the custom engine module you use, especially since we\u0027re already juggling a few other types.

We\u0027re doing well! \n\nThe next thing on my list is compatibility with near future\u0027s custom engine modules. To replicate some realistic engine behaviors, he coded up some adjustable-on-the-fly engine modules, which is very cool, but breaks compatibility with persistent thrust. In the near term, we can just force those to use persistent engine, but long term I\u0027d love to either see that supported, or somehow change the engine modules around. \n\nFinally, I\u0027m having a terrible time getting consistent power draw from my engines. Probably me doing something dumb, but in the VAB it claims a draw of 2.3 (modelling NSTAR) , in orbit it claims 3.9, and in time warp it was claiming something like 0.6.

Do I orient the sail so I am looking from the backside (anti-pro grade) of the sail directly at the Sun and have it centered (on all axis) and then set cone to 0 degrees, set then time and lock attitude? This is a point of maximum force on he sail and acceleration. I see that in the numbers.\n\nSecondly, when you say \u0022command\u0022, is the sail supposed to orient in real time as I adjust the cone \u002B- 90 or the clock \u002B- 90? If this so, I am not seeing any kind of sail reorientation occur, even if I time forward.

Do I orient the sail so I am looking from the backside (anti-pro grade) of the sail directly at the Sun and have it centered (on all axis) and then set cone to 0 degrees, set then time and lock attitude?

Do your controls have a \u0022Lock Attitude\u0022 toggle button? If this is active, the sail should follow the controls. You also want to click \u0022Set to Now\u0022 button when starting a new command sequence, to reset the start time to the current KSP time.  \n\nA positive \u0022Cone\u0022 angle will tilt the sail so the sunlight bounces off of the sail to the left, if you\u0027re looking through the sail at the sun. The reflected sunlight will act like rocket exhaust to boost the orbit. A negative cone angle will reflect the light to the right, pushing against the orbit and shrinking it. Hope this makes sense. Once you get the hang of the controls, you can switch to \u0022Map\u0022 view and see how different sail angles for different durations affect the future trajectory (check the \u0022Show preview\u0022 toggle button)."},{"CreatedByName":"Kreole","CreatedById":153086,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T14:32:42Z","Content":"Hey Solar, thx for the reply.   \n\nYes, I have the lock attitude button and I can engage it. What I don\u0027t understand is that if after I lock the attitude, as I adjust the cone and clock angles, should I be seeing the sail move about the cone/clock in real time? If so, I am not. I can manually move the sail with SAS manuevers but not with the sail gui. I can also see the sail responding to solar wind over time, so I can fly her, just not with the command sequence.  \n\nWhen I input a command sequence, lock the attitude and then hit the set to now button... when I preview I do not see any of the orbit portions in their respective color for each command sequence. I just see the current orbit.  \n\nI\u0027ve been working on my station for a while, so I\u0027ll play some more with it this weekend.
