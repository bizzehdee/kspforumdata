So I want to make this render farm because Starwhip inspired me to do so and two its something that makes me happy.**\n\n**What are my rendering options?**\n\n**Based on my computer, I offer 1920 x 1080 \\*Standard\\*, 3000 x 4000 \\*Ultra Portrait layout\\*, and 7680 x 4320 \\*Only for special people\\*.** \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/Oj5mN)\n\n**I offer a three different types of rendering: 50 - 100 samples in which can have a grainy look typically 5 minute render. Then a 300 - 500 sample render in which looks great for amateur pics hardly almost little grainy, about 30 minutes to an hour. Next 1000 sample render, typically 2 to 5 hour render depending on layout option, complete polish, no grain, professional. Note\\* You must show camera angle at which you want the rendering to be via screenshot.**\n\n**What do you do with the renderings?**\n\n**After I finish the renderings, they go under the fun process whereas I creatively remake it to look even more superior than it already is. Using an image editing software called GIMP, I am able to produce astounding results in less than 30 minutes. Depending on your rendering options your image should arrive by the next day.**\n\n**How do I get started?**\n\n**Simply specify your rendering options as listed above and give me the download link to your favorite craft. Then wait for your finished product to arrive.** ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Render List:**\n\n**1.**\n\n**2.**\n\n**3.**\n\n**4.**\n\n**5.**\n\n**Render Que \\*If necessary\\***\n\n**1.**\n\n**2.**\n\n**3.**\n\n**4.**\n\n**5.**\n\n**My work done for others:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Upon given the green light to launch, Elon Musk optimistically watch as the CRS-8 soar up to the upper atmosphere. As the first stage booster decoupled releasing the dragon capsule, the world watched to see CRS-8 computer guided program begin performing its \u0022suicide burn\u0022 directly over the barge. Later on that day, SpaceX became the first to successfully land a booster stage back to Earth. SpaceX surely left the world in shock to see a 14 story tall booster stage sitting on a barge.\n\nNote: Big thanks to [esinohio](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/59393-esinohio) for assisting me in developing these flames.
