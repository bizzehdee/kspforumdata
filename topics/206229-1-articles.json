Positive strand, negative strand, single stranded, double stranded, some strange alternative arrangement with 3 or more strands interwoven? RNA is an incredibly diverse molecule used in a staggering variety of ways in living organisms. If the virus uses an unusual type of RNA then it might not work with the bio molecular machinery available here on Earth, in which case the virus can\u2019t replicate and dies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u2019s assume the virus uses positive single stranded RNA like COVID-19; the protein-coding sequences run from the 5\u2019 end to the 3\u2019 end and can be directly transcribed into protein. Or can it? Here on Earth ribonucleic acids typically uses Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Thymine and Uracil bases (DNA uses Thymine, but in most cases RNA uses\u00A0Uracil instead), but this alien virus might use something different that doesn\u2019t exist here, so it can\u2019t replicate its genome and dies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u2019s assume the virus uses ACGU like a regular positive sense RNA virus. Now the virus needs to actually replicate its genome. It can use the available RNA bases floating around inside a human cell, and it contains a gene coding for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) that can create a negative sense copy of its positive sense genome, then make positive sense copies of the negative sense copies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr can it? The RNA a might have the right structure and the right bases in it, but those bases have to actually contain the right code to get turned into proteins in a ribosome (a large complex of RNA and proteins where proteins get made). There are a few bits before the coding region to help a ribosome grab on to the RNA, a start code to let it know where to begin and get the ball rolling, a sequence of bases arranged in triplets which each code for a different amino acid, potentially some complicated stuff like splice sites and non-coding regions, and finally a stop codon to tell the ribosome to let go. This alien virus needs to use \u003Ci\u003Eexactly the right set of codes\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0or its genome is a load of gibberish- it probably won\u2019t make proteins, or if it does they\u2019ll be garbled garbage that do nothing. No polymerases are made so the virus can\u2019t replicate its genome and dies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are twenty or so amino acids used by most organisms (excluding rare ones containing e.g. selenium) and 64 possible combinations of triplets using 4 bases. There are three stop codons, one start codon (methionine) and the other 60 are split unevenly between the other amino acids; the exact distribution varies between species so a sequence that works in a human might not work in, say, a mouse or a fruit fly. This hypothetical alien virus would therefore have to have at least twenty different codons which all matched the correct amino acids or start/stop codons for the target organism to correctly produce its encoded proteins and function- if it can\u2019t do that, the virus can\u2019t replicate and dies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides the RDRP, a virus needs to code for proteins that form its viral capsid, the outer shell of the viral particle, and the internal structural gubbins to wrap up its genome and hold the thing together. Those outer proteins are responsible for latching onto receptors on target cells and getting the contents of the virus into said cells, so they have to be structurally and biochemically compatible- like a key in a lock. If they aren\u2019t, the virus can\u2019t get into a cell, can\u2019t replicate and dies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to sum up- is it more likely that an alien virus happens to land on Earth, happens to have a positive sense single strand RNA genome that happens to use the same bases as RNA does on Earth, uses the same translation markers and amino acid codons as on Earth, coding for the same amino acids as on Earth, for proteins that will function to allow the virus to replicate on Earth; or for one of the many existing viruses on Earth that can already do all those things to swap some genome with another existing virus to make a new, recombinant virus with some new combination of abilities like, for example, the ability to infect humans more effectively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecombinant viruses are nothing new- the \u201CSpanish\u201D flu in the latter years of World War 1 was a recombinant influenza virus, as were bird and swine flu more recently; as far as I know, so were SARS and MERS which are both coronaviruses too. In fact, the existence of SARS and MERS meant that a lot of details were already known about this type of virus, meaning when COVID-19 came along research teams had some information to go on and could build on that to get multiple vaccines out in a remarkably short period of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA totally novel virus would be a completely different story- this hypothetical alien virus that just so happened to be able to function normally on Earth and infect humans would be completely new, probably code for proteins that had radically different sequences and structures to those in terrestrial viruses and would probably be unaffected by antiviral drugs- or it could have a fatal weakness to paracetamol, or the pH could be wrong for its charged amino acids, or it might need a hundred times the lethal dose of potassium to even break out of its capsid in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-02T23:12:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224072115\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206229\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221641164352\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154477\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JoeSchmuckatelli\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, JoeSchmuckatelli said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey were - I\u0027m assuming he referred to some other types of Coronavirus\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, coronaviruses have been around for ages.

There are two things that could make it a remote possibility. First, we still don\u0027t know the origin of first prokaryotes. Extraterrestrial origin is still on the table. Or, vice versa, it is possible that life from Earth has been seeded to other celestial bodies. We know that conditions for bacteria getting ejected on some rock and surviving a ride to another planet are possible. And since all of Earth\u0027s life shares the transcription method, it\u0027s likely that life on another planet that shares origin with Earth\u0027s would as well. Now, there are some variations in codone to aminoacid assignment across all of life, but it\u0027s almost shockingly uniform overall. While the fact that viruses crossing species having a lot of benefits for horizontal gene transfer is likely part of why, I don\u0027t know if there is any reason to believe that alien life with common origin wouldn\u0027t have mostly the same codone sequences. Moreover, terrestrial viruses do have ways of getting around some anticodones missing in host species, so compatibility at mRNA/tRNA level would be plausible at the very least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond is that we have a lot of viruses that bring their own machinery into the host. A lot of it tends to be host-specific, like reverse transcriptase and such, but we also have examples of giant viruses that basically carry much of their own transcription machinery to be compatible with hosts that shouldn\u0027t be otherwise. Something with mRNA payload to get a few basic enzymes going that kickstarts transcription of the virus payload despite host\u0027s transcription system not being fully compatible is entirely within realms of possible, and apparently, at least partially has evolved in some viruses here on Earth for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think we can fully exclude possibility of some dormant living cells on Mars, for example, containing viruses capable of reproducing inside at least some terrestrial cells if they share the same origin. Moreover, if these exist, they could travel to Earth or some other bodies of the Solar system, meaning these could come from virtually anywhere. Although, in a similar vein, a re-introduction of something that originally came from Earth and was frozen out in space for a few hundred million years is more likely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yeah, of course, something like a coronavirus definitely isn\u0027t it. But if some sort of a virus from another world does manage to survive and reproduce in some sort of terrestrial host, a co-infection can easily lead to gene transfer to mundane, terrestrial viruses. Again, reverse transcriptase exists, and mRNA can be transcribed back into DNA or RNA to be incorporated into terrestrial virus even if original payload was incompatible. So while an exceptionally remote possibility, I don\u0027t think we can ever fully exclude this from possible sources. Until, that is, we examine the genome and find absolutely nothing unusual in terms of origin about it, as has been the case so far. I just don\u0027t think it\u0027s a stupid thing to check for. And yes, if we ever do find something \u0022alien\u0022 in a virus genome, my first guess is still going to be a lab somewhere as a far more likely explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224072186\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206229\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221641179300\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn extraterrestrial alien virus would either wipe out literally all DNA-based life in a matter of weeks or it would never infect a single host.

Even if an alien virus is capable of reproducing in terrestrial hosts, it\u0027s not adapted to them.

That\u0027s why the most deadly viruses are typically the ones that cross species. We aren\u0027t their target host, so they never evolved to keep us alive and merely sneezing. Of course, there are also viruses and parasites where killing the host\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0part of spread strategy.

At that point, it\u0027s pretty much up to random interactions with completely new environment to that virus, some of which human body will correct for, and others it will not. This can be anything ranging from asymptomatic to the worst pandemic ever. But we are much more likely to get a virus like that from another species, one whose immune system is similar enough to ours. Like bats, or something. Case in point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
