Select nothing else and instal. It will prompt you which texture size, select one and then scatterer and eve redux latest versions will be installed. You also need to choose a scatterer config for the sun flare. I like to choose scatterer default config flare. By the way you also use 1.11.2 right?   \n\nNow start up the game and try make changes in scatterer, what I do is click on scatterer icon while in kerbal space center in a tutorial and choose a preset and apply. Then make some custom changes and close scatterer. Dont apply again it\u0027s only for the presets.   \n\nQuit to menu and do whatever you like in ksp Everything should work now!\n\nLet me know if i missed something or it\u0027s still not fixed and what you did different maybe"},{"CreatedByName":"Black-Two-","CreatedById":177626,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-02T11:05:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 hours ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Can you test if this happens by skipping straight to step 3?

And if anyone says that using 2 layers of Anti-aliasing is unnecessary, take a look at this:\n\n- Scatterer SMAA only, stock FXAA disabled (Scatterer likes to set it to this)\n\n![img%5D](https://i.imgur.com/TV4Lw04.jpg%5B/img%5D)\n\n- Scatterer SMAA with 8x stock FXAA (I have to manually go to settings and set this every time)\n\n![img%5D](https://i.imgur.com/sYyTvhV.jpg%5B/img%5D)\n\n[Here\u0027s a link to a folder with 2 screen recordings comparing the 2 with the camera in motion](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iOrc5ldGkAnqZNtDxn4M8mwthdlKzEuY?usp=sharing).\n\nEspecially looking at the Astronaut complex, you can see that double-layer AA looks much better.\n\nSome might argue that having the stock FXAA on with the Scatterer SMAA creates an enormous weird shadow. However, that is circumstantial to when the 2nd setting in the Depth Buffer Mode is activated (Merge depth pre-pass into main depth.... etc)\n\n![img%5D](https://i.imgur.com/rCyWWZ9.jpg%5B/img%5D)\n\nAs someone who owns an instagram account posting screenshots (and also simply just a visuals-phile), I want the clearest looking imagery possible. Unless there is a reason that the stock FXAA shouldn\u0027t be on, such as a technical issue or a major performance hit (Which I doubt bc its FXAA), I plead for whatever is set to disable the stock AA be removed on the next update.\n\nInstead, the feature can be set for the Merge Depth pre-pass setting, where if it is set, it gives a warning or disables the stock AA automatically, etc. \n\nRegardless, I hope all of the devs and whoever read my forum post all the way down here a great rest of their day.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-03T21:32:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2021 09:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by kerbalxploder**"},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-04T06:33:31Z","Content":"[@kerbalxploder](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/207009-kerbalxploder/)  \n\nread the changelog and read this:\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022104258\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6672302413\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/103963-wip19x-110x-111x-scatterer-atmospheric-scattering-00770-17052021/page/366/\u0026tab=comments\u0026do=embed\u0026comment=3908432\u0026embedComment=3908432\u0026embedDo=findComment#comment-3908432\u0022 style=\u0022height:317px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nHint: look at the horizon, look at mountain\u0027s edges in your screen\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-04T11:31:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2021 11:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbalxploder","CreatedById":207009,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-06T18:56:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/4/2021 at 2:33 AM, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@kerbalxploder](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/207009-kerbalxploder/)  \n\u003E \n\u003E read the changelog and read this:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022104258\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8780396984\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/103963-wip19x-110x-111x-scatterer-atmospheric-scattering-00770-17052021/page/366/\u0026tab=comments\u0026do=embed\u0026comment=3908432\u0026embedComment=3908432\u0026embedDo=findComment#comment-3908432\u0022 style=\u0022height:294px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hint: look at the horizon, look at mountain\u0027s edges in your screen\n\u003E \n\nThat makes sense.
