See the large explanation I gave a page or 2 ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor everyone: In general about the scanresolution setting:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you need to understand is that the scanResolution isn\u0027t the distance in gaps along your path of movement, it\u0027s the number of measurements in the scanning line that\u0027s perpendicular to your movement direction. There is a trade off, the higher the scan resolution the more measure points the scanline perpendicular to your direction of motion, but this means the scanline takes longer to complete so the resolution along your direction of movement becomes less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to optimize I find is to zoom in on your new map, start the scanning go to settings and lower the scanRes as much as possible until you start to see gaps in the perpendicular scanline at some latitude you want solid-ish after first pass (it changes on the fly when you save the settings) and then turn it back up a small notch to get it solid again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might rename things to make this more clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver increasing your scan resolution will actually decrease the resolution along the scan path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe trick is in finding the right balance which depends on body orbited, altitude, machine specs, what else is running etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your case I mostly think it\u0027s because you\u0027re using the csv writing it\u0027s too slow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-24T21:40:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2013 09:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Innsewerants\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Schnatta","CreatedById":67320,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T21:25:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot down to 100 resolution rate, but this breakes only the lines horrizontally like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- - - - - - - -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- - - - - - - -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have the same thing with missing lines \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo time compression, the whole map was made in realtime.
