However, there are a few technical questions that remain, if anyone could answer would be super helpful!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the correct or preferred format for Normal maps? I\u0027ve been using .DDS, DXT5 format with so-so results. I tried using DXT5_NM but my planet vanished. I\u0027ve also tried using a normal full color normal map (normally hued blueish) but that also causes my planet to vanish, so instead I use a gray scale. Also tried a .PNG format as some have suggested- but my planet also vanishes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo","CreatedById":150430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-07T14:01:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:13px;line-height:20.8px;\u0022\u003EDXT5_NM is correct. \u00A0Are you using photoshop with the Nvidia dds plugin?\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-07T15:27:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sure am, but it hasn\u0027t worked in the past.
