At first I thought you were going to capture an asteroid but I\u0027m not sure if you have a claw on the end of your ship. If you\u0027re going to another planet it must be further from the Sun than Kerbin judging the direction.

So taking that further step while within Kerbin\u0027s SOI is rather unique and bold. I would definitely have to think you had a very ideal window.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
