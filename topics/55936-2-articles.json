Thank you for some serious discussion. I\u0027d really like to dig in but I\u0027m honestly shocked at how much credit KMP is being given (and Squad how little). Yes, it proves that it can be done ... with stipulations. And that, to me, is a card in Squad\u0027s hat. It shows just how much doesn\u0027t work in the current model. KSP is, at it\u0027s core, a single-player game. That is the vision it was built with, or at least the technology it was built with. And while everyone has thought about docking ships with their friends, without a persistent, concurrent universe, its little more than novelty (not to insult the hard work that has gone into KMP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sort of demonstrates the strength and weakness of alpha involvement. The division between what players think the game ought to be. We\u0027re not all unanimous on this, and frankly I think KMP is better suited as a mod (seems to be doing fine as is). Something being taken for granted is what Squad wants to do. Yeah, you invested in their product but it\u0027s still a creative effort and if it is not a feature they are interested in, what\u0027s with the righteous indignation? \u0022SEE SQUAD, WE CAN HAZ MULTIPLAYER\u0022 Why not just distill what KMP is? Instanced situations where players can interact with one another in peer-to-peer networks, using a middleman to help find ships nearby; a byproduct of Squad knowing players will want things they may not provide, and opening their game up to modding very early. They could have obfuscated everything and released part pack DLC\u0027s. So ease up. At the end of the day, ANY of this exists because they made this game. No mod deserves more credit than the base product.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
