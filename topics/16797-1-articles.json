Achievement free as long as possible. The great thing about KSP is that there are no rules or things you should do, its purely about exploration and doing anything your mind can fathom. The goal is to be an innovator (I think of this game a space race against all you fools on these forums \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E), so I usually make sure I can do what people do on here (gravity boost off mun to minmus, typically landings blah blah blah) but have also been trying to figure out some of my own new missions. I would not say enforce missions on the players, but maybe implement some sort of worldwide space race on kerbin. For instance, maybe your kerbal R\u0026amp;D team gets wind of kerbals from \u0022the asian area of kerbin\u0022 deploying kerbals to the bottom of a crater and found a new element that supports fuel production....its not enforced that you \u0022have\u0022 to go there, but obviuosly players would.....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T20:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDone well, achievements can be a solution to the problem that some game players get stuck in a groove, concentrating on one successful technique or style of gameplay.
