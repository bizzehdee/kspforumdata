Would you consider also making some strutted fuel tanks similar to the Troy Mars Mission Concept? With gold foil texture and separate LF and OX tanks.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve already got separate cylindrical and spherical tanks done, but I\u0027m not planning on giving them a gold foil texture. Will release them eventually, although rather than giving them fixed amounts of fuel I think I\u0027ll just bundle Modular Fuel Tanks with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"yeliabmit","CreatedById":84267,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T01:07:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kommitz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kommitz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking of changing the engines to work more like methane nuclear engines, which would have greater thrust than (typical) hydrogen nuclear engines but a lower Isp. Basically change the engines to just use LiquidFuel, increase the thrust by maybe 1.5 or so and drop the Isp down to 600. Doing this would necessitate using Modular Fuel Tanks plugin to keep things from getting confusing with the stock fuel tanks, but I can always leave the current configs available as an alternative. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFWIW, I think this is a good idea.
