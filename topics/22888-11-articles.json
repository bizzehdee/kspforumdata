Thats why I combined the crew compartment. This thing didn\u0027t fly on top of a Titan, it was going to be on a Saturn V sized rocket, at least thats what I gathered from the Internets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo What I am asking is do you want it bigger? I am not going down the road of making a Saturn V Gemini launcher just yet, may be fun later though. For now you would just have to download NovaPunch, or just use a 3.75m to 2.5m adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELadders, well Kerbals can\u0027t climb sideways, witch would solve a lot of problems. I could move the entry/exit point on the pod to the middle since they only use one for exit anyways, but that would be weird to get into and out of in between the hatches instead of actually on top of the hatch. Maybe I will just add some extra hand holds on the thing. For now your just going to have to put your ladders where the hatch is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Gemini SAS I\u0027m removing the gyro controls on the SAS and putting SAS on the pod. I was hoping that it would work so that as it came on it would draw electricity but not really roll the craft so there would be some resource management as an extra electrical system, but it just turned out to be annoying. If you left the gyro on and sas on you would drain all of your electricity if you time warped. This wouldn\u0027t be a problem if you could engage the generator when power was drained but that\u0027s not the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should have plenty of mono to run the generators as needed to have enough electricity for the whole trip. Assuming you don\u0027t leave SAS and your lights on the entire time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mono on the pod is more than enough for maneuvering before re-entry. Your going to have to save enough for that so there is some resource management.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T16:30:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you could include the big Maneuvering And Cargo Module as an optional attachment?

I built an example of what I mean from your other parts (see link below). The top is the normal Gemini pod, the Winged Gemini thing below that is the Passenger Compartment. Between that imagine a decoupler (to separate the reentry stuff from the rest of the craft). The red/black striped fuel thing represents the Maneuvering and Cargo Module. It\u0027d be a bit bigger, but the general shape would be the same. Doesn\u0027t look too bad I think.
