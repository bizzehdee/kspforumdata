This may be hard/impossible with the way KSP is, but maybe this could be feasible in 1.1 with the supposed UI changes. After looking at the IFS cfg Nertea did for his CryoFuels and seeing those in effect in-game, I\u0027m a fan of IFS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here\u0027s the thought:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to has a part config that simply lets you define max amount in a tank (probably based on the standard LF/OX numbers; it\u0027s a point I get to later on), the number of fuel types in the tank, and let you (dynamically) assign the ratio of fuel mix in-game? The actual max amount would be a tweakable in-game so you can set a lower max (like current in-game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to built a spaceplane. I need both LF and OX, but a bit more LF than the stock ratio (9 LF:11 OX) to feed the jets I\u0027ll use for initial ascent. This means I need at least 2 tanks: 1 standard LF/OX and another LF-only. Now say I only need this to hit LKO (maybe it\u0027s just a Space Station Shuttle), so it doesn\u0027t need much fuel overall. For argument\u0027s sake, say I make this really compact and light and use just the small MK2 tanks: 180/220 LF/OX \u002B 400 LF. I\u0027m now carrying too much LF and not enough OX (maybe...) But this is the bear minimum I can try (well, stock anyway. How realistic this is, someone can try I guess). I can lower the LF in the LF-only tank, but I still can\u0027t change the OX amount with this set up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the idea I\u0027m thinking of, instead of getting fixed amounts of each fuel per tank, you could set the ratios instead and have the plug-in crunch the numbers for you. So instead of 2 tanks, I use just a single large MK2 tank, which holds 800 units total. You can set a default ratio in the module definition(s), but it\u0027s tweakable in-game. In this case, it would default to a 2-fuel tank with a 9:11 ratio, LF:OX. In-game, I could tweak the max total fuel to less that full (like we can now). For the fuels themselves, I tweak the ratios. So instead of 9:11, maybe I set it to like 3:2, resulting in 480:320 LF/OX mix. Now I have a better spaceplane fuel amounts. (A single fuel-type tank would be made by setting one of the ratio numbers to zero). Another tweakable would be what fuels types (and how many: LF/OX/MP tank for example) are allowed in the tank (probably handled like how IFS/FS currently switch fuels). This allows fully adjustable multi-fuel tanks. Modifiers to part stats (cost, mass) would be handled like they are now. (Maybe can scale costs/mass based on ratio as well? Different fuels require differently handling/storage requirements. That would affect costs/mass based on how much you\u0027re storing, no?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER! Some fuels (basically anything non-stock) don\u0027t share this simple ratio between fuel units. An example would be Nertea\u0027s mods: Hydrogen and Argon used FAR bigger numbers and ratios (now that I think about it, I think Xenon is in the same boat there...) For this, you could add a multiplier to fuel amounts in addition to the ratio system. This should solve that issue for those types of fuels. Example: A Hydrogen/OX MK2 large tank would give a 100x multiplier to Hydrogen after doing the ratio calculations for 800 units based on a LF/OX style ratio. Nertea essentially does this for CryoEngines\u0027 IFS Fuel mm config.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do realize this my be needlessly complicated. A know a lot of people that work better with raw numbers. Ratios don\u0027t readily click with them. (I\u0027ve helped as a math tutor.) I imagine there might be similar players in the KSP userbase. Maybe this could an option/tweakable toggle: Use Ratio Mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Well, this seems like a useful idea in my head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould IFS be able to implement something like this? If not now, then maybe for consideration after the 1.1 overhaul? Would it even be worth it to implement something like this? (Did any of this even make sense?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, just a thought/suggestion.

Easy way to check: install IFS on a stock game, put a stack gas tank in the editor, empty the contents (monoprop and argon), and observe that the Engineer\u0027s Report reads 0.5 tons more than the dry mass reported in the right-click menu. The seems to get even more confused as I add parts with alt-left-click.\u003Cp\u003EThis may be a stock bug with the editor, since Kerbal Engineer and the Tracking Station report the correct mass, but the wrong mass is also shown in the list of ships that pops up when I click on the launchpad at KSC, and I suspect that in a career save, this may have ramifications for allowing or preventing me from launching a vessel with fuel-switching parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003ESeem to me Engineer\u0027s Report is bugged.
