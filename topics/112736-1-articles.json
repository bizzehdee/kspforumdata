The record must be measurable. It cannot be \u0027best looking spaceship\u0027 as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, not the Geiger counter.\n2. there must only be one variable. We can judge \u0027fastest time to the Mun.\u0027 But not \u0027fastest time to the Mun with the largest ship.\u0027\n3. Craft files and screenshots(mainly the F3 screen)/videos(no craft needed here) are required for maximum chance of approval, along with instructions on how to re-create the record.{craft files can be uploaded through dropbox, or any other method, just Google: \u0027file sharing\u0027}\n4. No cheating. the record must be completed in a way that someone could beat it with a fresh game. No file editing.\n\n you cannot use mods that: \n\n- Control the craft\n- add parts\n- edit physics\n\n\\*Note that mods that increase aesthetics or performance are fine.\n\nWe encourage you to create your own records! here is the format needed for an entry:\n\n**\\*Name of Record\\*** Example: (Heaviest Rocket)\n\n**\\*Record\\*** Example: 500 Tonnes\n\n**\\*Version Achieved in\\*** Example: 1\n\n**\\*Proof\\***\n\nElse:\n\n**\\*Craft File\\***\n\n**\\*Re-Creation Instructions\\***\n\nThank you for your Records, we really appreciate them.![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T07:32:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\*Name of Record\\* Example: (Heaviest Rocket\n\nSomebody please call Whackjob."},{"CreatedByName":"Borsek","CreatedById":129852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T13:11:01Z","Content":"He\u0027s probably already on his way.\n\nI bet I could win the most overengineered mission to duna award with my 0.25 6000t duna mission, where I landed a 300t ship on duna\u0027s surface (more of a launch platform, actually), but the craft files are long gone."},{"CreatedByName":"Plume \u0026amp; Akakak","CreatedById":142955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T14:16:58Z","Content":"We got one.\n\nAfter intensive search, we found\n\n**The most similar-looking pair of kerbals**\n\n**Name of Record :** Most similar-looking pair of kerbals\n\n**Version Achieved in :** KSP 1.02\n\n**Proof :**\n\n[![904226KSPworldrecordmostsimilarlookingpairofkerbals01.jpg](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/904226KSPworldrecordmostsimilarlookingpairofkerbals01.jpg)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=904226KSPworldrecordmostsimilarlookingpairofkerbals01.jpg)\n\n**Re-Creation Instructions :** Examine every kerbal you can very closely."},{"CreatedByName":"Moar Boosters","CreatedById":79218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T18:08:59Z","Content":"**Name of record:** Biggest stock rocket.
