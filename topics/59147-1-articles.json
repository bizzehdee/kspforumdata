Below the middle level (Default, or Normal, I think), shadows may appear very glitchy, if they appear at all. General game detail as a whole goes down as you lower this slider, but speed will also increase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFallback Part Shaders:\u003C/strong\u003E Similar to the Terrain Shaders option, except it\u0027s better to have it disabled unless necessary. This option should only be activated if parts and ships appear glitchy, or lack textures, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAerodynamic FX Quality:\u003C/strong\u003E This affects the look and performance of the reentry and supersonic flight shaders. Lower settings will make the effect all but invisible, but the performance difference should be negligible on everything but the most monstrous of crafts. Some older cards may require it to be left at lower settings, as they may not support the newer shaders the higher settings use. You\u0027ll know if you need to lower this setting when parts that should be experiencing the reentry effect turn pink or black instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScreen Resolution:\u003C/strong\u003E Fairly self-explanatory. Changes the size of the game window when windowed, changes the screen resolution when in fullscreen. Lower settings = better performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFull Screen:\u003C/strong\u003E Depending on your graphics card, you may find that the game runs better or worse in fullscreen as opposed to windowed mode. Use Alt\u002BEnter to switch modes whilst in-game, if you wish to test which one works better for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnti-Aliasing:\u003C/strong\u003E As with every other 3D game out there, without antialiasing you\u0027ll see jagged edges on objects a lot of the time. However, Unity\u0027s AA is known to be rather unreliable and not super useful. It\u0027s better to rely on your graphics card\u0027s built-in AA support, which can be controlled through the app that comes with your card (e.g., the Catalyst app for AMD cards). As such, you can safely leave this option completely off entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EV-Sync:\u003C/strong\u003E In a sense, a frame-limiter. If you allow the game to run too hot, it will render frames faster than necessary. Most modern monitors display at roughly 60 FPS, regardless of what your card is sending it; it simply won\u0027t be able to show any more. As such, enabling V-Sync allows you to conserve your graphics card\u0027s energy. Every VBlank limits it to the monitor\u0027s refresh rate (usually 60 Hz, or 60 FPS). Every Second VBlank limits it to \u003Cem\u003Ehalf\u003C/em\u003E of your monitor\u0027s refresh rate (commonly this will result in around 30 FPS). V-Sync will also ensure that there is no partially-rendered frames (i.e., no visible tears on the screen). However, I\u0027ve noticed that enabling VSync can seem to be rather useless and even a bit damaging to performance when your card is not already rendering the FPS limit or higher anyway. If you experience lag issues, this should be one of the things you try disabling, possibly in favour of your graphics chip\u0027s built in app setting for V-Sync.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFrame Limit:\u003C/strong\u003E Allows you to set a more specific frame limit than the VSync setting does, however it will \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E prevent possible screen-tears. Can be used both independently and in conjunction with V-Sync. If you get FPS spikes to really high levels which then often drop back down, you can use the frame limit to strike a bit of a more stable middle ground by forcibly limiting the framerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPixel Light Count:\u003C/strong\u003E This alters the maximum number of light sources that have their light rendered on individual pixels. Additional lights will display glitchy, with a tendency to illuminate entire faces of an object, as opposed to a collection of pixels that make up that object. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA spotlight within the limit will have a fairly concentrated, obvious circle of what it is illuminating, whereas the same light that is pushing the engine over this set limit (i.e., there are a great many other lights around as well) will actually illuminate an entire object if any part of it falls under the light\u0027s usual beam. In addition, with more lights than this set amount, the additional ones will tend not to illuminate terrain at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaising this setting too much will likely deal a huge hit to your performance, but if you\u0027re fond of using lots of shipboard lights, it might be worthwhile raising it from the default a little. However, it\u0027s difficult to predetermine exactly \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ewhich\u003C/span\u003E lights are calculated first and which are considered over the limit and thus calculated \u0022lazily\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EShadow Cascades:\u003C/strong\u003E This changes the detail level of shadows. Low settings are better for performance, but will take away the smooth edges of shadows, instead showing more obvious regions of gradual lightening towards the edges of shadows. If you\u0027ve got the three kerbals in orbit on the Main Menu, fiddle with this setting and switch back to the main menu to see the difference. You\u0027ll notice it mostly on their faces inside their helmets. You\u0027ll also see it on the other main menu screens, but it\u0027s a little less easy to spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-13T06:47:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2014 06:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by vexx32\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T05:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@vexx32\u003C/strong\u003E Thanks.
