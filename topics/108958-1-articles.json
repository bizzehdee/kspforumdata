It certainly corrupted my campaign mode save file.\n\nScenario: I had landed a 4-Kerbal station on Minmus attempting to complete a contract. I realized that the contract required 5 kerbals, so I built a small RCS pod craft to fly down and dock with the base to complete the contract. After sucessfully docking and completing the contract I attempted to EVA the kerbal from the small pod craft, he bumped his head on the craft, clipped into a landing leg, then the screen went black. A contract completion came up congratulating me for doing a solar flyby, so I surmise the poor kerbal was launched into a solar orbit.\n\nThe altimeter display went blank, the UI was non-responsive, but I was able to use the escape menu to return to the space center. After the load, the usual aerial view of KSP was replaced with nothing but stars. The UI seems to work properly, but with no buildings to click on it\u0027s pretty much a corrupted save.\n\nLooking at the KSP.log file, I was able to find the time when everything went wrong.\n\n    LOG 15:46:05.699] Contract (Build a new surface outpost on Minmus.): You have finished construction of a new surface outpost on Minmus.\u003C#8BED8B\u003ECompletion Rewards: \u003C#B4D455\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3246,089   \u003C#6DCFF6\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A9\u003C#caff00\u003E(\u002B2)  \u003C#E0D503\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A115 \u003C#feb200\u003E(-5)  [LOG 15:46:36.382] [03:46:27]: Henble Kerman from Minbase II went on EVA.[LOG 15:46:36.511] [FLIGHT GLOBALS]: Switching To Vessel Henble Kerman ---------------------- [LOG 15:46:36.516] stage manager resuming...[ERR 15:46:44.812] Invalid parameter because it was infinity or nan.[ERR 15:46:44.813] Invalid parameter because it was infinity or nan.[ERR 15:46:44.814] Invalid parameter because it was infinity or nan.[ERR 15:46:44.814] Invalid parameter because it was infinity or nan.[ERR 15:46:44.816] Invalid parameter because it was infinity or nan.\n\nThe not a number error continues on for a long time, occasionally interrupted with\n\n    [ERR 15:46:44.817] dest.radius\u003E=0.0f[LOG 15:46:44.879] Look rotation viewing vector is zero[LOG 15:46:44.879] Look rotation viewing vector is zero\n\nThere\u0027s also a few entries of\n\n    [LOG 15:46:44.900] recalculating orbit for kerbalEVA (Henble Kerman): MinmusrPos: [NaN, NaN, NaN]   rVel: [NaN, NaN, NaN] |NaN|\n\nand a bunch of messages of my glorious Minmus base exploding.
