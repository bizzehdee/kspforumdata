To combat this atrocity, I present the Stock Lander System! \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/UBy9s)\n\n**Current parts and features**\n\n- FL-T100LV\n\nA slightly upscaled version of the FL-T100 tank featuring a partially recessed mounting node specifically designed to accept a VADULE or other .625 meter engine. Also features a shroud adapter to fit seamlessly on 1.25m stacks.\n\n- FL-T175LV\n\nThe FL-T175 is a 1.75m fuel tank designed to receive the FL-T100-LV with engine attached. Features an integrated decoupler and carries a small amount of monopropellant. When paired with LT-1 landing struts, the assembly fits snugly (read: barely) within a 2.5m fairing. Also fits fairly well to the Mk1 Lander Can on it\u0027s own, though there is currently some overlap.\n\n- X200-8LV\n\nSimilar to the FL-T100LV, but designed for use with the 2.5m Mk2 lander can. Engineered to accept the \u0022Terrier\u0022 engine. Shroud adapter included.\n\n- MK1 Lander Tank\n\nDesigned to pair with the MK1 Lander Can for a uniquely octagonal lander. Has an internal electrical supply and monopropellant capacity.\n\n- VADULE (Vanguard Astrodynamics Ultra-Lightweight Engine)\n\nA small engine intended for landing craft (go figure). Exceptionally light, yet reasonably powerful.\n\nSomewhat more fragile than most engines due to the pop cans used in it\u0027s construction. Surface mountable for clusters... or other things.\n\n **Planned things**\n\n- 2.5m third stage? Will have to test the usefulness of such a thing.\n- 2.5m base version? For use with the Mk2 Lander can.\n- Tiny memory footprint - Using stock textures will allow distribution with only dummy files, calling up the stock textures with MODEL nodes.\n\nStill requires a bit of balancing for cost and tech tree distribution as well. The system should be applicable to most non-atmospheric bodies, and Duna with parachute assistance. As with any work-in-progress this is subject to change entirely or be cancelled outright.\n\nDownload (includes example lander): [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x874vqmy6x7szp9/VADSLS.zip?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T00:28:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 12:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyren","CreatedById":76757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T05:57:45Z","Content":"Cool ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) is it possible to scale flt 150 to 1.875m? should still fit 2.5m bays and is more inline to other part upgrades, of course only if you want ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T06:03:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Cool ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) is it possible to scale flt 150 to 1.875m? should still fit 2.5m bays and is more inline to other part upgrades, of course only if you want ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nShort version: It could still happen.\n\nThat was actually my first choice (because I have been influenced by HGR), but it doesn\u0027t fit in a straight 2.5m fairing with landing legs attached.
