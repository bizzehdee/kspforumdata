I couldn\u0027t get the engines quite in line, and ended up skewing all over the sky. Therefore, I think that adding a pair of attachment points for the cockpit and one on each engine(thereby making them easier to attach in the right position) would be a GOOD IDEA!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if there is an ability to flex the engines forward, I couldn\u0027t find it.
