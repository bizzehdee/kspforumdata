The only thing I could say is you might want to retake your pictures with better lighting."},{"CreatedByName":"AlbertKermin","CreatedById":110967,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T18:58:55Z","Content":"Ok, this is a really, really interesting idea.\n\nHowever, the number and size of textures kind of mean that very few of these vehicles can be loaded at the same time- kind of counter-productive to using them with BDArmory, which was my first instinct when I saw this mod.![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"amankd","CreatedById":135588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T22:34:05Z","Content":"my primary experimenting has caused not masses of lag through just the running of the parts, it does hammer loading times quite a bit but actuall fps drop is more intrinsically linked to part count, i am still awaiting a mod that will load a duplicate damaged modelwhen the part is destroyed, rather than just vanishing i think there should be a way to load a damage model similar to the destryd buildings at ksc, not sure how you would impliment this though"},{"CreatedByName":"AlbertKermin","CreatedById":110967,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T23:16:46Z","Content":"Playing with this mod for a bit, the controls seem- tricky. I couldn\u0027t get the engines quite in line, and ended up skewing all over the sky. Therefore, I think that adding a pair of attachment points for the cockpit and one on each engine(thereby making them easier to attach in the right position) would be a GOOD IDEA!\n\nAlso, if there is an ability to flex the engines forward, I couldn\u0027t find it. Might prove useful.\n\nAlso, the lack of appropriate-size guns in BDArmory annoyed me somewhat ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"amankd","CreatedById":135588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T23:34:49Z","Content":"the tilt rotor system does need infernal robotics, i intend to learn bd armory, i have the gun model all ready but need to learn how to name stuff, i tend to use off set and the cot and com indicatoes to get the trust balanced"}]}
