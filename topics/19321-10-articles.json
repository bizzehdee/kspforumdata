It still makes more thrust than it really should and is far more efficient than it should be. I\u0027m not changing a currently still OP part back to more-OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the \u0022fix\u0022 you made on the command pod has it suffering from stock drag \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E FAR drag. With FAR installed \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E parts end up having those drag values set to zero, though most of them have it done in-game and not in the part.cfg; this is because if I don\u0027t do that then stock drag still acts on the part.

Consider delaying serious staging events until you\u0027re out of the lower atmosphere and try to keep the rocket from overspeeding, since that will allow aerodynamic forces to overpower your control authority. Make sure to start your gravity turn much lower than you\u0027re used to and keep the rocket pointed fairly close to prograde so that you stay in control. Those suggestions tend to fix approximately 99% of all the problems people have with transitioning to FAR. If you need more inspiration, take a look at real life rockets and design yours to look more like those than the abominations that most people build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@vrga: \u003C/strong\u003EPossibilities:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

However, it required an S value of 350, which is nowhere near realistic (about 10x what it should be). I think one of the reasons this is happening is because, as S increases, my CD decreases (S = 35 gave CD ~ 0.0344, S = 250 gave CD ~ 0.0069).
