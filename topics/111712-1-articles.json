This won\u0027t compete even with current generation of ion thrusters. But if you are limited purely by reaction mass, and your only other option is a light sail, this can do way, way better in theory.

But it\u0027s basically the same thing. The main difference is that electrons are thoroughly delocalized in graphene, so if you excite them with coherent light source, such as, say, a laser, you end up with the same coherence on the emitted electrons. And because electrons act as a wave here, you end up with a directed beam. Neat stuff, but it\u0027s honestly not rocket science. More like undergraduate level solid state physics in any decent university.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T13:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder how big is the propulsion against simple photons boucing.
