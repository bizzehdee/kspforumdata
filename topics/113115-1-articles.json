Usually this can be resolved by a quick time acceleration, though if your circular orbit is near-synchronous it can take a while. Synchronous orbit for Minmus is 357.94 km. How long it takes you to get in sight of your target depends on how far you are from that spot. If you\u0027re very close to that specific orbit, you\u0027ll want to burn either prograde or retrograde (depending upon where the ground spot is), then loop back around and fix the orbit. At Minmus, this shouldn\u0027t take more than 100 dV."},{"CreatedByName":"The Science Bucket","CreatedById":141289,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T15:35:19Z","Content":"Cool thank you. I\u0027ll keep trying."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T15:40:21Z","Content":"What\u0027s the text of your contract? Is it \u0022Put a satellite in a **synchronous** orbit of Minmus\u0022?\n\nReason I ask: In my experience, the only times a satellite contract ever gives me a condition of \u0022must have LOS to a particular location on the ground\u0022 is when it\u0027s a synchronous orbit. This means that if you have successfully gotten to the orbit, you\u0027re rotating in lockstep with Minmus, and waiting a few orbits won\u0027t really help you.\n\nIf that\u0027s the case, however, it\u0027s pretty easy to fix (especially at Minmus, where the orbital velocities are really low and it takes vey little dV to make an adjustment). The following advice assumes that you *are* indeed on a synchronous orbit, that you have already successfully matched the orbit, and that the only problem is that you don\u0027t quite have LOS to the target point on the ground. If that\u0027s the case, you need to do one of two things, depending on **which direction** you\u0027re too far from the LOS point.\n\n**If you\u0027re too far** ***east*** **from the LOS point:**\n\n1. You\u0027re too far *ahead* of the LOS point. You need to fix this by slowing down a little to let the surface catch up to you\n\n2. To do this, make a small prograde burn. Anywhere on the orbit will do. Doesn\u0027t have to be big, say; something that will raise your orbit (on the opposite side from where you make your burn) by 10-20% or so.\n\n3. Wait an orbit (or two, or three; whatever it takes). With each orbit, Minmus will rotate a bit faster than you, and the LOS point on the ground will catch up to you.\n\n4. After you have completed enough orbits to get LOS, set a maneuver node at the same place where you originally did your prograde burn. This time you burn retrograde, by the exact same amount that you originally burned prograde. This restores your orbit to what it originally was (i.e. the correct orbit specified by the contract).\n\n5. Profit!\n\n**If you\u0027re too far** ***west*** **from the LOS point:**\n\nYou have the same problem, but in the opposite direction. Do exactly the above, but in reverse. In step 2, you burn *retrograde* instead of prograde, to lower your orbit and make you go faster, so that you\u0027ll catch up to the LOS point. In step 4, you then burn *prograde* to restore your orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T15:46:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m still learning the finer points of orbital maneuvers and I accepted a satellite contract out at Minmus that required the vehicle be in line-of-site with a ground station on the moon.

See, the contracts that call for line-of-sight with a ground station ALSO ask for a synchronous orbit. So despite Minmus spinning fast, your satellite (if it is in the contract orbit) is orbiting at the exact same rate, and will never arrive in line-of-sight.\nIf you\u0027re behind the ground station, do a small retrograde burn at the designated apoapsis; this will shorten your orbit and let you \u0022catch up\u0022 to it. If you\u0027re ahead, do a prograde burn at periapsis. In both cases, you\u0027re trying to only adjust your orbit by a minimal amount - 1 or 2 metres per second. It may take several orbits to achieve line-of-sight (watch the contracts tab for the tick mark), after which you do the reverse burn to put you back on the contract orbit. Larger burns will obviously make the process faster, but cost more fuel at both ends.\n\nAlso, if you\u0027re having trouble with your engine being too powerful for these fine maneuvers, you can right-click on it and adjust the \u0022Throttle Limiter\u0022 down. Combined with the standard throttle, you can fine-tune your engine thrust down to less than 1% of its rated maximum."},{"CreatedByName":"The Science Bucket","CreatedById":141289,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T16:05:07Z","Content":"Yeah it\u0027s a synchronous contract and right now I\u0027ve been holding at the required orbit. Wasn\u0027t sure if prograde or retro would be the correct answer or just try to wait it out. Thanks for the detailed answers. That really helps my understanding of what movements affect my placement in orbit.
