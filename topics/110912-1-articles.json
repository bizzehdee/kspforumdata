This small How-To describes the procedure and what pitfalls await you. But don\u0027t fear! It\u0027s usually very easy!\n\n1. Manual installation\n\n1.1 Where to find mods\n\n1.2 Installing a mod\n\n1.3 Uninstalling a mod\n\n1.4 Troubleshooting\n\n2. Automatic installation\n\n2.1 Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network Package Manager\n\n**1. Manual installation**\n\n**1.1 Where to find mods**\n\nThere are 3 major site where you can find nearly all mods that are made for KSP.\n\na) The Add-ons forum\n\nWhen you are reading this you already found the [forum](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/4-Add-ons). It consists of several sub-forums:\n\n- [General Add-on Affairs](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/19-General-Add-on-Affairs) - This forum is usually used to help users searching for mods and to ask for new ones you would like to have but still don\u0027t exists.\n- [Add-on Releases](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/35-Add-on-Releases) - Here\u0027s the place most modders publish their mods. Have a look at the pinned thread named [Community Mods and Plugins Library](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library). It lists the most used mods there are along with the compatible KSP version. It\u0027s a good idea to start reading there.\n- [Add-on Development](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/37-Add-on-Development) - In this forum you can find unfinished mods. Beware that they can have a lot of quirks and break KSP in certain cases. If you are new to KSP mods you should avoid downloading mods from there.\n\nThe mods aren\u0027t uploaded to the forum itself. Instead the mod-creators paste links to Curse, KerbalStuff and/or other websites.\n\n![\u0026)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Curse\n\nThe [Curse website](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal) is the official KSP mods website determined by Squad (developer of KSP). A lot of mod-creators upload their mods to this site. But you should know that not all mod-creators like that website.\n\nc) *[Link to defunct mod website snipped by moderator because that site has since been hijacked by malware]*\n\n*[snip]* is a KSP mod website made by the community. Mod-creators who don\u0027t want to host their mods at Curse usually do it here.\n\n*[Moderator note: you may wish to check out [SpaceDock](https://spacedock.info/kerbal-space-program) instead. That\u0027s the site that replaced the snipped-out one referred to here.]*\n\nd) The Space Craft Exchange\n\nIt\u0027s a part of this forum. You want to see what other build or just need a proven lifter rocket? [Go there](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/20-The-Spacecraft-Exchange)!\n\ne) KerbalX\n\nIt\u0027s [great site](http://kerbalx.com/) to find crafts. It even let\u0027s you filter which mods are needed!\n\n**1.2 Installing a mod**\n\nNote: Some mods alter a lot of the game mechanics. This could lead to a lot of problems on existing saved games. You should always create a new career/sandbox/... when installing mods to avoid problems.\n\nYou now downloaded a *.zip* file containing a mod. The structure of the content can vary a lot but it\u0027s easy to identify what you need to extract.\n\nBut first open up a file browser and move to you KSP install. If you downloaded the game from Steam you\u0027ll usually find it in this place: *...\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\*.\n\nIn this place there\u0027s are several folders which are of interest for you:\n\n- *GameData*  \n\nThis is the folder where to put the mods into.\n- *saves*  \n\nIf you want to play a saved game another one created, put it here.\n- *Ships*  \n\nIf you downloaded crafts other people created you\u0027ll need to put them here.  \n\nCrafts in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E folder show up ingame in the Vehicle Assembly Building load menu. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E is the tall building where you primarily build rockets.  \n\nCrafts in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E folder show up in the Space Plane Hangar load menu. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E is the build near the runway where you build usually planes and cars/trucks/etc.\n\nNext have a look at the contents of the *mod.zip*.\n\n- If there\u0027s a *GameData* folder in there put the content of it in the *GameData* folder of your KSP install. You can do that by dragging and dropping the *GameData* folder into the KSP install folder.  \n  \nDo not drop the mod\u0027s *GameData* folder on to KSP\u0027s *GameData* folder! This will create a *GameData* folder inside KSP\u0027s *GameData* folder and most likely causing the mod fail to work or even crash KSP on startup.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![k9gp317.png](http://i.imgur.com/k9gp317.png)\n\nIf there\u0027s no *GameData* folder in the *mod.zip* it is very likely that there\u0027s only the mod folder there. Drag and drop this folder into KSP\u0027s *GameData* folder.  \n\nIf there are more folders put them all into the *GameData* folder too.  \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![1X8Rpxb.png](http://i.imgur.com/1X8Rpxb.png)\n\nThere\u0027s one exception you should be aware of: ModuleManager.  \n\nThis mod helps other mods to manipulate stuff during the game\u0027s startup. It needs to load before the other mods do. This is archieved by putting the *ModuleManager.x.x.x.dll* (x.x.x = version number) directly into KSP\u0027s *GameData* folder without an additional sub-folder. (*...\\Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\ModuleManager.x.x.x.dll*)  \n\nBecause this mod is so essential for other mods most are bundled with it. When installing several mods it could happen that there are several ModuleManager dlls. Just delete them except for the one with the highest version number.\n\nUsually that\u0027s it. The mod is installed now and should load the next time when you start KSP.\n\n**1.3 Uninstalling a mod**\n\nUninstalling is usually a trivial task. Just delete the mod folder inside KSP\u0027s *GameData* folder and that\u0027s it. It the mod was bundled with other mods and if those other mods aren\u0027t needed by mods you want to keep, delete them too.\n\n- Be aware that some mods add parts to the game. Crafts which use these parts won\u0027t load anymore and are removed from the save file by KSP after displaying an error message. After that the game should work without issues.\n- Some mods alter the save file and/or modify part behaviors. When removing the mods it can lead to unexpected behavior on crafts in flight.\n\n**1.4 Troubleshooting**\n\nThe game won\u0027t load!\n\nThere could be several reasons for that. The most commons are:\n\n- You put the mod into Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\GameData\\mod. See chapter 1.2 .\n\n- Your game runs out of memory. This can happen when adding a lot of new parts to the game. KSP (Windows version) is a 32 bit executable and has a memory limit of 3.5 GB. If it atempts to get over the limit it \\_will\\_ crash.\n\nRemove some parts or uninstall some mods to reduce memory usage or try the [Active Texture Management](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005) mod which compresses textures.\n\nYou can also try to force KSP to run in [OpenGL](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84203-Less-memory-usage-by-using-OpenGL) mode which uses less memory.\n\nI installed a parts mod but can\u0027t find the parts.\n\nAgain there could be several reasons for that:\n\n- You installed the mod into the wrong path. See chapter 1.2.\n\n- The mod depends on other mods to work. See the mod\u0027s description if you have all the file you need.\n\n- The mod is incompatible with KSP. Locate and read the mod\u0027s thread in the Add-on forum if there\u0027s a way to make it work again.\n\nIt still doesn\u0027t work!\n\nLocate the mod\u0027s thread in the Add-on forum. Write a post to let the mod-creator know about your problem. Be as precise and exact as you can be when explaining what you did and what the game does. Look [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29) if you don\u0027t know what to write.\n\nThe game runs slow after installing this mod!\n\n- If could be that the mod has issues and spams the log file causing the game to slow down. Go look at the mod\u0027s thread in the forum if there\u0027s something you can do about it.\n\n- Some mods noticeably impact the game\u0027s performance. There\u0027s nothing you can do about it.\n\n**2. Automatic installation**\n\n**2.1 Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network Package Manager**\n\nOr in short [\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager-v1-6-16-13-May-2015). It is an easy to use mod management program which automatically handles mod installation and uninstallation. It can also keep your mods up to date.\n\nJust download the package manager and put it somewhere (don\u0027t put it in the KSP GameData folder). It can run from any directory without installation.\n\nYeah I know this chapter is pretty short but what else can I write about it? Just read the thread about it. ;-)\n\n---\n\nI know this small How To isn\u0027t complete. If there\u0027s anything wrong please post it. :-)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-23T15:16:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2018 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**\n  \nSnipped link to defunct mod-hosting site that\u0027s now hosting malware"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T16:05:05Z","Content":"Well this will score you some rep from me.
