No fuel left but infinite eva propellant because you gain more when you get in a capsule. So anyway is it possible to retrograde via Eva with very little eva skills I can barely transfer kerbals and when I do it takes 5 or 6 tries.

Oh well - my tutorial says \u0022One, very Kerbal, solution is to \u0027get out and push\u0027 - you have infinite EVA fuel so get the Kerbal to push the pod retrograde using the suit RCS, slowing the vehicle and lowering its periapsis. Re-board the pod to refuel the suit, repeat as required until the periapsis is in the atmosphere and aerobraking will do the rest for you.\u0022 (so it must be true!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether you can do it with \u0022very little\u0022 EVA skills is up to you - you may well need to re-board the capsule several times and you need to get lined-up in front of the ship more or less properly when you do push.

I could have used my nearby rescue station to save the pilot, but that would have left the ship stranded in orbit. I hate debris. So mission control directed the GOP maneuver. 3 jetpack trips later we had an atmosphere skim, and one more push put us in for recovery. As an added bonus, the TMI stage was designed with legs for Minmus landings, so the whole ship survived (a hard) Kerbin landing intact.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kevin Kyle","CreatedById":110492,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T13:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had to so this once when I first started playing.

Take your time and go slow. Little bursts for thrust go a long way when reaching the back end. As most of teh engines are cupped shaped at the back. Providing a good place to push.
