The martian atmosphere gives an easy source of carbon and oxygen. Dust on Mars is smoothed thanks to the wind while moon dust is very jagged and wreaks havoc on your vacuum seals. The 24.5 hour rotation simplifies heat management (atmosphere also helps a lot here). The short day cycle also lowers the battery capacity needed to survive the night. If you land at the poles you also have relatively easy access to hydrogen. The atmosphere also minimizes micrometeorite impacts and allows you to reach the surface from orbit for negligible dV.\n\nThe major downside behind Mars is that it takes so long to get there, and you can\u0027t easily abort in case of an emergency."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddragon","CreatedById":66937,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T14:52:28Z","Content":"I too have to side with those who vote for the Moon.
