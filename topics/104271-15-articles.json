The ones in the first clue actually made sense to me but the rest!?\n\nSure. It\u0027s common knowledge here, so I\u0027m not spoiling anything. The answers thus far have been \u0022Apollo 10\u0022, \u0022Venera 9\u0022 and \u0022Saros cycle 8\u0022. We are therefore confident that tomorrow\u0027s answer will be \u0022something-or-other 7\u0022.\n\n The first riddle, posted 2 days ago:\n\nA capsule over the Mun with the crew being \u0022L.Gordon Kerman, Jr\u0022 \u0022Donn F. Kerman\u0022 and \u0022Edgar Kerman\u0022. Their being over the Mun denotes a connection, and those names are weird for KSP. Googling the names gives you Gordo Cooper, Don Eisley, and Ed Mitchell. The only time those 3 were together was as the backup crew for Apollo 10 and the altitude was **Apollo 10**\u0027s CPA to the lunar surface. \n\n Next riddle was yesterday and somewhat trickier.\n\n An orbiter named Mares and a lander named Envision at Eve with a bunch of numbers on the mission clock. Envision and Eve both point to Venus, and \u0022Mare/ Envision\u0022 is an anagram for \u0022Venera Mission\u0022 Some google-fu reveals that the numbers in the mission clock correspond exactly with the numbers for **Venera 9**.\n\nToday was a Kerbal staring at a red mun and a series of numbers \u00226585, 21, 7, 29, 7, 22.\u0022. A red mun is clearly a munar eclipse. Googling \u0022eclipse 6585\u0022 reveals that a Saros cycle is 6,585 days long. \n\n Looking at the Wikipedia article about Saros cycles shows that cycle #8 has it\u0027s eclipse types by occurrence in a pattern that happens to match 21,7,29,7, and 22. Therefore **Saros cycle 8**.\n\n So that\u0027s it so far. Tomorrow\u0027s riddle will be something-7 and you have an idea of how they\u0027re thinking when they put these together.\n\n Best,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T02:54:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 02:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"wolfedg","CreatedById":58442,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T03:03:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sure.
