It can take 1.5-2.5 tons to LKO with 1-3 crew with 500-750 m/s of delta v to spare for brute-forcing rendezvous, boosting to higher orbits, and deorbiting. After creating a variant with a KAS winch, a robotic arm, and a novel elbow-shaped decoupler, and launching some small stuff, I realized that there isn\u0027t actually much to \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E in LKO.

At the moment I shrunk the Hitchiker to create a 1.25m, 1-kerbal storage can. I should probably install remote tech. I\u0027ve fitted a rack of 3 comsats on the back of the SSTO, and I have enough DV to do phasing hops so I can place everything correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve decided to launch an SSTO base in LKO so I don\u0027t need to add parts for reentry to my interplanetary ships.
