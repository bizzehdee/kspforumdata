My current intention is to transfer to Solar orbit with as much fuel as possible and then angle the craft outwards and continuously accelerate until I find myself upon an escape trajectory... probably not the most efficient way to do this but bear with me I\u0027m new \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E. I\u0027ve run a couple of test flights using segaprophet\u0027s Scarab HLS, but it seems like I end up with my orbital map flickering between a very elliptical orbit and solar escape every couple of seconds... my Solar Periapsis is currently ~8000000000m, and i\u0027ve been in the same situation the last 2 billion metres, so it doesn\u0027t seem like my continued boosting is actually helping things...

I built a pretty simple 2-stage gantry-based rocket using parts from the Deep Space, Gantry and NovaPunch packs (but no Ion engines or anything like that, that\u0027d be cheating...) and basically burned straight up in a rough experiment. Upon running out of fuel at approx. 24.7km/s, I found myself on a solar escape trajectory with a very very very low periapsis... I\u0027m not certain, but I believe I max have actually flown through the sun... but I accidentally toggled 100000x speed at the wrong moment so I can\u0027t be sure... currently at 1.7 trillion metres above the sun and steadily climbing - it\u0027s almost impossible to actually see any part of the system from this altitudeand the orbital map is either glithced and not showing any lines or working and not showing any lines... I\u0027m not sure which! If anyone is insterested I did take a few screenshots of the thing... would be happy to post them provided people are actually interested! I\u0027m honestly suprised at this result... the rocket I used isn\u0027t even named because it was intended purely as an experiment... it just happened to end up achieving the exact thing I\u0027d been trying to do with more refined designs!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: The Explorator 21, a refinement of my previous design, just ran out of fuel at 102000m/s... I don\u0027t appear to be seeing the Kraken at all either. I\u0027m honestly astonished how easy this was to launch - I literally engaged sas, ignited the solid boosters, detached them and activated the liquid engines at full thrust and lefft it about 50 minutes to use up all the fuel... solar escape in no time! The solar escape trajectory appears to be broken in the orbital map for me though - it\u0027s 68y, 35d and 3h away and that time never decreases...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-02T20:07:34Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2012 08:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by 666lumberjack\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thatgiantsnake","CreatedById":42747,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T23:15:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou will go immensly far from the sun before problems start arising. one rocket that was 700 trillion meters from the sun showed NaN m/s and NaN for the altitude. at the point you will need to run it on x100000 timewarp while piloting another craft\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carde","CreatedById":32336,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T23:44:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can fairly easily do it using stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJI_FOvD5nU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.craft: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://per.hedbor.se/probe1.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://per.hedbor.se/probe1.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the capsule and the \u0022probe\u0022 is escaping the sun.
