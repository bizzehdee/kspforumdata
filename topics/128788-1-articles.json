With KSP 1.1 on the horizon, I feel it\u0027s the perfect time to come back and turn my stream into a family friendly place. You are all more then welcome to jump in whenever you like. And if not, I\u0027ll still hope you\u0027ll enjoy KSP as much as I will!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past I loved useing a lot of mods that made KSP harder and more realistic. But since I\u0027m expecting 1.1 to break all / most existing mods, I\u0027ll stay away from any and will play KSP 1.0.5 in it\u0027s natural state. Best wishes and hopes of success to the team working on KSP 1.1. I hope you\u0027ll be able to deliver a solid version in 2016!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make a long story short, it\u0027s good to be back with the Kerbals! I hope to add at least another 500 hours of gameplay during 2016!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ETake care and fly save.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EDoctor Mandarb!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-29T02:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello Doctor Mandarb, and welcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, time does go by quickly.\u00A0 Especially when you\u0027re playing KSP. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-29T14:43:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113526-doctor-mandarb/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022113526\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113526-doctor-mandarb/\u0022\u003E@Doctor Mandarb\u003C/a\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, you\u0027ve been playing KSP for about as long as I have, so I can\u0027t offer much advice.
