MET goes way up (9 - 12 days) but it\u0027s efficient, as it only takes around 150 d/v to get yourself back to re-entry.\u00A0 Just watch out for heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-23T03:23:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2016 03:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by WanderingKid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
