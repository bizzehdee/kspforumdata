Good luck with getting people to pay 50 bucks on KSP2 even when finished, let alone now, or daring to ask something absurd like 70-80-90 bucks when it is finished. Most KSP players still have potato laptops that play on minimal settings KSP. I doubt 50 bucks is something they are gonna dish out.

It\u0027s not the same as delaying by about 6 months to polish the game more.

There\u0027s a Ultima 9 as a famous example from the RPG genre. A delayed game can be good, but all in all a game getting delayed by multiple years isn\u0027t a good sign.

The delays are a sign of trouble and whether they are able to turn things around is a open bet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Also yes, I agree stating that KSP 2 is already better than KSP 1 is a wild claim. You haven\u0027t even played it yet. It\u0027s lacking a lot of KSP 1 features at the moment. Without trying it out it is really hard to say whether the new features make up for that. Just as an example, wheel physics seem to be as bad as ever.
