I do not mind Squad being silent, but I do miss the immersion and the little bites they offered that kept us enthousiastic. So now that multiple dev\u0027s have left and Squad has gotten silent, people tend to start thinking something bad is going on (and why shouldn\u0027t they?). The reason why this is important to recognise is because KSP IS the community. I\u0027ve always advocated KSP to others, banging about why they should play this game. But I\u0027ve fallen silent, since I don\u0027t know what Squad has in store for us, I cannot advocate it to others. So, even though Squad may rightfully choose to remain silent, they are to consider the effects (positive and negative) of remaining silent versus the effects of sharing information, even though in the end that information may only partially be true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for legal action, don\u0027t make me laugh. If there are [people]\u00A0here that are upset because they got something else than they\u0027ve been told and in sheer anger about that threaten legal action the answer is simple: A game\u0027s development like many things under development is an iterative process where the final result is seldom what is conjured up at first. Everybody has to recognise that.
