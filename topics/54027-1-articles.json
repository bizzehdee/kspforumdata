A couple of carefully placed struts can often help fix that aspect of it. You can watch for it flexing when it\u0027s initially dropped onto the runway, and if you apply pitch/yaw/roll controls while it\u0027s stationary. If you see much flex in either case, that could be the root cause of the problem. The stock Aeris 4A, for example, shows notable flex around the RCS tank, docking port, and IAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI disagree quite strongly with adding reaction wheels to solve stability on the runway during takeoff runs. To me, that suggests that there\u0027s a far more fundamental issue with the structure and/or balance of the plane, if you need extra torque just to hold it steady during the takeoff run. To me, the reaction wheel torque should only really be important once you\u0027re above the altitude range where aerodynamic control surfaces can operate effectively, sized appropriate for control from 30km up to orbit, and in orbit. That\u0027s assuming we\u0027re talking about a modestly sized craft which looks vaguely like a plane, of course. Giant or bizarre craft may well require a more unconventional approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue which is difficult to be certain about, but I became highly suspicious of, is the highly erratic prograde vector which can sometimes be seen on the nav ball when the plane rolls slightly after physics starts, but before you have actually applied power, etc. I can\u0027t be certain, but I think that if you turn on SAS at the wrong moment, while the vector is jumping around, SAS can lock onto some wildly inappropriate vector, and actually drag the plane off trying to follow it. The solution I use is to hold the brakes on, then turn on SAS, apply power, then release brakes. It\u0027s difficult to say with certainty, but I\u0027m pretty sure that holding the brakes on like that has eliminated most random runway excursions on takeoff for me (for craft which are otherwise generally ok for takeoff runs).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-23T02:08:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2013 02:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Murph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeleleMama","CreatedById":187262,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-29T18:10:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u0022788452\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002254027\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221385145526\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002282247\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kielm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2013/11/23 at 2:38 AM, Kielm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had a similar problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll bet it\u0027s a single engine plane with wheels on the wings?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue could be that one of wheels (either the left or right) is not always in contact with the ground.
