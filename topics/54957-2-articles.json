I did notice a few visual bugs however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst a bit of background. I\u0027m using the Real Solar System mod to rescale the KSP system by a factor of 10. So I decided to use it to rearrange these new planets to my liking. I rescaled everything by a factor 10 and placed Sentar in the same orbit as Saturn is IRL. I also put Serious a factor 50 further out and moved some moons to expand the system. Now the Serious system consists of Joker, Ringle (with Inaccesible as a moon) and Skelton.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all worked beautifully. But it seems to have introduced some visual bugs. First of all, planets with clouds (From the Clouds and City Lights mod) have a strange flickering texture, the only exception to this is Skelton for some reason. I suspect the clouds are clipping the surface or something.

Similarly to Laythe, when it was first discovered, it didn\u0027t enter the records because the scientists in charge thought the astronomer was looking at Moho.
