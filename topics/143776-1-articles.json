That is what I would like to see at Laythe, I do understand that Laythe is already close enough to Jool where it\u0027s intense radiation belts wouldn\u0027t cover all of Laythe in Radiation apart from its protective Atmosphere, but I believe Laythe\u0027s atmosphere is thick enough to be moved closer to Jool. Laythe is 1/5 the size of Jool, however moving it closer to Jool will effect Jool\u0027s orbit as it will move Jool a bit as Laythe passes over Jool if Laythe was to be moved to Jool (Which I would love) a lot closer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T13:34:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Laythe is fine where it is...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if you really want it closer to Jool, just use Hyperedit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/34785-113-hyperedit-v1521-june-22-2016-cheat-teleporter-orbitplanet-editor-more/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T14:39:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it should be at about 300km Jovian orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-15T16:35:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think if it were any closer it would be pushing the boundaries of physics a little too much and it couldn\u0027t have formed there, and that\u0027s a little too unrealistic.
