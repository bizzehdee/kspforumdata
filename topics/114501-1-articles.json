It has x4 high-penetration I-beam lances mounted on a smooth 360 traversing turret. For additional defense the turret also features a one-shot \u0022machine gun\u0022 mounted on it\u0027s own 360 rotating bearing. This stock weaponry might even give some BD-armory made tanks a headache. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![PeSoBti.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PeSoBti.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![SzWmU4T.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SzWmU4T.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![VfJPKy5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/VfJPKy5.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ***On the way!***\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![8TDn3ta.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8TDn3ta.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Even Zeke\u0027s stronk replicas are not immune to the power of the dark side.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![00QiQrA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/00QiQrA.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It can pull off stunts too kind of if you are interested in that type of stuff...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n***DOWNLOAD LINK (New 1.0.5 Version): [https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ne39wx0lyt44yr/JTF%20-%20Lynx%20II.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ne39wx0lyt44yr/JTF%20-%20Lynx%20II.craft?dl=0)***\n\n*Firing Instructions:*\n\nOptimal Firing Range is roughly 100M\n\n- Simply unlock the turret by pressing the space-bar and switching between the hull and turret using the bracket [ ] keys.\n- Press 1-4 to fire each individual high penetration I-beam lance. For optimal accuracy press \u0022control here\u0022 from the probe core on the turret of the tank corresponding to the side that is firing and aim at the horizon. The firing order is left-right-left-right. Make sure that this is correct by checking the action groups before usage. **Make sure to have the tank parked while firing for maximum performance.**\n- To use the 1-shot \u0022Machine Gun\u0022 press \u0022decouple\u0022 on the decoupler holding the bearing on top of the turret in place. Then use the bracket [ ] keys to switch to the machine gun. Press \u0022Control from here\u0022 on the probe core on the back of the machine gun. Then simply align the gun with the target and press the space-bar until the projectile is fired.\n\n*Known Bug: Loading Kerbals into the seats of the tank at launch glitch the turret bearing mechanism. If you wish to crew the tank do so after decoupling the turret. The tank is designed for primarily stock installations of KSP.*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-13T15:39:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2017 03:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Jon144**"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T02:00:58Z","Content":"\\*runs to arm calliope\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"RixKillian","CreatedById":145397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T05:46:25Z","Content":"Nice tank, although you might want to raise the turret so it clears the I-beams along the sides; it gets caught on those edges and can\u0027t turn more than about 10 degrees either direction.
