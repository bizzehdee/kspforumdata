I am soo close to orbit but not there yet. Ive been doing delta wing design and I regular non delta wind. Ive go the COM and COL thing pretty much dialed in. My craft are very flyable but \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am lacking experience in on the power side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have just a few small engine questions that I cannot seem to find an answer to. Sorry if these are basic but I need these answers so I can get my SSTO and make it into LKO! Im determined to do this my self so I dont want do dl any craft or anything like that. Im just looking to get some more info so I can destroy some more craft on my journey to orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI notice that people are putting loads of ram air intakes on jet engines. These are the most efficient and I would love to use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this significantly increase the thrust ? Ive tried to add and extra and Im not sure I see a difference. What the purpose ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also seen the intakes put on an Aero Spike engines... Why is this as they run without the intakes ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve been looking for some basic engine tips and tricks but have been able to locate much. Is there a good place for this other than the wiki ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T19:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIntakes can be anywhere, and jets use IntakeAir equally from all intakes. So that\u0027s why they wind up in odd places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJets need IntakeAir and LiquidFuel to run (just like rockets need Oxidizer and LiquidFuel) -- but mostly IntakeAir. They use a certain amount at full throttle; if you don\u0027t have enough intakes for them (because you\u0027re at high altitude where the air is thin), you can throttle back. Or, you can add more intakes. So they do significantly increase thrust, but only because they allow you to maintain full throttle at higher altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"42undead2","CreatedById":47664,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T19:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you see people adding loads of intakes, or most likely stacking them, they try to get as much air (at the highest possible point) to the engine as possible.
