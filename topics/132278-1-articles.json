All tips, no matter how obvious or mundane they may seem, are welcome as long as they are constructive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do use a few mods but right now the only parts mods I use are MRS and SpaceY (waiting out on KW to see what will happen with KSP 1.1). Pricewise the parts are fair to stock parts I feel, comparable parts have pretty much the same pricetags to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am aware that by missing the transfer windows can make huge differences in ship design and costs, which brings me to the next question\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Not every window is the same. Take Moho as an example. The inclination makes for most efficient windows being few and far between (unless you have a tip, of course on how to deal with a 7* inclination costing in the neighbourhood of 2000 dv. Add to that the eccentricity of Moho\u0027s orbit and you get windows that vary greatly in terms of delta v, ship costs and travel time. So, the question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn average, in your experience, would the dv \u0022cost\u0022 be for a trip to Moho, or Eeloo for that matter, and what would you consider \u0022good\u0022 in terms of dv on one hand and travel time on the other, and what price range are we looking at?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.1) What would your never exceed limit on dv or time be, or costs, if you play career mode?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do use the Kerbal Engineer mod for info, RT for commlink fun and automated control and I\u0027ll probably get KOS installed again at some point but I\u0027m reluctant to use MechJeb or similar mods. I\u0027d prefer to do the setup myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that in mind, on to\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) How do you set up for interplanetary transfers? By setting up a node for an encounter not looking at dv or any sort of costs, or is there some good planning ahead in the way you do it? Or do you go all out free form jazz improvising everything knowing everything can be sorted out somehow?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T21:04:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) All in career. I\u0027ve hardly touched sandbox since graduating from the demo (which I played to death at various stages over the last few years).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t find the cost prohibitive at all: I\u0027ve currently finishing off a medium difficulty career, year 10, nearly everywhere visited by Kerbals and 28 million funds in the bank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was lucky for my first visit to Moho - if I remember correctly I sent a probe with an LV-N and four mk1 tanks (two detachable), with a sub-probe with just monoprop and two puffs, without having a very clear idea of how much dv it had. Got a good capture and landed on Moho easily. I\u0027ve since experienced the harsher realities of Moho, so my Kerbal-crewed mission there (ongoing) is going via Eve and has a mining ship included.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince then, I\u0027ve installed KER so I know what my dv is, but I was fine without it until well after my first manned trips to Eve and Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.1) Only thing I can really say is not to try to do too much at once. Build a light-ish mining/ISRU ship that you\u0027re happy with, get used to landing it on the Mun, and you can explore the main three planets (Eve, Duna, Jool) using the same miner to get fuel from moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso - don\u0027t try to bring much of anything back home: light pods, heat shields, kerbals and data only. Leave everything else in orbit or on the ground to be reused by the next crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut a docking port on everything and assemble ad hoc stations, so that any spare fuel and/or electricity generation can be shared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) I use this\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 for approximate dates for transfer windows and as a rough guide to how much dv I\u0027ll need. I certainly don\u0027t try to plot the transfer precisely using any of the information that the site gives. A mid-course correction costing a few m/s is all it takes to arrive exactly where and when you want, once you\u0027re on a decent-ish transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, Moho is a bit of an exception. I\u0027m going via Eve to reduce both the Kerbin escape burn and the Moho capture burn, hopefully. Going by Eve also lets me improve my orbital plane (again, just a cost of a few m/s during the mid-course correction) by choosing exactly where I enter Eve\u0027s SOI. It won\u0027t get it perfect but it doesn\u0027t need to be as long as I cross Moho\u0027s orbit just once at a point where I can choose my arrival time without huge expense. I\u0027d have to come back on the exact cost but I think I budgeted for about 5000 m/s dv per ship. I am sending three ships and they cost between 190k-330k each (iirc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.1) Nothing is really \u0022never exceed\u0022 except for cost and size, because I don\u0027t need it. I\u0027ve played around with the bigger rockets but until now, I have never needed anything bigger than the Skipper for 99% of my builds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) See 2) above. Basically get an approximate date and dv cost, send up rocket, plot a node with approximately that dv cost and drag it around to get a perfectly prograde escape from Kerbin SOI and some sort of encounter*. Then try reducing the dv cost until no enounter is possible, and use that last encounter as the good one. Halfway out (or at the AN or DN, if it is nearish halfway) plot a course correction node to arrive where and when I want to in the target system (i.e., to get a Tylo flyby for dv-free Jool capture, Ike for a cheaper Duna capture, or Eve to set up arrival at Gilly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*edit: this might need a second node placed later for plane-change purposes, of course, but again I will tend to correct this once I\u0027m actually out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-16T21:12:02Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2016 09:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T21:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, heaps thanks for a great post!

The price tag is pretty enormous though, around 1.8 million for a complete rig not counting the necessary rocket/lander.
