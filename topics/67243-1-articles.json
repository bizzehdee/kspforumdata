They fly just like any other rocket, too...it\u0027s just the launch and landing mechanisms that are different.

A no frills spaceplane will have a Mk-1 cockpit, maybe a Reaction Wheel, a Z-1k battery and a pair of unshielded solar panels, its flight equipment and let\u0027s say....a pair of AV-R8 winglets for vertical stabilizers. Landing gear is mass-free, so we won\u0027t worry about it. You\u0027re looking at 6.175 tonnes plus the mass of the flight equipment as your payload mass in space. With a set of flight of equipment added for a light plane - one turbojet, two Mk-1 fuselages, three pairs of swept wings, four small control surfaces, and nine Ram Intakes - adds 3.83 tonnes to that mix. 8 FL-T100 tanks - or a pair of FL-T400s -would give you 2,552.867 m/s of delta-V (2,884.563 actually, since that mass assumes the Mk-1 Fuselages are full and they most certainly will not be once you\u0027ve reached space), and your total craft mass would be just over fourteen tonnes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe is going to be trickier, on account of the higher delta-V requirement - you\u0027re going to want a craft with at least 6,000 m/s of delta-V to it. 6.175 tonnes plus flight equipment...you\u0027ll need three sets of flight equipment (one engine, 2 Mk1 Fuselages, three pairs of swept wings, nine intakes) at 3.73 tonnes each, adding 6.69 tonnes...48 FL-T100s equivalent will get you the fuel you need to get there (6,048.8 m/s of delta-V assuming full tanks) and the craft will have a mass of 44 tonnes.
