I don\u0027t like having to overwrite game files to play certain mods. It should be possible to drop a mod into it\u0027s own folder in a mods folder and let it overwrite official game files with it\u0027s own files, without making users have to reinstall their game to remove a mod or back up game files each time. Rimworld and Starbound both allow this, why can\u0027t KSP? I\u0027m sure other games do too but I can\u0027t think of any other examples right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing with this is an in game mod managing menu, so you can turn mods on or off, and even select the order that they load up in, in case one mod overwrites stuff from another mod. Like if one mod adds water as a resource, and one adds food, 2 seperate mods, they both need to add something to the same official file so they both need to edit that file so you\u0027d need a merge method for that. You need a loading order for mods that might replace one or 2 things in another mod as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fairly sure this may have been suggested before, just wanted to suggest before I forgot and all.
