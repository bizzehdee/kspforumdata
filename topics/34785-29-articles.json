The sound that is made when an airbreathing engine does not have enough air. The engine did not change from airbreathing to closed cycle, since it had not automatically switched when the intake air got too low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo maybe that counts as a bit of a bug for Hyperedit , but again that is not the main cause. And maybe not so much as a bug as an issue that the user should be aware of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Mechjeb, a few days ago, I started using the Utilities option to \u0022Prevent jet flameout\u0022. Well, now I realize that when the jets are in orbit but activated, Mechjeb refuses to allow the throttle to advance even though there are rocket engines that could work. And this only tends to happen when using Hyperedit, as a normal climb to orbit would involve shutting down the jet engines anyway (Well, before I started using that option to prevent flameout, I used action groups to shut down various jets). And the Rapiers change from airbreathing to closedcycle on their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the solution for me is to either deactivate \u0022prevent jet flameout\u0022 in Mechjeb once the airbreathing part of the flight is over, or just have all of the airbreathing engines deactivated (and make sure the the Rapiers are in closedcycle mode).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- George Gassaway\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-24T21:40:12Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2015 09:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GeorgeG\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maxdreamland","CreatedById":100941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T12:16:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erecently i came across a problem with wandering maneuver nodes and created a forum thread to find out about the root cause of this effect. you can find this thread here (the thread describes it in detail and there is also a video of the problem): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110757-why-do-maneuver-nodes-wander-around\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110757-why-do-maneuver-nodes-wander-around\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efollowing post #17 in the mentioned thread it became apparent that the underlying cause of this seems to be HyperEdit.
