(you can opt out completely and choose \u0022indy\u0022 instead for the default career mode). you can also still pick whatever mission flag you want however based on your sponsor choice, the default mission flag is set to that companies logo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what would selecting a sponsor/benefactor do for you? well for starters, it would change how career mode progresses. For example, picking a more greedy company (interested in profits over exploration) would give you less starting money (but more starting science since they\u0027re a large well formed company) and various contracts would give overall less or more payout (noticeably but not so much as to make things impossible : i.e. 5% less/more or something to that effect) . On top of that the company you pick would also dictate your tech tree to some extent, where the more greedy company will charge more for unlocking of parts (but less for actually using them due to production connections) and you\u0027ll start off with more nodes unlocked than just the first few. also there would be an option for a custom company (where you could make your own sponsor which would be like the way things are now when you set up career mode (all those settings) but its saved as a future preset and you can set your default flag, and business practices ect ect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecompanies can even have \u0027traits\u0027 which give them/you special effects durring game play. for example, this greedy company could have the (aforementioned) connections trait thus reducing all build costs by, say 15%. things like that i think would be super cool. and you could catagorize each of the companies, so like, easy/medium/hard ect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Equite a few other factors can be modified with this idea but that\u0027s basically it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust a thought i had. what do you all think? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T09:01:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 09:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ackley14\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T09:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I choose O.M.B., do I get more ejection force with a chance of exploding my crafts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ackley14","CreatedById":125593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T20:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf I choose O.M.B., do I get more ejection force with a chance of exploding my crafts?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehahaha the \u0022explosive\u0022 trait X3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T20:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting idea. Would companies be based solely on their level of greed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this idea would be more interesting if sponsor companies were differentiated by areas of expertise rather than their level of greed. There might be some in-game effects like a mining company might boost a drills output or make parts handle heat better or something. But the biggest difference companies would have would be the organization of the tech tree (great idea by you!) and the type/availability of contracts. Maybe one company would rearrange the tech tree to start you off with probes (a frequently requested feature). Maybe one company would make aircraft parts easier to research.

If i took the time to learn i bet i could get something put togeather. maybe using the community tech tree mod as a base or something like that lol. didn\u0027t think of that! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
