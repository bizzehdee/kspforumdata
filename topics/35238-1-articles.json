The thing is, when i decouple the side SRBs, the whole craft goes into an unrecoverable engine over nose spin. This usually results in both my astronauts being killed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I am using KW rocketry, Tiberdyne space shuttle system, Taverios pizza and aerospace and mk3 parts expansion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s15.postimg.org/sml59qohn/screenshot8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s7.postimg.org/rkguged8b/screenshot9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpt_nosh","CreatedById":67129,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T06:28:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see the problem in the center of mass not being aligned with the center of thrust in this case.

You have to find a way to counterbalance this :l\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkipSpikowski","CreatedById":57209,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T08:00:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy advice is to not use SRB\u0027s. They look cool and authentic, but just like the real space shuttle, they leave no room for error. Run liquids, you can control them better and you can cut their throttle and decouple them with an action group. It is much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steffen_anywhere","CreatedById":64915,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T10:40:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been designing a realistic space shuttle recently using KW Rocketry and Stock parts. Though still in testing, it works quite well already (achieved suborbital flight with apoapsis at 100km), but is a pain in the arse to fly. I\u0027m actually using small thrusters to change/control attitude with the external fuel tank on the shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do in fact use SRBs, an assembly of a huge and a smaller one each, to create thrust in the right direction (each booster produces 1100kN, as you might guess, I have two of them)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle itself has 1050kN of thrust on the main engines. This is just wnough to uave a thrust to weight ratio of above one after booster separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re interested in pictures or the craft file of my shuttle just tell me (pictures will be more helpful, trust me, the prelaunch protocol is looong, and even MechJeb won\u0027t fly it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways just ask for more help as needed...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-29T11:19:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2013 11:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by steffen_anywhere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
