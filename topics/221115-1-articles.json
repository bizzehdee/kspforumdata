I thought I would make one because of this interesting news.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://x.com/fab_hinz/status/1732356833161945249?s=46\u0026amp;t=Jd73T2beq0JLNtwTy1uR5A\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://x.com/fab_hinz/status/1732356833161945249?s=46\u0026amp;t=Jd73T2beq0JLNtwTy1uR5A\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey launched a 500 kilogram \u201Cbio capsule\u201D into space on a Scud derived launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIran wants to send a man into space as the end goal of this project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Iranian-Space-Agency-completed-conceptua\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002269.63\u0022 height=\u0022557\u0022 width=\u0022800\u0022 src=\u0022https://spacewatch.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Iranian-Space-Agency-completed-conceptual-design-of-manned-spacecraft.-Credit-Iranian-Space-Agency.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis project began in 2010 with the launch of numerous live animals. This capsule mock-up was also displayed some time early in the decade. The program basically came to a halt in 2013 due to lack of funds and the lack of interest in space from the new President. But then the government changed in 2021. Now the space program has been reportedly reinvigorated. Iranian officials have claimed they will launch a man into space by 2029.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome Western observers have ridiculed it, but the Tweet thread above states the author\u2019s belief that when looked at without any \u201CIranian lense\u201D the trajectory of the program isn\u2019t that far off from any other space project, and therefore is not to be belittled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be noted China also showed off mock-ups of crewed spacecraft in 1980. It took them 25 years to actually put a man into space, but they did it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow for a little background on Iran\u2019s space activities. Their first orbital launch was in 2009, but for years their satellites were plagued by some issue that caused the satellites to decay after 1-2 months. It wouldn\u2019t be until 2020 that a satellite stayed in orbit for an entire year. Since then, Iran has launched another satellite, in September 2023. Both these successful satellites were developed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the Iranian Space Agency (ISA) built its own satellite, but it was launched on a Soyuz from Baikonur in August 2022. It continues to operate well as well. All three satellites are imagery reconnaissance satellites. The IRGC ones have very low resolutions of as much as 400 meters, while the details of the ISA one are classified, but it is claimed to have \u201Chigh resolution\u201D. It should be noted the ISA satellite was designed with help from Russia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy thinking on it is this: if the 1950s impoverished Soviet Union could launch a man into space, it\u2019s not that far fetched for Iran, with economic support from Russia and China, to do so either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope they can pull it off. It\u2019d be quite something to see a smaller (compared to the main crewed space superpowers) pull off an indigenous crewed space launch capability, even if it was only on par with Vostok or Mercury flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
