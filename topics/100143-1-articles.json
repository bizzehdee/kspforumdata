I\u0027ve tried to get help about it but nobody has any clue what\u0027s going on with it.\n\nI also get it when recovering a vessel too. Unfortunately, there seems to be absolutely no answers as to why, other than a memory leak or something.\n\nYou also have a bunch of null reference errors related to the Procedural Parts mod (I think), may want to look into that, although it doesn\u0027t seem responsible for the crash."},{"CreatedByName":"Nicklas","CreatedById":136480,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T12:02:31Z","Content":"Yes I also saw that Mono part, not that I know what it is.. Mine also crash when recover, it\u0027s like that 4.-5, time i switch between the VAB -\u003E Space center or Launchpad -\u003E VAB, or Recover. Its playable, if I remember to make saves..

Lowering graphics quality a little may also help, as would setting antialiasing to 2x or 4x. If you use steam to launch it, you can put -force-OpenGL in it, which seems to help some."}]}
