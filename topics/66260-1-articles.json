No, i am not joking; it will also take advantage of the highest point on Eve, which is nearby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFLIGHT PLAN:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft is assembled in Kerbin Orbit and consists of a Interplanetary Transfer Propulsion Module (IPM), Interplanetary Transfer Habitat (ITH), a Eve Landing/Surface Module (EL/SM), an Atmospheric Transport Airship (ATA), an Underwater Exploration Vehicle (UEV) and an Eve Ascent Vehicle (EAV). The crew consists of 8 people which are brought to the ship using an orbital transport vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft travels to Eve with several Gravity Assists and aerobrakes into a 150x150 orbit. 6 people board the EL/SM, which also carries the EAV, ATA and UEV. A precision landing brings them onto the top of the highest mountain on Eve. After the flags are planted and surface studies are conducted, UEV is lifted up by the ATA airship (which carries 3 out of the 6 surface crew.). The UEV is landed safely on water above the deepest point on Eve (which is located near the highest mountain making transport easy), and 2 kerbals board it, travelling to the deepest point and performing experiments which consists of leaving a permanent experiment platform there. After return to the surface, the UEV is discarded on water to use with future missions and the ATA transports all three back to the main outpost, where all 6 landing crew board the EAV, which is brought with the ATA to it\u0027s service ceiling (more than 25.000 meters), where the ATA is discarded and the EAV travels back to the main ship, after which it is discarded. The ship returns to Kerbin, again using gravity assists and an aerobrake, and the crew are again retrieved by OTV\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Goal is to be the first KSP player to reach the deepest point on Eve.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:right;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMedwedianPresident\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LtKraftKrackers","CreatedById":67940,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T21:00:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok? do it then.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T02:52:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds neat but how do you get yo the bottom of the ocean?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedwedianPresident","CreatedById":12212,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T06:47:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022robopilot99\u0022 data-cite=\u0022robopilot99\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESounds neat but how do you get yo the bottom of the ocean?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use Hooligan Labs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daddy Cecil","CreatedById":59121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T16:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t your ship die when you go below 600m of water (or whatever liquid is in Eve\u0027s oceans)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedwedianPresident","CreatedById":12212,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T18:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Daddy Cecil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Daddy Cecil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoesn\u0027t your ship die when you go below 600m of water (or whatever liquid is in Eve\u0027s oceans)?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will ask the owner of HL on how to hack it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
