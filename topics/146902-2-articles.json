Sounds like you\u0027re definitely going through a rough patch and, without wishing to pry too deeply, is there anyone you can talk to in confidence about some of it? It might help a bit. Having known a couple of people with depression, I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E going to bandy that diagnosis around without knowing exactly what\u0027s going on\u00A0but you do seem to be going through something a bit more serious than regular teenage angst.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck with it and with finding a way out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the perils of being the ideas guy - there are situations where this can be invaluable and situations where, as you\u0027ve noted, people just aren\u0027t interested. Troubleshooting specific problems, brainstorming for new directions to approaching a given problem - or finding new problems to solve - for those kinds of situations, having an idea guy around is exactly what you want. Likewise,\u00A0there are many situations where you need \u0027the vision guy\u0027 as well as \u0027the details guy\u0027 to get anything done. In my opinion though \u0027the vision guy\u0027 needs to be able to articulate how to \u003Cem\u003Eimplement\u003C/em\u003E that vision, at least to some extent. Do this well and it\u0027s called a strategy - and there are plenty of opportunities for strategic thinkers. Do it badly and it\u0027s just a wishlist of stuff for other people to do, which isn\u0027t particularly helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a boss like that in one job - he had\u00A0a \u0027strategy\u0027 for everything but offered little guidance on how to implement them. With a different team it might have worked. Me - I just felt woefully out of my depth and unsure what the flarp I was supposed to be doing. Not one of my more successful career moves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing the ideas guy can also involve knowing when to push your own ideas and knowing when to sit back and go with other people\u0027s ideas. Sometimes you\u0027ll find that people will talk themselves around to your way of looking at things anyway and sometimes a gentle nudge here or there can be more useful than insisting that people listen to you - cos you\u0027re the idea guy dammit! I work with a couple of very distinguished academics who work very much like that. Plant the idea, let them circle around it a couple of times and by and large they\u0027ll get where you want them to go. It takes a bit of patience (and can lead to some interminable meetings) but it does work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally - being the ideas guy in a creative context can be extremely difficult partly because creative folks aren\u0027t generally short of their own ideas and partly because the initial \u0027big picture\u0027 idea is only the start of the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake writing for example. I\u0027ve had a great idea for a story - and I can maybe set that idea down in a paragraph or two, maybe a list of bullet points. Converting that outline into enough of a plot to sustain a story, let alone figuring out the page by page detail of characters and their actions that make up that story, requires a lot \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E ideas and a \u003Cem\u003Elot \u003C/em\u003Emore work.

Sounds like you\u0027re definitely going through a rough patch and, without wishing to pry too deeply, is there anyone you can talk to in confidence about some of it? It might help a bit. Having known a couple of people with depression, I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E going to bandy that diagnosis around without knowing exactly what\u0027s going on\u00A0but you do seem to be going through something a bit more serious than regular teenage angst.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck with it and with finding a way out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the perils of being the ideas guy - there are situations where this can be invaluable and situations where, as you\u0027ve noted, people just aren\u0027t interested. Troubleshooting specific problems, brainstorming for new directions to approaching a given problem - or finding new problems to solve - for those kinds of situations, having an idea guy around is exactly what you want. Likewise,\u00A0there are many situations where you need \u0027the vision guy\u0027 as well as \u0027the details guy\u0027 to get anything done. In my opinion though \u0027the vision guy\u0027 needs to be able to articulate how to \u003Cem\u003Eimplement\u003C/em\u003E that vision, at least to some extent. Do this well and it\u0027s called a strategy - and there are plenty of opportunities for strategic thinkers. Do it badly and it\u0027s just a wishlist of stuff for other people to do, which isn\u0027t particularly helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a boss like that in one job - he had\u00A0a \u0027strategy\u0027 for everything but offered little guidance on how to implement them. With a different team it might have worked. Me - I just felt woefully out of my depth and unsure what the flarp I was supposed to be doing. Not one of my more successful career moves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing the ideas guy can also involve knowing when to push your own ideas and knowing when to sit back and go with other people\u0027s ideas. Sometimes you\u0027ll find that people will talk themselves around to your way of looking at things anyway and sometimes a gentle nudge here or there can be more useful than insisting that people listen to you - cos you\u0027re the idea guy dammit! I work with a couple of very distinguished academics who work very much like that. Plant the idea, let them circle around it a couple of times and by and large they\u0027ll get where you want them to go. It takes a bit of patience (and can lead to some interminable meetings) but it does work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally - being the ideas guy in a creative context can be extremely difficult partly because creative folks aren\u0027t generally short of their own ideas and partly because the initial \u0027big picture\u0027 idea is only the start of the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake writing for example. I\u0027ve had a great idea for a story - and I can maybe set that idea down in a paragraph or two, maybe a list of bullet points. Converting that outline into enough of a plot to sustain a story, let alone figuring out the page by page detail of characters and their actions that make up that story, requires a lot \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E ideas and a \u003Cem\u003Elot \u003C/em\u003Emore work. People rarely take kindly to\u00A0suggestions from other people (however well intentioned)\u00A0that result in more work for them personally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen this a couple of times over in the Fanworks forum, where people have thrown out a top level idea for a story for somebody else to write. I can\u0027t speak for everyone of course but my own response to that sort of suggestion would be a more-or-less polite variation on the theme of \u0027nice idea - why don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E go away and write about that.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeck you \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E this - and I know you do because you\u0027ve already told us about it.\u00A0You \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E how hard it is to get an idea out of your head and into a tangible form, let alone a tangible form that\u0027s anywhere near as good\u00A0as you imagined it in your head.

tearing-your-hair-out, why-the-hell-doesn\u0027t-this-damn-thing-work debugging and analysis.\u00A0 The kind of thing where you spend a whole frickin\u0027 day banging your head against some intractable problem, and when you finally find the answer it turns out to be some stupid one-line mistake in your code, which your eyeballs just skated over the first 99 times you reviewed it, and which could have been easily solved in thirty seconds if you had just noticed it sooner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s not just when you\u0027re starting out.\u00A0 That\u0027s what

eventually, after years of hard work.\u00A0 But initially?\u00A0 No, the payoff in the early phases is that after you\u0027ve gone through all that toil and sweat, you produce a childish scrawl of a

anyone who has used more than one programming language quickly observes, is that there is generally very little that differentiates programming languages.\u00A0 Programming is more about understanding paradigms than understanding looping structures.\u00A0 Between the 5 or 6 languages I\u0027ve dabbled in from the 8-bit era to the present day the major difference between them I\u0027ve noticed is going from procedural to object-oriented code, which still isn\u0027t very different when it comes right down to it, it just requires thinking about your code a little differently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI pretty much wasted a year of my life on a course which purported to teach web-design back in the late 90\u0027s. \u00A0I\u0027d have been far better

The next year I looked at the stuff the next batch of students were putting up on the college webpage, and I kid you not, half of them were uploading their images in bitmap format.\u00A0 My point is, be very careful what you choose to spend your time studying, and where you choose to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to get into games programming, you would be far better suited
