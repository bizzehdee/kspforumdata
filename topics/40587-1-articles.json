I\u0027ll be updating this thread each step of the way. I have some mods installed and some extra parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods that I\u0027ll be using the most include mechJeb 2.0, Quantum Struts once I get into Station Construction and some other odds and ends which I\u0027ll mention as I add/use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my humble start... I have never really explored Kerbin from the air before so I thought I\u0027d start there. I built a airplane and named it Kerbin Explorer 1. It features 8 terbofan Engine S (4 on each wing) and a Central TurboJet Engine M. Top speeds reached so far in my initial tests of it was around 400 m/s at an altitude of 8,000 meters. It flys like a charm so far. Very smooth and when your ready to come in for a landing you can cut all power to the engines and just glide in for a smooth landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for the first test once I knew that it would fly and land safely I took off from the run way at KSC and headed out over the ocean. I was planning on just seeing how far I could take her. However after I had been going for a while I come across a small Island that peeked my Interest. I lined my self up with the Island and reduced power to about 50% to start slowing my self down. Once I reduced speed some and it was clear I would have enough speed to safely make it to the Island I cut all power to the engines and started gliding in for the landing. I landed safely and took the pilot out for a EVA where I took the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.riseofheroesmmo.com/screenshot8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.riseofheroesmmo.com/screenshot9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then got him back in and went to take off however this time I had less then a successful take off as a result of the less then ideal take off area that the Island provided:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.riseofheroesmmo.com/screenshot10.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot10.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome how the cockpit survived the massive explosion from all the unused fuel and thankfully no Kerbals were harmed (Or atleast killed) in this test!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo give me some ideas on what I should do after I spend some time exploring Kerbin and I\u0027ll make this into a sort of Let\u0027s play!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JamesProctor","CreatedById":76869,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T05:29:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I decided to move forward and start preparing to launch a remote Space Program which will pave the way for Kerbals to go beyond LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Launch of a 250 km ComSat (ComSat 1) was successful and the brave team of Kerbanauts who put it into orbit successfully deorbited and landed safely back with in 5km of KSC where they are now waiting to be picked up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComSat 2 meanwhile is sitting atop it\u0027s rocket along with another Brave team of 3 Kerbanauts on the Launch pad waiting for it\u0027s launch.
