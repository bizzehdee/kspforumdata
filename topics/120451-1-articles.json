If the plane cockpit had higher mass, it would be EVEN MORE difficult to have an aesthetic delta-wing at the back, due to the CoM moving forward. What I\u0027d like is the Mk 1-2 being more ugile, and long-term, with interplanetary focus on the mk-1-2, and orbital focus on the mk-3. Once we\u0027ll have movement inside vehicles, better docking and airlock abilities for the mk-1-2. Once we\u0027ll have life support, interplanetary LS-capability for the mk-1-2, while orbital for the mk-3. But until than, Insane durability for the mk-1-2! No heatshields needed for interplanetary return!! Or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
