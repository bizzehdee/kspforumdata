With deadly reentry I was able to tell if parts were heating up in VV. I can imagine that this is because 1.0 and Deadly Reentry measure heating effects differently.\n\nSo... is VV planing on resolving this or should I go ahead and set the Reentry heat in KSP to 0 and use deadly reentry instead?"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T01:33:35Z","Content":"Moved to General Add-On Affairs. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
