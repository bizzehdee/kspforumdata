Also, engines have worse ISP the lower you are in the atmoshpere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust think about it like this, to get to LKO you need roughly 4500 m/s of dV if I remember correctly (I don\u0027t use stock aero so I\u0027m not sure) however, orbital velocity in LKO is only ~2km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u0026gt; ~50% losses\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this depends largely on how efficient your staging is, and more importantly your ascent profile. As soon as you exceed terminal velocity your drag losses go through the roof. If your design is suboptimal [to low L/D] and you have to reach very high speeds while still fairly low in the atmosphere you will loose even more due to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can turn off engines and still have enough thrust you have too many engines, they way a lot and if you are not running them at 100% thrust, some fraction (depending on thrust levels) is dead weight which means more drag and more gravity losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps a little, if not it would help us help you if you could give us some more info about your ascent profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T19:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@TheXRuler: He\u0027s using Realism Overhaul. Based on the dV numbers he\u0027s quoting, that also includes FAR and Real Solar System. So he needs ~10 km/s dV into low Earth orbit - by kerosene engine numbers - out of which about a quarter will be lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@jrodriguez: is that 12.5 km/s dV just vacuum dV, or atmospheric? If you\u0027re running with pure hydrogen engines, you\u0027re going to have high atmospheric losses, because atmospheric performance of hydrogen engines is very bad. They go from 450s Isp down to 350s or something, whereas a kerosene engine would only drop from 330s to 300s or thereabouts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, your vacuum dV number with kerosene engines is a close enough approximation that you can handwave the lower atmospheric Isp away and still make it to orbit, but with hydrogen engines the vacuum dV number is in no way, shape or form usable as a number for planning ascents out of an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering how close you are to orbital velocity - you should need about 7500 m/s, and you make 6900 - I wager that a large chunk of your \u0022missing\u0022 dV is simply lost because your engines have so much Isp loss at liftoff. A good indicator for this: most of your dV disappears early on, while late in the flight you pretty much get what you think you should get. By then, the atmosphere is gone and your hydrogen engines run at full efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is, incidentally, why pure hydrogen rockets are very unpopular IRL. In fact, there\u0027s only one single pure hydrogen rocket that\u0027s flying right now: the Delta IV Heavy. And even the launch provider itself calls it overpriced and inefficient and says that they will never repeat that particular experiment. The rocket only still flies today because there\u0027s no alternative to replace it with. All other hydrogen rockets have solid rocket boosters that do the majority of the lifting off the pad (Space Shuttle, Ariane 5, Delta IV medium, H-IIA etc). The famous Saturn V was all hydrogen... except the first stage, which was kerosene in order to give it a kick into the regions were hydrogen was efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T19:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I wasn\u0027t aware that RO uses RSS.

With that kind of atmospheric dV you should be set, technically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your dV is evaporating at the end of ascent... my first impulse would be to say that one or more of the engines you\u0027re running at that point is occluded by something and is not generating thrust, only consuming fuel. You say that you start with all engines running and then turn them off one by one to maintain acceleration. If you have at least 2 still running by the time you run out of duel, then one of them might not be generating thrust.

Can you describe when ambient does show as -200C?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi Nathan, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFind below some screenshots with the ambient temp at -200 C. As you can see there is a extreme temp change between 185km and 198km from -200C to -1.15C. However, I\u0027m not sure this can be related with my delta-v problem. Also you can see there that my speed is about 4100 m/s and my remaining dV is about 4277m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Du6HNLC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Du6HNLC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xj0b9xH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xj0b9xH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T06:09:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 06:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jrodriguez\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T20:22:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I see what\u0027s going on I guess--it\u0027s switching to a \u0022vacuum\u0022 temperature, the air is no longer shielding you from solar radiation.
