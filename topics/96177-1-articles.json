I have tried doing so by animating the location of the game objects you use to define them in Unity, but in the game the nodes stay put. I can move the part mesh around in the game using this method, but nodes do not budge. I think I remember a mod that does something like this, though I cannot remember which one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a part with a wide scaling range using TweakScale, but the nodes get in the way on the smaller scales, as nodes only scale to size 0 and do not become any smaller after that. Turning them off would be a solution, though there might be other solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-10T03:06:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2015 03:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T04:17:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJSIPartUtilities does it.

One issue is that when you turn the nodes off, then scale, then toggle them back on the nodes are on the unscaled position. If you have any ideas on how to fix that they would be more than welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize I am doing things backwards, but can you think of any other solution to fix the nodes overlapping the whole part when the part scales too small? The nodes seem to scale fine, but stop scaling when the node size goes under size 0. I guess that is the smallest node size available in general.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-10T08:38:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2015 08:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
