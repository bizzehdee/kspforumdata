You need to get a feel for how long it takes to slow down enough for a controlled landing, how long ahead of the intended landing spot you need to start your burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a low orbit around Moho, you\u0027ll be going\u00A0 around 800 m/s. That\u0027s horizontal speed you need to kill with the burn. You will also gain some vertical speed purely from gravity alone, which also needs to be countered - the longer you \u0027hover\u0027, the more you need to burn. Don\u0027t underestimate this: on three Ants this is likely to take a burn of 2-3 mins (!). That whole time you\u0027ll be falling, so don\u0027t start from too low an orbit or gravity will have you before you even had the chance to kill your orbital speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoing this with 840-870 m/s would require picking a flat area and executing a near to perfect suicide burn with a high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E craft. I would not recommend it if you\u0027ve never done it before; even the 950 m/s suggested is likely on the low side. I can\u0027t stress enough my first recommendation above - try it out a few times and you\u0027ll get a better idea of how much you may need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224136674\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208308\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653387457\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple more tips: first, you don\u0027t need landing legs.

I do agree with not needing batteries. In fact, you can do without that 0.625m reaction wheel too - the HECS2 includes a strong reaction wheel as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will however need a good antenna, or a strong relay in high polar position to keep line of sight with both your probe and Kerbin, or you risk losing control at the wrong moment (assuming you play with CommNet and requiring connection for control).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
