Are all competitors going to be streaming at the same time? Are we supposed to pull up 10 or more different streaming windows in order to watch all the competitors?

Have them scheduled and run them back to back, so pair/group 1 has an hour, then group 2, then group 3 for a three hour max session. This could even take care of the time zone issue for some if you had more than one session. The final champion could be either the best time out of any session, or a finals competition with the winner from each group plus an unannounced twist or additional requirement to change it up.
