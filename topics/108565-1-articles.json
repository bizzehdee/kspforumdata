This has been tested in vanilla 1.0.0 and 1.0.2 downloaded directly from the kerbal store. \n\nI\u0027ve got no mods installed at all - it\u0027s all vanilla. \n\nBut, to the problems:\n\nFirst, when a vehicle is controlles by an OKTO, the breaks of the Rovemax do not seem to function at all. Whether they are applied or not does not make any difference - the rover just keeps going. The only way to stop seems to be deliberately going in the other direction. Naturally, since the breaks do not apply, stopping on a slope is also not possible - the breaks simply do not function. I checked the break torque (set to maximum), there is enough energy and the vehicle drives fine otherwise. Also, tests on the runway at kerbin seem to confirm this with the same build just having deployed. I can upload the design if needed. \n\nSecond, when driving the vehicle in pshysical time warp everything works fine. Drive it for about 30 seconds on 2x or 3x timewarp (just straight) and then apply the breaks. With a normal MK1 cockpit, that acctually works (hooray for Jebediah, he found the breaks), but the motors on the Rovemax do not stop using power. With the handbrake i\u0027m able to come to a complete stop, but the tires each still suck 0.1 energy - constantly. Furthermore, if i loosen the handbreak the rover will start accelerating again without me doing anything. No SAS, no key press, nothing. Just loosen the handbreak and watch it going forward all by itself.\n\nFurthermore, if the constant energy drain happens and there are RCS on the rover, it will also be constantly applied in the pitch down direction (W) - as that is the same as forward for the wheels. That is very annoying when driving a rover on minimus, as that launches pretty much any rover into a spin of death. Even when coming to a full stop (very hard to do without breaks) on a flat surface and then just turning on the RCS \u00AE and not pressing any other button, the rover immediatly launches itself into a spin. The only fix i have found so far is to also apply SAS at the same time, but that constantly burns monopropellant/Fuel for no good reason. When quiting the game (it doesn\u0027t work when going to the space center or the main menu) and restarting it, the behavior is back to normal, until driven in physical time warp. \n\nWhile this is not that much of a problem on minimus (i can use hoppers there - just have to change my designs), this will be a problem if i deploy a mobile lab/base to say, Duna or Eve. Fuel is much more expensive to get there, and having to restart the game every time the lab drives somewhere is kind of... not optimal.\n\nThanks for reading this and any suggestions/help you can provide."},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T11:38:43Z","Content":"Your first issue - very weak brakes - is known and has been reported. The only workaround I know of is to never right click the wheels, in editor or flight.\n\nEDIT: There may be a way to fix your wheels by editing the persistence file and/or the craft file, if you have them it would be great if you could upload them.\n\nYour second issue sounds like you were holding down alt (for physical timewarp) while pressing W (for rover wheels forward), this engages trim (as does any alt \u002B rotation key), you can tell by leaving your hands off the controls and disabling SAS and looking at the PYR indicator in the bottom left. If the pitch indicator is off the centre, you have trimmed.\n\nYou can solve this by pressing alt\u002Bx, which resets trim.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T11:44:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 11:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Supernovy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fabraxias","CreatedById":143632,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T14:29:14Z","Content":"Thanks for the quick answer. That explains the behaviour i was seeing. By the way, is that trim function documented anywhere, as i have never heard neither experienced this before (or did not notice it). \n\nAs for the wheels - i\u0027ll see if i can figure out how to fix them. If i do manage it, i\u0027ll post the fix.\n\nThanks again"}]}
