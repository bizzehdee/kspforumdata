Anyways...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESymmetry mode in SPH is usually the more logical \u0027planar\u0027 way - so if I try to attach a wing to the upper part of a palne, the \u0027mirrored\u0027 wing goes to the upper part on the other side. But sometimes it snaps the parts by axial symmetry, like it happens in the VAB - so in the above example, one of the wings will be placed higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you know what causes the switch?

You can try pressing \u0027F\u0027 which is supposed to cause symmetry to affect the part you are hovering over and tell it that symmetry is for this part. Then select symmetry using \u0027R\u0027 and place your part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have found that does work on occasion but on numerous occasions I have had to abandon the craft and start another from scratch.

After you get the the placement spot you want, press R as Gaarst suggests to switch symmetry modes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s really the only symmetry rule, is that symmetry will switch to match whatever your mouse is touching (unless it\u0027s a single part). In the SPH, parts placed without symmetry (just a single part) default to holding Radial symmetry. So if later you remove some parts, turn on symmetry, and place those parts, they will all default to Radial and you can\u0027t switch it back. Sometimes that can cause a problem. Something to be aware of if you like to build one wing at a time, then remove and attach with symmetry later. This can usually be avoided by building both wings in symmetry at the same time, even if you want to pull it off and put it back on later, because the symmetric relationships will be correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
