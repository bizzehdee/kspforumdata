Noticeably, when moving at extremely high velocity ex. on an orbit taking the player\u0027s ship close to the Sun, the player\u0027s orbit would visibly change due to intense Kraken-induced acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKrakensbane significantly reduced phantom forces but did not remove them entirely. Physics errors can still be magnified, and even controlled, by building certain assemblies. This is the basis of the Kraken Drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse and \u0022operating modes\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince Kraken drives are usually built using some assemblage of landing legs or other moving part (ex. aircraft gears) tilted so as to clip back into the vessel when extended, they can usually be toggled on and off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKraken Drives seem to have two modes of operation: Low-, and high-velocity, with the presence of atmosphere as a possible third variable. At low velocities, below ~800m/s in the vicinity of Kerbin, many K-Drives will accelerate their vessel to a constant velocity that tends to be in the range of 0-5m/s. Above 800m/s over Kerbin, many K-drives will begin to exert constant acceleration on a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis discrepancy between operating velocities can be dangerous to vessels attempting to slow down using a K-Drive. If the vessel falls below the cutoff velocity, but is moving much faster than \u0022low velocity\u0022, activating the K-Drive can make the drive try to slow itself to low velocity, instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, some K-Drives seem to serve as anchors, holding the vessel fixed to a position relative to the parent body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertain K-Drives seem to function differently in atmosphere as well as, or rather than, switching modes based on velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is as yet no sure method for building a Kraken Drive. Performance can vary depending on the precise placement of parts, and may depend on hardware specifications, although this is by no means certain.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is known is that K-Drives are usually constructed out of some moving parts ex. legs or wheels, and some structural parts, as well as reaction wheels. Legs and wheels are usually arranged in such a way that they will clip into other parts of the spaceship when extended. This can be seen in many K-Drive threads.[2][3][4]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythic_fci","CreatedById":58577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-02T01:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlrighty, here\u0027s something I posted on it\u0027s own thread...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Hermes Kraken-Drive Light Spacecraft\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kl78ZC0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Kl78ZC0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt a mere 59 parts, it\u0027s potato computer friendly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RRIG0ij.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RRIG0ij.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe K-Drive is active here.
