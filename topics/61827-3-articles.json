The tuple of 3 numbers in a Euler Rotation (which kOS calls a \u0022Direction\u0022) instead of being x,y,z coordinates are actually rotation angles in degrees. The exact type of rotation is badly documented and it takes a lot of trial and error to work it out (which is why they\u0027re a pain to work with.

It also can\u0027t execute any arbitrary expression in fixed time. You cannot execute an expression consisting of 10 math operators and one consisting of 2 math operators in the same fixed time as each other. These differences make trying to use terminology humans developed for real world computers break when you try to apply them to kOS. The differences are large enough to warrant using new terms for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to get this on topic about the kOS mod, I suspect this is part of why kOS bogs down KSP and makes it stutter. kOS is pretending that its simulated computer executes things in constant time that on the underlying computer take vastly differing amounts of time. When the next batch of 5 operations that it wants to finish in the next timeslice actually take longer than the timeslice KSP expects a mod to finish its callback hook in, KSP has to pause simulation waiting for the mod to finish. So thus the simulation\u0027s clock will claim kOS is constant time when in reality it\u0027s not. If the algorithm was changed to not always execute the same number of fixed instructions per callback and instead watch how long they\u0027re taking, and stop when it\u0027s running out of time for this particular slice (thus executing a varying number of instructions per slice), that might help.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-04T03:35:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2014 03:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agathorn","CreatedById":99662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T03:34:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Camacha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Camacha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: sorry, this was meant to go in Agathorn\u0027s thread, but it illustrates the problem nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOL well FYI there aren\u0027t two threads, just one is a release thread and one is a development thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T03:37:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Agathorn\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Agathorn\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELOL well FYI there aren\u0027t two threads, just one is a release thread and one is a development thread.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a separate development thread?
