The problem is that the Unity API is not threadsafe, meaning you can\u0027t split the *same* process over multiple different threads, potentially across multiple cores. All the physics calculations in KSP are not done in the same thread, but what is slowing it down is that one big physics calculation cannot be split into multiple small segments. This is killing KSP because orbital calcs are a very huge part of the deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpgrading to Unity 5 won\u0027t magically split everything. Unity 5 introduces a threadsafe API, but it\u0027s not a magic button you press on that fixes everything. Once you have the threadsafe API, you need to exploit it. That means going back over aaaallll the code, seeing what you can split into threads, and then do it. That can be a very long process, and threaded coding can be very complex and confusing.
