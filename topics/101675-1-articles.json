For example my capital ships have a black sheen, but sometimes I might not want that. Is it possible to make something that will add to the part the ability to use one texture, or another? \n\nI think (if it doesnt already exist) that this would be an exceptionally useful mod that could see a lot of application outside of what I want to use it for. Say another dev makes a part pack where you can switch which colors the parts are, or how they look. \n\nThanks in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T15:21:20Z","Content":"If your talking about the whole texture you need Firespitter plugin it has a MODULE FStextureSwitch2 you can setup.\n\nEDIT- Here is a mod that using it and you can see how to set it up.
