For example my capital ships have a black sheen, but sometimes I might not want that. Is it possible to make something that will add to the part the ability to use one texture, or another? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think (if it doesnt already exist) that this would be an exceptionally useful mod that could see a lot of application outside of what I want to use it for. Say another dev makes a part pack where you can switch which colors the parts are, or how they look. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T15:21:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your talking about the whole texture you need Firespitter plugin it has a MODULE FStextureSwitch2 you can setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT- Here is a mod that using it and you can see how to set it up. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100984-0-25-NEBULA-space-engineering-Decals-Update!-Quality-fix-more?p=1557499#post1557499\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100984-0-25-NEBULA-space-engineering-Decals-Update!-Quality-fix-more?p=1557499#post1557499\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T15:29:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 03:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mecripp2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T15:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MeCripp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MeCripp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf your talking about the whole texture you need Firespitter plugin it has a MODULE FStextureSwitch2 you can setup.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this were Google\u002B (and, yes, I do use Google\u002B), then \u002B1 this comment!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T17:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sampa\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sampa\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf this were Google\u002B (and, yes, I do use Google\u002B), then \u002B1 this comment!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a little \u0022add reputation\u0022 button in the lower left of the comment which does exactly that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HlS9SZS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HlS9SZS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T17:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah, I was simply using a figure of speech with that, I was well aquainted with that rep button!
