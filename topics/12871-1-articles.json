Its under construction at the moment since im adding movable wings to make it a real tomcat. this one is fixed wing. however i have added retractable landing gear.

Working on KSP .15 update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: attached new picture to show what you are downloading. I had to dumb this down a lot but it does fly and pretty damn good. comes with sas. this isnt as pretty and does not having movable wings as i wanted because i cannot seem to get the right wing shape and i refuse to allow \u0027ugly\u0027.
