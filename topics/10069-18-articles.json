It , and Minmus, are currently the only places I can reliably get to. If you like, I can put a satellite up in orbit around it and start-a-mappin\u0027. Also, do I need to have KSP running continuously? or can I turn it off and continue at a later point?\n\nGathering it certainly will help. Sending it, not so much, as I\u0027m concentrating on Kerbin right now. It\u0027s a little arbitrary of me, granted, but I\u0027m still not sure what sort of problems/limitations I\u0027m going to run into. Most of the big ones are out of the way (sorting and merging multiple data sources, and deleting duplicate data), but I could very well run into fundamentally limiting factors like how much time it takes to render these maps on an i7 processor. (I don\u0027t have access to computing time on anything more than my iMac, as much as it would be lovely to be able to run the raster map generator and projection modules on a supercomputer. I don\u0027t anticipate this being a serious limitation, though it may require that I leave my computer on and processing for many hours, or days.)"},{"CreatedByName":"ramipro","CreatedById":24316,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T16:17:04Z","Content":"Uploading now a 1GB file to the folder.

I combined the data from the Kethane scanner with the ISA Mapper to produce this image.\n\nIt is now easier to see approximately where the kethane is (Dark Green) on a moon or planet. \n\nIf you want to try this out here is how I went about it:\n\nI used a photo editing program called Gimp to do this. \n\nI took the kethane data map and flip it top to bottom so the poles would match and resized it to match the ISA map.\n\nYou need to add a 1 pixel wide reference dot (Same color as the kethane dots) at each of the four corners of the kethane map, this is an important step, as you will need them to align the two maps later.\n\nThen I selected only the green on the kethane map and do a copy and paste to the ISA map.\n\nFinally I darkened the green, align the dots at the corners to the ISA map\u0027s corners and anchored it to the map.\n\nI don\u0027t have any vehicles on Laythe\u0027s surface right now to test it out, but I hope to soon.\n\n![LaytheKethaneMap1600_zpsad2aced8.png](http://i1190.photobucket.com/albums/z446/Tomweave4/Misc%202/LaytheKethaneMap1600_zpsad2aced8.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Grand Lander","CreatedById":31521,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T10:02:56Z","Content":"0.17 updates yet?"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-19T14:51:06Z","Content":"So, I smushed together an image made from tommygun\u0027s, ramipro\u0027s, and my own data.

One possibility is an atmospheric pressure map of Kerbin (or any other planet with atmosphere). Even a gravioli map! Wherever there is data to be found. Wherever there is an instrument to measure it. Without a plugin to map this data, the initial maps will be low resolution. A division of labor could be discussed for individuals to map out areas with a resolution of one data point per 1km^2, or whatever. Then a csv could be compiled from that and rendered using the ISA map gen. \n\nOr however someone with a better idea would prefer it to be done.\n\nAnyway, if the founder of the KGSS is reading this, let\u0027s get some stuff going again. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"JacobT11","CreatedById":11673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T22:26:11Z","Content":"I think it\u0027d be great to resurrect the Kerbin Geographic and Science Society.
