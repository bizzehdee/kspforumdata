Ie. One week, we would work on Eve. In that week, one agency could map Eve, two could work on finding the average tempatures, two the atmosphereic density, etc. And with this we could form a giant database of information to give to the KSP wiki. Also, there would be no founders. It would be like the UN in a sense. However, one person would run the thread.
