However, they\u0027re \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A315 for a packet of 10 tablets, PLUS postage and packaging. So, instead of just buying it, I looked it up and found that the active protein in miracle berries is called \u0022Miraculin\u0022. A similar protein, Circulin also has the same effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I want to find out how peptide bonds are formed in a laboratory, so that I can try and make some at home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T15:46:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a glycoprotein.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Miraculin.png/220px-Miraculin.png\u0022 alt=\u0022220px-Miraculin.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t make that in a lab from simple chemicals because it\u0027s extremely complicated molecule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why we have bacteria for.

Bacteria can easily be persuaded to synthesise protein chains, but the rules they use to attach carbohydrate chains to proteins are significantly different from those used by eukaryotes such as plants and animals.
