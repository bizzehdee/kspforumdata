I have never done it but I have landed an unmanned probe on Eve, with RT2 \u002B 7min signal delay because of distance, and a 15min window to send the signals in. It is possible but depends greatly on your satellite network coverage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally you want at least 4 satellites in a geosync orbit around Kerbin, and at least 3 more satellites in a north south orbit. For the Mun you may one a couple of relay satellites there to give you a larger coverage area when attempting the landing. Expecially if it is a dark side landing. You wont have to worry much about signal delay at that distance it will at most be a few seconds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETips for RT2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Set your commsats with at least 3 antenna, 2 omni directionals, and 1 dish with a good arc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Set your commsats like this, all antennas active, dish set to target active vessel, and that is it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way no matter what you have one dish pointed at the active vessel which should give you a link back to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t give up on it, it will take lots of trial and error but if you get it right it will be one of the most satisfying things you do in KSP. I know when I landed the probe on Eve, using the flight computer in RT2 that was my greatest moment in KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for re-entry without RCS, it can be done, but you need either a lot of reaction wheels or a very light craft to do it. I use FAR\u002BDRE, and I have had to do it a few times when I have miscalculated the amount of RCS fuel I needed in the design. Most of the time I have succeded, a few times I have not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo major things are needed if you don\u0027t have RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- Electrical power, you will need lots of it or a fast recharge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- SAS Reaction Wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout either of those two things your craft is at the mercy of physics, and that is never a good thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-13T15:33:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2014 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Niv200","CreatedById":103280,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T11:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethank you all! can you please post some pictures of space plane/shuttles at reentery CoM and CoL?
