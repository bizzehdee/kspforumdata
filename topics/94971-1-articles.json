Spacecraft usually get past their flight envelope pretty quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe higher speed engines with broader ranges of speed like scramjets /air aug rockets and ramjets have a minimum speed to operate, usually at least mach 0.5, and higher for efficient thrust. By the time the shuttle for example reaches that speed, its already gone though 20\u002B% of its maximum effective altitude. (It and its fuel have been dead weight so far). In the shuttles case again, it has about 100 seconds to provide thrust before leaving its flight envelope.

Beyond this each engine only gets a small Isp boost in final terms (max \u0026lt;2x), which is only achieved in a small range of around Mach 2. Mach 3 would be better performance, but the air is too thin to assist much by the time a normal rocket reaches that point, so to get a benefit you\u0027d have to lose out on far more launch profile performance, and at low supersonic/subsonic velocities, the ram effect is too weak to get a significant enough flow of air through the add-on. It\u0027s a significant mass penalty for a gain that only exists in a small range and is relatively small in magnitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the result is you get negligibly better engine performance, for comparable or worse TWR than a SABRE engine would be, without enough of a gain to use a lifting ascent that would make mass penalties more negligible.
