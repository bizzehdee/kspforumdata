Unless you go with Linux as an OS, you are going to have a very very hard time upgrading with that budget. You problem is that it sounds like you have a pretty old system in computer years anyway. You cant just upgrade your OS (W7 or 8 will eat about half your budget) and expect it to work with your current hardware. Example: W7 \u0026amp; 8 (you can skip Vista) will require a second core CPU, which in your case may require a new Mobo ($$$). But then your current RAM wont fit into the new Mobo. Modern GPU\u0027s need a second power source, with new connectors on your power supply. It turns into a chain reaction as you attempt to upgrade any one of the components mentioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour best bet may be to go onto Ebay and find people selling your current hardware components and then looking for those selling the \u0022next gen\u0022 of each component, like just baby steps ahead of what you have so chances are good that everything will fit and still be relatively compatible with one another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice to you is to keep saving your money.
