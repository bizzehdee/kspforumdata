\u003C/span\u003EThis article could be slightly confusing if you have not read that article first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarly in the development of both the Atlas and Titan Missiles, the Remo-Wooldridge corporation, the soon to be TRW, pointed out to the USAF that a better fuel source than cryogenic Liquid Oxygen should be found.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ELiquid Oxygen boils off at a prodigious rate when exposed to normal terrestrial temperatures.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe USAF approached both General Dynamics (Convair Division) and the Martin Company about converting to some form of storable liquid fuel.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EConvair pointed out that a storable fuel would destroy the balloon tanks in short order\u2026 and the extra weight would inviolate their entire launch principal.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis quickly excluded Atlas from being \u201Cup fueled\u201D to a new storable propellant.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EYou see, even today with all our advances in chemistry and metallurgy, storable fuels tend to be very caustic, very cancerous, and generally unbelievably BAD to be around.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBack in the 1950s we are talking about nitric acid and any of various fuel types that nitric acid self-combusts or goes hypergolic with.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhy is self-combustion an important factor for room temperature stored fuels?\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe short answer is I do not know.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe longer answer involves a lot of chemical and engineering equations that deal with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry)

investigated, were declared too violent even in storage.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThings like High Test Peroxide.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EHydrogen Peroxide, readily available over the counter in 2% to 6% concentrations in normal water is a great astringent and wound sterilizer.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBut at 80% to 90% concentration\u2026. Can dissolve organic matter in moments\u2026 this includes an all-up Human, much to the chagrin of many German pilots in World War II who flew the ME-163 Komet in various forms as the HTP as the high percentage Hydrogen Peroxide is often called, would leak.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThere being cases where Me-163s just exploded on the tarmac.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESo in short, Hypergolic fuels require a lot of care when dealing with them.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EMore so that the Cryogenic LOX.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news for Titan, was that this was 20 years latter and while Hypergolic rockets were tested and knowledge was gained, few were flown.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhen it was decided to convert the Titan to Hypergolic fuel, it was a simple choice as Aerojet General was about the only rocket company in the US with then current Hypergolic fuel use between their AJ-10 engine as well as some of their semi disposable JATO/RATO aircraft takeoff assistance motors.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAerojet had started to perfect their Hypergolic line even before being asked to convert the AJ-23 family of engines to Hypergolic fuels.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EEven before being approached about converting the AJ-23 family to hypergolic fuels, Aerojet had begun developing their own custom fuel that would be easier to store and use than the previous they used.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EPreviously Aerojet was using Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA.)\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe new fuel combination would also be unique in utilizing almost the same burn ratio as the KeroLOX fuel currently used in the Titan I rocket, by mass flow.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis new fuel was known as Aerozine50 and was a 50:50 mixture of UDMH and Hydrazine which are closely related to each other, and the improved Di-Nitrogen Tetroxide (NTO) was a replacement for IRFNA.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAerojet catching on that the more corrosion inhibiter they added to their IRFNA mixture the better their engines burned.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ENitrogen Tetroxide or NTO was being used in the IRFNA formulation as a corrosion inhibiter in the fuel tank.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe More NTO added to the fuel mixture, the higher the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service

stage\u2026.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESo Aerojet just pulled the IRFNA and left NTO in the tanks and achieved the best performance yet.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ETo the improved NTO oxidizer, Aerojet would use a 50:50 mixture of UDMH and Hydrazine for fuel.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWith the trade name Aerozine-50 (Az-50) this new mixture would burn more efficiently with NTO than any other fuel then tested.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhile still caustic, corrosive, and cancerous, the combination of Az50 and NTO would greatly improve the safety of every rocket stage it was used on when compared to the previous UDMH/IRFNA fuel combination.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis major leap did not come without problems, however.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EDeveloping the new LR87 and LR91 AJ-5 variants took much more money and much longer than anticipated.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EEnough so that the USAF instituted a CRASH program, one of the first times said type of program was initiated after WWII.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAerojet, for about 6 months was confined to working on the problems with the LR87 and LR91 conversion to Hypergolic fuel.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhile 6 months might seem like a short time, you must understand, everything else that Aerojet was doing was curtailed or in danger of being stopped by the USAF.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESo, when in the same timeframe Aerojet submitted a version of the LR87 to power the upper stages of the ABMA Saturn I and V Rockets\u2026.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWell, that did not happen.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EEven though Aerojet\u2019s engine was best in 10 out of 11 criteria, Rocketdyne got the contract, and the J-2 exists.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EYou can read more about that in my pieces on the J-2 and E-1 engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow did the Titan II change from the Titan I?\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWell knowing all the problems that Titan I had with stage separation, including several photographs from space showing the interstage collapsed in or exploded out preventing separation\u2026\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EMartin changed how the two stages would separate.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ELike on the previous Titan I, the Titan II would utilize a zero-ullage motor 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage start aka the \u201Cfire in the hole\u201D method.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis meaning the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage was started while the first stage was still or just powering down.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe big difference is the first stage would add thrust cancelation motors which were not powerful enough to completely stop the 1\u003Csup\u003Est\u003C/sup\u003E stage at full thrust, were more than powerful enough to overcome the turbopumps exhaust thrust.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt was believed that the Titan I turbopumps ran for several moments after the stop thrust commands were sent.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis proved to be mostly true.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt turns out that there is still quit a bit of fuel flowing to the engine after the stop thrust command is issued.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis is caused by the flow rate and the distance traveled after the fuel shutoff valves.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt is these same reasons why the LR87 takes so long to get to full thrust in the game.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIf you are not using any of the upper stage patches or Spool patches in BDB you can clearly see this after you shut off the First stage Titan engine\u2026 it still provides meaningful thrust for several seconds.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBut back to the changes.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EInstead of a solid Interstage with blow-out panels.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe new Titan II with it\u2019s larger diameter upper stage (the same \u003Cs\u003E3.05m\u003C/s\u003E 10 ft as the lower stage now,) was believed to \u201Cblock\u201D most of the drag from leaving the interstage open.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EOf course, this was not true but the loss in drag was more than made up for the much more powerful first stage as well as the much more reliable 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EA major change to the design choice of the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage involved not using a two stage starting method for the LR91 as the Titan I had.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan I as previously discussed activated the 4x vernier motors for almost 12 seconds of flight time before the main combustion chamber came on.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWith the LR91-AJ-5 for Titan II, the entire role of the verniers was deleted.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis meant that the turbopump exhaust did not need to be augmented nor was it used in the same way.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EInstead on the Titan II the turbopump exhaust would only provide roll control by a gimbal and twisting joint prior to the last 90-degree elbow pipe.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis greatly simplified both the startup of the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage as well as reduced the chances of damage to the 1\u003Csup\u003Est\u003C/sup\u003E stage and the interstage structure like happened to the Titan I with some regularity early in it\u2019s flight testing.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis also allowed the engineers at Martin to move the turbopump exhaust under the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage reducing parasitic drag and eliminating four high pressure points on the outside of the rocket as it accelerated to space.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESome documents claim that removing the 4 vernier exhaust from the airflow around the rocket more than offset the drag caused by open blow out panels on the interstage.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA new warhead was eventually developed for the Titan II, it would be one of the largest service warheads ever produced and would stay on alert with the Titan II until their withdrawal starting in 1982.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EA withdrawal due mostly to needing major manufacture level overhaul that would be needed to serve further, not due to any sort of treaty as many \u201Chistorical documents\u201D will contend.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ETitan II was not deactivated due to any arms reduction talks.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EHowever it\u2019s removal from service would affect current and future talks in the mid 1980s and early 1990s arms control talks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter it was retired from service many in the USAF had the bright idea to combine useable stages from the remaining missiles to create a cheap space launcher since every other launcher was soon to leave service\u2026. As the result of the Space Shuttle.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EOf course, history would stop the process of canceling the disposable rockets with the Challenger disaster in January 1986.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EChallenger happened right in the middle of the USAF looking into such a conversion of the remaining Titan II stages.

or just over all dilapidated status, as a sign of the quality of the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage, a 15\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E second stage was sent to Martin Marietta as part of

the Titan II ICBM into a space launcher would become prohibitive quickly due to the dilapidated state of the rockets and the cost of further conversions was, to put it mildly, more expensive than the just entering service new production satellite launchers of similar performance. \u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EWhen all was said and done, only a few

2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage after burnout to properly deploy the 3\u003Csup\u003Erd\u003C/sup\u003E stage or payload. \u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EWhile ACS is not

\u003C/span\u003EIn the end, the Titan IIG(23G) was available to launch a few payloads when launchers were hard to come by.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBut it was not cheap and when launchers became available again in the form of the Delta II, the Titan IIG faded into history.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt should be noted that the Titan 23G is not correct following USAF naming standards.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe 23 series of Titan Rockets were equipped with LR87 and LR91 engines of the AJ-11 subset.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0

it.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EGiven the issues with Pogo we will discuss in the next few paragraphs it was a good decision by NASA to NOT accept a new version of Titan and rather just alter the Titan II into the Titan II GLV.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ETitan II.5 is not buildable as described but a reasonable facsimile can be made by using the Titan IIIM first stage tank setup and reducing the fuel slightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Titan II GLV was a program that was relatively on time.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ERARE for a government acquisition.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EStarting with the base Titan II that was just entering testing for the USAF, NASA developed the appropriate changes to the basic Rocket that would be required for NASA to feel safe putting astronauts on board.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EChiefly the changes centered around lowering the pressure in the turbines of the engines, and many thousands of built-in test sensors throughout the spaceframe.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EHere is where things get hinky... this is also why Aerojet General was forced into the CRASH program for their new LR87 and LR91 AJ-5s\u2026.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EPOGO.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EPogo is a vertical (through the body of the rocket) oscillation resulting in up-to several gees of positive and negative acceleration along the flight direction with a rapid repetition.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis can lead to structural failure, and in the case of pilots, injury, or death.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIn USAF tests Pogo was only experienced once\u2026 as seen by their test instruments.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESince the USAF does not use as many test instruments for launches as NASA did, it is not surprising that many launches that entered Pogo went un-detected.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESo, NASA sort of pressured the USAF to add extra test equipment to the next few test Launches of the Titan II.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhat was found resulted in a lot of re-engineering of the new hypergolic LR87 and LR91 engines as well as the fuel pipes and tanks on the rocket stages themselves.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThese changes reduced the vertical oscillations to significantly less than 1g of acceleration and much less often than the 11hz or 11x per second the pogo was detected initially.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EMost of the \u201Canti-Pogo\u201D changes involved flex lines in the fuel system (instead of rigid fuel lines) as well as flow rate dampers in the fuel system itself to prevent over acceleration of the fuel or oxidizer in the engines (leading to altered burn profiles.)\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThese changes are the prime result in the Titan II having few \u201Cfailed launches\u201D when compared to the Titan I.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe base Titan II would have 77 successful flights on 81 launches.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EA much higher ratio of success when compared to the previous Titan I variant.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhen you add the Titan GLV and the converted Titan 23Gs mentioned above the launch ratio is 101 to 107 with only one Titan 23G failure out of the additional 24 launches.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt should be noted that several early launches in the USAF test program, where POGO was present, were still considered a success and are not counted as failures as the warhead simulator landed near enough the target zone to be considered successful.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn BDB we can build the All-up Titan II missile\u2026 the warhead is replaced by an aerodynamic cover.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWe can also make the All-Up Titan IIGLV.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EHowever, we are unable to make the Titan II.5 mostly because there is no real-world data.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EYou can make a loose analog by using the Titan IIIM first stage tanks with a small reduction in max fuel.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIn the case of this conversion to a Titan II.5 every other part beyond the upper first stage tank is the same as the Titan IIGLV.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, we can build ANY version of the Titan 23G satellite launcher including the Titan 2S, Titan 2L and 3L.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan 2S would be a core Titan 23G with the addition of either Castor IV SRMs or GEM-40 SRMs.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe SRMs would be mounted in quantities starting at 4 and ending at 10.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIf 10 rockets were carried, they would be burned in a 4, 4, 2 or 4,3,3 profile.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESuch a combination would double the payload of the Titan 23G but would cause problems because a new aft skirt (the engine mount in BDB parlance) to protect the AJ-5 engine (just switch to the \u201CTitan III\u201D engine mount type when you have your AJ5 engine installed) and would require structural changes to the core.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EGiven that only ~23 all up Titan 23Gs were possible to make this would have been an expensive undertaking.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan 23G(S) or Titan 2S is fully buildable in BDB.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan 2L would be a Titan 23G with 2 Titan 23G first stages strapped on as boosters.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAll 3 engines would ignite and burn at the same fuel rate (booster and 1\u003Csup\u003Est\u003C/sup\u003E stage.) and all three would burn out and separate at the same time.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan 3L would use the Commercial Titan 3 core but with Titan II AJ-5 engines on the first stage.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAs it is using the Commercial Titan 3 as the core stage it would use Titan IIIM tanks.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EJust like the 2L the 3L would ignite all 3 LR87-AJ-5s at once.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt is unclear if the Commercial Titan 3 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage would use the LR91-AJ-11A of the nominal production or use the LR91-AJ-5 for the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EGiven how few of the LR91s survived to be considered re-usable it is likely the Titan 3L would use Titan IV 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage tanks made new, and the LR91-AJ-11A of the CT3 and Titan IV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile there were enough first stages and spare engines that were of enough quality to consider the concept, it is unlikely that the 3L would have flown as designed and instead I feel the best \u201CLiquid boosted Titan\u201D to build is the Titan 2L.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan 2L is fully buildable in BDB and 3L is nearly completely buildable.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EOnly the CT3\u2019s AJ-11A engine upgrade is missing to fully give this rocket it\u2019s due.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan 3L would fly with the CT3\u2019s fairing as well I should mention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a lot of variants of the Titan II that can be fully built in BDB.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIn-fact there is one I have not

III to do so.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESecondly, while the Titan IIIA did have the slight second stage Stretch associated with all Titan IIIs that was the only change vs the

flown.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhen it was decided to convert the Titan to Hypergolic fuel, it was a simple choice as Aerojet General was about the only rocket company in the US with then current Hypergolic fuel use between their AJ-10 engine as well as some of their semi disposable JATO/RATO aircraft takeoff assistance motors.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAerojet had started to perfect their Hypergolic line even before being asked to convert the AJ-23 family of engines to Hypergolic fuels.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EEven before being approached about converting the AJ-23 family to hypergolic fuels, Aerojet had begun developing their own custom fuel that would be easier to store and use than the previous they used.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EPreviously Aerojet was using Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA.)\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe new fuel combination would also be unique in utilizing almost the same burn ratio as the KeroLOX fuel currently used in the Titan I rocket, by mass flow.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis new fuel was known as Aerozine50 and was a 50:50 mixture of UDMH and Hydrazine which are closely related to each other, and the improved Di-Nitrogen Tetroxide (NTO) was a replacement for IRFNA.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAerojet catching on that the more corrosion inhibiter they added to their IRFNA mixture the

\u003C/span\u003ETo the improved NTO oxidizer, Aerojet would use a 50:50 mixture of UDMH and Hydrazine for fuel.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWith the trade name Aerozine-50 (Az-50) this new mixture would burn more efficiently with NTO than any other fuel then tested.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhile still caustic, corrosive, and cancerous, the combination of Az50

\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis major leap did not come without problems, however.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EDeveloping the new LR87 and LR91 AJ-5 variants took much more money and much longer than anticipated.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EEnough so that the USAF instituted a CRASH program, one of the first times said type of program was initiated after WWII.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAerojet, for about 6 months was confined to working on the problems with the LR87 and LR91 conversion to Hypergolic fuel.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhile 6 months might seem like a short time, you must understand, everything else that Aerojet was doing was curtailed or in danger of being stopped by the USAF.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESo, when in the same timeframe Aerojet submitted a version of the LR87 to power the upper stages of the ABMA Saturn I and V Rockets\u2026.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWell, that did not happen.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EEven though Aerojet\u2019s engine was best in 10 out of 11 criteria, Rocketdyne got the contract, and the J-2 exists.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EYou can read more about that in my pieces on the J-2 and E-1 engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow did the Titan II change from the Titan I?\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWell knowing all the problems that Titan I had with stage separation, including several photographs from space showing the interstage collapsed in or exploded out preventing separation\u2026\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EMartin changed how the two stages would separate.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ELike on the previous Titan I, the Titan II would utilize a zero-ullage motor 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage start aka the \u201Cfire in the hole\u201D method.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis meaning the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage was started while the first stage was still or just powering down.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe big difference is the first stage would add thrust cancelation motors which were not powerful enough to completely stop the 1\u003Csup\u003Est\u003C/sup\u003E stage at full thrust, were more than powerful enough to overcome the turbopumps exhaust thrust.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt was believed that the Titan I turbopumps ran for several moments after the stop thrust commands were sent.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis proved to be mostly true.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt turns out that there is still quit a bit of fuel flowing to the engine after the stop thrust command is issued.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis is caused by the flow rate and the distance traveled after the fuel shutoff valves.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt is these same reasons why the LR87 takes so long to get to full thrust in the game.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIf you are not using any of the upper stage patches or Spool patches in BDB you can clearly see this after you shut off the First stage Titan engine\u2026 it still provides meaningful thrust for several seconds.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBut back to the changes.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EInstead of a solid Interstage with blow-out panels.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe new Titan II with it\u2019s larger diameter upper stage (the same \u003Cs\u003E3.05m\u003C/s\u003E 10 ft as the lower stage now,) was believed to \u201Cblock\u201D most of the drag from leaving the interstage open.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EOf course, this was not true but the loss in drag was more than made up for the much more powerful first stage as well as the much more reliable 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EA major change to the design choice of the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage involved not using a two stage starting method for the LR91 as the Titan I had.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan I as previously discussed activated the 4x vernier motors for almost 12 seconds of flight time before the main combustion chamber came on.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWith the LR91-AJ-5 for Titan II, the entire role of the verniers was deleted.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis meant that the turbopump exhaust did not need to be augmented nor was it used in the same way.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EInstead on the Titan II the turbopump exhaust would only provide roll control by a gimbal and twisting joint prior to the last 90-degree elbow pipe.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis greatly simplified both the startup of the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage as well as reduced the chances of damage to the 1\u003Csup\u003Est\u003C/sup\u003E stage and the interstage structure like happened to the Titan I with some regularity early in it\u2019s flight testing.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis also allowed the engineers at Martin to move the turbopump exhaust under the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage reducing parasitic drag and eliminating four high pressure points on the outside of the rocket as it accelerated to space.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESome documents claim that removing the 4 vernier exhaust from the airflow around the rocket more than offset the drag caused by open blow out panels on the interstage.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA new warhead was eventually developed for the Titan II, it would be one of the largest service warheads ever produced and would stay on alert with the Titan II until their withdrawal starting in 1982.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EA withdrawal due mostly to needing major manufacture level overhaul that would be needed to serve further, not due to any sort of treaty as many \u201Chistorical documents\u201D will contend.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ETitan II was not deactivated due to any arms reduction talks.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EHowever it\u2019s removal from service would affect current and future talks in the mid 1980s and early 1990s arms control talks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter it was retired from service many in the USAF had the bright idea to combine useable stages from the remaining missiles to create a cheap space launcher since every other launcher was soon to leave service\u2026. As the result of the Space Shuttle.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EOf course, history would stop the process of canceling the disposable rockets with the Challenger disaster in January 1986.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EChallenger happened right in the middle of the USAF looking into such a conversion of the remaining Titan II stages. \u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EOf 56 surviving Titan II missiles, only the 14 best were initially chosen for conversion.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBe it due to miss-handling or just over all dilapidated status, as a sign of the quality of the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage, a 15\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E second stage was sent to Martin Marietta as part of the conversion process.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EAfter the initial orders were placed, it was quickly discovered that to fully update the Titan II ICBM into a space launcher would become prohibitive quickly due to the dilapidated state of the rockets and the cost of further conversions was, to put it mildly, more expensive than the just entering service new production satellite launchers of similar performance. \u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EWhen all was said and done, only a few Titan II stages were still sound enough to be converted to Satellite launch vehicles.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThese refurbished Titan II missiles received a new deployment bus atop the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage and a standardized fairing based on those used on other rockets.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThere is a very nice picture of this on the 14\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E and final Titan II(23)G at the Evergreen air museum.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca

\u003C/span\u003EIn the end, the Titan IIG(23G) was available to launch a few payloads when launchers were hard to come by.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBut it was not cheap and when launchers became available again in the form of the Delta II, the Titan IIG faded into history.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt should be noted that the Titan 23G is not correct following USAF naming standards.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe 23 series of Titan Rockets were equipped with LR87 and LR91 engines of the AJ-11 subset.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0

changes are the prime result in the Titan II having few \u201Cfailed launches\u201D when compared to the Titan I.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe base Titan II would have 77 successful flights on 81 launches.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EA much higher ratio of success when compared to the previous Titan I variant.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhen you add the Titan GLV and the converted Titan 23Gs mentioned above the launch ratio is 101 to 107 with only one Titan 23G failure out of the additional 24 launches.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt should be noted that several early launches in the USAF test program, where POGO was present, were still considered a success and are not counted as failures as the warhead simulator landed near enough the target zone to be considered successful.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn BDB we can

first stage tanks with a small reduction in max fuel.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIn the case of this conversion to a Titan II.5 every other part beyond the upper first stage tank is

Titan 2L and 3L.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan 2S would be a core Titan 23G with the addition of either Castor IV SRMs or GEM-40 SRMs.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe SRMs would be mounted in quantities starting at 4 and ending at 10.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIf 10 rockets were carried, they would be burned in a 4, 4, 2 or 4,3,3 profile.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESuch a combination would double the payload of the Titan 23G but would cause problems because a new aft skirt (the engine mount in BDB parlance) to protect the AJ-5 engine (just switch to the \u201CTitan III\u201D engine mount type when you have your AJ5 engine installed) and would require structural changes to the core.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EGiven that only ~23 all up Titan 23Gs were possible to make this would have been an expensive undertaking.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan 23G(S) or Titan 2S is fully buildable in BDB.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan 2L would be a Titan 23G with 2 Titan 23G first stages strapped on as boosters.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAll 3 engines would ignite and burn at the same fuel rate (booster and 1\u003Csup\u003Est\u003C/sup\u003E stage.) and all three would burn out and separate at the same time.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan 3L would use the Commercial Titan 3 core but with Titan II AJ-5 engines on the first stage.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAs it is using the Commercial Titan 3 as the core stage it would use Titan IIIM tanks.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EJust like the 2L the 3L would ignite all 3 LR87-AJ-5s at once.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt is unclear if the Commercial Titan 3 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage would use the LR91-AJ-11A of the nominal production or use the LR91-AJ-5 for the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EGiven how few of the LR91s survived to be considered re-usable it is likely the Titan 3L would use Titan IV 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E stage tanks made new, and the LR91-AJ-11A of the CT3 and Titan IV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile there were enough first stages and spare engines that were of enough quality to consider the concept, it is unlikely that the 3L would have flown as designed and instead I feel the best \u201CLiquid boosted Titan\u201D to build is the Titan 2L.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan 2L is fully buildable in BDB and 3L is nearly completely buildable.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EOnly the CT3\u2019s AJ-11A engine upgrade is missing to fully give this rocket it\u2019s due.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Titan 3L would fly with the CT3\u2019s fairing as well I should mention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a lot of variants of the Titan II that can be fully built in BDB.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIn-fact there is one I have not

III.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EFirst off, the Titan IIIA flew with LR87-AJ-5 and LR91-AJ-5 engines.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWith one exception, it is the only Titan III to do so.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESecondly, while the Titan IIIA did have the slight second stage Stretch associated with all Titan IIIs that was the only change vs the Titan II that was integrated into the Titan IIIA.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo Titan IIIA has the longer
