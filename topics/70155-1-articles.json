So I developed a spacecraft capable of intercepting the mun and back. But that took a LOT of work. I don\u0027t like to transmit information because it\u0027s not worth the full amount of science from the beginning, that\u0027s just me I guess. Anyway, the point for me was to get as much science in one trip using one command pod and one kerbal as possible (I think it was 60 or something since I got out and took a sample of the highlands afterwards). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the challenge go nuts! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ebuild the most capable craft possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EScience isn\u0027t part of this challenge just the trip involved.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ego as far as possible (meaning be as impressive as possible. land on minmus, orbit duna, slingshot between the mun and minmus several times, whatever) just make sure to come home afterwards\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eno cheaters or mods or anything like that now\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emake sure to post key screenshots. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I didn\u0027t but I will as soon as I remember to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso have to remember to redo the launch and take screen shots this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow go! have fun! be creative!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sillychris","CreatedById":103939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T17:45:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was doing the same thing this weekend.
