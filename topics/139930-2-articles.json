Early Rocketry, Early Construction, Early Avionics, and Mature Supersonic Flight. All cost 10 science except Early Construction, which costs 5. We have 35 science available, which means we queue all of them, but it might make sense to reserve some science to beeline further up a branch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe currently research at 6.5 science per year, although every $10 million we allocate we can increase that by 1.5 science per year. This means that researching all three LV-related nodes, even considering a few more upgrades, will take us twenty one months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to make this decision, however, we need to make another decision: how we want to get to orbit. We have, essentially, the following options:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOrbit from the starting node and starting pad. No useful payload can be orbited: we will not have enough electricity stored to return science data from the orbit. Other disadvantage: very difficult-to-fly and failure-prone launch vehicle.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOrbit from the starting node but an upgraded pad. This allows us to orbit a useful payload and does not involve unlocking any tech nodes or parts, but does require a $75 million investment in our launch pad (which we will need to do at some point). However, such an LV is still failure-prone and cannot orbit very much, although useful science data can be returned.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOrbit from Early Rocketry. This will involve unlocking parts which we will use later (early AJ10, Baby Sergeant) and parts we will not (X-405 and/or RD-103). It will allow us to orbit useful payload into even polar LEO.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOrbit from Early Avionics. Has the same reliability issues as the first two options, but can orbit somewhat useful payload, although probably not into polar orbit. Does not involve unlocking anything we won\u0027t use later however.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOrbit from multiple Tier 1 (TL0) nodes. We will need to research all these nodes eventually, so we can put off our first orbital launch until they all unlock. That will let us launch useful payloads and even reach the Moon (barely), even from the starting pad.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHold off until Tier 2 (TL1) engines / avionics. This delays our first orbital launch, but does not involve spending money on parts we won\u0027t use again.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally we also should consider spending some of our science on Mature Supersonic Flight. That will allow us to unlock the first afterburning jet engines and good cockpits for high supersonic flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsiderations:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUpgrading the pad should also include building a new pad, so we can still launch sounding rockets with fast rollout times. However, upgrading the pad will not interfere with research, and therefore should be done as early as possible so as to synergize with research times.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhile orbit early on is possible, it probably makes sense to hold off.
