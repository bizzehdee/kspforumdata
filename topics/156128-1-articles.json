For example (and this is just me spitballing, not a first draft of an actual feature) nuclear powerplants could have some radiation value dependent on their power and you\u0027d need a certain thickness shield between it and your crew. Some widget or other would tell you what thickness (or mass) of which shield you need. Maybe you have 3\u00A0types of shield and tanks of various stuff could be given arbitrary protection-levels against differing kinds of radiation (of which there could be ,say, 3 types.). Radiation from space environment (solar wind, cosmic rays etc.) could be given an equally simplified treatment, a need-it-or-not with a few extra tweaks kind of level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf though, people *are* being saturated with challenge (feature toggles? Like the relay system?), then KSP must be feature-saturated and all further additions must come via 3rd party mods. In which case my only suggestion would be \u0022Bugs, polish,\u00A0visuals and then finalise\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
