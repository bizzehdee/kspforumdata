They stop working at some point when just the right/wrong change occurs in KSP, and that functionality is lost, maybe indefinitely. Or at least briefly as you await the update that fixes it. If the suggestion was never made, and squad never thought about it, then when mod X fails, will its functions be in stock already? Doubt it. If it was suggested? It may be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens to stock items as KSP evolves? Not much if anything at all. With respect to part/function longevity stock parts/functions will near always win vs mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s how well stock items \u0027fit in\u0027 with er...stock items. I\u0027d say pretty well given that stock is well, stock. Tha\u0027s not to say mods cannot fit in very well, they can. Its just if you had to bet on it, and I picked a mod part and a stock part at random without telling you, which would you bet on having the better overall balance with the rest of stock, the stock part or the mod part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther, people are lazy. Whether or not its asking much, its still a task they must perform, which they don\u0027t if something is made stock. To get something, for as little as possible(nothing) is always a goal. So getting it into stock means not having to go get it yourself, that\u0027s another win for stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven further still, there is yet another way stock wins, tech support / bug fixing. A bug that results from a mod? You might just be on your own and probably cannot expect a fix to the underlying problem that caused it if its a result of some oddness in the game beyond the modder\u0027s control. A bug that results from stock? Expect a fix at some point, especially with the game still in development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo no, I don\u0027t think the outcome is the same. Similar maybe, but, all things equal stock functionality is always better than requiring a mod to do the same, from the end user\u0027s perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said however, its still nice to find out that there is already a mod which does what your looking for, which solves the problem in the short term.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-30T19:52:06Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2013 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Amram\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andersenman","CreatedById":61273,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T21:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile valid and appreciated, those points are highly subjective.

I didn\u0027t really touch the opposing side at all in that post, and there are a few decent reasons why a mod can be the better option. Dev\u0027s don\u0027t have to make it, more variety in how to do something, tailored to an audience outside the core game\u0027s target audience, frequently more customisable, and im sure a few others i\u0027d think of if I took the time to really write it out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jwenting\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jwenting\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eoh, but unless everything he wants is stock he can\u0027t brag he plays \u0022all stock\u0022, does he? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enecessary?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-31T01:06:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2013 01:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Amram\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T01:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease read the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat Not To Suggest\u003C/a\u003E list in future before suggesting something that\u0027s already on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThread closed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
