It wouldn\u0027t be simple, but the process would be pretty straightforward. You first have to find the coordinates, angle, and size of the pseudo-screens in the mk-3 cockpit, and make a MM config that adds RPM screens in their place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrCheeze","CreatedById":143538,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T09:29:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah you\u0027re right I could do it on my own but I\u0027m not really a modder and I know that there are people out there who could do it way better than me.
