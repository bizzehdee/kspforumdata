Photons are invisible until they hit your retina which further means that only photons whose orbitals are such that they would intercept your retinas would apply. If we complicate things further by pointing out that an escaping photon should have a pseudo-random exit trajectory (assume something like a collision is what released the photon) then we shouldn\u0027t even see the structured \u0022orbits\u0022 as much as simply points of light.\n\nEven if you are inside the orbital (which, you know, would mean you\u0027d be going c) you couldn\u0027t see anything because the light would never reach you.\n\n\\*Then again, you could break physics and have one particle approach you at c while you also approach that particle at c resulting in a relative speed of 2c... but you\u0027d also have to deal with time dilation which, I believe, is sqrt(1 - v/c), meaning you\u0027re now unable to see the proton because time has effectively stopped.\n\nJust as a note though, we ARE mixing quantum physics; newtonian mechanics; general relativity; and special relativity here. \n\nPeople have different debates over how \u0022mixable\u0022 these fields really are. They do predict different outcomes based on scope and are most accurate when dealing with the extremes they were developed in. This is most notable with Hawking Radiation which dealt with very similar issues as this question; in the most part though, the dispute came because it relies on various aspects of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, but alone neither agreed with his conclusions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T02:49:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 02:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fel**"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T04:29:23Z","Content":"Is what I said in my first, also I was agree with Nful explanation.
