The stock solar system is so small, the craft are so easy to pile up delta-V on, there\u0027s no fuel boil-off to worry about, and the planets have so little mass (even with their unrealistic densities) that you can\u0027t get a good slingshot going anyway. Bouncing off Jool could work, but in stock you can just Hohmann everywhere.\n\nNow, in RSS, yeah, I would definitely consider using gravity assists off the inner planets to meet the outer ones because they would work much, much better."},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T20:42:13Z","Content":"It depends on the situation. If you\u0027re talking about visiting Moho, Eve, Dres, or Eeloo, I tend to burn directly from LKO.\n\nBut I use Ike to help my orbital insertion into Duna, and I use Tylo to help my orbital insertion into the Jool system. For about 50-100 dV, you can get an Ike or Tylo intercept tangent to your hyperbolic escape trajectory in the counter-clockwise direction, and then you\u0027re effectively using the gravity from both the host planet *and* its moon to speed your orbit relative to the sun (Kerbol).\n\nAnd gravity assists are great for getting around the Jool system because the inner moons have a lot of mass and a short orbital period. You don\u0027t have to wait long to get a free boost!\n\nSince gravity assists vs. direct burns is a tradeoff between delta-v and time, everywhere else it\u0027s usually not worth the time you have to wait to get the intercept. I can easily build in an extra 1000 dV and just not have to bother with gravity assists, *especially* when doing manned missions where I try to keep them out of cancer-causing solar wind as much as possible (for roleplay reasons)."},{"CreatedByName":"Musil","CreatedById":132791,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T20:43:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E To me, pulling off a successful gravity slingshot is one of the most satisfying things in the game.
