In my current career game I think I\u0027m up to \u0022Test Article 5\u0022.\n\nSatellites launched for a contract are named after the agency and numbered sequentially. \u0022SAT Kerbodyne 3\u0022 would be the third satellite launched for Kerbodyne, for example.\n\nI also take a modular approach to rocket construction and divide things into two pieces - a mission section (which are individually saved off as ships) and a booster section (saved as subassemblies). This makes it easy to piece a rocket together for any particular mission. Load a mission section, tweak it, attach a booster, double-check staging, and you\u0027re good to go.\n\nI name my basic booster designs after Greek letters, with additional designations added if I modify it. If the only modification is extra fuel tanks, then \u0022Heavy\u0022 gets tacked on, otherwise I\u0027ll add a letter or number (I\u0027m inconsistent with that one). Right now I have Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma rockets, and the \u0022Beta Heavy\u0022 is my current workhorse.\n\nI\u0027m inconsistent with naming mission sections, but generally unmanned probes just get some sort of descriptive name (\u0022Minmus Lander\u0022), while manned vehicles get a name that generally fits some theme. In my first career game that was Disney characters, currently it\u0027s Korean pop stars. Each new revision gets numbered. \u0022LM Minzy 2\u0022 is the second version of the Minzy lander.\n\nThe complete vehicle is then mission module \u002B booster: \u0022LM Minzy 2 Beta Heavy\u0022.\n\nWow, this sounds really complicated after writing it all out. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T21:10:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 09:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JetJaguar**"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T20:38:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Usually Unnamed Spacecraft, followed by Unnamed Spacecraft, and Unnamed Spacecraft.\n\n ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\nI usually give any spacecraft/aircraft a designation if I use it repeatedly. And the designation is based on mission or what type of vehicle it is. Example, EV-2 is my mainstream Apollo/Orion style crew vehicle (EV=Exploration Vehicle) and it was the 2nd generation EV-series (The EV-1 was the early career one-kerbal pod). From there, I\u0027ll give them models based on further improvements. The EV-2Awas an Apollo-analogue for going to the Mun and such, but later I had a more conservative EV-2B for LKO operations for going to space stations, tourist contracts, etc. The EV-2B had slightly different equipment, didn\u0027t require the fuel reserves or communications capability of the A-model, and was cheaper.\n\nIf I give craft nicknames, I usually stick with bird names for aircraft, ship/naval names for spacecraft, mythical creatures (ex Griffin, Phoenix) for SSTO spaceplanes, and general animal names for landers, miners and other misc utility vehicles whatever they look like (my Mono-powered Minmus lander reminded me of a \u0022Grasshopper\u0022).\n\nOthers:\n\nLV-? (Lander Vehicles)\n\nSR-? (Spaceplane, Reusable) SSTO spaceplanes\n\nEVR-? (Exploration Vehicle, Reusable) shuttle-type non-SSTO spaceplanes that launch on a rocket\n\nSV-?

I go back and forth depending on the save, but I maintain the same count scheme within each save. There is one exception: by tradition the first launch vehicle to get me to the Mun is named MuSh V.
