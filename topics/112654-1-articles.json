I am not a fan of Ubisoft, but truly, tis a beautiful and sad game. Holding in the tears is almost impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure I\u0027m not the only one who fels this way. So, I decided, why not create a thread for people to discuss about it -and for those who don\u0027t know it to check it out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it depends on the person, but generally speaking, don\u0027t be too afraid to use spoilers if need be. In my humble opinion, this game is even more painful after the first time anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T05:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, as someone who worked on a quite detailed World War I mod for Napoleon: Total War, I found it rather pleasing to see the fairly accurate uniform depictions of the early war, but unless I\u0027m mistaken the German soldiers in the game kept using those pickelhaubens until the end. On a similar note, I thought the villain was too simple and forced, especially in a game that sought moral complexity (of course the theme \u0027war is bad\u0027 might not be morally complex but you get the idea).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was interesting how they introduced the armoured cars, airplanes and tanks. The vaguely dieselpunk style gave us some interesting maps and areas to explore beyond the trench trope, although maybe it would have been cool to also see it culminate in some weapons manufactory or such (the industrial aspect of the war was something I feel they missed).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
