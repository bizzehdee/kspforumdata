Community Resource Pack\u0027s resources (like Liquid Hydrogen) are measured in liters. It is commonly accepted that the conversion rate between Fuel Units and Liters is 1:5.5.\n\n**Findings**: The current IFS patch calculates the following values for a tank that holds 800 FU:\n\n - 360 LF \u002B400 OX = 800 Fuel Units\n\n - 800 LF\n\n - 800 OX\n\n - 4400 LH2 = 800 Fuel Units\n\n - 4000 LH2 \u002B 400 OX = 727 Fuel Units of LH2 \u002B 400 Fuel Units of OX = 1127 total fuel units in the tank (which is 140% of the tank volume)\n\n**Solution**: When we solve the proportion between LH2 and OX, we should use Fuel Units rather than Liters.

I just did the math so the tank has constant volume when we switch between fuels.\n\nOn a related note, currently cryo engine burn at a ratio of 1 fuel unit of oxidizer to 10 liters of LH2, which equals to 1 fuel unit of OX to 1.18181818 fuel units of LH2. Cryogenic engines usually have a volumetric burn ratio of approximately 1:3 (source: total volume of OX:LH2 in the Saturn V [Second](http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/Second_Stage.pdf) and [Third](http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/Third_Stage.pdf) stages). Cryo engines should be updated to burn 1 Liter of LH2 to 0.0625 Fuel Units of OX, which equals to 1 Unit of OX to 16 Liters of LH2 or 1 Unit of OX to 2.90 Fuel Units of LH2.\n\nLet me know what you think about this and if you spot any errors in my math!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T23:19:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 11:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pacbard**"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T14:58:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E On a related note, currently cryo engine burn at a ratio of 1 fuel unit of oxidizer to 10 liters of LH2, which equals to 1 fuel unit of OX to 1.18181818 fuel units of LH2.
