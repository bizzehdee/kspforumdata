I don\u0027t know that I would of figured this out otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went to install a second instance of KSP on my system after the first. Using only the mods KAS and KW Rocketry (these are the same two mods that are used in the first game install). Whenever I would launch a ship in the second game, I would get error messages telling me that the mod\u0027s sound files could not be loaded; this was also reflected in the gameplay (no mod sounds). I never got a crash from this, but had the sound issues. I never had these issues -- with the exact same mods -- on my first game install. All mods are good downloads and good installs. I even tried moving an exact copy of the first (working) install\u0027s GameData folder into the second (not working) KSP folder, and got same issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeeded information: My first game was installed in C:/KSP. I tried to install my secondary install in C:/KSP/KSP install #2, C:/games/KSP install #2, and several other places. No matter where I installed the second game, I was always getting the sound issues that I was NOT getting in my first install. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter digging through the output_log, I found this line:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Audio load error: Couldn\u0027t open file C:\\KSP\\KSP INSTALL \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery time the game tried to load a sound file after this error, it would post:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/d63dfc6385190b60/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the key thing to notice here is that the game\u0027s installed folder was actually named \u0022KSP INSTALL \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E2\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went and removed the \u0022#\u0022 from the folder name, changing it to only \u0022KSP install 2\u0022, and the game now runs without any sound errors as it should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it would seem that for whatever reason KSP doesn\u0027t like a directory that includes a \u0022#\u0022 in its name. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this is a tiny minute little thing, and I don\u0027t even know that this is something that you could consider a bug, but it took me a while to figure out, and wasn\u0027t something I would have considered being the issue; especially because windows allows \u0022#\u0022 in a directory name without problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this can save someone else that may have this issue some time and aggravation! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you Squad for all you do!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Holy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E::EDIT:: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a moderator sees this and knows of a more appropriate place for a bug report to go, please feel free to move it there.
