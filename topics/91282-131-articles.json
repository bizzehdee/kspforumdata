Without it, all the nifty machines and\u00A0plot-enabling gadgets\u00A0quit functioning.\u00A0Some forms of unobtainium are based on real physics, but beyond the current scope of human engineering, such as\u00A0room-temperature superconductors; they would revolutionize just about every form of technology, but they are not in and of themselves dangerous or based on some exotic physics-bending principle. Others are more fantastic \u0022high-grade\u0022 unobtainium, such as\u00A0antimatter, which would be a revolutionary way of storing huge amounts of energy, if it didn\u0027t violently (as in, 1*10^-9 grams = tactical nuclear weapon yield) undergo mutual annihilation with\u00A0any\u00A0conventional matter it comes into contact with,\u00A0including air molecules\u00A0and the walls of whatever you\u0027re trying to store the damn stuff in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe most common varieties of unobtainium in fiction sit somewhere in the middle, like materials so resistant to heat and/or damage as to be invulnerable\u00A0compared to other, similar substances. Materials such as\u00A0mithril\u00A0are the\u00A0fantasy version.\u00A0Thunderbolt Iron\u00A0is especially popular in fiction (and has some\u00A0basis in reality\u00A0\u2013 until smelting was invented (which takes\u00A0ridiculously\u00A0hot - 1250 \u00B0C or 2282 \u00B0F - furnaces, hence the term \u0022Iron Age\u0022), it was the only source of refined iron). Much\u00A0mad science\u00A0uses unobtainium, such as\u00A0chemicals with impossible properties,\u00A0universal solvents\u00A0that can dissolve anything in the blink of an eye, super-explosives that make nitroglycerin look like a weak cough, and plenty of other\u00A0funny-colored solutions. Following this would be medical and/or chemical wish-fulfillers; Classical real-world alchemy casually referred to carmot, the base substance of the Philosopher\u0027s Stone, and Azoth, either the \u0022universal medicine\u0022 or \u0022universal solvent\u0022.

It has occasionally been used in official discussions to avoid directly identifying a material whose use is still considered top secret (such as the titanium skin in the project that eventually produced the SR-71 Blackbird). Most people, however, first heard the term as the mineral sought by the mining company in\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EAvatar\u003C/em\u003E, or the material used to build Virgil from \u003Cem\u003EThe Core\u00A0(\u003C/em\u003EAnd Unobtainium in both movies doesn\u0027t even make sense when you analyze it deeper.\u00A0Apparently, someone consulting on the\u003Cem\u003E Avatar\u003C/em\u003E made transportation cost estimates similar to ours because supposedly a kilo of unobtainium (which is used for room-temperature superconductor) sells for $20 million--a price that makes profitability at least conceivable. But, high price usually means tiny market, so even at that price, making a profit from a mining operation on a distant moon seems tenuous at best.\u00A0 If the unobtainium market were indeed highly lucrative, then sooner or later someone would figure out how to synthesize it. Surely a culture that can go to a moon, and at that a moon in a different star system, could figure out how to make unobtainium. As for \u003Cem\u003EThe Core\u003C/em\u003E, it does not explain the material further other than \u0027get stronger and generates power in the presence of extreme heat\u0027. But the \u0027generate power\u0027 part is what makes it ridiculous: At the end of the movie, after removing the reactor\u0027s fuel rods, the remaining terranauts are stranded with no power source, only 12 minutes from certain death due to the blast wave, but don\u0027t worry:\u00A0The\u00A0unobtainium\u00A0hull of the ship conveniently converts heat to energy. In the remaining 12 minutes they pull the ship\u0027s power wires loose and solder (what!?) them to the ship\u0027s inner hull. The ship magically powers up and the terranauts surf the blast wave to safety. This left us with many questions. First where\u0027s the circuit? To produce power, current has to flow and this requires a voltage drop. If one wire is hooked to the ship\u0027s hull which supposedly acts as a high-voltage source, then where is the ground wire connected? Even if the circuit did exist, how could the\u00A0unobtainium\u00A0possibly produce exactly the right kind of power (AC verses DC) at the correct voltage just by dumb luck? If it\u0027s so easily done then why wasn\u0027t the ship designed with\u00A0unobtainium\u00A0backup power in the first place?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThere are many real world examples of unobtainium. While the ideas of\u00A0Mithril\u00A0and Vibranium actually existing on our earth may be laughable, the idea of a mineral/resource that is near impossible to obtain is almost historical. Rare-earth elements\u00A0are used in most modern electronics, and aren\u0027t really rare, but they are hard to find in an economically-usable state. And, in addition, 97% of rare-earth mining is done in China. Because of their usefulness, worries that the Chinese could cut off or severely reduce exports of it is enough that now others countries are looking into reopening mines almost solely so that the Chinese cannot make unobtainium of them.

Hence, The Washington Monument was capped with a pyramidal ingot of\u00A0pure aluminum, Napoleon III\u0027s sets of dinnerware made from aluminum, and the statue of Anteros in London. Then Hall (and, independently, H\u00E9roult) discovered an easy way to make aluminium, and it stopped being unobtainium two years later with the construction of the first large-scale aluminum refining plant.\u00A0You\u0027re probably drinking out of an aluminum can right now. Even today, separating aluminum isn\u0027t as easy as you might think \u2014 it requires huge amounts of electrical power. Raw ore (bauxite) gets shipped around the world to take advantage of the cheapest possible electricity prices (Iceland smelts bauxite from South America to take advantage of its surplus geothermal power, while Quebec does the same to take advantage of its abundant hydroelectric power). It\u0027s also heavily recycled, as melting it down and re-casting it only requires 5% as much power as refining it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAstatine:\u003C/strong\u003E it was estimated that the amount of astatine in the planet barely can be gathered in a spoon, with around 30 grams existing on the entire Earth at any one time.

The process for making it was lost for centuries after the ore ran out, and was only rediscovered very recently through chemical analysis (the ore contained trace amounts of vanadium that created an unusual spiky crystal structure in the solidifying ingots). By all accounts, wootz steel is both stronger and more flexible than ordinary steel; back when swords were still used as weapons, Indo-Persian swords were highly valued throughout India and the Middle East because of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChlorine trifluoride:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This is the evil, HAZMAT twin of unobtainium, a material of unspecified composition that greatly endangers human life with the smallest spills or leaks.\u00A0Derek Lowe has a nightmarish description at\u00A0his blog.\u00A0From his article: \u0022It is, of course, extremely toxic, but that\u0027s the least of the problem.

It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, and asbestos, sand, and water-with which it reacts explosively.\u0022 There is a\u00A0rumor that the Germans produced as much as 30 tons of the stuff to use as\u00A0an incendiary weapon\u00A0and rocket fuel during\u00A0World War II, but\u00A0put it into the storage\u00A0after it became clear that the war is going nowhere \u2014 and then it simply\u00A0disappeared\u00A0somewhere...

Theoretically such femtotechnology could lead to a dazzling array of alternate chemistries. Thousands of alternate periodic tables may be possible, maybe more. The synthetic baryons all decay rapidly (the order of 10^-10 sec or shorter halflifes). The chemistry of an atom is determined by the electrons surrounding the nucleus. Atoms with synthetic baryons would be considered different isotopes of the same element. Recently a Japanese team reported the discovery of a so-called tetraquark \u2014 an exotic baryon consisting of four quarks instead of a normal three.

Not just any wood but the right kind of wood for the right jobs. Trees that had longer trunks, for instance, received favor, for their utility in building certain long parts of ships; oak was favored for many purposes\u2014especially for warships\u2014because it is sturdier (with live oak from the American South being particularly prized); trees with tall, straight trunks were needed to build masts; and pine was needed to produce pitch and tar, needed for waterproofing and other purposes (e.g. preventing\u00A0shipworm\u00A0from afflicting their vessels). This could often be an element and not always a positive one in the relations between Britain and America and Scandinavian countries, both of which were among the main suppliers. The loss of the American supply of timber, pitch, and tar for the Royal Navy was actually a key catalyst for the Industrial Revolution; the search for a source of pitch led a particularly hapless\u00A0poor Scottish earl\u00A0to develop processes to efficiently produce coal tar, which directly led to the first gas lighting (and therefore the 24-hour factory and shift work) and indirectly led to the modern chemical industry. Earlier the English were responsible for converting yew into the wooden Unobtanium du jour due to their legendary enthusiasm for longbows. While yew trees were common throughout Europe, good knot-free lengths suitable for bowmaking were rare. By the 15th century the English had instituted an import fee payable in yew staves on every ship coming into the country, and forests as far away as Austria were being pillaged for yew. Only the introduction of guns put a stop to the demand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-21T13:52:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2019 01:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by ARS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacescifi","CreatedById":197504,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-21T20:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223654183\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566280126\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/19/2019 at 10:48 PM, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny aluminium kitchen pot.
