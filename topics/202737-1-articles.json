So I want to look at setting up a refueling station somewhere in the Jool system. My first thought was in orbit around Laythe. The reason being I have had some landers able to get off Laythe, but not have much fuel left when they enter orbit, and a station could help that. Also, Laythe encounters are ridiculously easy. It is quite far from the\u00A0outer moons though, so maybe not ideal? Also, resupplying the station wouldn\u2019t be super easy. An orbital Pol or Bop station would be easy to resupply, but far from the inner moons. I guess the other possibility is to have the station in a Jool orbit, which I never really strongly considered, but maybe there is a good\u00A0reason to do that which I haven\u2019t thought of?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts on where it might be best?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Rylant\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-28T16:48:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2021 04:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Rylant\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-28T18:11:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion, orbital refuelling stations are awful.
