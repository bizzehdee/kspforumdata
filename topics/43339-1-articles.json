Its not about any mod, not a mod request (since such mods already exist) or a question to modders only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, how do you want to make a strut or fuel line the first part? It usually need a starting and end point. Same for radial attachable stuff. Most of the time you cannot do anything with it except attaching it to sth else. So it would not help in terms of subassemblies. I\u0027m sure there are other reasons why other parts are not available as the first one, although i don\u0027t know them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T17:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot only is this on the \u0022do not suggest\u0022 list, but if you\u0027d been reading the announcements of what the devs are working on, you\u0027d know that at least part of the reason it\u0027s on the list is because the devs agree and it is coming.

I think the first rule is a good rule, as I can\u0027t think of a single part that surface attaches that would make a reasonable core of the ship. The exception to this would be radial decouplers, though to be honest, that only matters when it comes to subassemblies, and I put the radial decouplers on the main craft and then mount the subassembly on them, so them not being an exception has never been a problem. I\u0027m less sure about the second rule but don\u0027t see it as a huge issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T19:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot only for all these reasons, but also because there\u0027s already a plugin called Subassembly Loader which does just that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sql_yoda","CreatedById":78737,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T03:02:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eric S\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eric S\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot only is this on the \u0022do not suggest\u0022 list, but if you\u0027d been reading the announcements of what the devs are working on, you\u0027d know that at least part of the reason it\u0027s on the list is because the devs agree and it is coming.
