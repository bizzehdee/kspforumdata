Like any serious student I look for the textbook / manual, ok, no manual but a huge Wiki, Great! Most of the stuff only about older versions of the game, not so great, but hey...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight, how to proceed? Training missions obviously, the way to learn and get a feel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027ve gone through the training missions and... well, I promised myself no expletives... So, the first 2 work. The others don\u0027t. I won\u0027t say too much about the clipped instructions that leave out a solid third of the stuff you as a newbie need to know, let\u0027s just say that the scripts in those missions could be more informative and leave it at that for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe others are bleeped, probably because nobody bothered to look them over before releasing new versions, my guess of course, they might have been rubbish right from the get go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, as most people do, I assumed I was the idiot, this is space flight after all, not easy, physics,math and stuff. But I checked the Wiki/forums and found one solution that clearly showed there actually was a wrong setting in the training craft, that mission cannot be completed unless you do stuff (to the parachute in this case) not mentioned anywhere in the mission instruction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt goes on, eventually I called the guy who recommended the game; engineer, smart guy, space nerd. Complained loudly. He laughs and says what I guess most of the folks on this here forum would say; \u0022Training missions? Man, why are you messing with them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause I want to learn, dammit, and these are supposed to help me do that, and it says \u00221.0.5\u0022 right at the bottom of the screen so this is the latest stuff, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWrong. It seems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I ask my friend, to check out the scenarios. His reply; \u0022Nothing wrong there, just had to tweak things a little, well one of the ships does actually have the wrong configuration, guess they missed that when they upgraded.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I told him to go back and play the tutorials, by the book, just as a complete newbie would, no tweaks, no shortcuts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was a bit more subdued the next time. \u0022They\u0027re unplayable, well, all but the first two.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Are we right? Are the Training Missions out of sync with the upgrades, if so that is really poor marketing. This thing sells on Steam now, tons of new users I would guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Has anybody of all you clever people out there run thru the Training Missions after 1.0.5? Would you do it? Just to see if my friend and I are right, and maybe at least post a list of stuff the the newbie user can do to struggle through?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnswers and comment would be much appriciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T01:14:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand your frustration and hopefully I can help put things in a better perspective for you. Right now the community is desperately waiting for an update to the game that will vastly improve performance and therefore the lives of the people playing the game a great deal. This update has taken quite longer than expected (on the order of several months) and has plagued progress in other areas. This is ok because the end result will be an overall better game but in the meantime things like the Training missions cannot receive the attention they gravely need. A lot of things actually have had to been put on the back-burner and despite the delays they do promise to tend to things that got looked over or left to sit. The good things is so far nothing had proven that they won\u0027t keep their promise and I do believe one day the Training mission will get a good looking over. With the limited knowledge the general public has of spaceflight and it\u0027s related activities, the Training missions should be treated as a critical bridging tool for new users.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Derfel99","CreatedById":155744,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T01:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for answering! Much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I figured something of the sort, but to my mind having faulty training Scenarios is actually worse than having no Training Scenarios as the frustration might cause people to drop the game and possibly curse it a bit in various places (Steam review section for instance), which really would be a shame considering the awesomeness of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisabling the Training Missions and attaching a simple note that explain that they will be back once they are updated might well have been a better solution than just leaving them as is and allowing new users to give themselves brain hernias trying to complete them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t mind my asking, is this why a lot of the user-created stuff is also un-updated to 1.0.5?

Also, if you do change plane at the Descending Node, you will have put yourself too far ahead of the target craft to be able to reach it within the next orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, you either do as you\u0027re told and burn 400m/s to change plane, then wait an orbit or five and change orbit for about 300m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, you change plane at the Ascending Note for 350m/s, then about a third of an orbit later do your orbital transfer for 300m/s. This is the simple solution that the tutorial should be telling you to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOR - smarter but NOT in the tutorial (and maybe a bit complicated for a beginner), you change orbit first at the Descending Node, then change plane when higher up. To do this you absolutely need to place two manouvre nodes at the same time. One at \u0022DN\u0022 with a prograde burn, then at the higher \u0022AN\u0022 to change plane to match the target.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, to get an intercept you actually need to burn a bit higher than the target orbit, because your first intercept (the only one marked for your transfer burn) will put you far ahead of the target. Since you are going higher, you will go slower than the target after that, and it\u0027ll catch up with you as you are on the way down AFTER the plane change. Once you\u0027ve placed a manouvre node at the \u0022AN\u0022 (now on the other side of the target orbit) and changed plane, you\u0027ll get a new intercept that should be a lot closer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guessed roughly and plotted a 295m/s transfer (prograde) burn, and after the plane change that gave a 72km intercept with the target ahead of me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to bring that distance down. Since the target is ahead, I need to go faster, meaning I need to keep my orbit smaller, so my first transfer burn has to be less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDragging my retrograde marker at the first node down to 291.2m/s gives me an intercept at 4.8km. Yay!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, doing that has necessarily changed the location of the plane change node, so I should really go back and fix it (even though it looks almost unchanged).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd after deleting the second node, placing it exactly on \u0022AN\u0022 and bringing the orbital inclination down to 0.0\u00B0 again - my intercept is 2.7km! Double yay!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTotal cost? 291m/s plus 199.8m/s . That means under 500m/s total instead of the 700m/s (and the long wait) that the tutorial proposed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a problem with this method though, which is that the second node will not update automatically while you are making a burn. So say at the end of the burn, you have 1.0 m/s still to do but if you burn, it starts heading back up again: stop! Delete the first node and click on the second one so that it updates. See where the intercept is. Burn a very small amount and click again, and again (or turn on RCS and use \u0022H\u0022 for prograde or \u0022N\u0022 for retrograde for finer control, but turn RCS off again afterwards) until the intercept is good. Then warp to the second node and change plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you can delete the second node and click the next two \u0022next\u0022 buttons in the tutorial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tutorial asks you to burn precisely down to 0.0m/s. Forget that: just create a node anywhere, giving 0.0m/s, and click next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, you need to plan your intercept. Create a new manouvre node on the intercept point. Then pull on the radial out vector until your orbit is fully inside the target orbit, and the prograde to increase it until your orbits are virtually identical. It doesn\u0027t have to be deadly accurate, what you want is a ballpark figure for your change in velocity, and your burn time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis should end up giving you about 360m/s to match the orbit of the target, and a burn time of about 30s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow - switch to your outside view and warp until you\u0027re about 2 minutes out. Go to target view like the tutorial says, and line up with the retrograde marker. If you properly set your manouvre node to match orbits, the blue marker should also be at almost exactly the same place. You\u0027ll also see the \u0022anti-target\u0022 pink marker very close by - and hopefully getting closer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you know that you need 30s to match speeds, you can wait until the target is much closer - at 40s it\u0027ll be about 16km away - before burning hard to bring relative speed down to under 50m/s. while burning, delete the manouvre node by clicking on the \u0022x\u0022 next to the countdown bar, and concentrate instead on the target velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you\u0027re under 50m/s, the tutorial will let you click the \u0022next\u0022 button. Your target ship will be anything from 5 to 12 km away (depending on how much nerve you had to wait before burning),\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tutorial\u0027s next suggestion is absolutely insane. You do not want to use RCS to bring your speed down from 50m/s to zero. That is just madness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you do not want to burn retrograde precisely because it\u0027ll just take years to manouvre close to your target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead, look at where the \u0022anti-target\u0022 pink marker is compared to retrograde.

When you burn, the retrograde marker will shift away from where you\u0027re pointing, and move over the target marker. If you pointed the right way, the two markers will be more-or-less in the same place once you\u0027ve lost half your speed relative to the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SPRnuyC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SPRnuyC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow warp forward for a while. You\u0027ll notice that the two markers (retrograde and anti-target) start to separate. Point to the other side of retrograde and burn again to align them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy now you should be going at around 10m/s towards the target, and it should be about 3 or 4 km way. NOW you do as the tutorial says. Point to retrograde, turn on RCS, use \u0022H\u0022 to thrust, and get your speed down to 0.0 or 0.1m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen turn off RCS, turn around, turn on RCS again and thrust \u0022H\u0022 towards the target until you\u0027re up to a few m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, if you correctly followed all the instructions about pushing the retrograde marker directly onto the anti-target marker, then coming to a stop was a complete waste of time since you were heading directly to the target at about 10m/s anyway. But Gene Kerman insists and he\u0027s boss...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWarp forward a bit. You will notice that again, the markers start to diverge. Now is the time to learn to use RCS properly. While pointing directly at the target, use the IJKL keys to move the prograde (yes, we\u0027ve turned around so it\u0027s prograde now) marker around. The slower you are going, the greater the effect. Bring the prograde marker back over the target. Warp some more, correct again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll also notice that these corrections have slowed you down compared to the target. Yes - all of this is manouvering is hugely wasteful, but it can\u0027t be helped now. What we should have done at the outset was perfect our intercept, perfect our orbit-matching node, and burn when the target was much, much closer. Or not bother with an orbit-matching node and trust in our feeling about how much time we need, and match speeds in gentle stages by pushing retrograde over the anti-target marker and keeping it there until the target is right on us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, for docking the tutorial gives very little help. Don\u0027t bother with docking mode: use IJKL and HN instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving around a dead ship to get the docking ports aligned is a nightmare. Instead, switch to the other ship, right-click the docking port on it and choose \u0022control from here\u0022. Then go to map view and click on the other ship and select it as target. Then move the ship until it is pointing the right way. Give a millisecond of warp to stop things from moving. Then switch back to your first ship and again, give a millisecond of warp. You should now have both docking ports pointing perfectly at each other and can use HN IJKL to move slowly up. Keep the prograde centred on the target marker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you approach, the target may drift away from your \u0022pointing\u0022 chevron. Don\u0027t try to realign with WASD - instead push the prograde slightly to the other side of the target marker. The effect of this will be to push the target marker back over your crosshairs - without adding an angle betwee your two ships\u0027 docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, yes, the docking tutorial doesn\u0027t really give the best instructions. If you follow them to the letter, you\u0027ll probably run out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, though, it has to be said that finding out what the tutorial is doing wrong is also a great way of learning \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-23T12:53:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2015 12:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T14:24:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the other tutorials:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- To the Mun Part 1: Fine - I deliberately played this approximately while following the instructions. That gets you to the Mun fine enough, though without enough fuel to land since I wasn\u0027t being particularly efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- To the Mun Part 2: The instructions for leaving the Mun are a bit off - a 270\u00B0 burn back to Kerbin SOI is really not the way to go, and the instructions afterwards to \u0022ignore a Mun intercept\u0022 is poor: it should add \u0022IF the intercept is after you pass Kerbin\u0022 because that 270\u00B0 burn could easily put you ahead of the Mun rather than behind it, where you want to be. What you really should do is burn 90\u00B0 (east) from the surface, get into a very low (9-10km) Mun orbit, then burn prograde as you start to approach that point of the orbit where you pass directly between the Mun and Kerbin. And the parachute is badly configured for 1.0.5 so you will die on splashdown: you need to raise the altitude to 1000 or 1500m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Asteroid Redirect 1: The instructions are not great. At that kind of distance you simply cannot configure a manouevre that will accurately intercept right at the edge of Kerbin SOI. Or if you do, your burn will never, ever stay exactly true to it. Since there is a Mun intercept on the next orbit, it is extremely difficult to set manouvre nodes properly since the slightest change makes enormous changes to the subsequent orbit, and the game keeps oscillating between orbits as it calculates the intercepts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best way of doing Asteroid Redirect 1 therefore seems to be: get a very approximate intercept, warp about halfway and try to place a new manouvre node to improve the intercept. While setting the node, if the intercept starts getting close before disappearing, then go back to the point before it disappears, burn that node then delete the node and continue burning a touch more to get your path approximately to where it should have been if the intercept hadn\u0027t disappeared. Warp halfway again, rinse and repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tutorial tells you much later to deploy your solar panels. You absolutely have to do this before leaving LKO because the ship steers like a cow with electricity, and like a dead cow without.
