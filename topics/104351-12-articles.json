Well done Squad, and thanks for listening to us about the round8 tank. \n\nI\u0027d just raise one point about the fairings and the way they separate; the picture makes it look like they break into many parts and separate kinda chaotically. I\u0027d hope that they come away as whole panels and that you get nice, geometrically pleasing separations with all panels moving away at the same rate."},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T02:32:06Z","Content":"I wish the larger xenon tank had a foil like texture link the original."},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T02:42:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Guys, guys!\n\u003E  The terrain around KSC is not flat anymore. \n\u003E \n\u003E  I hope you\u0027ve practiced landing in the runway.\n\nMan, Tayler Raiz will have fun trying to land his OV-X and other re-usable launchers now...

Maybe only for small details, like when your kerbal stands on it, it would look like there are rocks ans footsteps, etc on it. Why create an illusion of bumpy terrain when you can actually make it bumpy? From this distance, the system they are using, is perfectly capable of presenting the actual look of that terrain. And anyways, if it would be normal map, how do you imagine getting closer to it? It would gradually fade out?
