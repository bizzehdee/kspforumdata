You only start with 3 so there is a limitation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo Cheats of any kind....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The first launch I ended up killing a Kerbal. No big deal just add another one. Then I started building my new rocket and noticed I was adding a large number of safety features to ensure their survival. It was much heaver and harder to get into orbit. I also started caring more about the little guys safety, knowing full well if he died I only had one more backup. Well Jeb completed the mission and 3 more allowing me research probes. I was so happy when I got access to a probe. I could finally do more experimentation without the loss of life. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It was here that I realized the game was exponentially more fun for me. Kerbals became a limited resource that I had to manage and take care of the little guys. Each time a rocket exploded on the launched or a parachute ripped off during decent I felt a cringe in my stomach hoping that I had a reserve Kerbal in the ranks. Also to the opposite extreme, when I was able to get Jeb home safely after a malfunction it was increasingly more satisfying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really enjoyed playing like this and I cant wait for money to be introduced as a play mechanic. I realize this is not for everyone but give it a try, see if you like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3vAhByC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223vAhByC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joel Dryden","CreatedById":76304,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T23:57:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeen doing this with the new mission controller, add\u0027s a little bit of direction for each mission while having a cost limit, etc. Mixed with playing like that is actually quite fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf FScience (Another mod) were to allow you to not only put all and any data into a command pod, but put it only a kerbal as well, with slight diminishing results, you could send recovery craft and get half the science, if the ship didn\u0027t make it, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun to play perma death mode/no take backs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T00:03:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to Mission Reports. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
