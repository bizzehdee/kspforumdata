One is fixed, with it\u0027s origin at the center of the sun at the time the simulation starts, and the other one is relative to the craft and thus also constantly rotating. (I would love to do all in one coordinate system but creation of crafts with wing and engine positions and orientations would get really ugly.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo transform a vector from the global c system to the local one i obviously need a description of both systems. I have the x,y and z vectors of the global c system of course, but the problems begin with the other vectors. I have the direction the craft points at, but i would need a second, perpendicular vector (third vector would be cross product of first two) since how the craft is rolled matters for the coordinate system and thus the transformation. I plan to use the port (\u0022left\u0022) vector, to give me \u0022up\u0022 as the cross product of \u0022forward\u0022 and \u0022port\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENow, my problem is:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do i get the second (i.e. port) vector for a complete description of the attitude? The only possibility i came up with so far is that i set it up manually once when the simulation begins, and then rotate it whenever the craft rotates. But that sounds quite dirty and i don\u0027t know if the accumulative error would not get noticeable after a while (although i do use the GNU MPFR C\u002B\u002B library for arbitrary precision arithmetic so i could just use more Bit if the error gets too big?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative might be introducing a value (angle) for roll and then get to the port vector with some rotation and cross product magic, but the problem with an angle would be that it breaks down for certain situations (flying straight up / down) so i really want to avoid that if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, any thoughts on how to tackle this issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(If you happen to know how KSP handles attitude that would of course be nice to know too.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope i could describe my problem clearly, if not i apologize and i can try again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T16:13:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 04:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kertherina\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T16:34:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you describe the problem a bit better?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could use the center of mass of the vehicle as the vehicles origin, and calculate that in the global coordinate plane.

You need local coordinate system to draw the ship\u0027s parts. Also to simulate the forces on all of the ship\u0027s parts. Clearly, a real ship can rotate. So the side/port vector will change with the ship\u0027s roll. If you want to simulate flight, you should keep track of it. And yes, errors will accumulate, but if you have stable flight, that will be consistent with typical effects of things like parasitic drag and other sources of torque on the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if your simulation doesn\u0027t care about the ship\u0027s roll, and you wish to simulate it as if the ship was maintaining constant attitude, your best bet is to simply choose a vector that\u0027s orthogonal to heading and the radial. In other words, just take ship\u0027s position vector in global coordinate system, which is along the radial, and cross it into ship\u0027s velocity vector, which I assume you treat as your forward vector. The resulting vector will be in the port direction. You just need to normalize it. The only potential problem is if ship\u0027s velocity becomes purely radial. You might want to check for that if you think it\u0027s ever a possibility.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kertherina","CreatedById":109293,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T01:13:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you have a Patched-Conics Approximation set up, or at least one where the exact position can be determined beforehand?
