Sorry I don\u0027t have pictures, but I can never get them to work anyways. Basically, just walk up to either the launch pad flagpole or the astronaut complex one and then itll give you the option to climb it. If someone can post pictures of this that\u0027d be great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MadHorse","CreatedById":84126,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T15:32:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was possible in 0.21 (haven\u0027t played before..) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nkCoveP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nkCoveP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oddible","CreatedById":74605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T15:54:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESure was...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1fF8pKo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221fF8pKo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceSphereOfDeath","CreatedById":69754,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T15:59:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wont bother posting a picture, but it\u0027s perfectly possible\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T16:16:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy haven\u0027t I ever thought of this?!
