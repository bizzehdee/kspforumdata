You can also use the Add Maneuver tool to plan those burns and find how much time is needed to complete the maneuver. Note, it doesn\u0027t take much thrust to alter the altitude of the orbit once in orbit. it takes a lot more thrust to alter the orbital plane, applying thrust at an angle to the direction of travel in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for planning a Mun maneuver, the same tool can be used to plan for the encounter. It will show up as an altered path when you get it in the right location by moving its location and adjusting the handles, then your goal is to fine tune for the most efficient burn to get there.

Start out slow. I did with a suborbital crafts, then added a second stage and following the advice of how to do the gravity turn, got my two stage design into orbit with enough fuel left to bring it back down safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo raise the lowest point of the orbit, wait until your spaceship is almost at the highest point and pointing directly in the direction of travel. Use the Nav Ball to orient the ship correctly. Do a short burn and check the lowest point to see if it went up. Do the opposite for the lowest point to bring the highest point down - in that case, you burn against the direction of travel. Pointing the ship up or down or left or right will use excessive amount of fuel to get the change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn orbital mechanics, real space flight or the KSP simulator, the shortest path to a destination is always a curve since everything, Kerbal, Mum, your spaceship, is always moving and under the influence of gravity. And, it is in 3-D. So, if you didn\u0027t launch into orbit heading due east, your orbit will be in a different plane then Mum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen planning the maneuver for an intercept to Mum using the add maneuver command and moving the handles, your orbit will become elliptical. When that path comes under the influence of Mum\u0027s gravity, you will see the path being altered. That is what you are looking for. Fine tune the maneuver location and handles to get the most efficient Mum encounter possible. Again, if you are not sure how it is done, go review the tutorials, then experiment on your own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperiment to see what works and what doesn\u0027t. This is how you will learn how to control a space craft in orbit. Soon, you will become an expert and be ready for something more challenging. If totally stumped, go to the tutorial videos and try what others have done successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that during the days of Apollo, the flight engineers had to calculate orbital mechanics with slide rules and computers so primitive that they had to be programmed with a hexadecimal keypad for every maneuver executed during flight. There was no KSP for them to train on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I has set up a very efficient Mum encounter with a 12 second burn which would have place me close for an orbital insertion.

Of course it depends how fast your ship can decelerate - if your ship\u0027s slow, you gotta do it earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you slow down, your retrograde marker\u0027ll naturally start to point more towards the center of the blue area on your navball - that\u0027s right straight up, cuz you\u0027ll be killing your horizontal velocity and the moon\u0027ll be pulling you straight down. You definitely want your retrograde marker to be as close to straight up as possible before you hit the ground. You\u0027ll find you can sorta \u0027push\u0027 it around by burning on the side of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is a big help I never noticed that marker, thank you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe maneuver node method is a little complicated i\u0027ll have to try that when I have my ship perfected\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T11:31:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dramabeats\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dramabeats\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethis is a big help I never noticed that marker, thank you\u003Cp\u003Ethe maneuver node method is a little complicated i\u0027ll have to try that when I have my ship perfected\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will save you tons of fuel as you use its handles to search for the most efficient maneuvers. Most useful for reaching targets that do not lie on your orbital plane. Do plan on doing correction burns later to fine tune your course. They should be quite short lasting only a few seconds. And, as I found out last night, split the burn time. If your burn time is 20 seconds, start the burn at ten seconds to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
