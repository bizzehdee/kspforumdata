At first i could not do IVA in the habitation module and the greenhouse module, as well as i could not get the \u0022Deploy\u0022 option when i try to deploy them. I could only do that if i already programmed a key to do this before flight. After i verified my game cache I could finally do IVAs, and i can right click the greenhouse and deploy this, but not the hab module. Funny thing is, that when i transfer a crew to the hab module, im not getting any options at all from any of the other modules, apart from seeing the electric charge. If i transfer my crewman back to a planetary cupola i get the \u0022crew report\u0022, \u0022lights on\u0022 and \u0022transparant\u0022 option back.\n\u003E \n\u003E Im not running many mods so i doubt its a conflicting mod thats causing this. I hope someone knows whats going on here ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAbout what habitat are you talking when you say that there is no option to deploy it?\n\nThere are two, the MK1 cannot be deployed and always can hold kerbals. The MK2 can be deployed and only can house Kerbals when deployed. Guessing from your post that you can move a Kerbal into the Habitat, you are talking about MK1.\n\nFor the other problem: Is it possible that there is no Kerbal inside a Command Module or Cupola after you moved him/her into the Habitat? These are the only two modules that can be used to control your craft. When no Kerbal is inside of one of them and you don\u0027t have a Probe-Core on the vessel then you don\u0027t have control over it. \n\nCould you try out the same with lets say the \u0022K\u0026K Planetary Automated Control \u0022HAL\u0022 probe core is also part of the vessel and see of you can interact with the vessel then?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Not sure. CKAN still shows v0.2.7b as the latest version. You could try messaging the CKAN people (or posting in the CKAN thread) for advice; I\u0027ve always found them to be very helpful.\n\nI discovered that a nice person already made a pull request on CKAN for changes to make it work again before i even new that there was something wrong. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIt is working again now.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I gotta say, im impressed. Downloaded this mod not too long ago, and I have been plesently suprised with the results so far. Few things though. I really wish there was a good way to allow me to move only one part of a base set up with a 2.5m sized rocket. A K\u0026K to 2.5m single point adapter would be nice. Having made most mun missions with almost the same launch kit, Im kind of fond of it. The base wheels are an amazing thing (no preciece landings here).\n\nGotta think about that ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E CKAN is now showing and correctly downloading 0.2.8 (or at least was for me a couple of minutes ago).\n\nThanks!
