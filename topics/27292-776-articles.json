I have a crew orbiting the MUN but out of fuel to get home. Seems simple enough. First mistake (besides running out of fuel in the first place) was wasting too much trying to get closer (initial intercept was several kilometers apart). Then, when the rescue craft ran out of mono-propellant I switched to the lander to discover the symmetry was wrong on the nozzles on the lander... that was the second mistake. With only two nozzles, I could only translate up and down. I was able to hack it and kind of get things close enough by rotating 90 degrees to go left/right, then another 90 to go up/down ... That kinda worked until I got within a few meters and there wasn\u0027t enough time to rotate 90 to make the corrections.
