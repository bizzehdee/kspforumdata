I hadn\u0027t unlocked or used any fairings yet. I took the contract to test the stock fairing (EF1?) but when I would try to equip it under my command module I would just get blue lines no matter what, and it would always say 0 parts protected. I played with the settings, looked online, but couldn\u0027t figure it out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to unlock fairings on the tech tree (I also have community tech tree if that matters), which worked, but I still couldn\u0027t figure out how to use any of them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo then I tried closing the game, uninstalling both procedural fairings, and opening it up. Now all the new fairings and aerodynamic stuff was gone from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, including the experimental one I was supposed to be testing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I put the mods back, and it returned the procedural fairings to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but none of the other stock stuff, including the experimental one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is my next step? I\u0027m kind of stuck. I spent a couple hours fighting with this last night and searching online and I don\u0027t know what to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kchinger","CreatedById":200571,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-03T03:38:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I removed procedural fairings and a couple other mods, reset to a slightly older save, and was able to get the fairing to work, parts seem to be where they should be.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dante80","CreatedById":91509,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-04T10:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProcedural fairings works fine, you can re-intall it if you like.
