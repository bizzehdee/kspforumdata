Everything it does can be traced back and get a reason as to why it did what it did. To me, what you said sounded like the code is just making things up as it went along, but I know you didn\u0027t imply such a thing. The software will act only on certain inputs and conditions, and the conditions during your testing yielded the results you\u0027ve come up with, which differed from mine, and my experiment was due to missing information. The testing I did didn\u0027t produce the same results you got when I ran my 8 scanner probe at 100x. What you\u0027re seeing at your end is happening for a particular reason due to the code, not because of some magic that is going on in the background.

What happened in my case was I started all the scanners at the same time, so, the events probably were firing at the same time, and I PROBABLY was hitting better than 1fps at 100x, so I was being blocked by the timer duration. Since each scanner operates on its own timer, yeah, I can see how you\u0027d get the better resolution at faster speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022elfindreams\u0022 data-cite=\u0022elfindreams\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key isn\u0027t how often FixedUpdate vs Update is called it is based on the cycle time of the modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have the code or game in front of me so I am going to invent some numbers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Say you have one scanner with a scan time of 1.5s, it hits an update and sees it hasn\u0027t added anything in over 1.5s, it puts a dot... repeat over the planets surface you will have missing dots due to gaps in scan time...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have three scanners each with a scan time of 1.5s you can stagger them so they are .5s apart and detect 3 dots for every one of the other scenerio...
