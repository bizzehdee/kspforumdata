For one, they are cute and (I at least) have grown pretty attached to them. I could also see an argument about how changing them to humans may limit the ability of educators to use KSP as a teaching tool since people could protest over a game where kids can intentionally build death traps for their astronauts/kerbonaughts should they be humans (of course, as a mod that isn\u0027t likely to be an issue).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sandworm","CreatedById":66244,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ImJake\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ImJake\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf anyone has time to create it, I\u0027d like to see a mod that replace the kerbal models with genderless, faceless, perfectly humanoid astronauts.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt isn\u0027t easy. 3d models of human faces are just about the hardest thing in modeling to pull off.

We couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do the retarget with Mechanim inside Unity because we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re using the legacy animation system, which is extremely technical and not animator-friendly. It will need some further tweaking once some other dev has a look at the code and the way the animations are being called. \u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s another part of the Kerbal assets that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s being run with Mechanim: facial expressions.

Since the connection inside Maya overrides some other rig properties, reworking the animations there could be a little problematic.
