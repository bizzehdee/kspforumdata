Personally I think they do, but I\u0027d be curious to see what the game would be like without them. If anyone has time to create it, I\u0027d like to see a mod that replace the kerbal models with genderless, faceless, perfectly humanoid astronauts. If you want to be really thorough, you could also rid the kerbals in the advice text boxes and in the buildings like the VAB, astronaut complex, administration building, ect."},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:10:42Z","Content":"This would probably be a fairly simple mod (basically a texture replacer), however I suspect a lot of people prefer the kerbals for a bunch of reasons. For one, they are cute and (I at least) have grown pretty attached to them. I could also see an argument about how changing them to humans may limit the ability of educators to use KSP as a teaching tool since people could protest over a game where kids can intentionally build death traps for their astronauts/kerbonaughts should they be humans (of course, as a mod that isn\u0027t likely to be an issue)."},{"CreatedByName":"Sandworm","CreatedById":66244,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:46:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If anyone has time to create it, I\u0027d like to see a mod that replace the kerbal models with genderless, faceless, perfectly humanoid astronauts.\n\nIt isn\u0027t easy. 3d models of human faces are just about the hardest thing in modeling to pull off.

I find it captures the essence of KSP quite well.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As a simulation, it would be easy for Kerbal Spaaace Program to feel cold and dry\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AClike a game designed for an audience of tweed wearing, bushy eyebrow sporting physics professors. That it isn\u0027t is all down to the presentation, and the nature of the Kerbals themselves. They\u0027re clumsy, bumbling tinkerers\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACrated in-game for their courage and stupidity. It\u0027s the Kerbals that bring physics down to the layman\u0027s level. They\u0027re what stops KSP being about formulas and equations, and make it instead about slapdash engineering. In the context of Kerbal mission control, it makes sense that my moon lander was crudely bolted to the top of a barely functional ship. It makes sense that there\u0027s a Kerbal stranded in orbit\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACand that, years later, he\u0027s still wearing a big, ....-eating grin."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T02:38:56Z","Content":"As per the existing topic here, I\u0027ve pointed out that replacing the Kerbal EVA models with humans is *not* a trivial task - the Kerbal model is compiled into the game itself, and the skeleton / animations need to be completely redone for humans:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115432-Humanization](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115432-Humanization)"},{"CreatedByName":"ImJake","CreatedById":100029,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T02:58:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It isn\u0027t easy. 3d models of human faces are just about the hardest thing in modeling to pull off.

Its mascot characters with \u0022courage\u0022 and \u0022stupidity\u0022 are an anchor that gave early adopters something more to talk about than building rockets, how hard it was to get your first orbit or first rendezvous, and spaceship explosions.\n\nI\u0027m *not* an early adopter, I came in with 23.5. I started hearing about the game, and it sounded interesting because of player\u0027s funny stories involving Kerbal misadventures - which also told about the spaceship lego mechanics and learning curve underneath it all. It\u0027s a package.\n\n###\n\nThe human mod described tho, would be useful for \u0022total conversions,\u0022 things like RSS, and could lead to even more TV news broadcasts using KSP like Photoshop, to illustrate space scenarios and news events. Sumghai clearly knows of the amount of work involved... I found another clue in this Devnote Tuesday post:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Daniel (danRosas): I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on the female Kerbals: I had to do a quick retarget inside Maya of all the animations that are being used in Unity. We couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do the retarget with Mechanim inside Unity because we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re using the legacy animation system, which is extremely technical and not animator-friendly. It will need some further tweaking once some other dev has a look at the code and the way the animations are being called. \n\u003E In the meantime there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s another part of the Kerbal assets that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s being run with Mechanim: facial expressions. IVA Kerbals look good, although there are some troubles with the position of the arms and feet, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m already targeting how to solve those problems in two different ways: I could save a pose inside Maya and apply it to the beginning of each animation, or I could override the bones in Unity. Since the connection inside Maya overrides some other rig properties, reworking the animations there could be a little problematic. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m learning to stop using the Expression Editor as there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s plenty of freedom with the utility nodes to start messing around with always-running calculations."},{"CreatedByName":"Solarspaceprobe","CreatedById":125110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T22:04:32Z","Content":"Well...kerbals really made it special, in my opinion. They made some of the small gaps in realism acceptable. It\u0027s much harder to accept a billion identical humans than kerbals. Overall, I would find it weird to use humans alongside most KSP contraptions. As mascots and characters, I\u0027d probably like KSP a lot less, and it likely would be missing identity."},{"CreatedByName":"TiktaalikDreaming","CreatedById":136290,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T03:45:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As per the existing topic here, I\u0027ve pointed out that replacing the Kerbal EVA models with humans is *not* a trivial task - the Kerbal model is compiled into the game itself, and the skeleton / animations need to be completely redone for humans:\n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115432-Humanization](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115432-Humanization)\n\nWhile picking out reasons this wouldn\u0027t be easy, keep in mind Kerbals are about 1m tall. All the crew capsules, and thus all the other parts, would need to be scaled x2.0, with weight etc x8. The Earth is larger, with more deltaV required, but I\u0027m pretty sure there\u0027s already (or were) mods to do that. Kerbals are the excuse for making a lot of things a bit easier."}]}
