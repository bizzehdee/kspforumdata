That will make it re-download all the correctly configured parts.

It now being utterly meaningless, it was removed in 1.0.1. Drag is dependent on orientation and mach number (and if any parts are occluding the part) so you can\u0027t boil it down to one number. If you want a per-part drag display, *in flight* go to the debug menu and then physics-\u003Edrag and turn on \u0022show drag data\u0022 and it will appear in part right-click menus."},{"CreatedByName":"TokiTech","CreatedById":131500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T06:14:57Z","Content":"Thanks for the insight. Is different from what i anticipated with the new drag system which i thought is still based on the drag value."}]}
