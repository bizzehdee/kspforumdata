At the Kerbal Space Center, Jebediah \u201CJeb\u2019 Kerman becomes the first Kerbal to become a \u003Cstrong\u003Ekerbonaut\u003C/strong\u003E.

Jeb, as he prefers to be called, has been a test pilot before joining the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003C/em\u003Ein the role of kerbonaut pilot. He was tasked with being the first kerbbed crew on a rocket propelled vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new vehicle, titled \u003Cem\u003EKerbin I\u003C/em\u003E, was launched into the sky on a plume of smoke and fire in the early afternoon. The rocket travelled 10km into the sky before slowing down and returning to Kerbin\u2019s surface. The return was aided by a parachute on the top of the \u201Ccommand pod\u201D, a gum drop shaped capsule on top of the rocket. The kerbonaut and his vessel broke height and speed records on this historic first journey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene Kerman, Flight Director for the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003C/em\u003Esaid that this mission was an important first step for future space exploration. Gene said, \u201C\u003Cem\u003EKerbin I\u003C/em\u003E, while only going up 10,000 meters, proves that we can use rockets for powered launches. This one small step is actually a giant leap for all kerbals.\u201D Gene also stated that this launch will be only the first of many with the goal being an actual Kerbal in orbit around Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter his return, Jeb Kerman described his historic flight. \u201CThe lift off couldn\u2019t have been more perfect. I was slammed to my seat and felt some gee\u2019s [Gravitational Force] like I haven\u2019t since my test flying days.\u201D Jeb also talked about the sheer joy of knowing that his experience would allow kerbals to explore the space around Kerbin and in time, the other planets as well. When asked if the program could really reach other worlds, Jeb said, \u201Ccertainly. Getting into orbit is half way to anywhere you want to go. We could get to Mun before the end of the year.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhether the claims of kerbals on Mun are the stuff of science fantasy or within the grasp of the Kerbal Space Program, one thing is sure this day.

When he came on, we were mostly scientists and engineers. His flight experience and degrees in Aerodynamic Theory and Avionics have been crucial in both kerbbed and remote piloted endeavors,\u201D Gene said. He also stated that Jeb\u2019s skills helped the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003C/em\u003Esolve problems they didn\u2019t realize they had.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring his off time between design and piloting, Jeb gives tours around the fledgling \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003C/em\u003Eto school groups.

The \u003Cem\u003EKerbin II\u003C/em\u003E, the second vessel launched from the Kerbal Space Center (\u003Cem\u003EKSC\u003C/em\u003E), was nearly identical to the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin I\u003C/em\u003E rocket launched at the first of the year. Using the same Mk1 Command Pod and RT-5 Solid Rocket Boosters, the main different was scientific equipment attached to the vessel to allow data about kerbbed flight on rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob Kerman, the kerbonaut for this launch, is a scientist by profession. He was chosen for this delicate mission due to his knowledge about the science equipment that was being used on the launch. The launch went successfully. The \u003Cem\u003EKerbin II \u003C/em\u003Esoared into the sky to a height of 7km. As it fell back to Kerbin, the parachute opened successfully. As it landed back on the ground, tragedy struck. The RT-5 rocket on the bottom of the craft exploded on impact. Fire crews and technical personal rushed to assist. While there were no flames to be seen, concern was high for the kerbonaut inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob Kerman emerged from the capsule unharmed. While looking shaken, his first concern was the retrieval of the scientific data that he has mission had been the focus of. On the ride back to the \u003Cem\u003EKSC\u003C/em\u003E, he was reported to be in good spirits, but with a slightly delayed response to questions. Further updates about his condition will be reported as they are provided.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBobak Kerman, Mission Controller was on hand to answer questions. When asked if Bob Kerman was qualified to fly the mission, his response was guarded. \u201CWe believe that any kerbal is capable of being a kerbonaut. Bob has had extensive time in the simulator and has had flight lessons with Jeb[ediah Kerman].\u201D He said that future missions would evaluate the skills needed and that would impact the crew roster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiscussions of what went wrong with the landing were speculative. Bobak explained that the Operations team had added the science instrumentation late in the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin II\u003C/em\u003E\u2019s design. And while it was too early to have concrete answers, they speculated that \u201Cthe additional weight over-exerted the parachute\u201D.

Gene Kerman said that \u201Cthe possibility of accidents in any new endeavor exist. But we at the \u003Cem\u003EKSC \u003C/em\u003Ewill strive to remove any risks we can.\u201D While these words are reassuring, today\u2019s events are a sobering reminder of the dangers of space flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/2uyBd/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProfile of a Kerbonaut\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob Kerman always knew he wanted to go to space.

Bob graduated from University with degrees in Applied Rocket Science and Theoretical Orbital Mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus Kerman, Head of Applied Sciences, say Bob is the best kind of kerbal. \u201CI knew that Bob would be one of the \u2018First Four\u2019, his desire for knowledge has never been quenched by books or distant observation, he has to go there,\u201D said Linus. Valentina Kerman, another kerbonaut and one of the \u201CFirst Four\u201D, said that Bob was \u201Cthe kind of guy that sees a problem, figures out the solution, and then goes and gets the wrench to fix the problem himself.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbin II\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u003Cem\u003E Kerbin II\u003C/em\u003E space craft is based on the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin I\u003C/em\u003E. The differences are hard to see unless you look up close. While sporting the same Mk1 Command Pod and RT-5 booster, the inside is where it counts. The \u003Cem\u003EKerbin II\u003C/em\u003E is equipped with Crew Report log systems to allow the Kerbal Space Center (\u003Cem\u003EKSC\u003C/em\u003E) to have a detailed voice recorded log of what the kerbonaut aboard is experiencing.

The youngest of the Kerbal Space Center\u2019s (KSC) \u201CFirst Four\u201D kerbonauts, Valentina piloted the new Kerbin III rocket to a height of 21km, breaking the between lower and upper atmospheres. While traveling up there, she surpassed speed records set by Jebediah \u201CJeb\u201D Kerman on his Kerbin I launch. After Valentina\u2019s record breaking flight, her Kerbin III capsule descended back down to Kerbin and splashed down in the ocean, Rescue and retrieval crews quickly fished the excited kerbonaut out of the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStanding on the launch pad, the Kerbin III was an impressive site. Taller than the last two rockets the KSC has launched. It had a RT-5 booster with fins on the bottom and another RT-5 booster on top of it. The Mk1 Command Pod sat on the very top of the stack. When the first rocket had finished burning its solid fuel, a series of explosions sheered the first rocket from the second. Then, moments after the bottom began to tumble back to Kerbin, the second rocket fired and flew even faster into the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen returned to the KSC, Valentina was literally bouncing up and down with excitement. \u201CIt was awesome!\u201D, she exclaimed when asked for a statement. Valentina went on to describe the incredible feeling of acceleration as her craft launched into the air. \u201CWhen the first Flea [nickname for the RT-5] finished burning, I was thrown into the harness. And then \u2018BOOM\u2019 and the second Flea fires up and I was slammed back into the couch again.\u201D She had to be firmly escorted to the medical station for examination of any possible injuries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene Kerman, Flight Director was on hand to take questions. He first stated how proud he was of the Kerbin III launch. \u201CThis is an incredible moment for Val and all of us. We tested out some new hardware and concepts today and they worked flawlessly,\u201D Gene said. When asked about the delay between launches of Kerbin II and Kerbin III, Gene attributed that to two reason. \u201COf course, the crash landing of Kerbin II gave us pause. But the other was simply a case of economics. Without being able to reuse Kerbin II\u2019s RT-5 booster, we had to manufacture a new one.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen questioned on what Kerbin II had taught the KSC about mission safety, Gene was quick to point out several changes to Kebin III. First, the rocket was pointed out over the ocean for its flight. \u201CThat was intentional\u201D, Gene said. \u201CThat way there will be a softer landing for our kerbonauts. And anything that could go wrong will not fall back to land.\u201D In addition, until better technologies become available, Gene said that only the Mk1 Command Pod would be reused. \u201CWe actually jettisoned the RT-5 attached to the capsule before splashdown so lessen the weight.\u201D He assured that every possible step was being taken to safely explore space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/qsTZ9/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProfile of a Kerbonaut\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina Kerman loves being a kerbonaut. A member of the \u201CFirst Four\u201D, she was selected due to her unconventional thinking about space. Bill Kerman, a fellow \u201CFirst Four\u201D kerbonaut and engineer says with a smile, \u201CI remember when she was an applicant. She couldn\u2019t sit still in the chair, was tapping the table with her pencil, and humming the tune from that annoying gum commercial.\u201D But when Bill interviewed her, she described the idea of monopropellant backpacks, essentially tiny rockets that are worn for travel by kerbonauts when out of vehicles. \u201CWe hadn\u2019t even thought about what would be needed for EVA [extra-vehicular activity] and she was already solving how you\u2019d get around out there\u201D, Bill said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith her ability to come at problems laterally, she was hired and became a pilot for the fledgling space program. Advances she\u2019s developed for training are a centrifuge chair, using rapid lift and dive flights by plane to train for weightlessness, and dehydrated ice cream for snacks when in space. All of these achievements have impressed the Research and Development team. Linus Kerman, Head of Applied Sciences said that she was even working on a pen that could write without gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina, although playful described as a explosive ball of energy, has a remarkable focus when performing training exercises. Whether in the Centrifuge Chair, the \u201CBarf Bomber\u201D, or being required to sit for hours in the simulation pods, she never complains, fidgets, or loses sight of her objectives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbin III\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two stage Kerbin III is a proof of concept that rockets don\u2019t need to be one piece. Essentially, a Kerbin I/II placed on top of an addition RT-5 rocket booster, the Kerbal Space Center (KSC) says that there is much more to the design than that. Valentina Kerman, kerbonaut, explained that the multi-stage design needed entirely new maths. \u201CYou can\u2019t just slam two Fleas [nickname for RT-5] together and hope they work. Both booster need to be balanced for each other. The first stage, to accommodate the weight of the entire stack, and the second stage to take in account the higher altitude and reduced wind resistance.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other significant technologies incorporated into the Kerbin III was a Ionic Symphonic Protonic Electronics Communitron 16 antenna. The retractable system will allow communication with the KSC when vessels are high in the atmosphere and space, where traditional radio systems will not work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the Kerbin III is the test to see if staged designs will work, the KSC has already begun construction of its successor. What new improvements will be included in the Kerbin IV are unknown. But hopefully the Kerbin III will have a safe flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-07T23:22:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2015 11:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Daelkyr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGot the date wrong on\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daelkyr","CreatedById":149075,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T23:16:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EJebediah Kerman\u003Cstrong\u003E FIRST KERBAL IN SPACE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy Walter Kerman \u2013 The Daily Planet \u2013 Eelops 14, 720\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the early morning light, the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin IV \u003C/em\u003Esat on the launch pad at the Kerbin Space Center (\u003Cem\u003EKSC\u003C/em\u003E). The new two stage design was again used by the \u003Cem\u003EKSC\u003C/em\u003E. With the familiar Mk1 Command Pod and a RT-5 booster as the upper stage, a new taller RT-10 booster was used for the lower stage. The rocket, sitting majestically, waited for over an hour as final pre-flight checks on the new booster were finished. Jebediah \u201CJeb\u201D Kerman, the pilot for this flight sat patiently in the command pod waiting for lift off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, after a two and one half hour delay, the countdown resumed. At zero, Jebediah Kerman lifted off the launch pad on a deafening ball of flame. The new RT-10 booster sailed up to the upper atmosphere before being spent and detached. Then the venerable RT-5 was ignited and carried Jeb the rest of the way into outer space. His capsule reached a height of 90 km, 20 km past the atmosphere of Kerbin. While in outer space, Jeb experience weightlessness for 1 minute before his capsule returned back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe descent was incredibly fast. As the Mk1 Pod re-entered the atmosphere, it began to push against that the air so hard that the air ignited into flames. Bob Kerman, \u201CFirst Four\u201D kerbonaut, said that the flames (called plasma) were nearly as hot as Kerbol itself. The descent trajectory was arced in a way to allow Jeb\u2019s pod to literally burn off excess speed in the air while falling back over the ocean. At 3000 meters, the chute opened, slowing the Kerbin IV to a gentle walking speed as it splashed into the ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBobak Kerman, Mission Controller, was available to discuss this historic event. When asked if all mission objectives were met, Bobak said that the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin IV\u003C/em\u003E and Jeb had exceeded all goals. \u201CWe not only went into space, we proved the Mk1 capable of re-entry using aerobraking [using the atmosphere to slow down a craft], we proved that kerbals can function in weightlessness, and that multi-stage rockets will be the answer to space travel,\u201D Bobak said. He was especially proud of Jeb, who was able to complete all of his assigned scientific tasks while also piloting the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen asked by Bill Kerman or Bob Kerman hadn\u2019t been on the flight roster for this mission, Bobak explained that after \u003Cem\u003EKerbin II\u003C/em\u003E, the decision was made to always have a pilot in command of the capsule. \u201CUntil we come up with better automated systems or a two kerbal capsule, we\u2019ll have to train our pilots to be science assistants.\u201D This policy, along with landing capsules in water, are continuing reminders of the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin II\u003C/em\u003E accident and the possible dangers of space travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides the science data that Jeb collected on \u003Cem\u003EKerbin IV\u003C/em\u003E, he also took several images. They show Kerbin from space. These incredible images are an inspiration to all Kerbin. With the success of \u003Cem\u003EKerbin IV\u003C/em\u003E, the question of what\u2019s next for the \u003Cem\u003EKSC \u003C/em\u003Ewas answered with a single word and a smile. \u201COrbit.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/vqa5x/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EInterview with a Kerbonaut -\u00A0\u201CJeb\u201D Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWalter Kerman had the opportunity to meet with Jebediah \u201CJeb\u201D Kerman just after his historic flight on Kerbin IV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWalter Kerman (W): \u003C/strong\u003EJeb, how was this flight compared to Kerbin I?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EJebediah Kerman (J):\u003C/strong\u003E Well, for one thing, I went a lot higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EW:\u003C/strong\u003E *Chuckles* You did.

A new trend of delays keep the\u003Cem\u003E Kerbin V \u003C/em\u003Eidling on the launch pad for nearly three hours. The pre-dawn launch turned into a noon take off due to Operations and Research and Development making sure the new Liquid Fuel/Oxygen (LFO) tanks and LV-T30 Liquid Fuel engine that comprised the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin V\u2019\u003C/em\u003Es upper stage were in working top shape condition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the countdown was completed, \u003Cem\u003EKerbin V\u003C/em\u003E\u2019s RT-10 lower stage ignited and hurled Valentina skyward. While the RT-10 lower stage was able to hit 18 km in height, it didn\u2019t reach the 20 km that Jeb\u2019s \u003Cem\u003EKerbin IV\u003C/em\u003E did on its record breaking flight. Once the lower stage dropped away, however, the new LV-T30\u2019s ignition could be heard all the way back to the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new rocket motor hurled Valentina and her\u003Cem\u003E Kerbin V\u003C/em\u003E, a heavier rocket in total than the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin IV\u003C/em\u003E, to a maximum height of 80 km, falling 10 km short of\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003Ethe height set by Jebediah\u2019s first flight to space. Bobak Kerman, Flight Controller, said that the 80 km ceiling was an intentional choice. Once the target elevation was reached, Valentina deactivated the LV-T30 engine. A feat only possible with new LFO fueled rockets. As she sailed from upper atmosphere to outer space, Valentina experienced weightlessness for the first time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust after reaching 80 km in height, Valentina re-ignited the LV-T30 engine on the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin V\u003C/em\u003E. Pointing straight east, she was able to restart the rocket and extend the time that she would be in space by moving faster horizontally. After a 10 second burn, she turned off the engine and coasted again. After another 20 seconds of drifting to her new height of 82 km, she ignited the engine for a third time and pushed her total height to 84 km. This set her total time in space to two minutes and ten seconds. More than doubling Jebediah\u2019s time spent as first kerbal in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs she began to fall back to Kerbin, Valentina jettisoned her LV-T30 rocket stage. When she met the upper atmosphere the capsule of her \u003Cem\u003EKerbin V \u003C/em\u003Ewas greeted with the explosive plasma flames of the air around her catching fire as she used Kerbin\u2019s own atmosphere to slow her fall. After slowing to a safe speed, the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin V\u003C/em\u003E deployed its chutes and safely splashed down on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBobak Kerman, Mission Controller and Skyler Kerman, new Head of Public Relations were on hand to discuss the launch of\u003Cem\u003E Kerbin V\u003C/em\u003E.

Skyler Kerman also commented that the new LV-T30 engine and the LFO technology that it is based on is already getting interest in the private sector. \u201CRockomax and Kerbodyne are in talks with our R\u0026amp;D department about licensing our developments\u201D, she said.

With Gene Kerman, Flight Director and Skyler Kerman, Public Relations, taking their place in front of the lectern, the gathered crowds waiting in the hot rays of Kerbol finally quieted down. Behind the lectern was a large object covered with a red tarp. And sitting to the side of the trap was the \u201CFirst Four\u201D kerbonauts, Jebediah \u201CJeb\u201D Kerman, Bob Kerman, Bill Kerman, and Valentina Kerman.

The largest rocket built to date, the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin VI\u003C/em\u003E, weighed in at 16.8 tons.

The first capable of carrying two kerbal capsule, the\u003Cem\u003E Moho I\u003C/em\u003E carried\u00A0Jebediah \u201CJeb\u201D Kerman and Bob Kerman into orbit. As the countdown slowly worked its way from T -20 minutes, all eyes were riveted to the largest rocket stack the \u003Cem\u003EKSC \u003C/em\u003Ehas ever built. Gleaming in the noon light, the \u003Cem\u003EMoho \u003C/em\u003Ecapsule rested on top of a two stage stack. The upper stage was the familiar 1.25 m diameter seen in the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin \u003C/em\u003Eprogram. However, the lower stage was a new, wider 1.875 m rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen zero was reached, the \u003Cem\u003EMoho I \u003C/em\u003Eleaped into the sky. Momentarily deafened onlookers oohed and awed as the rocket climbed an ever increasing column of smoke as it made its way spaceward. The larger, lower stage propelled the rocket ever higher until it was lost from sight. The gathered crowd either switched on or turned up their radios to listen to announcements of the kerbonauts progress from Mission Control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt close to 60 km up, the \u003Cem\u003EMoho I\u003C/em\u003E jettisoned its lower stage rocket and Jebediah Kerman fired up the smaller upper stage. With a short burn to push the \u003Cem\u003EMoho I\u2019s\u003C/em\u003E top altitude (or apoapsis) to 85 km, the engine was cut and the rocket was allowed to silently slip into space. When the time came to reignite the engine, the new LT-V909 started without complaint and Jeb circularized the rockets orbit at 85 km by 82 km. After a brief respite to enjoy the sheer exhilaration of weightlessness, Jeb orientated the vessel into the sunlight of Kerbol and Bob prepared for the first phase of\u003Cem\u003E Moho I\u2019s\u003C/em\u003E mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 15 minutes into \u003Cem\u003EMoho I\u2019s\u003C/em\u003E flight, Bob Kerman suited up in a pressurized Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) space suit. Then at 16 minutes into the mission, the Mk1-85 capsule extension had its oxygen cycled out of the cabin in preparation for Bob to step outside the capsule. On minute 17 Bob Kerman opened up his capsule door, and while hurtling around Kerbin at speeds in excess of 2,200 m/s, he prepared to step outside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe atmosphere in Mission Control was tense. All eyes were glued to monitors feeding life-signs and vital statistics for both kerbals and their craft. Bobak Kerman, Mission Controller paced back and forth, a cigarette forgotten in his hand. Gene Kerman, Flight Director, stood silent and still amid the hushed chaos. Bill Kerman, Capsule Communicator (CapCom), listening to the final go ahead from Bobak, said \u201CBob, why don\u2019t you get some fresh air.\u201D Moments passed inside the Mission Control with seemingly no one breathing when the radio crackled and Bob Kerman reported, \u201CCapCom, this is Bob. My front yard is beautiful.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob Kerman became the first kerbal to \u201Cwalk\u201D in space. Spending four minutes on EVA, he was able to confirm the ability to move while in the vacuum of space and was able to successfully test a monopropellant movement system designed by fellow kerbonaut Valentina Kerman. During his four minutes in his \u201Cfront yard\u201D, Bob performed and retrieved several scientific experiments and even took several photographs of Kerbin from space. After 3 minutes and 30 seconds on EVA, CapCom ordered Bob to return to the Mk1-85, but radio problems prevented him from complying immediately, causing his return to be delayed by 30 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter returning to the capsule, Jebediah and Bob finished their first orbit of Kerbin and followed it by a second orbit of the planet. They set a record in space as their mission had them in low Kerbin orbit for just over an hour. Once they finished their second orbit over the great desert, Jebediah fired the \u003Cem\u003EMoho I\u2019s\u003C/em\u003E rocket and lowered the kerbonauts back to Kerbin. However, their return was not as flawless as their ascent. The \u003Cem\u003EMoho I\u2019s \u003C/em\u003Edescent burn was 8 seconds longer than needed. This caused the capsules return to be shallow. Jeb and Bob hit the atmosphere and experience over 5 times the strength of gravity due to their shallow descent. After slowing enough to trigger their parachute, the \u003Cem\u003EMoho I\u003C/em\u003E landed roughly in the highlands west if the \u003Cem\u003EKSC\u003C/em\u003E.

When asked for a quick comment, Jebediah\u2019s comment was drowned out by an exuberant Bob yelling \u201CFirst!\u201D Skyler Kerman, Public Relations, said that \u003Cem\u003EMoho I\u003C/em\u003E was an \u201Corbiting success\u201D and that the \u003Cem\u003EMoho \u003C/em\u003Eprogram would continue to set firsts in space exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/6Kh5B/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInterview with a Kerbonaut \u2013 Bob\u00A0Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWalter Kerman had the chance to sit and talk with BobKerman after his historic spacewalk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWalter Kerman (W): \u003C/strong\u003EBob, you were one of the \u201CFirst Four\u201D kerbonauts and have already been to in a rocket on \u003Cem\u003EKerbin II\u003C/em\u003E.

The capsule itself is composed of the Mk1 Command Pod, the Mk1-85 Mobile Orbital Laboratory Extension, and an upper stage booster for orbital circularization, altitude change, and de-orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mk1 pod is being brought over from its successful service missions on the Kerbin program. While the Kerbal Space Center is working on designs for a fully modern command service module in the future, the Mk1 has been too good of a capsule to retire yet. It continues to have a KER guidance chip, life support for several days, reaction control systems. An addition to the Mk1 is a flight reaction control systems (RCS) integrated into the parachute. This allows the capsule to change directions and all three dimensions using monopropellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new Mk1-85, nicknamed the \u201CBackseat\u201D by Bill Kerman and Bob Kerman, in an extension to the Mk1. Fusing the two together, the Moho capsule can hold two kerbals comfortably for up to 15 days. The Backseat is has its own hatch to for its kerbonaut to enter and exit on EVA [extra-vehicular activity]. Because of the backseats great size, it allows both itself and the Mk1 to cycle their cabins oxygen supply into holding tanks to allow exits into space. The Mk1-85 also has integrated monopropellant RCS to aid in steering. Lastly, while Kerbal Space Center is working on using solar technology in the future to power our space craft, the Mk1-85 includes a simple generator that will convert monopropellant into electricity for extended flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe upper stage of the Moho is a single mid-stack 1.25 m liquid fuel oxygen rocket. The engine attacked to the stack is our new LV-T909. This small engine has a huge thrust when in the upper atmosphere or space. This allows the Moho to be able to get more speed and burn time from the same amount of fuel than the larger LV-T series engines we\u2019ve used in the past. The upper stage also can include a small service bay to store experiments, sensitive equipment, or other vital supplies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Moho capsule and upper stage combine to make a two kerbal vessel that will be able to handle any job we ask of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T13:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like your writing style, makes me wish I\u0027d actually written my Project Mun reports as a narrative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t because I\u0027m lazy.
