This is video recorded from the booster cameras aboard shuttle flights STS-117 \u0026amp; STS-127. They have an hd cam [on the wing] so it is really clear! At 1:45 the space shuttle breaks 2,000mph At 1:57 the shuttle separates from the [booster] rocket at 28 miles above the earth at a [maximum] velocity of 2,959mph. 3:30 it is really quiet in space and you cannot hear anything except for the sound of metal \u0027groaning\u0027 and final bit of remaining propellant burning [at this point]. 4:16 gracefully tumble(ing) in space. 5:12 the SRB begins to plunge back into earth\u0027s atmosphere nozzle side down [so you are seeing Up] 6:47 the parachutes are deployed 7:04 the Shuttle Rocket Booster\u0027s \u0027nozzle\u0027 is jettisoned away, to prevent damage upon impact with the water. 7:14 something hits the water 1st 7:21 the SRB lands in the water 7:59 looks like the nozzle, parachuting into the water, further away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"forenci","CreatedById":63070,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T11:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, the life of an SRB.
