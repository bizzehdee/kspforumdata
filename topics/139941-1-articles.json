Stock labs have a 5:1 ratio on data and science and that\u0027s even too much on 50% reward with DMagic in career. I can probably research the whole tech tree with Mun and Minmus alone. Since I also use USI-LS my plan is to give around 2:1 ratio but taking a whole lot of time, making life support relevant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhats your thoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T07:57:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat a coincidence! I just experimented with this yesterday while setting up my own next career instance... and I also opted for a 2:1 science to data ratio. Well, that actually makes it a ~2.5x science multiplier in practice, because there\u0027s a 25% bonus to data (rounded down to whole numbers) gained when submitting experiments from the same SoI the lab is currently in. So the stock MPL really has a practical ~6.25x multiplier, not just 5x. But I digress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you want to adjust are three certain values inside ModuleScienceConverter:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- scienceMultiplier = 5\u003Cbr\u003E\n- researchTime = 7\u003Cbr\u003E\n- ...and one more that isn\u0027t on the wiki yet, and unfortunately I am not home, so I can\u0027t look into the actual file. It\u0027s called something related to data rate, sits at the very top of ModuleScienceConverter, and defaults to 0.5. I\u0027m just going to call it \u0022dataRate\u0022 here for simplicity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first one is obviously how much science you get per point of data. You want to set this to 2. I am not sure if this field accepts decimals - the patch stopped working when I tried to use decimals for all three values, so at least one of them is allergic to it - but if it does, you could also set to to 1.6 to result in a true 2x science multiplier after the SoI bonus. (Or you could turn off the SoI bonus inside ModuleScienceLab, but honestly I think it\u0027s a good thing to have, since it gives you incentive to send a lab to the actual destination.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLowering scienceMultiplier instantly reduces the research rate by the same factor. So by setting it to 2, your lab will now only run at 2/5th\u0027s of its usual speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can use researchTime to tweak the speed at which the lab runs, but be warned, the setting has a \u003Cem\u003Edrastic\u003C/em\u003E effect. It only accepts whole numbers, and going from for example 7 to 6 will speed up research by a whole order of magnitude. I ended up not touching this at all, but it\u0027s an option at any rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is where that new dataRate field comes in. It lets you set research speed in a much finer-grained, linear manner. If you double this, research output per day doubles, and so on and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat ought to be everything you need to know.
