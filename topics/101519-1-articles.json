I made an account last october to use the support functions in this forum. Fool that I was, I never tried exploring the amazing community here. I started being more active sometime last in january I think, and I managed to remain completely unaware of the fact (at least it seems that way to me) that it is something of a tradition to post on the welcome board when getting started. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is my \u0022slightly\u0022 late introduction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been a kerbonaut for ages now (600\u002B hours on record), and I think it\u0027s about time for me to take part in the amazing phenomenon that is the ksp community.

Having huge trouble getting anywhere near orbit, I soon searched for an autopilot, and thus I found MechJeb, my first ever mod. From there on it didn\u0027t take long until I had so many mods my computer hated me and kept crashing \u0026gt;.\u0026lt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I can\u0027t imagine playing KSP without mods, and I thought it\u0027s high time I started giving something back to the community from which I have been taking \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I\u0027ve started trying to help new players getting started. I\u0027m also planning on uploading some of my better craft, but feeling that that isn\u0027t enough I would really like to become an active part of the modding community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify, I only have very little programming experience, a little LUA in minecraft, a bit of faffing around with KSP part configs and a tiny bit of KoS Scripting. However, I consider myself a fast learner, and as I said before, I am eager to start giving back to the modding community which has enriched the game for me so much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering whether any of you could point me to some beginner tutorials, or anything else that might help me getting started as a modder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance and fly safe \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T11:59:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m surprised you found SSTOs complicated, in many ways they are much easier than staged rockets.
