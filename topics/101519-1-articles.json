I made an account last october to use the support functions in this forum. Fool that I was, I never tried exploring the amazing community here. I started being more active sometime last in january I think, and I managed to remain completely unaware of the fact (at least it seems that way to me) that it is something of a tradition to post on the welcome board when getting started. \n\nSo here is my \u0022slightly\u0022 late introduction.\n\nI\u0027ve been a kerbonaut for ages now (600\u002B hours on record), and I think it\u0027s about time for me to take part in the amazing phenomenon that is the ksp community. Just wanted to say, you guys have restored my faith in gaming communities ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI started out in ksp using only rockets, since SSTOs just seemed way to complicated. Having huge trouble getting anywhere near orbit, I soon searched for an autopilot, and thus I found MechJeb, my first ever mod. From there on it didn\u0027t take long until I had so many mods my computer hated me and kept crashing \u003E.\u003C\n\nNow I can\u0027t imagine playing KSP without mods, and I thought it\u0027s high time I started giving something back to the community from which I have been taking ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSo now I\u0027ve started trying to help new players getting started. I\u0027m also planning on uploading some of my better craft, but feeling that that isn\u0027t enough I would really like to become an active part of the modding community.\n\nTo clarify, I only have very little programming experience, a little LUA in minecraft, a bit of faffing around with KSP part configs and a tiny bit of KoS Scripting. However, I consider myself a fast learner, and as I said before, I am eager to start giving back to the modding community which has enriched the game for me so much.\n\nI was wondering whether any of you could point me to some beginner tutorials, or anything else that might help me getting started as a modder.\n\nThanks in advance and fly safe ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T11:59:00Z","Content":"I\u0027m surprised you found SSTOs complicated, in many ways they are much easier than staged rockets. Low part-count, robust, simple construction and straightforward, fast flights are countered by their high fuel needs - for about 400m/s deltaV more than a disposable launch vehicle.\n\nSpaceplanes are the exact opposite, of course. Hard to build, hard to fly, can\u0027t lift much without hundreds of parts but hardly use any fuel.\n\nIt\u0027ll be interesting to see how much *all* of that changes in 1.0, which may also make some of the stuff in [Add-on Development](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/37-Add-on-Development) and its sub-forum [Help and Support](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/30-Plugin-Development-Help-and-Support) obsolete, but most of it is more stable - being about the programme structure not specific functions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T12:32:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 12:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T12:29:13Z","Content":"ok, seems I got my terminology mixed up.

It can be extremely easy (ModuleMangager configs, for example) or very, very hard (C# scripts, things like Ferram Aerospace Research).\n\nMy own mod (the Modular Booster System, click on picture in my signature) is stuck because I cannot for the life of me figure out C# for KSP. It\u0027s a very different programming language, and I\u0027ve been programming Python for over four years, fiddling with Assembly language, using Arduino and Parallax Basic microcontrollers for about the same time, and C\u002B\u002B for two years.\n\nThe above may or may not be because I have yet to see a C# script written for KSP. I learn by reverse-engineering, even in programming. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIf you simply want to make parts for KSP, and not introduce any new mechanics, modding is very simple. You only need to have a bit of programming know-how, (Reading the .cfg\u0027s of existing parts will really help you!) and some 3D-modelling experience, which is fairly simple to pick up.\n\nTexturing is another level entirely, but isn\u0027t all that hard to learn either. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nMy advice? Just keep at it. If it doesn\u0027t work, keep going until it does. Start over. Try it again. Tweak this thing, delete that one, add in something new, until you\u0027re satisfied with your work."},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T04:14:38Z","Content":"Welcome aboard TheXRuler!\n\nIf you feel you\u0027re up to the challenge, KSP-Interstellar Extension Config is looking implementing some new ISRU reactions, and one idea is to use the Regolith converter-code to do this. If you\u0027re interested, swing by the development thread for KSP-I Extended (link\u0027s in my signature) and familiarize yourself a little with what the mod is about and the ISRU reactions I\u0027m interested in adding (I mention some of them in the thread- and would be more than happy to give you a re-cap there).\n\nThen get a hold of RoverDude and see if you can\u0027t get his help in learning how to use Regolith to create converter-reactions for the new ISRU reactions (which are conversion rather than extraction reactions- we\u0027re currently using ORS for all our extraction reactions for, reasons...) If he\u0027s able to help you figure out a way to use the Regolith converter-code with the existing KSP-I ISRU refinery parts, we\u0027d be more than happy to take a look at adding in what you come up with (note that the current densities for some of the resources that will be used in the ISRU reactions are slightly inaccurate- Liquid CO2 is getting a new name and a higher density in the next CRP revision, for instance... So you have a bit of time to figure out the Regolith converter code before we settle on more accurate resource-densities...)\n\nRegards,\n\nNorthstar\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T04:17:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 04:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989**"}]}
