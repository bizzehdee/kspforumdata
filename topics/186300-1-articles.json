In 1.7.3 the rotatron supporting the wing is very wobbly regardless of autostrutting. This makes using these parts pretty frustrating as you cannot put struts between two rotating parts to make them more rigid. I really hope this gets fixed very soon.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u0022112.50\u0022 style=\u0022width:600px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022IzRU7sD.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/IzRU7sD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-13T20:20:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice plane!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-13T22:56:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223633826\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186300\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221562963992\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119650\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EvenFlow\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/13/2019 at 8:39 AM, EvenFlow said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea how to properly replicate or document it, but did anyone else notice that\u00A0connection nodes of\u00A0robotic parts seem less rigid in the newest update?
