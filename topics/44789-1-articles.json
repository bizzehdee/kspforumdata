This is proper, but when you hit reverse (or braking for that matter) there should technically be full (stalled, stopped) torque available from the motors. This would be in keeping with how an electric motor actually performs. I don\u0027t know if this would be easy hard in the game\u0027s code, but it would make rover driving a bit easier, especially on vehicles that use \u0027tank steering\u0027. That being said, my OCD would be really happy to see the electrical usage rate reflect the output torque. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T04:57:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately the code is based on speed not on rpm, so the torque curves aren\u0027t really torque curves at all, but are acceleration curves. If you experiment with various rovers you will see that they perform pretty much the same regardless of mass. They would have to completely recode the wheels to get the kind of realism you\u0027re asking for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
