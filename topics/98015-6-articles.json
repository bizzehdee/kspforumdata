The heatshield (no ablative) and a few other items reach 1,200degrees but nothing explodes, however two winglets break off (aerodynamic forces) trying to maintain the nose up angle once the airflow increases at lower altitude. This results in total loss of craft control and spinning to occur at around 30km altitude but by this time most of the danger is passed and no further damage is received, drogue chutes open at 15km and straighten out the fall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain chute deploys at 7km and HDIc flips into its proper and correct tail down orientation, airbrakes retract and legs deploy.

As for a flight profile you want to fly vertical until you hit around 100-150m/sec then gradually lower the nose by increments of 5-10 degrees. Flying gently is important, the early SkyBolt doesnt have movable aerodynamic surfaces (fixed position fins from sounding rockets) so you are entirely relying on gimbal and reaction wheels. The later SkyBolt V-Light had improved controllable fins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, SkyBolt V was never a manned launcher in my career, it only ever flew probes, its payload to orbit of 1tonne (inclusive of propulsion) wasnt enough to support even the smallest capsule. SkyBolt IV was a straight up and down sub-orbital launcher and then HoundDog I served as my orbital launcher for Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to be much more gentle on your re-entry, 100km Ap should be matched by something more like a 30-40km Pe, you want to spend a fair amount of time in the upper atmosphere losing velocity before you enter the thicker air lower down. Re-entry really is deadly when orbital velocities are 6,000m/sec.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThankyou for your kind words and good luck with your career, it really is a challenge worthy of being proud of when you finally master it, whenever I go back and try a stock install I am surprised by how easy it all is!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Marsu69","CreatedById":160048,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-13T16:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you very much for the config. i will try it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the Skybolt, yep I know it was not design as a manned spacecraft.

This was fine whilst KSC was in sight, however Kerbin is round, and Lilith soon passed out of direct line of sight falling through 15km altitude, by now wholly sub-sonic.

Minmus, with its low gravity and widely spread resources would be the ideal fuel depot if it wasn\u0027t so far away or at an incline which restricts easy transfers, If suitable concentrations could be located at Mun, the steeper gravity well may be overlooked in favour of a more local source.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe core payload of Lunic IIb is a direct relative of the Lunic II probes which were so successful at Minmus. The duplicate instruments however have been replaced with a single set and Karbonite sampling equipment has been added in its place, along with a Bang-O-meter seismometer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn an attempt to both satisfy a requirement to provide a large heavy transfer stage to use as an impactor, and the increased mass of the Lunic lander it has fallen as a happy coincidence that this mission fits the requirements for an \u0022easy\u0022 maiden flight for the latest in the HoundDog series, the IV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeighing in at 351,447kg on the pad, HoundDog IV is a significant step up from the 145,000kg HDIII. HDIV shares the same core staging as all previous HoundDog lifters, Core, boosters and upper stages, it just scales them up to the limit of current technology, 3.5m diameter tanks with 3m diameter interstage fairings and 2.5m nose fairings which leaves it restricted to the exact same payload volume as a HDIII yet payload mass can now push for 30,000kg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EBt4Y2p.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EBt4Y2p.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlasting into the post-dawn sky we see the main reason for this tripling of lift capacity, two massive additional boosters, each massing nearly as much as a HDI sport a single KW Maverick-V KeroLox motor. The core stage packs a third and in addition to the quad arrangement of solid boosters (added mainly for the cool looking smoke effects) puts the initial pad thrust rating at 3,911 KN.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solid motors burn out all too soon, after travelling only 2.5km infact. With an Ap of only 4km at this point in any version of KSP after 0.90 they would have impacted the KSC, but with the 2.5km physics range they are safely deleted from existence before any damage can be caused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith no crossfeed employed, a single Maverick-V cannot lift a fully fuelled core stage, the two side boosters burn for just over 3 minutes. Flying at 60km and Mach 6 they are jettissoned, pushed away by retros built into the nosecones. By this time the thrust of a single motor has increased to its maxmum rated output of 1,260KN and the core stage pulls away. The side boosters both carry chutes and will be recovered from their oceanic landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iZWsD2x.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iZWsD2x.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother 3 minutes later and the core stage is running dry, practically at orbital velocity by now 138km and 5,570m/sec it is discarded to burnup in the atmosphere, or spread burning Kerosene soaked debris across the Peninsular, either way its job is done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHoundDog IVs upper stage is stretched slightly and up motored in comparison to the HDIII. Replacing the service motor with a single KW Maverick-1D (the same as used on HDIII core stage (but 3 of)) tuned to the HydroLox fuel it produces only 175.3KN but is capable of dragging its 27,312kg record breaking mass into a 150x152km orbit. With 2,463m/sec still in the tanks it shows there is still plenty of capacity left in this design to increase payload mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kcz0xGA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kcz0xGA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRather than waste this remaining fuel, it is decided that it actually has enough Dv to complete the 2,271m/sec Mun transfer burn, without the assistance of the \u0027transfer\u0027 stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving ejected from LKO towards the Mun the HDIV upper stage retains 180Dv, it is decided to separate the stage now and use this fuel to guide the stage to a Mun\u0027r impact as it (like all HoundDog upper stages) contains independent orientation and control facility. The interstage fairing protecting the \u0027transfer stage\u0027 motors has significantly too much ejection force, whilst 2 of the panels will hit the Mun, the third will get a gravity assist and go interplanetary.
