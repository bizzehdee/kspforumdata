If you are a frequent visitor of the Mun or Minmus, you surely must have a standardized Trans-Munar-Injection stage! Right? I prefer to stay within the Kerbin System, so I have several stations around the Mun and Minmus and ground bases as well. This means I need standardized landers and reconnaissance probes. Here is my medium TMI stage, with appropriate use of small hardpoints. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fAZct57.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022fAZct57.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use linear RCS ports because I want to be a hipster. The outer tanks can be increased or decreased in size depending on the payload. This design allows the use of aerospikes, as efficient as the Lv-909\u0027s but with more thrust. Ideal combination of T/W and efficiency. Also best for small landers and probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my Heavy(er) TMI stage, with decouplers on the specefied locations. This one packs a little more punch, as in acceleration, and is more desirable for larger payloads (who would have guessed). Best for larger landers and Station parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yArTvsO.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022yArTvsO.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have noticed that my TMI stages all have radial engines, and I have no clue why so don\u0027t ask. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease show me your TMI stages, what they are designed to shuttle, and if they lean towards efficiency or T/W. Please only use stock parts unless it is truly impressive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T02:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use my Alfa interplanetary stage for almost everything [unless I\u0027m using the Zulu Heavy Transfer Stage], including Mun shots.
