All of the equations that I have found seem to be dealing with two more-or-less massive bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is it possible to calculate orbital period from semi-major axis, semi-minor axis, planet density and planet mass, or should semi-major axis, eccentricity, planet density and planet mass be used? Are there any other things that I forget to factor in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy real reason for wanting to know this, is that I want a formula where I can put a semi-major axis in, and then calculate what the semi-minor axis should be to achieve synchronous orbit. This would be useful for setting things like Molniya orbits up in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Z-Man","CreatedById":96549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T10:04:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a given central body and a small orbiter, the orbital period only depends on the semi-major axis and none of the other parameters you mention.

In KSP, all planets are assumed to be perfect spheres, and therefore, period of any orbit depends on semi-major axis only. The game does, also, take an approximation that mass of the ship is negligible, yielding a formula T = 2\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC Sqrt(a\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3/\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC).
