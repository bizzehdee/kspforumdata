I only watched anything relating to it in 2013, when I watched Day9\u0027s Day Off trying to play it, and a week or two later watching Zisteau (somebody I\u0027ve followed from afar since 2011 thanks to his Minecraft Super Hostile series) and his series of videos, though not the entire playlist. It wasn\u0027t until this last Steam Winter Sale after I got an awesome new computer that could actually run it (and lots more!) that I seriously considered buying it, and soon did. No regrets, except the first moon launch (not enough fuel to return!), the rescue mission (Not enough fuel to even get off the surface!) and the following many attempts to land a 3-pod lander near enough to rescue the now two stranded kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"airelibre","CreatedById":107713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T22:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was getting interested in the moon landings and space in general and then I happened to click on a video by a certain guy called Scott Manley on YouTube.

This was back when it was still pretty much a concept rather then a game. Once squad had made the game and released the early alpha though I jumped on it straight away and bought it. I\u0027ve always been a sucker for space games and this was quite a fair bit different then all the standard space shooter or 4x games.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
