Even if it were as basic as searching by keywords so a player could type \u0022engine\u0022 and anything with the ModuleEngines part module in its part.cfg would appear in the search results, it would make things much more efficient. Then of course it could search actual part names and maybe descriptions as well. I\u0027m sure searching the appropriate fields wouldn\u0027t be hard, but is it even possible to modify part selection?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T13:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few mods that do this already.
