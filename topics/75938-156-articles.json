One such effect is that not all the repulsors will update. Another is that they will all update, but instead of changing by, for example, 2 they will instead change by 5. On one occasion I even managed to mess it up enough that instead of the repulsors turning off at height of zero, I had to hit the button once more so that all the height sliders reported -1 before they would shut off completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do, however, have a theory as to why this is happening and I think it has to do with the context slider that is attached to the ride height variable. Since the KSPField that contains the slider for the context menu is set to an interval of 5, then setting a requested interval of anything other than a rule-of-five will either fail or have varying results because it is trying to limit the end value to that interval. I thought, before doing this experiment, that the min/max ride height was a free slide between those two values and the interval would only affect the \u003Cem\u003Echange\u003C/em\u003E rate. Instead it actually locks the values to that interval in relation to the min/max. That\u0027s why the old implementation of this feature worked, because the interval for the field was also changed to match on every part on the craft with that field present on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m hit with a bit of an issue. KSPField sliders can be set to an interval like that, but GUI sliders don\u0027t have such a feature. I can set the value to round to the nearest whole number (nearest int to be precise, but it seems to work for any data type that takes numerical input) but I have no way of rounding to the nearest 5th int. Alternatively, I could change the context slider to take intervals of 1. Second alternative would be to actually set the sliders for every part on the current craft to match the interval in the GUI, or do the opposite and have every part check on their fixed update (or whatever is available) against the persistent variable and reset their sliders to match. in the end it may turn out to be more hacky than the original implementation, but with some fiddling I\u0027m sure I can get it to work properly. If only we had a \u0022Mathf\u0022 method similar to \u0022Round(float x, float y)\u0022 to let me round the value \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E to the nearest \u003Cem\u003Ey\u003C/em\u003E then this would be so much easier. That would also let me make your dust amount slider a little more friendly by rounding to the nearest 0.25 since the current huge decimal is a bit of an overkill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, I couldn\u0027t seem to get the repulsor lights to turn off no matter what I switched on or off. I think something got broken somewhere down the line in our frenzy to fix that dusty bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Great Jebediah\u0027s Ghost (and he ain\u0027t even dead yet) I think I\u0027ve got it! I\u0027m not ready to share the details, cause the math is rather... for me anyway. Besides, I think I can merge my two extension methods into a single method... and that should fix all our problems... at least in relation to this post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: It all works. I added a new method to the Extensions class that allows me to round to the nearest \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003Eth numeral. What this means is that we can round to the nearest 5th, 10th, or even the nearest 0.5, or 0.25, you name it. If the number to round to is between 0 and 1, then it simply multiplies that number by 10 and treats it like a divisor. Otherwise it treads the number (1 or greater) as a multiplier and then does the rounding process depending on which (divisor or multiplier) has been determined. So, to round to the nearest 5th, you enter 5 into the \u0022roundto\u0022 parameter and it does something like \u0022Math.Round(num / 5) * 5\u0022 which outputs the \u0022num\u0022 rounded to the nearest \u00225\u0022 value. For a decimal round it\u0027s more complicated. You enter something like \u00220.25\u0022 for \u0022roundto\u0022 and it first detects that we\u0027re dealing with a decimal level and it multiplies that by 10, which doesn\u0027t eliminate the decimal but it makes it easier to work with when dealing with the standard \u0022Round\u0022 method which only rounds to the nearest whole number. 0.25 * 10 = 2.5. You end up with something like \u0022(Math.Round((num * 10) / 2.5) * 2.5) / 10\u0022 which outputs the nearest \u00220.25\u0022 to the input \u0022num.\u0022 I\u0027ve done each of these calculations with over a dozen input by hand (okay, not quite by hand, but using \u0022calc.exe\u0022 step by step) with over a dozen different \u0022roundto\u0022 targets with perfect results, so I\u0027ve integrated the new method into the GUI sliders and, from what I can tell from testing it thoroughly, all is working perfectly. It\u0027s a relatively simple way of duplicating the functionality of the context-menu sliders (at least the interval/min/max parameters of them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be committing the new stuff shortly. Work on an unfolding debug menu to attach to the GUI settings menu is still a work in progress, but I think I\u0027m close to the solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T00:50:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 12:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T14:31:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi \u003Cstrong\u003Elo-fi\u003C/strong\u003E, would you please explain the meaning of numbers in the steeringCurve section of ModuleWheel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T15:04:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are two types of steering curves: brake and torque.

But, essentially, yes the numbers represent speed and angle. However, float curves are used in many different applications and so I have attempted to define them in more generic terms. For instance, if brake steering were a \u0022speed to turn angle\u0022 type of thing, then it\u0027s basically saying that at zero speed, no turning, and the higher the speed the more turning you get. That simply is not the case. For torque steering, the more accurate way to describe it is \u0022torque to turn angle\u0022 and not necessarily \u0022speed to turn angle\u0022 and in the case of that curve, it doesn\u0027t account for both directions but simply uses the same angle for both turn directions. The reason for the extra detail in the brake steering I believe is because it needs to somehow balance the effect since, essentially, you\u0027re braking one side of the craft slightly to cause the craft to turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a novice at all this stuff though, so I make not be on top of things very well.

I always figured that it\u0027s all relative to whatever unit it\u0027s manipulating in KSP. For speed, it\u0027s a 1:1 relationship with m/s. For torque and braking force, again it\u0027s going to be a 1:1 relationship with the KSP defaults. To get a better idea of what is what, you\u0027d have to look at what Squad put into the stock modules/parts and scale it from there.

As you already know, KSP has a precision mode for things like RCS and throttle control (supposedly, I\u0027m unsure if I\u0027ve ever used it myself). So, if we could tab into that and toggle a bunch of limiters/enhancers when KSP goes into precision mode, we could reduce the need for specific action groups.

That was also a reason to try and get a spark emitter integrated to simulate pushing the parts to their maximums. On that note, I tried to implement occasional sparks to the Screw drive like I was talking about, but could never get the sparks to actually emit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027m getting close to a workable precision mode toggle both by the stock precision mode and by an override via action group.
