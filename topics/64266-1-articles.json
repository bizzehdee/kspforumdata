As velocity goes up energy going up decreases. So basically kinetic energy is like a end result (right?). This means that kerbart with all of his ragging with the mess i had in my maths (BECAUSE I DID IT IN NOTEPAD AND COPY AND PASTED IT) did it the right way. Find velocity made from energy on mass of object first, then subtract velocity.

It is just as improbable that the object has exactly zero rotation as any other rotational speed. Any scheme that uses engines mounted to the surface of the object is going to have to account for the rotation. This is where gravity tractors and nuclear warheads detonated above the asteroid\u0027s surface have an advantage. And nuclear bombs have the additional advantage that they can be detonated on a flyby trajectory. This may save enough delta-V to make it possible to deliver the charge quickly using only existing rocket designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ninja\u0027d by AlbertVDS...
