That\u0027s strange. I got all of the stuff from the links on Medieval Nerds tech tree thread.

The space center scene also disappears when I try to go back to it. I quit the game and restart it, only to find that my ships get duplicated on top of one another. Instead of having 11 flights in progress, I have 17, and when I load one of the duplicated ships, it loads them all on top of one another, creating a rather spectacular explosion. Anyone know what could be causing this, and if there\u0027s a fix?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m confused as to where I should put the ExsurgentEngineering dll.
