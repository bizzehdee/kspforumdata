You don\u0027t have to mine anything with EPL, you can simply ship up RocketParts to your building platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise with ground bases - land a survey station with enough rocket parts, plant a stake, and you\u0027re done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, you can also check out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHangar\u003C/a\u003E, maybe that\u0027s closer to what you\u0027re looking for.
