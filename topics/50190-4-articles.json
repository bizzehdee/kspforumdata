Research and science were huge (it allowed career mode), but I think to round out the career mode experience, having to budget for your builds and a method to earn/get/accumulate money I think is also important. Adding that in I think will flesh out career mode significantly and likely would also \u0022put a stop\u0022 to things that feel kind of cheaty on how to amass tons of science in short order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoar parts. I do like most of what we have, but I do feel like some important parts are missing, especially once money/economy is added in and balancing/tweaking science. We need some 2.5m science parts and we need the option of some .725m probe science parts. I am thinking things like a soil scoop/analyzer for probes would be neat/cool/should be there and things like orbital research bays as 2.5m parts. Some more advanced parts, such as 2.5m NERVAs and nuclear reactors would be cool. Especially if other things like more powerful Ion drives or VASMIR is added in to go with nuke reactors (scaled roughly to in game ion drive standards...so something like a 1.5m ion drive/NERVA might use 10x the power of a probe based one, but also produces something like 10-20 thrust and a 2.5m one that uses 50x the power of the probe ion drive, but produces something like 40 thrust). To go with later suggestions, radiators too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat. Engines in space and some things like nuclear power plants and RTGs should produce heat that accumulates (even if very slowly, but dissipates super slowly unless you have working radiators). Radiators will radiate it away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife support. Especially with career mode, I think it is time in the next couple of updates to consider implementing life support. 1.5m and 2.5m life support modules and small (monopropellant sized) radial life support modules would be nice. They use a small amount of power (very small) and have a finite amount of \u0022life support gas\u0022 in them. Make it not uber challenging, so something like a small radial tank might be enough to last 4-7 days for a single kerbal and uses 1 unit of energy per minute or something. Probe sized provides double that, 1.5m gives 2 weeks for a single kerbal and a 2.5m gives a month for a single kerbal. Then also provide things like 2.5m hydroponics/aeroponics modules (hydroponics costs less, but weighs more and is unlocked before aeroponics in tech tree). Those hydroponics/aeroponics can provide unlimited life support gases for 3 kerbals, or recharge life support gases at the appropriate rate if there are fewer than 3. Great reason for space stations now too. Stick a hydroponics module or two on it, send it out to Duna and you can tank up missions being sent out there. You can also have \u0022atmosphere reprocessor\u0022 units in radial size maybe, that use a lot of power, but also recharge life support gases on planets that have an atmosphere (can be used as an atmosphere scoop too, but the lower the air pressure, the slower the recharge).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadly re-entry heat and heat shields/coatings. I honestly don\u0027t want this to be super difficult. However, if you are going fast enough to cause a heat trail, that should be fast enough to damage parts that aren\u0027t protected by a heat shield or tiles/coatings. Allow any part to be coated/tiled, but have the protection be a lot weaker than a heat shield (IE could withstand moderate aerobraking or gentle re-entry, but it isn\u0027t going to withstand a plunge straight in from orbital speeds. Heat shields can generally protect anything at nearly any speed...so long as not really ridiculous).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiomes for all planets and have them remapped (a la Kerbin and the Mun in .21).

Sorry for not having a reference, but I believe the developers said they didn\u0027t want to allow science to be gained by simply time-warping a crazy amount.\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds like a better idea. If you can complete one orbit around Kerbin you gain a certain amount of money. You wouldn\u0027t gain more for more orbits though, because usually if you can make it once around Kerbin you can also make it around 10 billion times (because there is no orbital decay).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds great!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference is that science is a limited use resource: Once you have researched tech tree completely, it is of no use.

Therefore there needs to be a unlimited amount of credits players can earn. However, this should most likely have a limit on how much one single flight can earn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECredits also are the opposite of science: More science is earned the further you go. But to go further, you need bigger rockets, which cost more. If you would only get more credits by going further players could bankrupt themselves by a single failed launch. This is why IMO the game economics model will need to have some sort of \u0022easy\u0022 credit making method. Satellites would fit this perfectly. At the very least they should provide you with enough credit income so you can build bigger ships, which carry mun rocks to sell to people for big credits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut overall my point was that there could be two type of missions: One which rewards credits instantly when certain parameters are met, and another that will operate for certain period of time, and earn credits slowly up to a certain limit (hence the time/data limits in my original post). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ideas are mostly similar, just the payment method is different (one is all or nothing, one has partial payment for partial success). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting idea might be if the kerbin was divided into different geographical areas. Then players could for example be rewarded only for time the satellite is transmitting over the area in question.

I am pretty sure they consulted every book in existence on the subject before they even began the planing of the rocket. If you want to spend half a day measuring distances between orbits, working out the masses of planets and orbital periods, and than working out the optimal launch windows and working out the hohmann transfer nodes, its up to you. I am not even sure that KSP gives you all the necessary information ingame. I would rather look up on the deltaV map and plan my mission from there. Right now its fairly easy, since you can massively overcompensate and bring tons of fuel with any probe you send out, but once the economy kicks in, that would be a luxury you may not be able to afford.

I like the idea of a job board that issued tasks to be completed (land here, take samples, leave a comsat in high orbit, etc) and completing provided the payout. Would also love to see two types of funding in career mode. Allow the player to select Government Branch or Private Sector development. If the space program was government funded, you would get steady (yet fixed) funding but would allow for a faster start as it would start you off with a higher budget than the Private Sector option. Missions would also be required to be achieved within a specified time line else face some sort of penalty or budget cut (not to be allowed to go below a specific amount).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Private Sector option basically starts out with a smaller budget (the paultry $4000 in your pocket) making startup harder, but successful missions have better payouts and you get to select which missions you wish to complete and ignore/refuse the rest. Too many failures and your business drops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth could be linked with the tech tree, completing science missions alongside economic missions in order to accomodate the funding of both the science and the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the science is done, the job board still exists so that players don\u0027t suffer from the \u0022what do I do now that I\u0027ve done everything\u0022 syndrome.
