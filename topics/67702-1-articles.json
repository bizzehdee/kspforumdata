Is this intended?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- To hire Kerbals you need reputation. Hiring Kerbals increases reputation. Increasing the staff size to gain reputation? This doesn\u0027t make sense to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More than 2-3 smart Kerbals aren\u0027t needed for career play through (1 as pilot and for early experiments; 2 guys for science lab). I can pick not-so-smart Kerbals and train them to Einsteins and activate timewarp. Why should I care about reputation to attract smart ones? This eliminates one of the two reasons for gaining reputation (money is the other one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The scientist will be a competitor to rockets. Both produce science by spending money. Flying rockets is more fun the just giving a Kerbal a science job. So is there a good reason to hire a Scientist?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- To me it seems money is the only important \u0027resource\u0027. You can do whatever you want if you have enough of it. Spend some and Kerbals will get smart and happy. Spend some more and you\u0027ll get all the reputation you need to \u0027fix\u0027 you income modicator.

Your first contract would be a government initiative just to get a Kerbal into space. After getting rep for that your next contract might be to get a Kerbal to orbit Kerbin. Then to the Mun, then Minmus .etc. This would also allow players to slowly, through necessity, become more familiar with the game. Basically you can\u0027t progress until you master something easier. The game would still be a sandbox game as you could choose from a variety of contracts in your reputation range and it would be completely up to you how you accomplish the tasks... and if you want to play pure sandbox then don\u0027t play career mode - that is what the sandbox mode is for \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t like the idea of infinite science sources, but I do think that the science system needs to be reworked. I can unlock pretty much every single part in career mode just by landing on Mun and Minmus over and over again and then by the time you leave Kerbins sphere of influence there is nothing left to research. Research should be a slower process that requires a different kind of Kerbal on the ground to handle it. You go to the Mun, get some samples and then turn them over to a lab which is staffed by scientists attracted by your reputation. They will do the research on whatever you brought back and slowly award you the research points (perhaps on a timer not tied to the in game clock so it can\u0027t be Fast Forwarded through) up to a maximum for the object being researched. You could even build labs in orbit of Kerbin or in orbit of other planets as stations that would increase the multiplier of the research being done (again, up to that object\u0027s max). That could change based on where a sample came from and where it is researched. Think of it like, dirt from Kerbin, researched on Kerbin is worth almost nothing, but dirt from Kerbin researched on Eve could be worth a lot more (mixing Kerbin soil with Eve soil makes for a better snack growing medium or something...). Science would basically be used for what it is used for now, maybe tweak the unlock costs of some things. More things that science can be used for would be nice too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI kind of like the idea of factoring a Kerbals personality into the mix and having things like Psych evaluations and training for different scenarios, but I can\u0027t really come up with many ways where that would enhance the game experience aside from, like OrtwinS said, The SIMS Kerbal edition. Perhaps something like a Kerbal would have to be trained for a specific mission. Like 0g training for Kerbals that are going to live in orbit for a long period of time or specific training for Mun missions. Taking a Kerbal on a mission he isn\u0027t trained for would hurt the mission in some way. You could overcome the issue of really only needing 3 Kerbals for the entire game by putting a cap on the number of times an individual Kerbal can be trained. Like if you train to land on moons, you won\u0027t be very good on a space station. Something like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that is almost essential for making a good career mode is the removal of the \u0022revert flight\u0022 buttons. \u0022Oh no! the rocket I just got contracted to build is about to crash because I didn\u0027t design it right! That is going to hurt my reputation and cost me money! ... Oh well - Revert Flight! Crisis avoided!\u0022 Come on... that is B.S. If you want to play sandbox mode, go play sandbox mode. Nothing wrong with sandbox mode, sandbox mode is totally cool, just that career mode is not sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
