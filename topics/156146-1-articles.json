As you can see, you\u0027ve not been getting any replies in over a day. That is because this forum is dedicated more to the stock game and general questions about how to do stuff in space. What you\u0027re asking though is a highly specific case question about one of the most poorly documented special features in possibly the most complex mod ever created for KSP. I\u0027m willing to bet that apart from the mod author himself, there are maybe a handful of people at best who can even answer it.

Also, if I\u0027m not mistaken, the module need to be landed to scavenge resources. Check the description of the parts used and look if there is something like \u0022can scavenge from nearby warehouses\u0022; if you don\u2019t find any its possible you don\u2019t have access to the \u0022hidden ducts/wires\u0022 UKS simulate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotice that, like I said, this its just a well intended guess.
