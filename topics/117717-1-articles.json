Combining roles does reduce operational complexity. Mining operations get fuel for free so drill baby drill!\n\nI had some unstated assumptions:\n\n\u003E You would keep the lander easy to fly (massive would realise some efficiency gains on its own from reduced overhead, better tanks, and more efficient, larger engines)\n\n\u003E You had the piloting skill to consistently land the tanker within a klick of your minner. You need to be somewhat acetate to hit the good site anyway.\n\nParticulars of your operation may be defined by resource distribution.\n\nMy survey results came back that the optimal Minmus resource node was in a flat that needs at least 9\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 of inclination to fly over. An optimal launch window every 11 hours does not sound good for on demand refueling though. I can place a fuel refinery that can be rendezvoused with as normal for refueling and run Ore to that periodically. I understand that the flats make for a good spot to rocket rover so I am toying with the thought of giving my tankers landing wheels and driving to optimally placed mine heads upon landing. Using fuel cells on mine heads is a no brainer to avoid concerns about visiting the site during the night."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T01:59:21Z","Content":"Check out [this guy\u0027s video](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40559-All-craft-from-my-Constellation-mission-vid), especially around the 27 minute mark. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T02:21:35Z","Content":"I just did this recently, see the video below.\n\nNotable time stamps:\n\n[12:00 - coming in from orbit](https://youtu.be/KT4aAytMvnA?t=12m00s)\n\n[13:10 - discussing thrust limiting](https://youtu.be/KT4aAytMvnA?t=13m10s) (And using 2 very nice mods, neither of which are critical but both of which make it far easier)\n\n[14:30 - landed next to the base, right before actually starting the docking](https://youtu.be/KT4aAytMvnA?t=14m30s)\n\n[16:10 - just moments from docking](https://youtu.be/KT4aAytMvnA?t=16m10s)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/KT4aAytMvnA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T20:46:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m thinking about something similar, and I might try to use some physical docking alignment support, like \u0022V\u0022 shaped rails to lead the craft directly onto the target.

It can also lead to rubberband physics, parts flying off, and stuff exploding, even if you use parts with 80m/s tolerance and make contact so softly you\u0027re barely moving.\n\nOn the other hand, Infernal Robotics provides many, many possible ways to move things into position. One that worked for me is creating hydraulic suspensions using rails, which can be scaled to work on a variety of vessels with Tweak Scale. Even a tiny probe with three legs could have three miniaturized rails attached behind those legs, then all it has to do is bounce into position above the dock using RCS/torque then lower suspension until it makes contact."},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T22:18:11Z","Content":"I tried the same thing in .90 for the Kethane mod.\n\nYES, it\u0027s possible to land a ship atop another ship.\n\nNO, that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s a good idea.\n\nIt\u0027s tricksy to get them aligned. You\u0027ll burn a lot of fuel. You\u0027ll destroy a lot of solar panels. You\u0027ll take ages doing so and probably tip the lower craft over.\n\nI suggest doing it horizontally. Put your drilling rig and storage tank on wheels. Land the ascent vehicle nearby, and then drive the drilling rig into it. Either have docking ports on the side, or use the Klaw for the simple approach. This will make it infinitely easier.\n\nThere is a HUGE difference between putting a lander where you want it on a surface, and landing a 2.5m wide part of your lander exactly onto a 2.5m area on another craft, with enough force to make them snap together but not so much they bounce off or explode, while fighting gravity at the same time.\n\nSeriously.
