I got Jeb out to do an EVA report and soil sample and he fell off the plane from probably 2m up and everything went black. The HUD still showed up but there were no numbers on the altimeter. I tried to revert back to Launch, but Kerbin had been abducted from its orbit around Kerbol and trying to revert to the SPH resulted in the same missing planet problem upon re-launching.\n\nSomething similar happened in my modded game, but either Jeb would explode on contact with the ground or the game would CTD."},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T21:11:48Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums!\n\nPlease read the [thread=92230]Stock Support and Bug Reporting Guide[/thread] and post the requested information."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:29:35Z","Content":"It\u0027s a bug that happens semi-frequently, but unfortunately not enough that it\u0027s been tracked down.
