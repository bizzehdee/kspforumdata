All the stars we see at night are only a small part of the Milky Way (except the visible galaxies like\u00A0Andromeda, Triangulum, the Magellanic clouds..) so we would really only see blackness, and the mentioned galaxies\u00A0(and of course the Milky Way itself). No one is sure of how the Milky Way REALLY looks like but it would most likely look like the pictures we see of it (the artist renders). It might be a bit dim because of our eye exposure, but if you\u0027re close enough, it would probably\u00A0look better than ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, NGC 6744\u00A0is the most similar galaxy to the Milky Way known to date (of course that\u0027s if our Milky Way looks like we imagine it) so the view would probably look like this galaxy does.

You wouldn\u0027t be able to see anything at all if there are any lights on inside your FTL\u00A0spaceship due to the reflection on the glass. I\u0027ve been out to places where you can really see the stars, and Andromeda is still just a barely visible oval blob. You can\u0027t even see it if you look directly at it because it gets in your blind spot. That\u0027s probably similar to what the Milky Way would look like, just not as big in the sky. If we could see all the colors that those long-exposure false-color images are taken in, it might look as colorful as the pictures, but until we invent better eyes, we\u0027re stuck with gray blobs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T18:25:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA nebulae would just become more and more diffused as you got closer to it until it disappeared.
