There was no time, there was no anything. \n\n*-flash!-*\n\nIn an instant, the Universe expanded from an infinitesimally small point- a point no larger than an atom- into what we know as the cosmos today. Every little whirring molecule, every cloud of dust and gas, every space rock, every planet, every star, and every single galaxy, came from that infinitely small point. \n\nAcross the eons after that initial fantastic explosion, things began to change. The collections of subatomic particles condensed into more atomic ones, and those atoms fusing into still larger molecules and creating the natural elements, these elements condensing into packets of materials and dispersing across space and time. As these collections of materials grew in size, so to did their gravity. They began to attract one another, bumping into each other and fusing further, once again increasing their own gravity. When enough material collected into a single point, these collections of materials condensed into spherical shapes. When more and more material condensed into these little protoplanetessimal structures, the first stars in the universe were born.\n\nAnd so the Universe would continue for billions upon billions of years: Eternally condensing and collecting into heavier and heavier structures, stars aligning themselves such as to create great collections of stellar arrangements we call galaxies, and each one of these stars allowing enough material to collect on their stellar disks of gas and rock that worlds formed, an endless variety of planets and moons, comets and asteroids, rings and gas giants. \n\n*It is on one of these worlds, a tiny little world orbiting a teensy-weensy little star, that our story begins.* \n\nThe star known as Kerbol is by all accounts an impossible star. It is impossibly small, impossibly hot, impossibly dense (not having an abundance of it but rather having not enough!), and impossibly inhabited by seven little orbiting bodies, nearly too small for the imagination.\n\nMoho, Eve, Kerbin, Duna, Dres, Jool, and Eeloo. The planetary compatriots to the impossible star.\n\nHowever, one of these little tiny planets has something special about it. Unique. While a couple of the bodies in the little solar system harbor suitable qualities- Liquid water, habitable temperatures, a suitable atmospheric pressure- None has quite the same appeal as the third rock from Kerbol. The planet Kerbin, a blue planet and covered with nice, balmy land, is host to an impossibly tiny race of creatures known as Kerbals.\n\nKerbals: Green, tiny, big-headed. These three words, more than anything else, define what a Kerbal is. **A Kerbal is green-** They are quite conscious to themselves and to their home planet; they would never pick a fight with each other for any significant reason, and they treat their little world with respect and admiration, as all living creatures should. **Kerbals are tiny-** Their small stature is perfectly befitting of their place in the universe: Little tiny green creatures, running around on a teeny tiny little world orbiting a tiny little star. Make no mistake, however, because while Kerbals are indeed tiny, they make up for it in what they are capable of. **Kerbals are quite big-headed:** Not just physically (their head volume makes up roughly equal or greater than that of the rest of their body), but mentally as well. Kerbals are beings of grand dreams, of grand schemes and grand means. Kerbals are the creatures that represent the very definition of ambition, of an undying dream.\n\nKerbals are spacefaring creatures at heart. From the very moment Kerbals gained their awesome sight, they have been gazing up at the universe in wonderment and yearned to travel to those tiny pinpricks of light in the night sky. Kerbals promptly spent their entire history in efficient cooperation: working, calculating, plodding, snacking, thinking, and building. Finally, they are ready. \n\nWith their great buildings built, with their feet on the ground and eyes in the sky, they prepare to step forth into their great, fire-spewing machines they\u0027ve created and fulfill their lifelong dreams. \n\n*The Kerbals are going to space.*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T15:13:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 03:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Maximus97**"},{"CreatedByName":"ChillinMcMillan","CreatedById":141138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T01:59:54Z","Content":"Beautiful.
