It would be a shame for the developers to\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeautifully shade, light and texture the spacecraft parts just so we can spend 90% of our time not looking at them. This is a difficult problem to solve as it objectively\u003Cbr\u003E\nis easier to fly the craft in map view. Maybe you could add a small orthographic top down view of your orbit around the planet, you could use this for simple stuff such as circularizing\u003Cbr\u003E\nyour orbit, and you can use the map view for more complex maneuvers such as rendezvous. Although it would be ideal to only setup maneuvers in map view, but to perform them while looking at the ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would also be cool to have a cinematic camera that automatically chooses good camera angles so that both your spacecraft and the planetary body you\u0027re orbiting are in view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime Warp improvements\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP 1 time warp is completely linear, speed in eccentric orbits isn\u0027t. This can be a problem as when you are approaching periapsis your spacecraft speeds up rapidly and that has\u003Cbr\u003E\nmade me miss my maneuver so many times. The fix for this would be to make the timewarp non linear. So when you are approaching periapsis timewarp would automatically slow down.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd it would speed up as you\u0027re approaching apoapsis. Also general improvements to timewarp (like fixing warp to node, or automatically slowing when getting close to a node etc.) would be good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and reaction wheel balancing\u003Cbr\u003E\nLet\u0027s be honest, reaction wheels are very overpowered and not very fun, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is pretty much useless unless you\u0027re just learning docking.

But after thinking a lot I found a great gameplay reason to implement this type of progression.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPeople mostly stop playing KSP1 because they get stuck somewhere, I think that is because the leaps from one goal to another can be very jarring (especially in the early game).\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnlocking probes first would be a great way not only to add realism, but to also flatten the learning curve. Instead of after achieving orbit, you immediately try landing and returning from the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat if your next mission would be just to set a satellite in orbit around the Mun, without the need to return it. This goal seems much easier and\u003Cbr\u003E\nonly teaches one simple concept, while going from barely knowing how to orbit to landing on the Mun and returning to Kerbin intact seems like an impossible challenge.\u003Cbr\u003E\nConstantly having challenges that are difficult but doable would make newer players want to continue playing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlthough Kerbals are central part of KSP, they can still be in the picture when piloting probes. Imagine while you\u0027re piloting a probe instead of normal kerbal portraits,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere would be a mission control portrait and the Kerbals would react to whatever is happening to the probe,\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0they could be screaming as the probe is about to crash,or they could be celebrating a successful landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome minor things\u003Cbr\u003E\nBallistic entry would be awesome since, if you nerf reaction wheels, the commands pods falling through the atmosphere would only be able to turn using aerodynamics,\u003Cbr\u003E\nso having a ballistic reentry profile would only make sense.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI find it much more fun to dock with a docking camera than just blindly, any way to measure movement relative to another ship would be great.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNon linear thrust would mean that you wouldn\u0027t have to mess with the engine thrust menus just to accelerate less than like a 100Gs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEngines should also not accelerate to 100% immediately, they should take some time to spool.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEngine gimbal should be smooth, would make rockets more stable, and of course, make the game more realistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd last of all, just take your time, I have a lot of faith in you guys and I wish you godspeed in the development process.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0I hope that you guys can make the best version of KSP2 possible.

It forces the player to design the game instead of the developers. Of course, if the player wants to, they can have control over everything, but changing these things might change the experience for the worse, leave the balancing to the developers. Also, when people discuss KSP2 they seem to discuss it in the context of KSP in the sense that they don\u0027t image KSP2 as a whole new game but instead as a KSP1 but with new features. When I said probes before manned you imagined just putting the KSP1 probes at the start of the tech tree, in reality, it\u0027s just not practical to think with KSP1 as a reference, I would imaging that all of the probes will be significantly rehauled as would be pretty much every other aspect of the game. Another example, you said that you will happily warp forward and freeze the ship which has been confirmed to no longer be possible because there is persistant rotation in KSP2.\u00A0 Don\u0027t think of KSP2 as KSP1 with added things, the devs have the freedom to make any game they want, and I really hope that that game is going to fix the insanely huge amount of problems that KSP1 had, they have a clean slate, an incredible opportunity, and I really, really hope that they don\u0027t let it slip out of their hands because of some people who can\u0027t think outside of the box.
