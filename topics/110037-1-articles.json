The game will crash over the desert well before you get there. (Something like a half hour of flight.) There will be a windows message that the game crashed. There will not be a crash folder.\n\nGame Version: 1.0.2\n\nI have lots of parts mods but this plane is mostly stock. The fuel tank is from KW Rocketry and one science instrument from DM orbital science. I don\u0027t think either has anything to do with it. I also have KJR, Transfer Window Planner, Docking Alignment Indicator, precise node. The remainder are all parts mods, whose parts are not on the plane.\n\nSpacecraft have no issues.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T20:41:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 08:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Leszek**\n  \nIssue resolved."},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T04:39:39Z","Content":"Well, I now have crashes with error logs, it seems I am running out of memory after about a half hour of flying. Some sort of memory leak then would be my guess, but I am not sure where to go next to track down what is causing the leak.

Reducing ground scatter helped a bit, and reducing texture resolution is a short term solution if I want to finish a flight, but no matter what I do (and what mods I uninstall) it always crashes after a while. Flying in space has not crashed the game for me yet, it usually crashes when I return to the Space Center...\n\nEdit: \u0022-force-opengl\u0022 as a start option reduces memory useage too, but drops the framerate (for me, at least). And press F10 if parts of your plane overheat.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T09:40:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 09:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JohnnyBB**"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T07:35:12Z","Content":"Ok so I turned off the heat overlay (F10) and low and behold I was able to fly just fine.
