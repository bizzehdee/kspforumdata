I came here to see if I could get an answer to a different question and this was the first post on the page. After my first few attempts to get things in orbit, I had left a good bit of debris behind. I now to try to make my launch stages self cleaning, but I still had several pieces of debris in orbit. Deleting them from the command center felt like cheating, so I decided to try and come up with a way to knock them out of orbit. After I did it a few times consistently, I figured I would just delete them from the command center and pretend I sent up a ship to do it. However, each attempt was a different challenge and I kept thinking I could do better, so I just kept going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/902134800753389937/5402286E671A84D31F0E9F95B6828948AE7221F1/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMy first design\u003C/a\u003E (sorry, I don\u0027t have screen shots of it in flight) was to use LT-1 lander legs as a grabber. This was in 0.21 and I didn\u0027t know that those legs were bugged when in the lowered position. After matching orbit with a non functioning satellite, I had to leave. When I returned and loaded the game, the legs were gone from my craft. I already put the time to get in orbit and lined up, so I just decided to try and nudge it out of orbit. It worked, but I think I just got lucky too. After matching orbits and lining up, I only had enough fuel for a half second burn. When I nudged up against it I just happened to be facing the retrograde and that half second burn was enough to deorbit the satellite and the deorbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second design I just swapped out the lander legs with an upside down small to large adapter. I figured since nudging worked in the last try that I would just give myself a larger surface area to nudge with. This design didn\u0027t work as well though. I went up after a rocket stage left after putting up a satellite. It took me a bit longer to get lined up with it facing retrograde, and when I performed the de-orbit burn the junk rolled off. I had to recapture it a couple of times to slow it down enough to deorbit it. Even then it only dipped into the atmosphere enough to slow it down and took two more orbits before aero breaking it slowed enough to bring it down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/902135452886468602/9FED26992B538FA8C2D5F6797AD9DA4CC8FACC10/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMy third design\u003C/a\u003E I used girders as a basket and the LT-2 landing lets as a lid for the basket. This craft worked pretty well. I was able to capture that rocket stage and had enough fuel, battery and RCS left over that I was able to capture another piece of junk with it. The second thing I deorbited with it was another satellite. It was working, but it really didn\u0027t server any purpose. I did discover a small flaw in the design though. That small satellite would slip out between the girders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that third craft was able to deorbit two pieces of debris, I came up with the idea to design a craft that would stay in orbit and could be reused over and over.
