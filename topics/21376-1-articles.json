I may make a version with a three-man command module, should be as easy as swapping the part in the craft file and moving a few things around in VAB. Currently, however, I am working on a two-story, 5-Kerbal habitat cube, which will be followed up with a 3-Kerbal launch to establish a base. The reason for the small capsules on the garage (and hab cube) is simply not putting all my eggs in one basket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T16:15:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENifty \u0022craft\u0022, and a great album showing it off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(So you actually managed to drive under an arch with no ill effects?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also diggin\u0027 the Venturer multirover bus linked in your sig.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-05T16:18:16Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2012 04:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Commander Zoom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aescwulf","CreatedById":51988,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T16:23:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still struggling getting a DEMV I to the Munar surface T_T and I see this...
