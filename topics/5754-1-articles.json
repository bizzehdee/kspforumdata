The good forum should be able to give you some tips. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, try keeping your plane simple at first, use straight airfoils (no anhedral or dihedral), and with no payload. Gradually evolve to multi-engine designs and exotic airfoils. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr_Pockets","CreatedById":13317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-19T02:21:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is one example of one of my planes that cannot roll.

Thanks for posting a pic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor functional ailerons I have only seen that once on the rare instance I was able to use the symmetry function to place the control surfaces. Other than that for heavy bombers and such I use the rudder to control roll. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a small ship like yours you probably won\\\u0027t need 4 huge control surfaces - normal surfaces will suffice and if you want added maneuverability just use a pair of canards on the front (Eurofighter style). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now for roll control probably you will want to lengthen the nose with 1 fuselage module, and add a bigger tail with moving rudder. Lengthening the aircraft;s nose will make the centre of gravity move forwards making it more stable (will not roll out of control suddenly), while the rudder will add better control authority. Remember, planes can\\\u0027t turn without rudders. (B-2 Spirit and other flying wings are exceptions, they have ways to get around the lack of a tail which we can\\\u0027t).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf in doubt just add an ASAS module in the front and use that as a fly by wire system while you troubleshoot the aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I am very sure you have a small plane with big wings. Too big for an engine of this size. Smaller wings would make troubleshooting easier, though I like the Mirage IV look \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-19T02:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EControl surfaces in this game function differently, depending on whether you had symmetry turned on or off when placing the control surface parts on your vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESymmetry turned on = ailerons.
