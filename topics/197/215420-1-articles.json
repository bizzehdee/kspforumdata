In KSP2, the game does not currently \u0022force you\u0022 into the same symmetry pattern as the existing part when you try to place a new part on it, resulting in what you have in the 3rd picture. There are 2 easy workarounds: build a collection of parts with symmetry by first building just one, building on that, and then copying its root and re-placing it in a symmetry pattern where you actually want it, or: place the first symmetrical parts, then when you want to add to them, you do the extra step of of switching to the same pattern as the first symmetrical part, meaning that if you want to put mirrored landing gear on a set of mirrored wings, you have to switch to mirror symmetry yourself, the game currently doesn\u0027t do it for you automatically. As for the bicoupler, the devs know about that and say they plan to fix it, but it\u0027s a convenience feature, not an actual problem, so for now, put 1 engine on, copy it to the other node to simulate the craft properly, set up your action groups and part settings for just one of the engines, delete the other, then copy the original engine to the other node again. That\u0027s also how you deal with the tediousness of the parts manager and action group manger right now, set up just one part in the managers, then copy and symmetry it to the craft.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MehJeb","CreatedById":227441,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-19T23:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwell... to start with - KSP1 had [R] and [T] - and for a reason... the new dev team keeps repeating the mistakes already done by Squad in KSP1 and solved...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand as for picture #3, look at it carefully: what it does is it goes through symmetry creation loop several time: and each time going into duplication of previous loop, that\u0027s wrong behavior and poor programming and needs to be solved... we\u0027re not looking for \u0022workarounds\u0022 - we are helping devs FIX obvious bugs (and those not that obvious as well)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vortygont","CreatedById":223549,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-20T10:20:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the last case with gear symmetry, I had similar cases with radial symmetry when I put my parts on boosters, but in the most cases floating in air and obviously unnecessary parts dissapeared and they were placed rightly.
