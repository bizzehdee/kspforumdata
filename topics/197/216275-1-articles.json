Example: I\u0027ve been trying to create a combined space craft with a altitude of 250 km above Kerbin. When I add a new section to the spacecraft I usually have the section attached to the upper stage with its own probe core so I can deorbit the booster that brought it up (clean up space). When I go to deorbit the upper stage the orbit of the now larger Moho spacecraft shifts to a highly elliptical orbit that takes the craft thru the planet and subsequently crash my Moho Spacecraft into Kerbin.\u00A0 Has anyone else had this issue? I was also having this issue before update 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Filed.Teeth","CreatedById":178610,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-07T01:14:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething as simple as putting a recoverable launcher and payload rocket into orbit will do it for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter separation, I will bring the launcher around one orbit to land it back near \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and the payload rocket (which is not being controlled at the time) will jump it\u0027s orbit, from something in the 70-75km range to having an AP of\u00A0 ~250km and impacting Kerbin about 90 degrees further along in the orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
