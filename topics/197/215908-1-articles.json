Add a fairing and everything contained within the fairing seems to misbehave and the entire upper stages leans and oscillates to the point of the rocket destroying itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe navball shows that there is full control inputs occuring, max roll, max pitch when no controls are being touched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStruts make zero difference, I\u0027ve tried two struts, four struts, thirty struts and there\u0027s no improvement. The issue seems contained to the large and extra large fairings. Also upon fairing jettison, the pieces cease behaving like they\u0027re objects affected by physics and just launch themselves off straight down toward Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
