I encountered the issue with struts and docking ports after loading a quicksave around the Mun. The attempt before I tried to undock so I can get ready to land, but that ended in the termination of the vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002248BELwY.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/48BELwY.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, before anyone asks, the CSM is an EJ_SA design.

I just needed to do a bit more to actually learn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
