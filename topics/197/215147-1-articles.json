I think afterburning mode can be have the exhaust blocked easier than cruise mode, and that wings have larger hitboxes than their models suggest. I solved this by moving some of the wings on my plane more clear of the exhaust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason_25","CreatedById":55730,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-25T19:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have also seen what BlueB1C2 has seen.\u00A0 The afterburner is more easily blocked for some reason.\u00A0 In KSP this was less of a problem because if the part was blocking an exhaust stream then it would become heated up and a heat indicator for the part would pop up.\u00A0 In this game, you should give all your engines a wide berth because you can even run into a partial thrust situation with occluded engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
