Hopefully you find a fix. For the rapier engines\u00A0 me won\u0027t do anything when in closed cycle once you leave atmo they burn fuel but no thrust. But in atmo they work fine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MegaRouge","CreatedById":228204,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-24T17:04:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had the same issue with multiple spaceplanes using Rapiers. The engines worked fine in air breathing mode, switched to closed cycle and worked fine to orbit and also worked fine in orbit, but after re-entry the engines would not work in either air breathing or closed cycle mode. They are burning fuel but producing no thrust and there is no exhaust animation. Note that this was not a problem before the first patch, so I assume this problem was introduced by whatever Rapier fix was in patch 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donkey32","CreatedById":174169,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-24T17:25:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is happening with Whiplash engines as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
