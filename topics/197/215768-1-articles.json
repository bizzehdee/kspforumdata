I have a Command Module (CM) and a Munar Lander Module (LM) on the same ascent vehicle. In lower Kerbin orbit the CM detaches, rotates 180deg and docks with the LM. Just like the real Apollo missions did. At this point I still have 2 Kerbinauts in the CM and one in the LM. Then they get into Munar orbit, the LM detaches and descends, lands on the Mun. Ascents and rendezvous with the CM in Low Munar Orbit. At this time the 2 Kerbals that were the CM are gone. No EVA, not floating.. just GONE. Poof-vanished without a trace. I can\u0027t control the CM to re-dock with the returning LM. I\u0027ve repeated this several times. And the two in the CM keep disappearing after the LM lands on the Mun. Has anyone else seen this? Are Kerb-aliens abducting my Kerbinauts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022a9VG4mX.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022225\u0022 width=\u0022400\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/a9VG4mX.gif\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zylark","CreatedById":101018,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-23T14:25:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI encountered a similar bug. I did a Mun landing - not quite Apollo Style but close enough - with the intrepid trio Jeb, Bill and Bob. Landed with Jeb, got back up and docked with the CM, got Jeb back in with the two others and undocked the Lander. Left the Lander in Munar orbit. Upon return to Kerbin and recovering the CM Capsule and our heroes, I called it quits for the night, saved and exited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn return to that save today, Jeb, Bill and Bob were not available in the roster of Kerbonauts. Not only that, it said the Lander I left in orbit was landed on the Mun - actually upon inspection, beneath the Mun surface. And to top it off - was occupied by Barth for some odd reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLatest version - no mods.
