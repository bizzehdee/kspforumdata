It\u2019s bad enough we can\u2019t pause and make a maneuver (I assume this was to add a sort of challenge to the game) but this is just punishing to the player. If we could even have that info on screen when making the maneuver, that would be way better.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-I can\u2019t figure out how to see very vital and simple information about my ship in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E for things such as battery charge. I\u2019m not sure if that was an oversight or a bug but that seems like important info to know without having to add up every battery on your ship.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-This probably doesn\u2019t need to be said but autostrut. We need it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The parts manager really seems to get in the way. I understand the need for it but I really wish it wasn\u2019t the primary way to use anything on the rocket. I wish it was a choice to use if you need to find a piece that\u2019s hard to get to on your craft.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Randomly some tanks will get rotated when moving sub assemblies in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. It seems to have no real predictability either. One time it will rotate just one, another time it will rotate the whole symmetry, and sometimes it will just do one tank on every symmetry but it will be a different tank each time.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-I really dislike having multiple saves of multiple crafts in multiple workspaces. I really don\u2019t understand the cluttered aspect of a save menu. Maybe folders being the workspace and sub-saves below that would help organize it?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-being at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is really restricting and boring. I think it would be way better to be able to rotate from the center on the ground similar to RTS games or something like Cities Skylines or other god mode games. Right now I can only rotate in place with the origin being the camera and it feels really weird and lifeless and restricting. I don\u2019t think movement is totally necessary but I would like to be able to move around a bit.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-fairings jettison straight forward rather than out. I don\u2019t see a purpose in using clamshell because none of them jettison like a clamshell. Using 1, 2, 3, or 4 pieces do nothing different because all pieces stick together as they jettison away anyways.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Fairing construction had a big downgrade in this game. I can\u2019t figure out how to attach the end of the fairing to the rest of the rocket. It seems like you can only make a point and that\u2019s about it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-I can\u2019t \u201Csee more info\u201D on anything in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E that doesn\u2019t have extra stats. This might seem useless but the descriptions of most parts don\u2019t fit in the box allotted so we aren\u2019t able to read the rest of the description, which is frustrating because some parts seem to have a niche purpose that I can\u2019t figure out. For instance, the small structural fuselage. I assume there must be a niche purpose for it since there aren\u2019t any other sizes and it\u2019s the only one of its kind.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The adjustable toobs are super cool but extremely useless if we can\u2019t do anything with them. They are unable to attach radial ports to, or really anything radially, and can only be used as an empty spacer. Would be really cool to be able to use these to cover up any parts we deem unappealing. Maybe nodes in the middle based off length similar to fairings in the old game? (Speaking of that, we could also use that in the fairings in this game \u0026lt;3)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-When placing things radially, a lot of the time a pink square will replace one of the objects. It seems you can fix this by picking up another piece in the radial collection and putting it back on the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Struts and the fuel line will sometimes stay attached to one stage after being decoupled.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-When focusing another craft, my camera will become locked and I am unable to do anything.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Letting go of my ship in space (not in atmosphere) caused my Kerbal to randomly explode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Stage switching is very clunky and never seems to do what I want it to. I can\u2019t figure out if I place it above the stage I want or below and it seems to just have a mind of its own.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The launcher was such a bad idea. Entirely anti consumer. The only explanation for it is to push your publishers other games and it undeniably creates a worse experience for the gamer. I hate how long it takes to boot up the game. I should not have to open something to open the game and then wait for 5 unskipable title screens. I get the strobe warning but why does every company need their own unskipable page? It\u2019s a bit egotistical if you ask me\u2026 basically all this does is make it harder for me to want to open the game and play, especially knowing I can\u2019t play the game as intended anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly I can\u2019t start or complete a single mission or really do much of anything in the game. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating to play and I find myself in a constant struggle of wanting to play and do everything I think of but then realizing I can\u2019t do a single one of those things for at least a few months, which originally was when I thought we would get the really fun stuff like science, colonies, and more. I don\u2019t believe those mechanics could or even should be added until KSP2 is at least in a state where you could craft, launch, fly, encounter, doc, and land a vessel which seems to be a far ways away. Some bugs seem easy to fix but others I fear are going to need an entire rework of current systems. I would personally sacrifice some of the old \u201Cfeeling\u201D for new and improved feelings. Catering to those who would rather play the old game seems like an inevitable way to shoot yourself in the foot. I understand the mantra, and I do agree with it to some degree, but I really think this game deserves some new approaches and maybe it\u2019s own unique feeling inspired by KSP1. Honestly, I\u2019m not a game dev to the degree that you are so I don\u2019t want to pretend to know the answers, all I know is, as an avid KSP1 fan, this game hurts my soul.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MehJeb","CreatedById":227441,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-21T08:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe there is a sticky post in this sub-forum asking specifically to not create \u0022compilations\u0022 of bugs - go work a little, create 7 different posts for 7 bugs... this bible you post here is gonna be lost as noone has time to read non-defined bug descriptions when there are so many well defined... just out of respect for your own job already done typing all this - go and split them into actual bug report topics\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicrose","CreatedById":224410,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-22T06:09:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224263165\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022215618\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221679387085\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227441\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MehJeb\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, MehJeb said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe there is a sticky post in this sub-forum asking specifically to not create \u0022compilations\u0022 of bugs - go work a little, create 7 different posts for 7 bugs... this bible you post here is gonna be lost as noone has time to read non-defined bug descriptions when there are so many well defined... just out of respect for your own job already done typing all this - go and split them into actual bug report topics\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, I must have missed that.
