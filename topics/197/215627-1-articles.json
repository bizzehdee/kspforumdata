Landing went perfectly. I enabled infinite propellant, and decided to jetpack around Eeloo, wanting to go down into a massive ravine which I had landed next to. When I was ~12 or 13 km away, I went into map view, and targeted my lander, to return to it. As I neared it- mind you, I was flying with the EVA pack at considerable speed- I could tell my velocity was too fast, and I zoomed WAY past the craft, by like several kilometers. When I turned around, there was still a target indicator on the navball, but there was no craft to be seen, not even in map view. Even the flag that I had planted was gone. Odd, I thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday I landed on Pol, and again, I turned on infinite propellant to fly away and explore. This time, when I got about 1-1.3 km away from my lander and my flag, I heard an explosion. I turned around to see debris markers flying away from the ground at the landing site. They probably flew up a few hundred meters before hitting the ground again and exploding. I can only assume this is what happened to Val\u0027s lander, too. That being said, Bob thought he was returning to Kerbin, so I was a little more disappointed this time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Turbo Ben","CreatedById":193979,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-21T01:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had something similar happen on Pol. Landed, planted a flag and then went for an excursion with the jet pack. I did see my ship fall over (had to land on the transfer stage engine after finding out docking ports can\u0027t be staged), but with such low gravity on Pol it didn\u0027t explode. After travelling with the jetpack for a few km, I decided to head back to the ship, only to find it had disappeared along with the flag. I suppose the falling ship could have taken out the flag, but what happened to the ship I have no idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was pre patch 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VlonaldKerman","CreatedById":225683,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-21T15:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224263043\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022215627\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221679362306\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022193979\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Turbo Ben\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, Turbo Ben said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was pre patch 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting.
