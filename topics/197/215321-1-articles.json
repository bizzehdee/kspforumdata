If, lets say, your maneuver requires only a small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and you have very large engines, you might want to dial back the thrust on those engines so you don\u0027t miss the stop time. Doing so however, does not update the burn time or the resulting maneuver trajectory (since nodes are at the start of the burn rather than the center) so executing it would result in you shifting the center of your burn further away then what you see and as a result, throwing your trajection way off.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nExpected result: Changing engine parameters should result in a new calculation of burn time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFeature request: Add remaining \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to the UI so instead of seeing a burn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirement, you see a remaining \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E or a combination such as 70/70 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E at the start of the burn and 20/70 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E after burning off 50 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E. This way, we have something a little more precise to use than a meter bar with very thick increment lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
