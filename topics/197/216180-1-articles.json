After roughly 4:24-4:28 into every flight the rocket will destroy the decoupler between the engine mount and first stage, and or the decoupler between the engine on the LEM and the upper stage. I tried restarting the game, and modifying the craft to fix this. I also tried staging away the first stage early, and even the second stage right after first stage separation. Every time something breaks at this time point in the flight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time corresponds with the time it takes the first stage to run out of fuel. or close to it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also tried firing the first stage held down by launch clamps and experienced no issues at burnout.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also have a structural failure if I try staging after burning the first stage dry held down on the ground.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe weirdest part is that I lose control even if the command module is intact and presumably the kerbals inside are alive.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow at this point I am confused but begin to notice that perhaps it is an altitude problem. I try again without doing any gravity turns and notice that indeed, some sort of physics gets applied to the rocket when it reaches ~21.5km, however, this time flying straight up nothing experiences a structural failure.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ninterestingly even turning on unbreakable joints on I still experience parts breaking when in a gravity turn and reaching 21.5km\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried a further test and yet again experienced a sudden buffet of physics forces upon reaching 21.5km. I kept the rocket going without staging and at 4:37 the same structural parts failed and the rocket lost the ability to be controlled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a note for the devs I DO have the stiffness of joints turned up from the standard 1500 to 15e6.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have a good way to insert or upload images and I am not about to get an account on some website to do so,\u00A0 but I did take screen captures of a few of the failures.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
