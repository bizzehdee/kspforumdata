After this the kerbal no longer responded to the ASWD keys. I loaded a quicksave after landing and then was able to move again with the ASWD keys but then the keys to climb the ladder and board the craft (tried jumping since I couldn\u0027t climb) did not work. The pop-up showing the keys for grabbing the ladder and boarding was also partially cut off when it appeared. Got frustrated so haven\u0027t tried the quick save again yet, but wanted to report the bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
