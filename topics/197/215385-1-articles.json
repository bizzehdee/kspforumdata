The \u0022jettison\u0022 action detaches the engine plate\u0027s shroud. It does not decouple the node below it. That\u0027s why it is specifically not named \u0022decouple\u0022, but rather something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to decouple a stage below an engine plate, you must use a stack decoupler or stack separator. (Conveniently, both of them are hollow rings, so your desired setup will still work.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy best guess as to why that was done is that the engine plates with built-in decouplers in KSP1 were essentially \u0022upside down\u0022 - the decoupler stayed with the stage it was attached to, rather than the stage that was decoupled. This went against all other ingame logic, confused the heck out of the Engineer\u0027s Report in the editor, and had the potential to mess with fuel flow logic in certain edge cases. It made sense to streamline them for KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
