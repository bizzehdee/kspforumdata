Sometimes when I switch from flight mode to tracking station any vessel in orbit anywhere starts acting up. For example I switched to a rocket I left in orbit.. to find out is invisible. Not only that, but is no longer orbiting, it\u0027s launched away from the solar system to who knows where. the Kerbal is in it so i know the ship is there. I take my kerbal outside of the module and the module magically reapears. The fuel and engines are gone though and it\u0027s just the module flying away almost as if every single stage triggered without me knowing about it. A satellite I have on the mun is spinning like crazy and I can\u0027t do anything because the solar panels are not charging it because they can\u0027t get sun exposure long enough. I notice this happens when I switch to tracking station. I use both ways, the small icon at the bottom of the screen and I also use the ESC button in my keyboard and select tracking station from there. One of those two is causing the problem. Also If I rename any vessel in the tracking station, As soon as I exit, the names go back to weird default names. Not only that, but I\u0027ve loaded the games and sometimes the names are switched for example from\u00A0 \u0022default #24\u0022 goes to \u0022default #8\u0022. This doesn\u0027t happen during the gameplay, it happens when I exit the game completely and Load a save file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I left the game run a bit in it\u0027s bugged state.. suddenly the vessel UNBUGGED and I can now regain control of it. when in and out of tracking station a couple of times to check on them.. and they UNBUGGED for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-04-05T06:36:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2023 06:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by shuliito1789\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate on the bug.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
