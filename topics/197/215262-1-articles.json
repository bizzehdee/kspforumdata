I kind of attached the rocket with the rover but now it crashes 100% when trying to launch. It usually also crashes when the parts get scrambled and you try Undo/Redo. Which makes me wonder if the scrambling of parts during attachment and the crash are somewhat related. I have a save file that reliably reproduces this issue on at least 2 very different PCs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
