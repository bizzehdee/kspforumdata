It seems like it is constantly switching between windowed fullscreen and fullscreen mode as sometimes I can move my cursor off my main monitor and over to another window like Chrome and other times I\u0027m stuck in my same monitor. It\u0027s INCREDIBLY frustrating when you destroy a craft while docking because your screen went black or your screen comes back on and you realize you\u0027re flipping uncontrollably.\u00A0 On that note, it would be really useful to be able to leave my game window up while I\u0027m in a browser or something like most other applications and games. I never fully understood why some games minimize to taskbar whenever focus is lost but I imagine it\u0027s just an oversight as many Unity games implement this into their games. Personally I thought it was a difference between fullscreen and windowed fullscreen but it doesn\u0027t seem to work with either of them...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
