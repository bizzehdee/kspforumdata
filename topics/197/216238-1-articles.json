The only way to solve the problem is to change your Windows to English if it is not in English. There must be an official patch for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the language you use has non-English letters like uppercase \u0022i\u0022 = \u0022\u0130\u0022 etc., this bug appears. On main menu screen I see SINGLEPLAY button like S\u25A1NGLEPLAY. I think this is why there is a problem verifying in-game texts. This is why the game gets stuck on the loading screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
