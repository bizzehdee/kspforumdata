I made a rather simple landing parachute crane for a Duna rover. No thrusters or anything. Just some \u0027chutes and trusses. Anyways, it keeps randomly jumping like this then it will suddenly try to change direction completely randomly. It ruined my Duna Rover launch completely. I even rebuilt the rover and crane to no avail. Also, at one point, a random truss piece flew off, and when I inspected closer, I didnt see any missing truss pieces? Very strange. I attached a video of the anomaly.:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtube.com/watch?v=vvBegMZiTMs\u0026amp;si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtube.com/watch?v=vvBegMZiTMs\u0026amp;si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
