I launched a large craft into orbit. After that I was unable to Load any vessels onto the launchpad from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. It would freeze on the loading screen and I would have to restart. This occured even with new campaigns. I fixed the issue by wiping all my game files and doing a clean install.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI uploaded the corrupt game folder.
