To better follow these points, I have recorded the flight. The Problems start after engaging the Afterburners via Action Group at 0:37 in the Video\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLink:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E-O4_n4VMIg?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022KSP2 Bug Report: Multiple Issues with Panther Engine\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeel free to ask if you have any Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
