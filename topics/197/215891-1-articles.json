I am a 78h noob, currently building a space fuel station for further missions out to the Kerbol system. I read it was a good step to build something requiring rendezvous after getting people to the Mun. I am 12/19 stages done with the build i envisioned \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have in the building of this station relied heavily on \u0022Remote Guidance Units\u0022 or Probes to get the parts into space. How ever.. when ever i drop the second stage i lose control of the rocket and it says there is no \u0022No CommNet Connection\u0022 - See image below.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wMjfAk6.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/wMjfAk6.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow! As i am a noob, i am not sure what a CommNet is... I have a feeling its a satelite network, like the GPS system or something (which i have not made) - but I can Fix/Circumvent this \u0022issue\u0022 by quick saving and then quick loading.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is not only this, I have relied heavily on a small \u0022Tug Drone\u0022 i made for the purpose of assembling the parts in space... The ISS version of a forklift i guess.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is a few images for context:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZKqk531.jpeg\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ZKqk531.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd two images of them working and doing their thing (sorry they are a bit dark)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DcCZBHb.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002281.24\u0022 width=\u0022597\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DcCZBHb.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022luu8hAR.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002261.95\u0022 width=\u00221059\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/luu8hAR.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese little guys also have the issue, that when they dock/undock they lose CommNet - they have antennas on them... and my space station has 4 huge disks.. so i guess they should be controllable around the station at least?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny way, I also find, some times when i quick safe / quick load to get them going, its like the reaction wheel in them dont work. It wobbles and wants the center of the craft to be off center. This is also fixed by quick safe quick load.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHope this helps with the bug slaying!\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPS. It seems like the relative position of crafts could be more precisely saved? I have noticed that when i quick safe to have a point i can load if i mess up the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E maneuvering (which i relied heavily on in the beginning of the assembly) They were not were i saved them when i loaded... and i think this is what, some times causes the station to blow up... as it loads a vehicle within another vehicle. But I have not experienced this enough to be certain about it.. its just a theory.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-25T16:27:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2023 04:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by BechMeister\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarification.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
