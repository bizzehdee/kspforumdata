Currently, I\u0027m using Rapiers and normally end up at around 13k feet speedlocking at around 300m/s. \n\nI read and seen some ideas about diving and then pushing through, and I know the best speed for that engine is over mach 3. Can anyone give me a hint?"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:53:01Z","Content":"If you are speedlocking at 300m/s at 13k feet, that is an issue.\n\nTry holding at 10km, and accumulating some speed. You should be able to get 500k/s, or more, at that altitude. And as you climb toward 20km, you should be seeing speeds in excess of 1km/s. About that time is when the engine starts wanting to cut out (this is where I pitch up and go to Rocket Mode, usually...).\n\nEDIT:\n\nOne thing I found that helps during the transition from Air-Breathing to Rocket Mode is to close the air-intakes. Their Drag goes down when you do this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T15:55:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 03:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EtherDragon**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:58:27Z","Content":"Climb as fast as possible to the 13k mark, the level out with your prograde vector at 5 degrees.

Don\u0027t try to achieve the jet stage ceiling, but rather try to achieve vmax at an altitude where you still have enough air \u002B power for the engines. Then pull (gently) up, zoom into a steep climb and kick in the rocket stage when air is running out.

Also I\u0027ve found that at around 0.0166 intake air per engine means you basically never have to worry about flame out. \n\nI initially climb as fast as possible, keeping my speed below 270 m/s to stay under the worst of the mach 1 drag. Then between 12-14k and I switch to 0-5 degree upslope to gain speed to ~470-500 m/s. Being careful to stay above 450 m/s so as not to re-enter the mach 1 drag, I climb at 20-30 degrees to 17km where I level off to around 5-10%. I build up speed until the rapiers lose thrust above 22km and my speed acceleration heads almost to zero. There I switch rapier modes and close intakes and try to get above 32km as fast as possible. After 32km I point near prograde until main engine cutoff as my apoapsis rises above 75 km."},{"CreatedByName":"mikeb30165","CreatedById":60789,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:49:34Z","Content":"Totally agree with Garth Gerbal, but for one odd thing: I discovered (by accident) that by holding 5 degrees while firing in closed-cycle mode from 29K onwards - not pulling-up to reach apoapsis ASAP - I got about 100 more delta-v into orbit. (at 29K, Rapiers auto-switch modes when using the new-shaped ram-inlets). Total speed would be about 2150K, dribbling off to 2050 by the time 70km was reached, leaving a circization burn of just 350K. According to mechjeb, total Dv used was about 4200 which is good for a space plane.\n\nNot sure why this happens, but noticed the same behaviour, many times with other planes \u0026 also when when flying rockets. My guess is (probably wrong!) that the atmosphere is thinner then it used to be from 30K onwards so drag-losses while coasting are lower. Add in other factors like that the Rapier\u0027s ISP just about max\u0027s out from 30K, circulisation is closer to the ground, steering losses are lower, your nose is deviated less rom the petrograde during the early part of the coasting etc and you seem get a little more left in the tanks after ascent. (anyone else had this experience?). \n\nTo help with the original question, give yourself plenty of power (TWR of 1.3/1\u002B at sea-level, 4/1\u002B at 30K) and only put on as few wings/control surfaces as you can getaway with on your plane; the emulated trans-sonic drag, is very, very heavy and can stop an underpowered plane dead in its tracks at mach 0.99.\n\nHope this helps..\n\n(Quick update: just seen Cybersol\u0027s suggestions: this is basically what I do too. works a treat!)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T16:54:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mikeb30165**"},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:53:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My guess is (probably wrong!) that the atmosphere is thinner then it used to be from 30K onwards so drag-losses while coasting are lower.\n\nYour guess ist right.

This got me up on the first shot, with about 200 dV left. The plane in question has 6 Rapiers, and weights about 60t at start. Wasn\u0027t a perfect ascent though, leveled out a little under 10km by mistake, so I nearly cooked off some parts during the 10-20km accel. Anyway, thanks for that tip; I\u0027ll probably tighten up my ascent on future tests, and also probably tweak the design a bit. The current design has 8 shock-cones and 12 pre-coolers (I\u0027d been trying to get a 20\u002Bkm cruise altitude), so I can probably shave those numbers down a bit."}]}
