Despite the MK1\u0027s description saying the liquid fuel is lighter, this does not seem to reflect in the weight of the fuel tank. Both tanks weight the same, 2.25t, and the mass\u00A0values of liquid fuel (.90t)\u00A0to oxidizer (1.10t) in the FL-T400 tank add up to the mass of liquid fuel in the MK1 tank, 2.0t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand the fact that liquid fuel in the game might weigh less then oxidizer, but I could have sworn in 1.0.5, it actually mattered, and a full FL-T400 weighed slightly more then then a fuel\u00A0MK1 liquid fuel tank..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould someone un-confuse me on this please\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-01T22:58:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2016 10:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by fireblade274\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T23:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAFAIK, LF and Ox have always had the same masses (5kg/unit).
