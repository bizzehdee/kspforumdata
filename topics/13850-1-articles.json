It has been tested as zoom-climb capable up to 20,909 meters. It has enough fuel for approximately 30 minutes of full-throttle afterburners. During one test flight, which occurred mostly between 14,200m and 15,300m, the \u003Cem\u003ESwallow\u003C/em\u003E flew at an \u003Cem\u003Eaverage\u003C/em\u003E of 532m/s - that includes takeoff and the climb to altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETakeoff is smooth and only requires approximately 450 meters of landing strip - although it can be done in less by experienced pilots, it is recommended to keep the autopilot (SAS) on during takeoff to avoid destroying the tail as you pull up. The \u003Cem\u003ESwallow\u003C/em\u003E can be independent of the runway at approximately 83 m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as maneuverability goes, well, she\\\u0027s no \u003Cem\u003EBroadwing\u003C/em\u003E, but is adequate enough. She\\\u0027s also light enough to make unpowered landings feasible. The \u003Cem\u003ESwallow\u003C/em\u003E comes in several variants, the first being the one you see here in these images. These additional variants are the \u003Cem\u003ESwallow-B\u003C/em\u003E, which carries a large volume of dumb gravity bombs; \u003Cem\u003ESwallow-M\u003C/em\u003E, which carries eight unguided missiles; and finally, the \u003Cem\u003ESwallow-R\u003C/em\u003E, which is simply a \u003Cem\u003ESwallow\u003C/em\u003E with rocket-assisted takeoff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:48px;\u0022\u003E*Including gliding\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:48px;\u0022\u003E**During shallow dive, not level flight - level top speed approaches 675m/s.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlease note:\u003C/strong\u003E you will need r4mon\\\u0027s fixed camera plugin and cockpit .cfgs as I have installed them and don\\\u0027t intend on removing them.
