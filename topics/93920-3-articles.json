It \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E take 11km/s, but only if you deliberately want it to. If you leave on day ~720 and choose to take a stupid route it is 11km/s. This gives you a travel time of 350 days. If you leave on the same date, however, you could spend less than 5km/s and be there in 240 days. So by choosing an odd route you are costing yourself 6km/s and 110 days. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is far from the discussion about whether Duna and Eve\u0027s windows should be brought forward. Eeloo, Jool and Moho have much more regular transfer windows (just over a year for Eeloo and Jool and a lot less for Moho, which has a \u003Cstrong\u003Elong\u003C/strong\u003E transfer window every 135 days). Those windows are unlikely to effect a new players ability to go interplanetary quickly as they are not primary targets, and the windows come round fairly regularly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a new player, Duna and Eve would be the two main targets. Duna\u0027s transfer window is around day 220, I feel this is fair to give new players time to pick up the basics to have a good chance of making the window. At no point in the first 400 days, will a direct transfer from Kerbin to Duna, with aerobraking, cost more than 2000km/s if you time it right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor these reasons, I think experienced players should bear the burden of the extra 0.5-1 km/s delta-V if they want to go to Duna \u0022early\u0022 rather than force inexperienced players to rush for a deadline (if they are even aware the deadline exists), considering it takes 800 days until the next transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T18:27:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERusty6899: Don\u0027t misunderstand me, I agree that the current transfer windows are mostly okay. I realise 11km/s is a \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E pessimistic for Duna, but for a reasonable transfer delay at a bad time, you do get pretty close to that (9-10km/s). Moho\u0027s another beast though - its inclined, low orbit can make some transfer windows quite a bit more expensive than others, not to mention you\u0027ll arrive at a pretty crazy velocity (if you don\u0027t pick a nearly-ideal time to transfer) with not a great deal of time to slow down before you leave the SoI again.

Let\u0027s look at how the mechanics work together to encourage this sort of behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. There are no fixed costs in the game. You don\u0027t pay upkeep on the facilities, you don\u0027t pay salaries, and there\u0027s no penalty for sitting around doing nothing. Everything you need to pay for is purely discretionary. This means you can sink every fund into whatever it is you want, which is the first step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. There are no on-going costs for a mission. There\u0027s no limit to how many missions you can have going simultaneously, there\u0027s no need to pay the techs to track the mission, the controllers to monitor it, parts don\u0027t wear out, there\u0027s no life support, and so on. This means that, subject to the constraints of orbital mechanics, you can leave a spacecraft wherever you want and it will be there whenever you come back to it. The only costs a mission has are the ones it incurs at launch. This is the second step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. There\u0027s no opportunity cost for declining a contract. You can refresh the contract list however much you want until you get the contract you want. There\u0027s no reputation penalty, no financial penalty, and the contracts refresh immediately if you decline one you don\u0027t like. This is the third step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Contracts can be completed by any vessel that meets its requirements, which means that the spacecraft you left in orbit can complete science missions. This is the fourth and final step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have orbital science contracts, there\u0027s nothing stopping you from getting an arbitrarily large amount of money by putting a satellite into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a few ways to fix this. The first is to introduce the dreaded time-based mechanics. This is also the one I think is preferable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Upkeep gets paid on buildings per time period, Kerbals get salaries every so often, and if you run out of money, things stop working until and unless you get enough to pay the balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Every active mission takes up a slot at the tracking station. If you have too many simultaneous missions, then you can\u0027t launch anything new until an old one ends. Also, every active mission requires a certain amount of money to keep track of, possibly depending on the cost and part count of the vessel itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Contracts refresh on a timer, like every day or week. Evey contract you decline is one you don\u0027t get back until the timer elapses, so you might end up taking a less than ideal contract to ensure that you can make ends meet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. With the above changes, this ceases to be an issue and can be left as is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, if time-based costs are unpalatable, the only alternative I can see being viable is mission based costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. List first because it is the most important to address in this scenario, contracts have to be assigned at launch and can only be completed by the spacecraft that was launched to fulfill them. You can\u0027t park a spacecraft in orbit and have it fulfill any and all contracts you throw at it. You have to specifically launch one to fulfill it. This really renders the rest moot, but I\u0027ll look at them nonetheless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Contracts have a surcharge based on the level of your facilities and how many Kerbals you have employed. This would give some pressure to accept more difficult but higher paying contracts, since they have to cover not only the cost of the vessel, but the cost of maintaining your space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. On-going costs in this system don\u0027t matter. If a mission takes a long time, it takes a long time. You can\u0027t get any new contracts without launching a new mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. There should be some cost to declining a contract, even if it\u0027s more or less a nominal charge of funds. Players will eventually have to pick a contract, whether or not it\u0027s ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T20:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, Nemoricus, but no. Your concept violates the golden rule of game design: you do not take control away from the player. Whenever you have a dilemma of game design wherein players favor grind over variety, the answer is not to \u003Cem\u003Eforce\u003C/em\u003E variety, it is to \u003Cem\u003Eincentivize\u003C/em\u003E variety.

The takeaway from this is that the alternatives are too difficult, don\u0027t pay nearly well enough, and/or are very easy to fail. My go-to example at this point of bad contracts are the aerial/visual surveys. Their payout is atrociously bad for what they ask you to do, their precision requirements are excessive, their engineering requirements are excessive, and ultimately they take far too long to complete. Adjustments are badly in need for this variety of contract, for as it stands, they just take up space on the mission control contract list to tempt players who haven\u0027t tried them yet and don\u0027t yet realize that they\u0027re horrible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-22T20:25:21Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2014 08:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRender\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T20:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESkyRender: I actually enjoy those survey contracts (on Kerbin!).
