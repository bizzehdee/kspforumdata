I know texture replacer can change the outward appearance of helmets and there are a couple of mesh switch options, interstellar and firespitter, perhaps in combination they can achieve the helmet swap in such a way that kerbal crew while boarded will be wearing your custom helmet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe making of the actual helmet is fairly easy so I\u0027d try to sort out the application of it before worrying too much about appearances\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WRalyV9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WRalyV9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-01T21:08:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2016 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SpannerMonkey(smce)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"martinezfg11","CreatedById":59995,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T22:08:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be cool to be able to swap helmets in the IVA scene, to add flight helmets to airplane crews.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
