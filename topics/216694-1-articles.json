But I\u0027m regretting it, because now for the second time, the download offered for the patch is a complete install of the game instead of a delta patch. I would like a steam key or a refund, or better yet, that 1.3 is offered as a **patch** instead of a whole new game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
