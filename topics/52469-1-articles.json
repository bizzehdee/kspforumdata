The Jool system isn\u0027t that hard to get to, with aerobraking you can put heavy stuff into orbit, landing on one of the smaller moons isn\u0027t all that hard and you\u0027d be able to return with plenty of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Eeloo isn\u0027t all that hard to get to, nor return from. Consider just bringing back a Mk1-2 pod from there, mass is what, 4 tons for the pod alone? 4x8000 for just returning the pod, compared to how you\u0027d have to bring almost 107tons back from M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn to get the same score, that\u0027s nearly three full orange tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso what\u0027s unclear is if the entire mass has to land on the surface, or only a Kerbal/lander. This would make the challenge even more skewed since you could leave heaps of mass in orbit, land with a simple lander and then return home with the interplanetary stage, which even empty could weigh a lot. It\u0027s understandable that you want to keep the score calculation simple, but it really skews things unless you introduce a rule that the entire mass has to land on said location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were to do that though, you\u0027d have to figure out a better scoring list, depending on delta-v required to reach the planet/moon and its surface gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge itself seems fun, but I would suggest a rework and clarification.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Affan","CreatedById":76236,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T12:36:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for the advice, making the changes now.

Plus what about stages you may drop during that liftoff? How does their weight on surface count to the 50% you\u0027re supposed to bring back? Or are we supposed to dismantle the ship down on Kerbin to check that the lander part is at least 50%? What if I transfer fuel to it so its tanks are full and it weighs more, will it be considered cheating or not? That fuel was not down there, or was it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest to drop the 50% clause - your score comes from complete weight which visited the other body and returned to Kerbin, nothing more.
