These are 3.7V standard. CPU needs 5V, and there aren\u0027t good opportunities to step it up. Solar panels will bring something like 4V-5V, depending on temperature. So that means two banks in series (each bank can have 1 or more cells in parallel) that charge at roughly 2.5A with full illumination of 5 panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat gives us a total of a little over 900mAh of charge in 45 minutes. I would like to at least double capacity from that to 1,800mAh. That would allow for more than 3 minutes uninterrupted broadcast at full 200W, assuming we build transmitter to work with these 7.4V. It also means that 45 minutes would only half-charge the batteries. But even at half, it\u0027d be safe to send some transmissions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CPU drawing only 5V is a bit of an inconvenience, but I think I can split that 7.4V source into a 5V \u002B 2.4V using a Zener diode, and use the 2.4V for something non-essential, rather than waste them as heat. Everything else that draws considerable power can be designed to use these 7.4V specifically. Sensors, etc. shouldn\u0027t draw enough to worry about such details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last bit, I don\u0027t know if there is a good way to distribute power dynamically. It will be easier, and more reliable, if we simply have a charge cycle and work cycle. During charge cycle, each LiPo cell charges through its own constant current circuit using the 4V\u002B from the solar panels. Every other systems runs off the panels as well, effectively isolated from batteries. Once voltage on panels drops, it will switch to drawing power from batteries. That will isolate solar batteries. Part of the advantage here is that we\u0027ll have less heat loss in this mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince rear face will always be shade-facing, I propose using it as a radiator by painting it black and insulating it from the rest of the sat, except via a thermocouple. We can then use the later to control heat flow out of the craft. On the day side, we\u0027ll probably be wasting some power to actively push heat to the radiator panel, and on the night side, cut that flow down. This isn\u0027t something that most cubesats have to worry about, but it might be critical for a bio experiment. I\u0027ll do estimates on expected heat flows later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T07:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we really need radiators would it be possible to have some kind of corrugated or finned panel in the shade behind the solar panels to get rid of heat? even just two taking up half of a panel each centered behind solar panels should be good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T07:32:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinns are only good for air cooling.

Depending on how we go with the LiPo batteries, you need to be careful about how you set them up. If we just buy a single pack from something like hobbyking, that is fine. If we do something custom, that gets a little tricky. Here\u0027s why. LiPo\u0027s have this nasty habit when rigged in parallel of trying to charge each other. In any other battery, this is fine. But LiPos are REALLY good at it. Too good. If you have one lipo with something like 90% charge and another with 80% rigged in parellel, the 90% will dump power at something ridiculous like 15-20 amps into the 80%. For some reason that has never been well explained to me, it will basically overshoot and you\u0027ll end up with the 90% being something like 82%, while the 80% is at 88%. (this is a bit of an exaggeration, but I am illustrating the point). So now the charge flows in reverse, and so on. Now this does not necessarily mean anything bad, except for the fact that it will generate a LOAD of heat. The sort of heat that results in batteries bursting into flames or otherwise damaging themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest way to fix this is to toss in a couple of heavy duty diodes so that way power can only leave but not enter. This of course means that for the charging circuit, you will have to rig up things to be just a little bit fancier. Luckily one of my friends is a very excellent electrical engineer and has designed systems like this before. Once we know what we are doing with all the systems and needs, he can design the system and we can have a board made and tested within about a month of \u0022start\u0022 for him.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T15:06:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027m aware of these things. I\u0027ve wired my own charger. It\u0027s honestly not too complicated, so long as you are aware of this property. My only concern is how expensive and/or hard to obtain are diodes that we can safely use in space. I don\u0027t know about ordinary diodes, but Zeners sound to me like they\u0027d be pretty rad-sensitive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Treldon","CreatedById":128860,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T15:33:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello guys!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like your idea and dedication, and would like to join in with whatever help I can provide\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Before someone asks, I am perfectly up to date with the mission parameters, I have read all 157 pages, not just skimming over them)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow exactly I can help I do not know yet - I have studied to be a mechatronic engineer, but due to personal and financial reasons I could not finish my studies.
