Timewarp some more, but the sun doesn\u0027t move.\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) When I go to the launchpad, I am greeted by a black screen (gui is still present) and it says I\u0027m going NaN m/s (Altitude still 104m), when I try to revert launch back to the launchpad, the game crashes entirely.\n\nThese are Kopernicus known bugs. they happen when reparenting kerbin.\n\n#2 is just an aestetic bug, doesn\u0027t hinder gameplay. #3 can be avoided by launching directly from the VAB/SPH instead of clicking on the launchpad/runway from the KSC view\n\n\u003E 4) The orbits of the smaller body in the barycenter still orbits the larger body rather than the barycenter, causing their orbit to \u0022wobble\u0022 with the larger one. The moons that I added to pluto do the same as well, orbiting pluto rather than the barycenter. I don\u0027t know if this is whats supposed to happen because of limitations with KSP or something is bugging out.\n\nthis is intended. for KSP limitations the moons need to be in orbit around the biggest body rather than in orbit around the barycenter. this is to give them a better rotation period.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 5) When I try to Hyper Edit a craft around pluto or one of its moons, even at very small or large distances the screen goes black and I have a speed of NaN m/s, or occasionally the game crashes entirely.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m using SigmaBinary 1.1.1, RSS 10.2, Kopernicus 0.4 on x64 Linux if that matters at all.\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for any suggestions or feedback you have, I hope mine is useful in some way.\n\nHyper Editing stuff around planets in binary systems is tricky.\n\nIn this specific case, Kerbin\u0027s Sphere of influence is bigger than the barycenter\u0027s.\n\nthis is intended to make \u0022normal travel\u0022 easy. but if you try to hyperedit something covered by kerbins SoI, but not by the barycenter\u0027s SoI, that may cause problems.\n\nI\u0027m not sure all those NaN problems are coming from. but this could be one of the issues.\n\ntry launching from the VAB/SPH and hyperediting stuff not to far from the planet"},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T20:21:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure all those NaN problems are coming from. but this could be one of the issues.\n\u003E try launching from the VAB/SPH and hyperediting stuff not to far from the planet\n\nHyper Edit can\u0027t really calculate SOI changes in the game, so it pretty much just puts you into a orbit around the body you specified - this crashes the game. Which is why I go Alt-F12 Infinite fuel and launch a rocket to get there without worrying about fuel. Actually, now thinking about it... HyperEdit has a few issues with RemoteTech, which is recommended for RSS.
