The \u0022straight up till 10 km, then bank 45 degrees\u0022 hype is nothing more than an easy way to get killed since the official release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Despite popular opinion, and especially in Career mode, smaller is really bigger in rocket construction. Most of the time, you will find that overbuilding a rocket \u0022just to be safe \u0022 just makes you waste enough money for funding 2 or even 3 smaller rockets that will also complete the task just fine. Heck, that\u0027s what rocket science is for -calculating Delta-v, TWR, etc. is a complicated matter, but ask this number -crunching is why our ridiculously large rockets are not ridiculously larger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2a) When building landers, smaller is bigger, but wider is much bigger. Narrow bases make a lander land not to well, and tripping on most bodies is generally the equivalent of ripping apart your ticket home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, on most bodies, at least. If you trip over at Minmus, it\u0027s no biggie, as the SAS alone is generally powerful enough to lift you right up. And for Gilly, don\u0027t even bother to pack heavy landing gear and waste Delta -v; just touch it down gently to is side and you\u0027re golden \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Do download MechJeb. Early on it\u0027s readings and predictions are going to be a humongous help, and by the time you unlock Ascent Guidance(quite late into the game, last time I checked) , orbiting a planet will be a trivial task to perform, and manual launches will only serve to bore you out of the game eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3a) As regards Landing Guidance, try not to abuse it. The first landimgs on each celestial body are going to be much more satisfying if manually done. Once you are off exploration and into body exploitation, though (space tourism, resource mining, colony assembling), yep, let MechJeb take the heavy load. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4)After the first 3 tiers into your Tech tree (which should all be bought), researching the bottom first yields better results early on. As stated in 2), you\u0027re not gonna need bigass 2.5m rockets for your early milestones, and the bottom nodes are an assortment of useful gadgets: more parachutes, a more efficient engine, electrical storage and low generation (real useful if your early game is focused on probes -see below), and the most logic investment you could make with your Science: instruments for doing more science! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Real life itself has given an almost beautiful tip for satellites: unless you plan for an atmospjeric reentry, or to land all spent stages back on Kerbin (which is generally not beginner material, especially if SSTOs are concerned), try to build your probe into your last stage, and not as a separate stage. Otherwise,any fuel into that last stage is wasted, you have to haul the weight of that extra Decoupler up to orbit, the decoupling force will throw your sat of its orbit (if it\u0027s important for the mission or something, which generally is not in Stock KSP worth so much precision), and you have an inert object orbiting Kerbin -possibly dangerously- close to your probe,for no apparent reason. They are not to important reasons, it\u0027s just not worth it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Despite everything stated in 2), always pack just some extra fuel, especially on manned missions. Whether manual or MechJeb, not a. Single use of the engines will be perfect (especially during landing and ascent), and a rocket made with Delta-V over logical amounts of redundancy may find itself having a veeeery bad time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6a) However, if not needed, any extra fuel is still useful. Generally, any fuel remaining in a stage after it has completed its purpose cannot just be ignored; just be thankful that every single engine in KSP is fully throttlable and indefinetely restartable and use up that fuel anywhere it does not hinder safety (you should use fuel in the transfer stage to perform part of a decent deceleration, but obviously not for the whole landing), or on situations where getting rid of space debris is important. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one last tip for Remote Tech users, based off 5) and 6a): if you have to leave a stage in orbit while departing for/ landing on another planet, what the heck, it might as well be a simple Comms Sat. It doesn\u0027t even need an actual probe core: all you need is set your dishes to their targets prior to detach (or via Kerbal if need be), deploy your omnis, and provide some energy until you leave its loading range, and voila!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are my seeds of wisdom for today.

MODS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your computer can handle it (mine certainly can\u0027t), mods can be extremely useful for not only cosmetic purposes, but practical ones too. If you\u0027re someone like me who has to make sure that I\u0027m not forgetting anything, my struts are present, and the craft looks even the slightest bit presentable, than mods can be your friend. Mechjeb for example is an incredible mod which basically makes everything easier. If you don\u0027t know what it is, look it up. But even when I have an on board computer to calculate my trajectories, preform my orbital insertions, and make me tea, it can still be kind of difficult to go to other planets. I\u0027ve landed on duna before, which was absolute torture by the way, and I think I even did it without Mechjeb. So even if you\u0027re the most utterly inept person when it comes to rocket science, mods aren\u0027t always necessary. If you\u0027re a total beginner though, Mechjeb is very good at doing the hard stuff for you and will allow to to more easily learn about the game without doing a bunch of studying before hand.

SPACEPLANES\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceplanes are much easier to build and fly with the new 1.0 aerodynamics. For me, there are 3 crucial things to worry about when building a spaceplane: 1. Your plane needs to be aerodynamic. It needs to be able to cut through the air like a hot knife through butter. 2. You need fuel. This one isn\u0027t as important as the others because jet engines are so damn efficient. 3.

Please excuse my vulgar language but rovers are a pain in the ass to build, test, and fly to other planets. You need some serious patience to transport these things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. DOCKING\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking sucks. It can be stressful as hell and anger the Almighty Space Kraken. If you\u0027re building a space station, you need a ton of of RCS and mono propellant.

It\u0027s relaxing in some ways and can put me in a good mood if I successfully land on another planet or something. KSP is the ultimate space sandbox and I truly love it to death. If you haven\u0027t bought it yet for whatever reason and are interested in space and orbital mechanics and flight, this is a perfect fit. If you want it, don\u0027t pirate it. Just buy it. It\u0027s worth it, trust me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helped any beginners out there and made it easier to understand the game.

Especially with Mechjeb:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 way RCS thrusters and a lot of them. But you need to make sure they cover ALL axes (that is the correct plural of axis). For example I spend an hour designing and redesigning a mk2 chassis shuttle to dock with my space station so the 5 kerbals would have a ride home anytime they needed. After all that time of getting it to space in a non-exploded state, I was having trouble docking because I put my thrusters on either side (1 front and 1 back x 2). I could go up and down and front and back, but I had no side to side. And when your docking port is near the nose of your craft, and you find yourself 2 meters to the right of where you need to be, not having side thrust makes it rather hard because you have to turn (which throws and off center docking port out of whack), move forward, and then turn back and hope it was not too much or too little. Even Mechjeb was having a hard time docking, and sometimes it just gave up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can always just put a single port RCS thruster to cover the one axis you\u0027re missing.
