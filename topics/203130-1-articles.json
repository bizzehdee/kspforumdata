You might be able to get away with 3 digit numbers for some of the globular clusters, but for something that will just feel like a spiral galaxy at scale you have to be operating on 5-6 digit numbers at least. In contrast to the nine digit number of stars in our own galaxy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, naturally, if you were to go that route, you wouldn\u0027t be expected to visit even a meaningful fraction of the worlds, which means you can get away with considerable repetition, but at least everything a typical player visits needs to feel fresh. So even if that\u0027s just a dozen or so systems\u00A0 on average, to account for birthday paradox, you probably need something on the order of 100 hand-crafted systems which you can then vary a bit with procedural work so that everything feels sufficiently unique.

No Man\u0027s Sky ended up ok. Eventually. But it was no small effort and was designed to be procedural from the ground up. Plus, the creators were fine\u00A0with it being very sci-fi, so some of it looking... unnatural was par for the course. KSP is a bit more grounded than that, which means that generating believable and yet diverse worlds would be even harder.

It is possible to train the network so that instead of topographical guide, it would use output of a noise-based generator and spit out a complete elevation map that has erosion features, valleys, etc. It\u0027s a bit of work, but most of the heavy lifting has already been done in research and it\u0027s just a matter of getting enough training data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get the feeling that this would become very memory intensive if all the terrain needs to remain as is after has been generated. I assume this because I have the impression that unlike procedural systems working off a seed, DNN AI can generate inconsistent results where the next time the same region is rendered if it weren\u0027t saved or stored in memory there may be slight differences in the generation. Is this a fair assumption or is it the case that after DNN AI training is paused\u00A0 they perform perfectly deterministically?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-20T11:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223991964\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203130\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221624184942\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180102\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mcwaffles2003\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n38 minutes ago, mcwaffles2003 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor is it the case that after DNN AI training is paused\u00A0 they perform perfectly deterministically?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat. There are different kinds of neural nets, of course, but as far as pretty much anything related to Deep Learning goes, you have two distinct processes. You train the network first, which is slow and not necessarily deterministic. Once you are done with training, you use the network for evaluation. At that point, the weights are fixed and the process is fully deterministic. Generally, once you released a version of your product or feature, it will only be running in evaluation mode with all of the weights you generated during training supplied. That way, the neural net will produce the same output for all the users consistently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, as long as you use the same seed to generate the input, it should always produce the same output.
