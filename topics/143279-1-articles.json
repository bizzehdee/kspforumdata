How would you explain that besides \u0022We\u0027re on a really big sphere\u0022? I also saw only the tops of clouds over the horizon very clearly out an airplane window at 9 km altitude only two days ago. It\u0027s pretty clear and easy to test. Also, sextants work. And explaining the loop-shaped orbits of the planets, where the loops are 1 AU wide, the distance from Earth to the Sun, would be extremely hard, since the loops are exactly what you would expect to see if Earth was revolving around the sun with them. You can test these theories of motion with equipment that isn\u0027t out of reach. Plot the motion of the planets and their moons for a year, and you can discover the Copernican model, plus the speed of light. Do the same with the stars and you\u0027ll find that they have varied distances, meaning they aren\u0027t painted on a black dome but are part of an immense sea. You can look at the nearby galaxies, see their shapes, and connect them to the band of light in the sky and realize you are inside something like that. You can even find planets light-years away with a home telescope! Not even the strange world of quantum mechanics is out of reach of testing by commonfolk; Point a laser at two close slits in a piece of aluminum foil and observe the particle-wave duality of light. There are people on Antarctica; they would know if it was just an ice wall. Likewise, there are people who work in particle accelerators and space stations and other places, and they know what\u0027s up. And it\u0027s not hundreds like you say. It\u0027s the other way \u0027round. Millions of people from many different international organizations, not all government funded, need to see the same data and work with it as part of their jobs. If something was amiss, someone in those millions would say something. They are scientists, their purpose is to educate the general public. If they find out a theory was wrong, even if it\u0027s their own, they\u0027ll revise it until they find the right one, and they\u0027ll tell us about it so we can learn more about our world, our universe, and our life.

How would you explain that besides \u0022We\u0027re on a really big sphere\u0022? I also saw only the tops of clouds over the horizon very clearly out an airplane window at 9 km altitude only two days ago. It\u0027s pretty clear and easy to test. Also, sextants work. And explaining the loop-shaped orbits of the planets, where the loops are 1 AU wide, the distance from Earth to the Sun, would be extremely hard, since the loops are exactly what you would expect to see if Earth was revolving around the sun with them. You can test these theories of motion with equipment that isn\u0027t out of reach. Plot the motion of the planets and their moons for a year, and you can discover the Copernican model, plus the speed of light. Do the same with the stars and you\u0027ll find that they have varied distances, meaning they aren\u0027t painted on a black dome but are part of an immense sea. You can look at the nearby galaxies, see their shapes, and connect them to the band of light in the sky and realize you are inside something like that. You can even find planets light-years away with a home telescope! Not even the strange world of quantum mechanics is out of reach of testing by commonfolk; Point a laser at two close slits in a piece of aluminum foil and observe the particle-wave duality of light. There are people on Antarctica; they would know if it was just an ice wall. Likewise, there are people who work in particle accelerators and space stations and other places, and they know what\u0027s up. And it\u0027s not hundreds like you say. It\u0027s the other way \u0027round. Millions of people from many different international organizations, not all government funded, need to see the same data and work with it as part of their jobs. If something was amiss, someone in those millions would say something. They are scientists, their purpose is to educate the general public. If they find out a theory was wrong, even if it\u0027s their own, they\u0027ll revise it until they find the right one, and they\u0027ll tell us about it so we can learn more about our world, our universe, and our life.
