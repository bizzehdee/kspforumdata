KSP/Unity don\u0027t respect the colliders well when loading, resulting in an immediate jam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule number two: both too wide and too narrow clearance results in power loss. Too narrow means the collider mesh of the shaft pushes the wheels too much up their suspension struts, resulting in power loss. Too wide and the shaft starts too tumble, again pushing the wheels too much up their struts but now with a larger force due to an imbalace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule number three: After first attaching and rotating/offset the landing gears to have the proper clearance with the shaft, launch craft, return to editor and adjust the wheels again. Due to a bug, the first time the location/orientation is not respected by KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule number four: Four wheels per bearing is not enough for reliable operation! A shaft of 1.25m requires a minimum of six and a max of 8 wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, user Kuzzter had the following remarks when he looked at my PO2R:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Symmetry on symmetry. Azimech put two (symmetrical) gear bays on each of four posts with mirror symmetry, then put the four posts around the shaft with radial symmetry. This way one can adjust clearance by moving the four (or six, or eight) posts, and keep clearance constant all the way around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Gear bays for thrust bearings, too. There are two wheels at each end of the shaft to keep it from moving axially. I might try this with the wheels impinging on a cone rather than the flat end of the shaft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Use a separator to detach the rotor shaft from the rest of the craft. The craft must start out as one piece, then in operation the rotor and stator have to be two separate pieces. I tried using clampos first, but I suspect the magnetics were interfering with rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. SPH clearances can be (visually) deceiving. When i looked at the shaft in SPH it appeared there was lots of daylight between the gear wheels and the shaft. In operation, every wheel seemed to be in contact with the shaft all the way around. Good thing this design and SPH \u0027gizmos\u0027 make it easy to tweak clearance (see #1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T12:08:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 12:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Azimech\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T14:16:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlaying with the yet-to-be-released Corsair.
