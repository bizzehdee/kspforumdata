MechJeb says it has an atmospheric Dv of 11000m/s, and 12000m/s in vacuum. All stages have TWR more than 1 on Eve. Will it make it from sea level?

Merely using structural parts as legs would only work if you can control your speed to a very low number at touchdown. You could tweak your design with more chutes and more space between the mainsail and the ground, but IMOH you are better off using a mod here. There are a few mods which add what you want (MRS, Karbonite, NFT comes to mind) but the MRS leg is probably the best in the offering and it has 6000\u002B rating for suspension.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T13:21:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongrats on your great endeavour!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill you make it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E250-1 odd are \u0022no\u0022, at least with your first design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo yourself a favor, set up a sandbox with hyperedit, and test,test,Test your designs on eve before you actually *fly* there in a real mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve is a very evil place to rocketeers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding gear:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally i like the design of Long structural angled down, with short structural 90degrees to it, curved in.

After that the suspension just gets crushed under the weight and allows the mamooth and rhino engines to survive the first hit.
