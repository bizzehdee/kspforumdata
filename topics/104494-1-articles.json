Building upgrades could then be split into smaller pieces, and allow you to upgrade buildings in smaller chunks. (\u0022I don\u0027t really need more than 255 parts in my VAB, but action groups would be nice\u0022, for instance.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully 1.0 makes building upgrades easier to mod (I hear it\u0027s not really exposed to modders at all currently.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t repeat the entire post here for brevity\u0027s sake, since I think the design there is pretty elaborate already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience Research Time\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd a time component to science -- so unlocking a node in the science tree starts a timer before that science is fully developed. I kind of like the idea of still having to design with older tech while the new stuff is in the \u0022Scientists discover X, expect market applications in 3-5 years\u0022 stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch for a node dependent on other nodes could be queued, but the timer wouldn\u0027t start until those nodes are completed. Nodes that are all at the same level/not dependant on anything could be researched in parallel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe part-testing contracts could favor parts in the \u0027in progress\u0027 parts of the tree, and reduce the amount of time remaining upon completion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be particularly useful with mods like Kerbal Construction Time and the various mods that make you lose rep for doing nothing -- you might need to launch some probes with old tech while waiting for new tech to finish. NASA can\u0027t exactly sit around waiting for the newest thruster technology to make it out of a lab, after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime delays might be omitted for the first couple nodes in the tree, and possible Strategies can alter the time delay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFuturistic mass-altering drive (Mass Effect-style)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an idea I posted long ago (before a long break from KSP). The idea is a end-of-tech-tree device that, while powered and active, reduces the mass of every part of the ship by some fraction. (in Mass Effect, there\u0027s a material whose mass is dependant on the strength \u0026amp; polarity of electrical charge it\u0027s receiving).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is a technology late in the tech tree that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Has a fairly substantial weight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Drains ElectricCharge extremely quickly while active\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Reduces the ship\u0027s mass by a percentage. Possibly this reduction could exclude the device itself (and others sharing the same PartModule), with a maximum of removing a certain amount of mass. (The device could have \u0022max effectiveness %\u0022 and \u0022max mass reduction\u0022 attributes.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T05:15:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dewin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dewin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpgrade tree for buildings in Career mode\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience Research Time\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Can\u0027t really be done in 0.90, but if it is more accessible post 1.0 I wouldn\u0027t expect to wait long before someone does this (packaged upgrades are stupid, the faster they become granular the better)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I think Kerbal Construction Time may already include this, and it\u0027s configurable enough you should be able to remove most of it\u0027s other functionality\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T05:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, #1 would require stuff not be hardcoded \u0026gt;.\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T08:28:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScience Research Time - you mention \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92377\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Construction Time\u003C/a\u003E, which has this built-in.
