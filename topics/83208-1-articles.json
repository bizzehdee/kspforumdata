The first is that there would be a noticeable delay when picking up any part that hadn\u0027t already been picked up. Even if we assume that only 20% of the parts are used, during construction you would have to wait in total 20% of the time from the loading screen. That is also assuming the load speed would be the same even when a large 1000 part ship was being constructed which seems unlikely but then I don\u0027t know the exact coding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second problem is that each part (stock and modded) would now need a separate 2D image and wouldn\u0027t rotate unless is was given it\u0027s own video of it\u0027s rotation or was loaded in to rotate. This would take up extra space which depended on the screenshot size. It could be only 5% extra space or it could be 50% depending on many things but boiling down to the required screenshot size and loaded size of the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do understand the frustration with this loading time, I\u0027m trying to make parts and the loading time just to test one part even with stock (plus part) is very annoying. One this that could be saved for loading later could be internals. they tend to take a small proportion of the load but are not needed until the ship is actually in flight. I would still suggest loading them when a capsule is selected as this is a rare occurrence and not often do people use many types of capsule on one craft (I\u0027ve never used more than 3).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T16:44:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-0-24-Release-3-3-1-Active-Texture-Management-Save-RAM-without-reduction-packs!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EActive Texture Management\u003C/a\u003E?
