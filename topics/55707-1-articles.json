I don\u0027t know about mars one. I mean, funding a mars colony (Which will be a one way trip) on a reality show based around said colony, with the fact that they are advertising for just normal people over the internet to become the colonists? I mean sure, if it was funded by NASA, and they were just sending some outposts, and creating a lander and launchers tailored to the mission, and sending real astronauts and scientists then it would seem fine. But what mars one is proposing? A one-way trip to a hell-hole of a planet with constant dust storms, raging winds, a tenuous at best (not to mention toxic as hell) atmosphere, where you are going to live out the rest of your life in an inflatable tube, constantly depending on support from earth to develop to the point of sustainability, which would surely take many years, and no chance of returning or ever talking to a family member in real time, face to face, again? Mars One is going to fall flat on its face faster than a legless donkey doing the high jump.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T10:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClosest thing I could find in google images to that awesome sounding donkey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://rookery.s3.amazonaws.com/778500/778547_7789_625x1000.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022778547_7789_625x1000.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease someone make a nice picture of a legless donkey doing the high jump.
