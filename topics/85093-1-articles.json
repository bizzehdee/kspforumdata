My thought was to do Duna Apollo-style. You know, lander, command module, etc. Didn\u0027t bother giving the lander a separate ascent stage, though. One thing I missed documenting was the landing itself - My knuckles were too white and jaw too open to hit F1 it seems. It was remarkable - heading in almost horizontally and having 16 parachutes open into a giant cloud was pretty cool.
