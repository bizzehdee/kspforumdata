Control surfaces mounted at the front and/or back of the plane will also help with rotating the nose, but don\u0027t overdo it because that can make the plane unstable.

That makes more cool looking planes but, the trade off would be that it\u0027s easier to get a tail strike, so the higher the gear the better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T08:47:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you can arrange to make the front landing gear taller so that the plane sits nose-high on the runway\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes that helps.
