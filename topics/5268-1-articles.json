But couldn\\\u0027t you just make a ram-scoop(powered by your new electricity) and use that as a justification for creating fuel? (ram-scoop= coil that creates an immense electromagnetic field and pulls in free-floating ions in space, to be used for fuel or fusion) \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CAPFlyer","CreatedById":8575,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-01T23:03:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Awaras\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Awaras\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn \\\u0027ion engine\\\u0027 that needs only solar power to work is basically an infinite fuel cheat part that would take away any challenge from the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot so. Once you get too far from light, the amount of power generated wouldn\\\u0027t be enough to continue powering the engine. Additionally, as your output thrust is very low for the amount of energy required, it will take a lot of very careful planning to ensure proper light gathering at both ends of your trip to provide enough power as your internal batteries will most likely not provide enough on their own and require at least some level of recharge to complete your acceleration and deceleration maneuvers. In fact, with Deep Space 1 and other Ion Drive powered probes in the real world, the issue has been less fuel and more battery capacity. As the launch vehicle constrains the size of the probe, it also restricts the size of the solar panels. To maximize the scientific payload, some loss in solar panel size was required to still make the launch and initial orbital velocity constraints, meaning that in all actuality, any true deep space probe (along the lines of the Voyager series) would run out of useful sunlight well before running out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
