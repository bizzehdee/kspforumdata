It was a most excellent day. Got some one on one time with not only a NASA engineer who worked on the shuttle (and Hubble), but also two astronauts who flew on Discovery and Atlantis! Think I spent three hours with Atlantis between Martin (the engineer guy. Didn\u0027t get his last name) and Don Thomas. Ran into Mike Mulland at the Saturn V center and got to have a chat with him before he went off to do book signings. This was also the first time I had ever actually met anybody who actually went to space. So that was pretty sick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing I did after the park opened was to go see Atlantis again, and I was right in doing so. Martin basically gave me a mini tour (There weren\u0027t many people in the center just yet) and he pretty much converted me into a Hubble fanboy lol. Having him show me the mock-up they have and what everything did and what not was amazing. And then later on I saw the Hubble IMAX movie they have, that covered STS-31 and STS-61 as well as what all Hubble has been able to discover, and it was mind blowing. The way they set up the theatre made it as if you were sitting there in space with the astronauts as they dealt with Hubble. The scale was amazing and in most of the shots it was like I was looking at the mock-up, except better! It was just unreal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, on a less awesome note, I also got to witness the Columbia/Challenger memorial, and let me tell you that was not the most pleasant thing ever coming into it without knowing what all was in there. When I first went in I had just thought it was just a memorial for the astronauts with some of their personal effects. But off in a corner down the hall way (they don\u0027t even make an attempt to make you notice it. Like, the small hallway between the main one and this room wasn\u0027t even lit) were two pieces of debris from Columbia and Challenger. And when I turned that corner I literally gasped and teared up a little. I mean, I had just spent hours with Atlantis and yeah. Seeing those pieces was not pleasant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut beyond that, it was an awesome day. I\u0027m working on uploading the pictures I took so that\u0027ll be a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T00:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/toqzJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
