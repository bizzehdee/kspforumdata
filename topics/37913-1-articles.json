I picked up KSP during the Steam summer sale, and I have to say, I\u0027ve sunken a lot of time into the game so far. I look forward to being an active part of this community! Quick question--what\u0027s a generally good way to offset rocket topheavy-ness? While trying to launch the second part of my space station, my rocket keels over while initiating it\u0027s gravity turn. I do in fact use MechJeb, because I\u0027m god-awful at flying rockets without it. What\u0027s a good method to solve my problem? Should I add more struts to the bottom?

MOAR STRUTS! Lastly... Bigger rocket with more struts. Struts will be you best freind along with booster rockets. Hope this helps!

And the gimball-locking method is interesting as well. In any case, my space station is now functional, thanks to some more struts, even if it is more accurately just a bunch of rockets docked together in the middle. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
