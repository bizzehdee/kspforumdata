In other words, instead of just heading and altitude, I can add speed. I\u0027m guessing that the source file will show something like maintain heading X and so on so if I define speed and add it as an option it will maintain the given speed by controlling the throttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother example is in BD armory, say the AIM-9 sidewinder. If you\u0027ve ever used this mode you probably know that the missiles just suck and few flares/chaffs with some random turn will manage to avoid the missile - disgusting\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Is it possible to edit the algorithms or whatever it is that guides the missile and make it better?
