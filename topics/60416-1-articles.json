Probably. I don\u0027t want to say yes, since I\u0027m not familiar with the actual coding that would be required. It wouldn\u0027t be as simple as you think, though. Subassemblies show a single connection point because that is their root node; crafts and assemblies are constructed, stored, and saved in a layout that ends up a bit like a tree. One part begins the tree, being the \u0022root\u0022, and then you add trunk and branch parts to infinity. What you ask would require the game to rearrange the layout entirely and re-draw the entire tree structure so as to have a different root node without changing the parts\u0027 individual positions in the 3-D space. I honestly have no idea how complex that calculation would be, but I know that it\u0027s not one I can do myself, with or without a calculator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T18:35:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt may already get frustrating if single part you are trying to attach to your ship wants to stick differently than you want it to stick - either it snaps to a different attach point, or it sticks radially to something.
