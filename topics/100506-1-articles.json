Currently, if you need to plot a course you create a node, then zoom out as you increase the burn so you can see where your course ends up (to see if you\u0027ve got an encounter). Sometimes you accidentally click somewhere and close the node, and then you have to zoom back into Kerbin and reopen the node, then zoom back out to continue plotting your course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If this isn\u0027t already a feature, I would like to suggest adding a hot key for opening the current maneuver node and/or cycling through them (with them open). This would make plotting courses in KSP a lot easier. As far as I\u0027m aware there isn\u0027t currently a hot key that allows one to easily open the maneuver node when you\u0027re on the map screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T23:36:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome idea! The zooming in an out is really obnoxious. Your observation is true when planning a maneuver node for a known transfer window and if you\u0027re experimenting with a maneuver node to look for novel transfers. A hot key sounds like the right solution to the problem of accidentally closing the nodes (which is easy to do).
