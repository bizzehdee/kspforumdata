Generally speaking, first stage engines are not capable of starting themselves and rely on ground systems to do so: they have ground-supplied pressurants to pressurize fuel and oxidizer tanks, and some also require ground systems to begin spinning turbo pumps. This is not universally true but it\u0027s very common. Others still require ground-supplied fuel and oxidizer tank pressure but spin up turbo pumps with helium, which is a limited resource. Still others, such as SpaceX Merlin engines, use a number of \u0022charges\u0022 of a set of hypergolic compounds called TEA-TEB (Google it) to start (they\u0027re responsible for the characteristic green/yellow flash on Falcon engine start; check YouTube for videos).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir-starting an engine in flight is another problematic issue; LH2/LOX engines can use spark igniters but you still have to be able to spin up turbopumps and/or pressurize the flowing propellants. Here is how the J-2 engine did it. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketdyne_J-2#Start_sequence\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketdyne_J-2#Start_sequence\u003C/a\u003E Note the time limit between starts; wait longer than about 6 hours and you couldn\u0027t restart it again even if you have the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor kerosene/LOX or other fuels, air starting has its own issues. Kerosene can\u0027t get TOO cold or it starts to gel and won\u0027t flow properly. It also subjects engine parts to fouling and sooting from combustion products. Again, you need a way to get the turbopumps spinning good and fast. Unlike LH2 which will warm and expand into gas very easily, thus starting to flow naturally, kerosene is a liquid and has to be pumped. The best way to get the pumps spinning quickly, and thus fuel flowing quickly at flight pressure into the combustion chamber, is hypergolic start cartridges.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zander","CreatedById":76100,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T16:04:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for whether in RL there\u0027s a certain number an engine can restart, TBH i don\u0027t know, but i\u0027ve seen some reference saying some engine has ... as its ignition system and is capable of 5 restarts...\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps wear and tear is a good point, i.e. the ignitor may randomly break especially after many ignitions.
