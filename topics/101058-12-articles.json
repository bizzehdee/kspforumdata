I have dabbled in exporting parts into KSP before, but never released anything. I\u0027ve learned a lot about Blender and Unity while making these, but am still struggling with some of it. Here is what I\u0027ve done so far:\n\n![2lwr8n9.jpg](http://i61.tinypic.com/2lwr8n9.jpg)\n\nIn the middle, you can see a ring to serve as walls for a base, or as the center of constructions like this. I thought that rather than having a single-direction base, a double-direction base and a wall-less base, it might be better to have just the bare base, and a wall section which could be added to the top, the bottom, or both. Also gives more options for wall height (by adjusting its position in the editor).\n\nOn the left is a reworked dome. I\u0027ve reduced the number of layers in it. It has the same dimensions, but increased visibility, and the filesize is 1/4 what it was.\n\nThe dome also has no hull attached to the top, but there\u0027s a flat window there which you can use to attach stuff to the top, as before, or use as a skylight:\n\n![2zyann9.jpg](http://i57.tinypic.com/2zyann9.jpg)\n\nRoald likes the view.\n\nI\u0027ve rejigged the small hydroponics module, making it slightly narrower, and packing a lot more vegetation in. (New one is on the left, here)\n\n![2qc1ath.jpg](http://i60.tinypic.com/2qc1ath.jpg)\n\nI need to work out how to add lights in Unity, but aside from that, it seems done. (New one is on the right)\n\n![2m4ozzn.jpg](http://i62.tinypic.com/2m4ozzn.jpg)\n\nHere is an original medium-sized hydroponics module on top of a newer one. Still WIP.\n\n![34rakbr.jpg](http://i58.tinypic.com/34rakbr.jpg)\n\nI\u0027ve tried to replace the frame in the old model with an icosphere with a frame texture. I\u0027m sure it could work well, if I can find the right way to do it. Filesize is less than 1/3 what it was.\n\nHere is the large garden biosphere:\n\n![1zdc750.jpg](http://i61.tinypic.com/1zdc750.jpg)\n\nI\u0027ve added some more detail to it, including hatches for kerbals to go in and explore nature (no plans for an IVA, though. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)), as well as a ladder running down each side of the main shaft. I\u0027ve greatly increased the leafiness of the trees, and still reduced the poly count enough to get the filesize down to just over 1/3 what it was.\n\nFinally, the size 3 housing unit:\n\n![md1va0.jpg](http://i58.tinypic.com/md1va0.jpg)\n\nI\u0027ve brought the end connections in and added textures where they were absent.
