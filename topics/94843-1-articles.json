More bang for your money. Not that hard to do now days.

My first rig I got 6 years out of it with upgrades (playing at max settings) before games eventually outstripped it\u0027s capability. This time I spent a bit more on my Mobo so I could upgrade the CPU and RAM when I could afford it. Also check out hardware performance comparisons.
