It depends on the rover, if they work well like ours I think you could maintain 17m/s or a bit more nearly all the time.

If you are coasting towards a 0-meter intercept with a separately orbiting vehicle, you are in a different orbit than it is and you must have a relative velocity when you are closest to it. Either they would plan to have the MAV motors burnout right next to Hermes at 0m/s, or they would allow for a rendezvous burn to match velocities at closest approach after a coasting period. Since they planned for a 40-minute coast, they would have to plan for a rendezvous burn. It could be small, if it approached at 10m/s for those 2400 seconds that would mean burnout was around 24 km away from Hermes, but it would have to exist. In the book they seemed to expect no speed-matching burn would be necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It seems the MAV launched from about 4.3 degrees South of the Martian Equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Certainly the flyby was at less than 1000km altitude above Mars, probably much less. This would translate to less than 100km above Duna. In the interest of making the ascent reasonably simple I would push for there being two stages to the MAV, with a coasting period between the two firings. The first gets it up into a fairly circular orbit, and the 2nd, after a few minutes of coasting, pushes it to Hermes\u0027 velocity and within 100km or so of Hermes. Then we coast to a low-speed intercept where Hermes can use manuevering motors for velocity matching. A spacewalk then gets Watley from the DAV to Hermes.

We were not planning to do the \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ETaiyang\u003C/span\u003E Sheng part so you won\u0027t find the ship in the files. This play through was meant to be quite a bit shorter than the book (to cover the most attention spans) and starts with a rover journey of approximately 4-6 hours, so we planned to have the Hermes about 6 hours away from the Duna flyby. I know on the Reddit challenge they are doing the whole thing, and you are welcome to use our craft to complete that challenge if you want. I am not going to enter myself so there would be no overlap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the symmetry of the orbits and would like to see someone do this, I doubt many people in the Reddit challenge will get as far as this and will just put Hermes in orbit and fly up to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of Hermes, I stole some of Azimechs and RedshiftOFT\u0027s bearing tech and built this, it\u0027s 160 parts before you add any engines and is just a starter centrifugal gravity ring for space ships and stations, craft file coming in a sec. It is stiff enough that you can manoeuvre gently with the ring turning (though I wouldn\u0027t) I\u0027m thinking of looking into an ingame tweakable that would reset docking ports so they could redock. Then you could do manoeuvres and start up the ring for the cruise phase.
