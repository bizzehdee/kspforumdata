It depends on the rover, if they work well like ours I think you could maintain 17m/s or a bit more nearly all the time. If you do get to any steep places then you are probably going to have to go manual. If you go flat out everywhere you are going to roll eventually.

We were not planning to do the Taiyang Sheng part so you won\u0027t find the ship in the files. This play through was meant to be quite a bit shorter than the book (to cover the most attention spans) and starts with a rover journey of approximately 4-6 hours, so we planned to have the Hermes about 6 hours away from the Duna flyby. I know on the Reddit challenge they are doing the whole thing, and you are welcome to use our craft to complete that challenge if you want. I am not going to enter myself so there would be no overlap.\n\nI love the symmetry of the orbits and would like to see someone do this, I doubt many people in the Reddit challenge will get as far as this and will just put Hermes in orbit and fly up to it.\n\nSpeaking of Hermes, I stole some of Azimechs and RedshiftOFT\u0027s bearing tech and built this, it\u0027s 160 parts before you add any engines and is just a starter centrifugal gravity ring for space ships and stations, craft file coming in a sec. It is stiff enough that you can manoeuvre gently with the ring turning (though I wouldn\u0027t) I\u0027m thinking of looking into an ingame tweakable that would reset docking ports so they could redock. Then you could do manoeuvres and start up the ring for the cruise phase. You may want the persistent rotation mod too. \n\n![EvenNiceKusimanse.gif](http://giant.gfycat.com/EvenNiceKusimanse.gif)\n\nUp in the top corner you might possibly be able to make out I am getting about 47 to 50fps\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-15T02:10:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2015 02:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by selfish\\_meme**"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T05:26:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, I\u0027ve finished the book.

They sort of suggest that it aerobraked into orbit, but at that speed it would take going deep enough into the atmosphere to brake at 6 G\u0027s to slow into orbit. I just can\u0027t picture the Hermes surviving that sort of force. It also makes it tough to simulate that part of the voyage. I\u0027ve gotta think about it more.\n\nHi PLAD also the Rich Purnell presentation in the film was so....whats the word I want, oh yeah crap.
