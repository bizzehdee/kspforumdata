MechJeb\u0027s is acting all sorts of weird. Sometimes it works fine, others it puts me on a 10 degree inclination for no reason, even turns on the SAS and holds it there when I am pointing 40 degrees off target. Another odd thing, with the end turn altitude in the ascent control, the input box is screwed up. I cannot click at the end of the numbers and backspace them out, I have to delete from the left side of them, and if I type \u0022150\u0022 it comes out \u0022051\u0022 so I have to input the numbers backwards. **edit** well that last issue fixed itself.
