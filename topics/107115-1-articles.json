Why was this moved to the Spacecraft Exchange???** There is no craft presented here.\n\nSo since I was a big fan of the \u0022nuke\u0022 in 0.90 and used it basically for all my interplanetary ships, I was a bit miffed about the heat issues it now has. So I made a test rig:\n\n![LBJxvcy.png](http://i.imgur.com/LBJxvcy.png)\n\nIt appears the best solution is using an FL-T100 small tank, put a boatload of wings on it (24 \u0022Type D\u0022 structural wings in my case) and then attach that contraption to the rest of the ship.\n\nThe worst setup? Putting a nuke on a girder. Solar Panels on an FL-T100 also didn\u0027t really help a lot.\n\nThe end result: a 8 nuke cluster firing at full throttle for more than 22 minutes. The temperature curve flattens after about 1990 Kelvin and the heat buildup after that becomes negligable. 10 minutes after shutdown the heat was back to normal levels. Interplanetary missions, here I come!\n\n![bu0gDqC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bu0gDqC.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T17:48:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ShadowZone**"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T09:04:42Z","Content":"You don\u0027t need als those parts after 1.0.2.

When I put a nuke on an FL-T100 without the wings, the tank explodes after 3 minutes of thrust and the nuke reaches \u003E2000K in that period of time as well.

So, instead of one big tank with the engines bolted on with octo struts, couplers or radially with whatever, it is best to make your craft so that engines have a decent sized tank each like on the right in the pic."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:30:10Z","Content":"That\u0027s an ingenious solution though...

Heating creates two weak links, one is the nuke, which can withstand 2500k and rarely overheats, and the part a nuke is connected too. And a FL-T100 has an extremly low thermal mass and therfor overheats in no time. You can see those infos when you activate the heat context info in the thermal debug menu. Even a FLT-800 would work around a million times better.\n\nOne actual mistake in your build are the upper tanks, though: They are somehow isolated and don\u0027t get to spread any heat, so there isn\u0027t any reason to put wings on them..\n\nLook at this: \n\n[http://i.imgur.com/0fHL0Hw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0fHL0Hw.jpg)\n\nThis ship could, with full tanks, managed 2000\u002B dv in a single burn in 1.0, were heat was a lot more dangerous. Only loss was the command core, but that was my own fault since that\u0027s the one part where you don\u0027t want to spread heat too.\n\nThe single engines are all connected to a big tank, which would heat up slowly and reasonably radiate heat away. Furthermore, that tank doesn\u0027t just have to cope with the heat alone, since the conductivity distributes heat over the whole craft and every single part radiates heat. While I didn\u0027t test it in 1.0.2 (was an early ship to test heat), I would bet that ship won\u0027t overheat at all.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T10:40:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 10:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:51:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Don\u0027t put nukes on a FL-T100.
