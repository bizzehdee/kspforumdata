Putting a nuke on a girder. Solar Panels on an FL-T100 also didn\u0027t really help a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end result: a 8 nuke cluster firing at full throttle for more than 22 minutes. The temperature curve flattens after about 1990 Kelvin and the heat buildup after that becomes negligable. 10 minutes after shutdown the heat was back to normal levels.
