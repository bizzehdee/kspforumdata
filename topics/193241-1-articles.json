The mod allows you to change the units of speed and/or measurement displayed, for example, km/h, mph, feet, etc. Is this possible to do? Also, I\u0027ve had very little (in fact, none at all) experience with modding and I thought this mod would be a simple one to start with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-19T15:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is possible - two examples are \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/169611-18-speed-unit-annex-%E2%80%94-enhanced-navball-panel-contextually-2019-10-18/\u0026amp;ct=1587309652\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ESpeed Unit Annex\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/68202-13x-16x-speed-unit-changer-more-units-for-your-speed-ap-pe-on-your-navball/\u0026amp;ct=1587309675\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ESpeed Unit Changer\u003C/a\u003E.
