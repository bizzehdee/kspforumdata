Feel free to comment, to agree or disagree with me - this is a truly interesting topic for debate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine that you place a magnet between two glass panes. You then get another magnet and use it to manipulate the magnet you placed between the panes - you move the outer magnet around on the surface of one of the glass panes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven though the magnets don\u0027t touch eachother, they attract eachother. Their attraction is 3-dimensional but as both can only move in 2 dimensions, only the planar components of the magnetic forces can be observed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow imagine that the plane between the glass panes is Flatland. Several scientists suddenly observe that the magnet is seemingly attracted by a random point of the plane, but can\u0027t find the source of the force that is moving the object. They think that it\u0027s dark matter - something that can\u0027t be observed but still enacts forces upon \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022normal\u0022 matter.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds familiar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdd one dimension and you have the explanation for dark matter. Space (space, not spacetime) is 4-dimensional but matter can only move in 3 dimensions. Gravity is one of the few forces that breaks through the dimensional barrier, e.g. spreads through all four dimensions. Dark matter is simply matter located on another \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022layer\u0022 of space, e.g. displaced in the 4th dimension. We can\u0027t see or feel it but we notice its gravity. It\u0027s not \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022dark\u0022 by any means, just normal matter located on another layer of space or dimensional plane or brane or however you would call it.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow let\u0027s move away from \u0022dark\u0022 matter and take a closer look at the 4th dimension itself, which consists of 3-dimensional \u0022layers\u0022 or \u0022planes\u0022 of space. They are separated from eachother by physical barriers that disallow movement in the 4th dimension - our glass panes. Only few forces can act through these barriers - maybe it\u0027s only gravity, maybe others too. The thickness of the \u0022layers\u0022 is infinitely small (maybe Planck length?), resulting in complete immobility and the impossibility of the creation of 4-dimensional particles or objects. The layers are as such physically discrete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe neighboring \u0022layers\u0022 are essentially what we would call parallel universes. Same physical laws but different location and distribution of matter. \u003Cspan\u003EThings like the invisible Great Attractor are just galaxy superclusters located in neighboring spatial layers.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that 4 is not the maximum number of the dimensions of space - in my opinion, there is an infinite number of dimensions actually. \u003Cspan\u003EThe 4-dimensional layers, the 5-dimensional hyperlayers and n-dimensional n-layers of space form complex structures incomprehensible to our minds. I don\u0027t know whether the layers are \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022straight\u0022 or whether they have irregular forms. If our universe has a positive curvature, the \u0022layers\u0022 are different layers of a hypersphere, meaning that different layers differ in sizes and that the volume of parallel universes gets smaller and smaller as you travel towards the center of the hypersphere.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mentioned travel. Whether travel between parallel universes is possible or not depends on the structure of the barriers - if they are physical by means of consisting of matter, they might have infinite density or not, resulting in the viability of breakage or perforation and the creation of portals to parallel universes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, these barriers are most likely non-material just as the barrier that separates flatlanders living on two different sheets of paper from visiting eachother. These barriers don\u0027t consist of matter or space but of the absence of space - just like the absent 2-dimensional space that chains flatlanders to their paper sheets. The layers don\u0027t interact with eachother except by means of gravity; a possibility of transport has yet to be found. It is likely that no way of breaking the dimensional barriers of our universe will be found ever and that communication with our brethren living on parallel earths will only be possible by means of enacting forces upon their universe - an object that moves between two places in space is enough for a \u0022gravity telegraph\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting, isn\u0027t it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skylon","CreatedById":175317,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-10T15:02:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery interesting.

Newtonian gravity happens to be a good approximation, but there is no actual equivalent to the continuous field lines like in electrodynamics. So the inverse power laws don\u0027t have to apply. And in fact, they do not. Close to Schwarzschild radius, gravity does not follow inverse square law.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNonetheless, gravity is roughly linear at large scales, and it is fair to ask if we\u0027d still get roughly inverse square law if we had extra dimensions. The answer is that we probably wouldn\u0027t with a complete R\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0spacial dimensions, unless something really strange was going on, but if extra dimension is finite in its span, then we\u0027d still get inverse square law, while getting all kinds of side effects. This idea\u00A0shows up in string theory, supersymmetry, and holographic interpretation of quantum mechanics. So it\u0027s actually an idea that has been studied quite a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, none of the existing \u0026gt;3 dimensions \u002B time models have demonstrated any advantage over the standard model. Just the opposite. They either ended up not sufficiently robust, or made predictions that did not pan out in experiment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of the day, Standard Model, for all of its drawbacks, is sufficient to describe everything we have observed. We might have to add a field or two to describe dark matter and dark energy, but nothing indicates that we\u0027ll have to invent all new physics to account for these. Kind of like Higgs particle was added without any loss to existing models.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as a reminder to these who aren\u0027t physicists, Standard Model consists of 3 \u002B 1 dimensional space, where extra dimension is time, and a number of intrinsic degrees of freedom which do not have an associated dimension. After enforcing local symmetries on all of these degrees of freedom, a Lagrangian of the Standard Model can be written down, and from it equations describing \u003Cem\u003Eabsolutely all known physics\u003C/em\u003E can be derived.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, if we try to account for local symmetries in all degrees of freedom, equivalent to saying that we want to have a quantum gravity description of the universe, we can write down the equations, but we cannot solve them numerically or algebraically. Which is a bummer, and why people are still trying to come up with nicer models, like Loop Quantum Gravity, to try and give us an alternative description which has solvable equations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key point, however, is that we aren\u0027t currently looking for a replacement because something in SM doesn\u0027t work. Absolutely every part of SM agrees with experiments and observations. We just ran into some boundaries with the ability to make predictions from it, and some people think we can do better.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E was going for:TLDR atm. But the first thing to do is not try to come up with a theory. It\u0027s to analyse the current theory for what it is. Usually that is a simple math function being treated as more than it really is. Then you need test things base on more complex premises. This is what is lacking in modern science. And I mean the physicist and people running the equipment like the colliders and other test equipment. They do not understand the scale of what they are testing(or ignore it) and massively simplify and use very fanciful/simplified ideas. They have no chance of finding out the answer with their approaches(potentially by design). You have a 99.9999% chance the premise of any modern theory is completely over simplified garbage the guys making it up simply can\u0027t or don\u0027t do the math to put in context of the next step. They then waist massive amounts of money to test nothing and get nowhere. What they need to do is get themselves to the point they can get their theories to a level of complexity to reality(wich is measured in massive magnitudes of complexity.) and then test the theory and move ahead a massive magnitude more with what they find. Current theory is all basically slow rolling theories as little as possible to fuel their egos or grants or pocket books(in the case of lectures and side money). It\u0027s not science. They are con artists. They do not know how to do real work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrent, \u0022science,\u0022 is just slow rolling out formulas to make money and get center stage like video card makers release video cards.

Just like everything else today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo intended statement about your theory though! It\u0027s just that how modern, \u0022scientific theories\u0022 are made(from actual scientist), dark matter is a big potential and/or openly known simplification on modern sciences part.
