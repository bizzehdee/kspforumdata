Let\u0027s say the below is your git branch structure (asterisks are commits):\n\n         *--* a\n        /\n    *--*--*--* master\n        \\  \\\n         \\  * b\n          * c\n\nYou then issue the following commands (the red bits, the parentheses are explanations):\n\ngit checkout master (to get the branch to start on master)\n\ngit checkout -b stuff (to create the stuff branch and go onto it right away)\n\ngit merge a (this, like the other two below, will merge the given branch (here \u0027a\u0027) into the branch you\u0027re on, in this case stuff. If there are conflicts, this is where you deal with them.)\n\ngit merge b\n\ngit merge c\n\nThe end result will be a branch named \u0027stuff\u0027 that has all the commits from a, b and c, which should be easily mergeable into master.
