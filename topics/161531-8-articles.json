What\u0027s the reasoning behind that? The Alcubierre Drive is kind of the part the entire KSP-Interstellar mod was originally built around, and replacing it with a different version from a different mod (that doesn\u0027t work the same way as the original???) isn\u0027t exactly something that should be done lightly...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E Also, the XenonGas isn\u0027t used as a coolant in RoverDude\u0027s version of the Alcubierre Drive. It\u0027s used for \u0022maneuvering thrusters\u0022- which kind of doesn\u0027t make sense as an Alcubierre Drive wouldn\u0027t require built-in maneuvering thrusters to operate... I\u0027ve been examining the video he posted of his warp drive in action- and it also seems to only generating a warp bubble of a very limited diameter around the part itself- which may actually be more realistic (energy requirements increase with larger warp bubbles) but greatly limits the size of ships you can move with a warp drive part...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT #2:\u003C/strong\u003E There may also be issues with the degree of realism in how the Alcubierre Drive implemented by RoverDude is affected by physical laws, in that the version found in prior versions of KSP-Interstellar is more realistic. For instance, you would expect the Alcubierre Drive to translate your ship relative to the Solar System without need for maneuvering thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how to describe the differences better than this: with a KSP-I Alcubiere Drive (prior to this version of KSP-I Extended) activating the drive while pointing prograde in close circular orbit of the Sun would quickly fling you out to the edge of the solar system (moving you in a straight line). In RoverDude\u0027s version, nothing would happen if you didn\u0027t have the maneuvering thrusters accelerating you in the direction your ship is pointing- the ship would remain in a circular orbit despite the contraction of space-time ahead of it which should (in theory) translate you in a straight line without any source of acceleration being necessary...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, so the observed result of the two is exactly the same, so long as you have functional maneuvering thrusters (and a source of XenonGas with RoverDude\u0027s version, or Helium with the way you adapted it). But the difference is there is no requirement for the maneuvering thrusters in real life, or in the version previously found in KSP-Interstellar... Nor is there need for the Liquid Helium- unless you\u0027re using it to dissipate WasteHeat, which radiators should be perfectly capable of doing without requiring an expensive resource that quickly boils off...

This effectively makes it impossible to power the warpengine using only nuclear power, you going to need at least a fusion power to get into warp. Charging the warpengine works as it previously did but instead of losing all warp power at launch, you lose half (and any overcharge). The first half is used start warp travel, the second half represent the warp field which you need to maintain to remain at warp speed. The more power you can use to maintain the warp field, the longer distance you can travel. Once you warp field (represented by Exotic matter) runs out, it collapses and you return to normal space. If you stop you electrical generators or stop feeding the warp engines, the warp field will start to collapse on it\u0027s own, but it can take considerable time depending on the warp field strength (which depend on the warp speed). If you you wish to drop out of warp sooner, you can press the \u0022Deactivate Warp Drive\u0022 to reverse to polity of your warpfield generator and help the warp field to collapse much fast. This means you can no longer instantly drop out of warp at will (as you did in Interstellar) and that your warp engines start uncharged after dropping out of warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This mod, which was created out of my own frustration with the lack of incompatibility between Interstellar and Near future, is my first (public) Mod for KSP.

And even if Exotic Matter *did* come in contact with normal matter directly, it\u0027s not going to interact with it explosively like antimatter. In fact, Exotic Matter, while quite strange and unusual, in small quantities (the kind we\u0027re talking about here for an Alcubierre Drive- it\u0027s not like we\u0027re building a star or planet out of it) is perfectly harmless...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBy the way, regarding black holes:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if you could collapse just a few metric tons of normal matter to infinite density (creating a sort of miniature black hole) the magnitude of gravitational attraction exerted by that mass on other objects would remain unchanged at the same distance from the center of mass (i.e. its gravity would be insignificant). What makes a black hole truly dangerous isn\u0027t the magnitude of its gravitational force (which is the same as the mass that collapsed when creating it), it is how close you can get to that center of mass. You can head directly into the center of a black hole- something you can\u0027t do with a comparably massive star or nebula without starting to pass through its boundaries well before you reach the light-capturing gravitational forces present near the center of a black hole... I.e. it\u0027s the density of a black hole that is dangerous, not the total magnitude of mass (although the infinite density does lead to it eventually acquiring a very large mass, leading to the supermassive black holes that are truly scary...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I can sum it up this way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(1)\u003C/strong\u003E Exotic Matter doesn\u0027t require large amounts of energy to maintain- this isn\u0027t realistic (to theory).

So for those interested read that. I was looking to explain the reasoning behind the alternate mode, if you entertain the possibility even if not convinced that\u0027s mission accomplished for me. Because... \u0022hypothesis\u0022, nobody knows because frankly the whole idea could be pure fantasy. If it works it is beyond known physics and may behave in a way we would not predict or know until we turn one on. For all we know your orbital velocity upon turning off a warp drive would be zero because your velocity inside your warp bubble is zero. Or the drive would be impossible to turn off, so the whole thing would be moot because now you\u0027re some sort of tachyon forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil someone makes exotic matter or NASAs experiments into space warping show us something or aliens visit using one and share the knowledge we really don\u0027t know and they are all equally as correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the thing you\u0027re missing from how this drive is supposed to work regardless of energy conversion is that your ship is staying still and space is effectively moving through itself using its shape to propel that flat spot. Whether that flat spot is disconnected from space time is part of the debate. Either way you\u0027re being pushed by space itself and that is providing the propulsion up, down, and around the gravity well. It would be like if the cement around your car liquefied and a wave of liquid cement pushed your island of regular cement to a new location. This analogy doesn\u0027t quite work, but it gives a good idea of the propulsion idea. Energy conservation could be obeyed in two ways (and hypothesis again) your raw speed has to change as you move in the gravity well otherwise you receive or lose potential energy; or your raw linear momentum stays constant and you do gain orbital energy \u0026amp; angular momentum based on your position in the gravity well. Total energy conservation here isn\u0027t possible, so it could be either because based on normal physics both are wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are not disconnected from space-time, your trajectory is altered by gravity as it would be for light. You effectively hit escape velocity for that gravity well, if you want to, as soon as you activate the drive. The trajectory shown in the map screen, regardless of conservation, is what your ship is going to do when you turn off the drive. You are propagating yourself through space itself just as light does. The way krakensbane works kind of turns every ship into an Alcubierre drive, and when using the function to move the ship, you\u0027re using krakensbane truly as an Alcubierre drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree fully that linear momentum being conserved might be reality. Both RoverDude\u0027s original and KSPI\u0027s drive works about right if that\u0027s the case. The whole reason I proposed angular momentum conserving version was that everyone was using the linear momentum version and I wanted to try the other one. Linear momentum conservation is far simpler to code, I understand fully there. I wanted to see what the other way was like and thought others might want to as well. Then one could make their own choice of which side they fall on based on the reasoning they are most convinced by and which one seems more correct to them after using it. For me it all started when warping out to Jool from Kerbin and thinking \u0022how... does my ship have this much energy suddenly?\u0022, then I looked into it and saw lots of disagreement.

Because that\u0027s what you imply when you state no additional power is required once you have created the stuff. beside the fact that exotic matter will constantly try to cancel itself out, you supposedly need use the stuff to create a warp field, which either way will require a lot of constant additional power to maintain.
