If you are at the northpole, and want to go to KSC, couldn\u0027t you just point south on the Navball and navigate from there? I use this method commonly. Or i just zoom out in flight mode alooooottttt, see where it is i want to go, and turn that way and carry on. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Are you talking about a rover, or a plane, or a rocket, or an EVA?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T02:53:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m talking about a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the navball but I\u0027m asking if there is other method.
