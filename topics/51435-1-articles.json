This is a really uncommon and pretty expensive part. But if I had to guess I would say that it won\u0027t do very well at max settings, even Intel\u0027s best integrated GPUs are pretty bad compared to a low-end discrete GPU. You will probably have to turn down a few things. The game will still be CPU limited most of the time, but running at max settings could slow things down in some situations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merlinux","CreatedById":83117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T15:25:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell reading that review from annandtech I can try and answer your question \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E It says The Iris pro is on par with the GT650M.
