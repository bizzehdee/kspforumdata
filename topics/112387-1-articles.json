Craft size isn\u0027t a problem, as I\u0027ve got the VAB and launch pad fully upgraded. I just don\u0027t have the ability to make a ship that doesn\u0027t wobble itself to death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas on how to do extremely low tech missions like this? I can make a ship with the delta-v necessary that isn\u0027t too gargantuan, but all the construction techniques I\u0027ve tried lead to a ship which is too unstable in the lower stages to get out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions on getting to the next tech level are not welcome. The Mun mission was a self imposed challenge that I\u0027ve failed, and I\u0027m curious to see how other people do it (I\u0027m fairly confident it can be done). Getting to the next tech level is trivially easy, anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral low-tech construction techniques \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E welcome, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I should make some clarifications. This is a one Kerbal land and return mission. Science isn\u0027t necessary. I\u0027d really prefer not to use the jetpack, but if your idea uses it it should be limited to one use (outside of messing around on the surface). The kerbal has to survive. The mission must only use parts from the first 2 levels of the tech tree (the tech you start with being the first level), and should be doable in career mode with a fully upgraded VAB and launchpad. Funds are irrelevant.
