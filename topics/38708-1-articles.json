I\u0027ve managed to figure out 90% of my real nav ball design but for the life of me I cannot think of who to go to to get a nav ball made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m talking of the ball itself. It has to be two hollow hemispheres with a screw hole at the top. This is to attach the third axis. For my test systems I\u0027m going to fudge it with a kids ball and the markings scrawled on. I haven\u0027t decided on servo or stepper motors yet... both have good and bad points so I will probably do both... But I have no clue where to get a ball made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I finish this I will post all the specs for how to make one yourself. I was surprised at how easy the design is. I think the only real expensive parts are the servos and maybe getting the ball done. But compared to a real one it\u0027s going to be cheap. The only hard part in construction is the link tracks (remember as the sphere rotates if the wires were directly contacted to the internal servo it would tangle up and die.
