When I upgraded from Fractal\u0027s KSP-I to Wave\u0027s a long time ago, I removed Treeloader, ORS and WarpPlugin first and everything was working fine. Recently I reinstalled everything, KSP and all mods and now I keep getting the \u0022resource deprived\u0022 error. I think it happens after I load a quicksave, but not always, it seems random. I think it started after I upgraded MKS, so I removed the ORS folder again and replaced it with the one from Interstellar, but that didn\u0027t solve it. I also deleted the openresource dll I found in the scansat folder, but that didn\u0027t solve it either.

Efficient systems should minimize this loss, since it\u0027s always easier to not generate power that isn\u0027t being useful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe counter argument is that, sometimes, local efficiency is gained at the expense of systematic inefficiencies. This is the argument for electric cars too, that it\u0027s more efficient to generate lots of kinetic energy at high volume, high efficiency, electrical generators and transfer that energy over inefficient power lines to inefficient electrical motors connected to wheels then to just start with inefficient kinetic motors that are directly connected to wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lei07","CreatedById":110324,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T12:40:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wendo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022wendo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERight... that explains all the trouble...
