I\u0027m not sure if this is done through emissives, as it is my understanding they only used for variable input/output lighting and animations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I setup parachutes? I get what\u0027s in the cfgs but I\u0027m not sure where to define the hinge that the parachute will swing on, and really not too sure of other Unity specific things regarding them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith solar panels, I want to know similarly how their animations are made game ready in Unity, ie how to define the rotating point, and what to tag the game object for the solar panel face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one last odd question: I am very very new to texturing, could someone guide me to a resource for reducing model glare? Or just a good texturing resource would even be helpful, I\u0027m pretty bad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"austin4050","CreatedById":66368,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T00:13:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot quite sure on these but I believe you should be able to bump up the \u0022reflectance\u0022 parameter to make more of the glare.
