As mentioned by several people upthread, DLC would be a great way to expand beyond the core of the game itself. Extra star systems besides Kerbol, sci-fi parts to reach them, etc. might be a great DLC option. Some players absolutely drool over the idea and would have no problems paying an extra $5 to have these things in an official, supported way. Meanwhile, other style players might opt for an \u0022uber-realism\u0022 pack with extra survivability parts, more realistic physics, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real trick would be, in my opinion, that Squad wouldn\u0027t be able to charge $14.99 for a DLC pack like a bigger developer. $4.99 would probably be a more reasonable price point. And they would have to add a fair bit of value for that $4.99, or as people have mentioned, the players would simply get what they wanted from KSP\u0027s absolutely awesome modding community.

Is Squad planning on releasing DLC? Because I would totally [insert HATE or LOVE here] that!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of whether Squad does DLC, which I guess is totally up in the air right now and we have no idea if they will or not, there are three classes of DLC in my opinion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The total ripoff DLC. Example: $4.99 for a cosmetic change that took a modeler a grand total of 2 hours to make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The pay-to-win DLC. Example: $4.99 for a 4000s Isp Nuclear Thermal Rocket with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 50.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The additional maps DLC. Example: $4.99 for a new set of planets and moons to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly the third type would get me to bite. That is, if Squad does DLC.
