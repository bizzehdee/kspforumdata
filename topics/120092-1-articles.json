So far I have the model created for 1.25m ships at this time, at least I believe it should be that size, I just haven\u0027t transferred it yet to Unity. My question mainly is will keyframes properly transfer over to unity and if there is current a reason I have not seen inline solar panels before. Here are the pics of the starting state and the fully deployed state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8SX9KiS.png\u0022 alt=\u00228SX9KiS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5PbDk5V.png\u0022 alt=\u00225PbDk5V.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPardon my lack of textures at this time, just wanted to get some input on this before I continue on with the idea. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T01:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESolar sails?

This first part is just going to pop open and is stationary and can close also. I mainly want to make a part that is protected better then surface attached panels, especially on ships entering the atmo at high speed. Allowing them to have a good supply of power when they do land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan to make an angled set of parts also that would allow for better range of view for the sun when landed, so instead of having -=- have it come out like \\_/ but the with the panels pointing down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I like Dr Jets inline solar idea, they are a nice setup but I wanted more of a frill around the ship.
