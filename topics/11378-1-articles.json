The first stage engages the 8 Atmospheric engines, while the second stage fires 8 solid boosters, which are enough to lift the craft into the air. It is possible to take-off pure vertically, but i suggest getting a little bit of forward velocity for better stability. Once airborne, the craft very stable, as long as you don\\\u0027t enter oscillations. In that case, it is likely that one wing will break off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor jettisoning the boosters you got 2 options: Dropping them when they are burned out, with a huge possibility for them to hit the craft and destroy it, or jettison them before they burn out, so that they eject upwards and are out of the way. I suggest the 2nd option, although it comes with the remote possibility of the boosters hitting each other and destroying the craft in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case something unexpected happens, there is alway the possiblity to disconnect the cockpit and let it descent on a parachute to save your Kerbals, which works sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, it will fly like a plane, can accelerate with over 70\u00C2\u00B0 of climb and has some maneuverabilty. For orbit, just go to 75\u00C2\u00B0 climb and hold it there. In the lower atmosphere it is best to leave the ASAS off. Once you are about 14-16k high, fire up the rocket engine, get a almost vertical climb going, disable the air breathing engines, and you are good to go for an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got into an 500*500km orbit with a little more than 7 fuel tanks, leaving me with almost 3 tanks for deorbiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReentry can be a bit tricky, but if you got the craft to stop spinning, it is actually able to land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease feel free to comment, suggest improvements, download and edit the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thobewill10","CreatedById":6148,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T01:38:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is a beautiful behemoth.
