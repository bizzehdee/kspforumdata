Neither the craft nor the savegame made it into KSP 1.1, and I would have to continue the mission in 1.0.5.\n\nA reentry profile and runway landing procedure was developed before the actual mission started. More bodies were planned to be visited. But to actually do all of this would now be a chore, as 1.1 is so much faster on my computer that I never want to launch 1.0.5 again.\n\nThis is not really bad, but rather a bit embarrassing, because I had recently boastfully promised to attempt an \u0022exceptionally, spectacularly silly\u0022 entry, flying a \u0022profoundly bonkers\u0022 craft. Now, I\u0027m standing here with empty hands, as far as the K-prize rules are concerned. I mean, Duna is beautiful and all, but probably slightly too far away from the KSC runway to count for the \u0022... and back\u0022 part of this challenge, right?\n\nHowever, since the main purpose of my craft was to be silly and entertaining, I will show pictures of the unfinished mission below, and say a few words about the mission, and some more about the craft.  \n\nThe Mission went to Minmus first, for refuelling by ISRU. Landed there with less than 1% of fuel left - I would likely not have beaten this sort of craziness for the rest of the mission anyway! Went to Duna next; the vessel carries some Duna-specific landing equipment. Suboptimal landing spot, slightly missing good ore reserves. Went on a cross country trip on wheels to get to a better mining location, when KSP 1.1 came along. Mirgy and her 1.0.5 universe are now frozen in time forever. (She doesn\u0027t know.)  \n\nThe Circular Crackpot Contraption is a single seat, ISRU capable, interplanetary vessel, designed for horizontal takeoff and landing on all bodies that are named \u0022Kerbin\u0022. Its outstanding uselessness can be quickly summarized: it\u0027s huge, uses lots of parts, but carries only one Kerbal and no payload. Delta-V or similar useful data isn\u0027t known, as this sort of information makes way too much sense for a craft like this. Given the silly shape of the thing, even the delta-V value would probably have been rounded to the point of being about as useless as the vessel itself.\n\nBut what really sets this craft apart, where plain and common stupidity has to make way for breathtakingly advanced, high grade, raging lunacy, is the \u0022aerodynamic\u0022 layout.\n\n*No* wings.  \n*No* control surfaces.  \n*No* fins.  \n*No* airbrakes.  \n\nBut I insist that it\u0027s a spaceplane!\n\nIt does fly using aerodynamic lift. Apart from a little lift generated by tanks, most lift is derived from an outrageous abuse of a giant payload fairing.\n\n(Yes! It\u0027s true! A saucer-shaped fairing, moving through the air sideways, behaves very much like you would expect it to do IRL. I was surprised to find this, because I had assumed that the simplified aero model of KSP would only properly deal with the fairing when flying along the intended orientation.)\n\nObviously, such a vehicle is a nightmare in terms of control and balance. Despite liberal reaction wheel spamming, the CG absolutely has to be, and needs to stay, exactly in the center, otherwise the handling turns from \u0022unbelievably bad\u0022 to \u0022utterly impossible to not wreck\u0022 quickly. This presented a huge problem with engine placement. After some time, I arrived at the solution of placing the nukes facing forward, to balance out the bunch of Rapiers in the back.\n\nDuring ascent from Kerbin - which takes ages and is a nightmare in itself - there\u0027s a moment when the Rapiers run out of OX, before even a periapsis of 70km is attained. To switch over to the nukes, the vessel needs to be rotated 180\u00B0 around the yaw axis while engulfed in plasma. If that sounds like horrible handling to you, you haven\u0027t begun to consider that this maneuver is possible only because there\u0027s *no* rudder to begin with!\n\nI DO NOT recommend to use fairings as wings! This was an exercise in getting something to work that\u0027s really unsuitable for the job, while not using any of the parts that should really be present on any proper airplane. The result is decidedly worse than ... really, just about anything else I\u0027ve built lately.  \n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Z8Cmj/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Jetski","CreatedById":119969,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T03:44:28Z","Content":"Here\u0027s my unmanned Low Mass contender for SSTO 1.1.2, playing stock \u002B KER\n\n14 parts, 6.04 tons on the Runway.
