I\\\u0027ve done some artwork, too. I need to improve on it, but hey, XKCD is stickmen and look how popular \u003Cem\u003Eit\u003C/em\u003E is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to name it something along the lines of \\\u0027IMPACT\\\u0027, but I couldn\\\u0027t seem to come up with a good name based on it. Then I thought of \\\u0027RankAmateur\\\u0027. The name, somehow, hadn\\\u0027t been taken already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny artworks I post here may be modified later on. Feel free to point out any proportions I\\\u0027ve got wrong or things that don\\\u0027t look right - IE, the size of Renaza\\\u0027s head [too small] and the direction her right eye is pointing [makes it look as if her iris is at the very edge of her head.] By the way, Renaza is the Haikovan Mission Controller on the left. The one on the right is an engineer, and I don\\\u0027t have a name for her.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2XOOs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222XOOs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s the start of a possible sketch. In this one, Renaza\\\u0027s left arm is too thin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N1kxI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022N1kxI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\\\u0027s the context.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe storyline is set around a HSD ship. The Mission Controller is Renaza Talinar. The ship is sent on an unimpressive mission to sort out a bar fight on a Pleasure Cruiser. The ship suffers some damage on the way there, including the loss of several engineers. Luckily, however, they come across a short-range but interstellar skiff with an engineer on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s where the luck ends - the engineer is suffering from mental trauma, having been forced to use a transporter [like the ones from Star Trek.] The transporter itself didn\\\u0027t cause the engineer to have the breakdown, rather that along with a large number of people she is of the belief that when transporters take someone apart and put them back together somewhere else, the original is dead. The person now wandering around is just a copy. Having that belief and then being that copy can cause severe cases of personality dissassociation. In the storyline, its a well documented condition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, they have an engineer who doesn\\\u0027t want to believe that they are who they would seem to be. Problem is, the original was working on very important research, which could have dire consequences for a large section of the galaxy. And because of the engineer\\\u0027s condition, she isn\\\u0027t in a state to be conveying that information to anyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERenaza\\\u0027s mundane mission to sort out a bar fight ends up as a race to save trillions of lives, and everything rests on a mentally unstable woman who won\\\u0027t come to terms with her own existance. And, of course, a lot of interstellar shenanigans happen along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technoguy33","CreatedById":8845,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-18T03:41:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dunno.
