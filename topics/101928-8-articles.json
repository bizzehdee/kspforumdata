To be more precise - when building container with goods using EPL, mass of items in container is added to resource cost but any fuels in items in container are calculated as just extra mass so it\u0027s possible to produce anything from rocket parts, including fuels, food, water, or even more rocket parts. It\u0027s not a problem in a near stock game but with mods like TAC Life Support or Karbonite\u002B things are becoming a bit cheaty.\n\nWant unlimited life support made from scrapped extra fuel tanks? Easily!\n\nWant payload with astronomical money cost almost for free? Throw some tank with costly lightweight material inside (for example karborundum from Karbonite\u002B) to container and now it costs you just few rocket parts if built with EPL!\n\nNo advertisements or complaints - just reporting."},{"CreatedByName":"Xaver","CreatedById":46640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T12:00:57Z","Content":"Since now it is stock for me.

It seems part of the idea is that you do not *need* carryable containers because you can carry several on the kerbal by default.\n\nI still think there could be a role for the carriable containers. As it is, kerbals can carry a lot of stuff, yet that stuff doesn\u0027t seem to take up much space.\n\nYou could probably get away with kerbals only having 1/3 of the storage volume, and adding a slightly shrunk version of the old carryable containers to use as backpack.\n\nCarryable containers were fun, it would be a pity to do away with them completely. \n\nThe grab thing from KAS isn\u0027t going away is it? As long as it\u0027s still there, modified versions of the carryable containers will still run. \n\nIt might be a good Idea to make it a bit more obvious in the instructions that you need to hold X to attach things. This approach to moving things around is quite similar to what you can do in the sims, I\u0027ve found myself trying to drop things into the box, or the kerbal without opening the inventory a few times now. It could be an idea to make that possible. Also, perhaps a button in the inventory dialog window that lets you take or give everything when you\u0027ve got two inventories open could be useful?\n\nAdding the \u0027bounce\u0027 module from the kerbincup balls to the basket ball would be cool, but might be stretching the no dependencies rule.\n\nIt is very cool.

Maybe this would not even be possible, but just to throw something out there: one way to keep a vague sense of \u0022realism\u0022 with carriable containers that are much larger than Kerbals themselves might be to make them attach to Kerbals via a cable that would get stuck to a Kerbal\u0027s back. Kind of an automated sort of plug-in-to-a-port-with-KAS-stuff process, and then the Kerbals could tow/drag containers around rather than have them stuck to their backs.
