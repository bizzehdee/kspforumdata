To be more precise - when building container with goods using EPL, mass of items in container is added to resource cost but any fuels in items in container are calculated as just extra mass so it\u0027s possible to produce anything from rocket parts, including fuels, food, water, or even more rocket parts.

Maybe this would not even be possible, but just to throw something out there: one way to keep a vague sense of \u0022realism\u0022 with carriable containers that are much larger than Kerbals themselves might be to make them attach to Kerbals via a cable that would get stuck to a Kerbal\u0027s back. Kind of an automated sort of plug-in-to-a-port-with-KAS-stuff process, and then the Kerbals could tow/drag containers around rather than have them stuck to their backs. Then they could move larger containers around.
