I\u0027ll think about it.\n\n@ObsessedWithKSP; I\u0027ve made one further RCS block - a rectangular trapezoid shaped one designed to continue the slope of mk2 fuselages and seamlessly fit on the sides of a mk2 fuselage where the black stripe is. Its less aerodynamic than the blisters, but can be used instead of the chine pieces.\n\n@Gryphorim; I had an idea originally for a sort of bomber-esque observation/high visibility mk2 cockpit/mk2 cupola thing.
