No prob, I think, it\u0027s happened a few times before, I just grab a backup save, rename it, and replace persistent.sfs in the appropriate saves folder. No dice. I try the other persistent backup file - same deal. Starting to sweat a bit now. Tried a few other save files at random, no luck. Clearly renaming the files isn\u0027t working. I\u0027m wondering if something in the files needs to be changed, or maybe something is up with the loadmeta file which I have zero working knowledge of.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny suggestions?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy Sandbox save was showing the same, but I was able to restore it with little effort, so there\u0027s that. But it wasn\u0027t the active save at the time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lunar Sea","CreatedById":164137,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-18T14:48:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, tough crowd.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
