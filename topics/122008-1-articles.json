There are good reasons for this in real life, but in KSP, I\u0027d like to be looking out the side of the ship, like in a lander can. The thing is, the two stock lander cans have pretty small windows. I\u0027d rather have a wide view - like, the default camera angle/zoom sees only window, and I have to look around to spot any instruments. That said, having it strutted up like the cupola wouldn\u0027t be a problem, as long as the struts were fairly thin. Like the USI Exploration pack\u0027s HERP Pod, only oriented sideways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know about the Panopticon pod, which would at first blush seem to fit my needs. And it\u0027s all right. But it doesn\u0027t look stock at all, which is kind of an issue for me, aesthetically. So what I\u0027m asking is this: would any of you be interested in making an alternate Mk. 1 lander can with a big window? Something like this (fear my MSPaint skills!):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rK9l8vE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rK9l8vE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly maybe with some struts on the bendy parts or something. And it doesn\u0027t have to look exactly like that; if you have other ideas, go for it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Mk. 2 version (and a Mk. 3 version, with three crew, a 270 degree window, and poor Bill staring at the crew hatch?) would be cool as well, but if I can only talk you into one, I\u0027ll take the Mk. 1. Do any of you think you\u0027d be interested? Or do you know something already that might fit the bill?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T02:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds intetesting.

Standard capsules, even the ones with larger windows (like the spaceplane stuff), are looking the wrong way to see any of the cool stuff, and the lander cans have tiny windows (plus, the Mark 2\u0027s window is fogged for some reason).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t need those fancy see in from the outside windows (though if you \u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E to, that\u0027d be neat), just a nice big picture window to look through from the inside. Mark 2 (and Mark 3, with 270 degree coverage and poor Bill staring at the hatch?) variants would be welcome, but something like this, that\u0027d fit in with the stock looks and let me do my all-IVA run without 90% of the view being unchanging instruments, is all I want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thahat","CreatedById":100130,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T12:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etheoritically someone could probably use the 1 man lander can and remove the right uppper and lower instruments to make room for more windows, but then you would be lacking in instruments, thought that could be overcome with rasterpropmonitor stuff/other iva enhancements/placement somewhat overhead for instance i guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecant do it myself (can only modifiy config files somewhat, sorry!) but totally digging the idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
