Any error should be Mass-forward so that you gently accelerate forwards. Flying choppers/VTOLs with the navball takes a bit of getting used to, but it is possible to make a very stable flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience with KAX and Firespitter, helicopters are much more finnecky to fly than jet VTOLs. The Firespitter auto-hover feature is a great advantage for landing, but when I tried KAX on it\u0027s own I couldn\u0027t get it to work - the button was there but didn\u0027t do anything (at least that I could see). On the other hand, the KAX rotor effects are much more satisfying/smoother than Firespitter\u0027s. I used the SP\u002B parts and KAX Huey rotors to make a Chinook-style helicopter with the intention of recovering vessels/pods that landed offshore. Balancing the KAS winch, fuel tanks and CoT on that was... interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KazeNinja","CreatedById":113774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T18:32:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the helpful advice.
