In this picture the craft wobbled itself apart until those 3 panels on the left ripped loose. One of the bases is straight gone. But notice how inexact the placement is now. They were EXACT when I launched it. Annoying as this is. Researching this issue is like doing real science. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nTH8LuN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nTH8LuN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-27T17:40:12Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2014 05:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by UAL002\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ginsuguy585","CreatedById":128607,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T01:52:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBUG In the VAB hinges rotate in relation to the item they are attached to instead of on their own rotation axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo duplicate: attach a hinge to any currently attached node, use the position editor to change the angle of the part so it is not at min or max, set the max/min angle to something other than default values but keeping the current position valid, use the position editor to run against the min or max limiter, use the position editor to reverse the previous action, repeat the last two steps several times and the part will no longer be at the angle you attached it.
