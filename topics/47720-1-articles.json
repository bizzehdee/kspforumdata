The exploding version lacked the thrust plate at the top, so the middle stages would suffer shearing stresses and collapse. It\u0027s not the weight of the tanks that\u0027s the problem, its shearing that pulls big rockets apart. If the first stage is only attached to the central core, then it pushes that core up, whilst gravity pulls the radial cores down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the thrust plates in place, all the engines on the lower stage push evenly into all 9 engines of the second stage so all the stacks are under a similar amount of strain.

Like numerobis explained, with that number of engines it doesn\u0027t take long for them to burn enough fuel to lower the weight. The saturn V did the same thing. I\u0027ve taken them off with a thrust ratio of exactly 1. They hover between the launch clamps for a few seconds before they slowly start ascending. It doesn\u0027t matter how slowly they start accellerating..... your car can do 0-60 faster than most rockets. The important bit is that they keep accellerating for a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike others have said, you don\u0027t need to build anywhere near this big to reach the various planets.

TBH I don\u0027t think The Apollo Creed is anywhere near the upper limit of this design. It\u0027s solid as hell.....It\u0027s never exploded during launch....... the only problem is that it flexes during flight if you use the controls too much, and enabling SAS will cause major wobble issues. I think that can be fixed though by disabling gimballing on some of the mainsails, and possibly by adding more SAS units - the lower stages don\u0027t have any at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Apollo Creed is basically just a redesign of the exploding orange one. I used less orange tanks. I think having shorter tanks enables the stacks to survive flexing better. 2 orange tanks undergoing X amount of stress will have all that force concentrated in the joint between them. If you use 4 of the half sized tanks, that X amount of stress is distributed between 3 joints, so less chance of breakage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main difference is I didn\u0027t use the small decouplers you like for your asparagus designs. They\u0027re not going to work when building vertically because they\u0027ll create a wobble point. I just built the upper stage/payload, put a large decoupler underneath, a 2x2 panel directly beneath that, and then attach the girders. You can then put another stack underneath that....... It actually looks like the stack connects to the decoupler and sort of magically sandwiches the panel in the middle. The part clipping isn\u0027t a problem like it would be with your asparagus designs because here the plate is beneath the decoupler and the plate gets discarded at the same time as all the fuel tanks attached. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe giant bottom stage is created by putting 8 girders on the plate in symmetry, then disabling angle snap and adding 8 more. In theory this stage could quite easily be adapted for asparagus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
