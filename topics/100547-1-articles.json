It\u0027s a new feature that came out in 0.90.\n\nWhat they make that for? ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif) it makes craft building harder as it\u0027s *very* disorienting.\n\nAnother change that came with 0.90 is that some parts (like wings \u0026 cube struts) can\u0027t snap to the middle, just slide sideways. \n\nCan horizontal-snap be returned? One solution is to use the offset tool while angle snap is on to align the parts, but this requires doing 4 actions where i used to do just 1:\n\nBefore 0.90:\n\n- attach part behind a part\n\nAfter:\n\n- attach part\n\n- select offset tool\n\n- select part\n\n- select direction\n\n(By the way, the tools are GREAT)\n\nOpinions? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T19:29:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Overfloater**"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T19:30:03Z","Content":"EditorExtensions has the vertical snap back, you just need to place the part before pressing V, rather than afterwards.\n\nAgreed on the camera moving though, that\u0027s frequently more annoying than not."},{"CreatedByName":"manni01","CreatedById":109903,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T23:34:14Z","Content":"If you want to make it so that it doesn\u0027t zoom into the craft, you have to move (your camera) *down/lower* into the SPH. Either you can zoom down with the keys, or the keys are hard to find, use this trick:\n\n![cGEippb.gif](http://i.imgur.com/cGEippb.gif)\n\nAs you can see, when going into the VAB, chose a part, delete it, then chose your root part (, if you want, move it down so that it is level with camera). The zooming will go away. This isn\u0027t a bug, but a side-affect of what happens when the default camera is a little higher than usual. The camera hits the VAB ceiling and thus can\u0027t move up more. Your sphere through which you can navigate your camera becomes a very thick pancake:\n\n[http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/a/a1/Oval2.PNG](http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/a/a1/Oval2.PNG)\n\n(imagine a sphere with two planer intersections, but the planer intersections cut off the edges.
