Essentially it would be an extremely efficient air-augmented rocket, except it wouldn\u0027t work without the \u0022air\u0022 part, so it\u0027s still not \u0022one engine for everything\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan we stop that particular discussion now? I\u0027ve read thru an entire 50-reply long page of it, and it gets tiring after the 5th post saying the same thing. Hopefully my idea is something you\u0027re all at least \u0022okay\u0022 with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn topic, it\u0027d be nice if SQUAD found a way to add an \u0022air-optional\u0022 mode to the RAPIER. It wouldn\u0027t shut off without intake air, but having intake air would boost the specific impulse proportionately to how much it can get. Of course, this effect would only boost the ISP to roughly 390 if activated at sea level with more intake air than it can possibly consume available, and would have a lower vacuum ISP than the pure closed-cycle mode if it can\u0027t get any intake air, would be subjected to the same spooling that regular jets have, and would run a bit fuel-rich compared to rocket mode (1.8 fuel / 1.1 oxidizer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically an air-augmented rocket mode somewhere in-between the current air-breathing and closed-cycle modes. What can I say, I like air augmented rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eintake atm was always a hack by modders to get around squads botched job saying the intakes check for atmospheric oxidizer not the engines. rewrite things so that you can get intake air anywhere but the jet engines themselves check for oxygen and fail on planets without it, and it would admittedly solve a lot of problems, but it\u0027s a fix only squad can make. With that done we can have all the funky non-oxygen air breather technologies we want, but I\u0027m afraid what you would find is that all those new funky parts would look and perform relatively the same as their jet counterparts because there are only so many performance niches in terms of gameplay stats and they would all have an intake and atmospheric nozzle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T04:49:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGood point, but sadly it still seems that for almost anything that doesnt involve atmosphere (actually on duna its also the best engine), there is absolutely no reason to use anything but nukes. they have best range (even if you consider their mass on any craft but a super lightweight fuel tank\u002B909\u002Bpod style build), they have enough thrust that you arent pulling your hair out or lagging to death (ions are so bad unless u have like 1 per ton, which adds up to incredible amount of part count, lag, and overall clutter. Maybee if they give us a 1.25m io engine with say ~10x thrust and 10X weight, then i might use that instead of the nuke, but for now its nuke all the way fo reverything but atmo (where u use jets anyways). The only planets where nukes wont cut it are tylo, eve, jool (actually im not sure its even possible to land on jool in the 1st place), kerbol, and kerbin, and laythe. Aside form that, basically anything can be landed on with nukes if you knwo how to do it right, and they are so much ebtter then LFOs.\u003Cp\u003EI may be wrong on this, but according to experience and some calculations, the insane 800 ISP of nukes makes everything else completely redundant unless you want to do something on Eve, Kerbin, Laythe, Jool, Tylo, or Kerbol. Every other planet can be landed on with nukes, and well, if you are in space, then ur TWR isnt that important anyways. 2 of those planets btw support jets, so you get ultra ISP on kerbin/laythe (laythe is actually alot of fun, its atmo is thick enough to fly normally and land, but thin enough to be way less draggy and you can get near orbital speeds with pure jets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry take a nuke to Tylo, we will wait here for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T06:08:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022 data-cite=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETry take a nuke to Tylo, we will wait here for you.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis it a challenge?
