Programming the first parts of a system are always the fastest, from that point on everything you add could break the old parts. This adds up until you reach a point where you are almost spending as much time fixing what you just added as you spend adding new items. Squad is actually very good about bug fixing before each release and what you don\u0027t see is all the bugs the parts added to the game that were then fixed. My bet is about 1 week to a month is just bug fixing on each update. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do however think it might be nice if they made SURE they added a new item or two each update (which they mostly have so I\u0027m very happy so far \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) just to keep things seeming to progress to players.

Deadlines keep people focused and accountable. If deadlines mean nothing, then you have no motivation to get anything done in a timely fashion. It\u0027s one of the reasons I hate the \u0027when it\u0027s done\u0027 mentality. Not only has that historically been absolutely NO guarantee of quality whatsoever, but it is oftentimes little more than a flimsy excuse made by an unfocused and undisciplined team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see people building bridges \u0027when it\u0027s done\u0027, designing aircraft \u0027when it\u0027s done\u0027, cooking and serving food \u0027when it\u0027s done\u0027, or even major publishers releasing games \u0027when it\u0027s done\u0027. As a matter of fact, delaying games used to be fairly common about ten years ago. Nowadays it\u0027s very rare that a game ever gets delayed. Teams are held accountable, on-track, and have milestones charted that they reach. The progress of the game from storyboarding to \u0027going gold\u0027 is charted to exacting detail. The team making the next Assassin\u0027s Creed game knows exactly how much time they have, where they need to be at every step of the way, and how much they need to get done to reach that point. They aren\u0027t just showing up and browsing Reddit for half the day and then deciding that since it\u0027s been three months they should put in a science archive screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only example people can ever point to is Valve, but not only does Valve hardly even develop games these days, but the only last game that outright used a \u0027when its done\u0027 mentality was Half Life 2, which was \u003Cstrong\u003E9 years ago\u003C/strong\u003E. Neither Portal nor Portal 2 used \u0027when its done\u0027 development schedules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry but \u0027when it\u0027s done\u0027 is an excuse that flies with procrastinating teenagers, not anyone who actually has a real job. Squad\u0027s updates are outrageously slow and chronically offer extremely little content relative to the time investment involved. In three months I would expect you\u0027d have been able to do more than to add two new parts and make some experiments a one-time affair. v1.0 of the game is so far away at this pace that I honestly wonder if anyone will even still be playing this game enough to care when that happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChrist knows that people are undoubtedly pretty tired of the current planetary lineup. I don\u0027t even care to speculate how many years it\u0027ll be before we get another single new planetary body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t stick to schedules and milestones, you slip a little. One feature doesn\u0027t get into update because it wasn\u0027t done in time. Then next time, you let the release date slip a little because you had another feature not done. Then next time, you just keep your delayed release schedule since people didn\u0027t get too upset last time, and besides, now you have more time to get more features done. So now you\u0027re developing three months of content in four months. Then you get a little lazy, maybe burned out on this project that you\u0027ve been dragging out for three years, and you slip another feature, and decide to hold the next update for that feature. Now you\u0027re on five month schedules for three months of content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing good comes out of it. Games built \u0027when it\u0027s done\u0027 are not provably of any higher quality than games that stick to deadlines. If you believe that, Duke Nukem Forever would like to have a word with you - a game that is almost a monument for what can happen if you don\u0027t make a schedule and stick to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-26T00:38:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2013 12:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Frostiken\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeMeSiS","CreatedById":5379,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T00:43:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frostiken\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Frostiken\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t see people building bridges \u0027when it\u0027s done\u0027, designing aircraft \u0027when it\u0027s done\u0027,.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be fair; projects like that miss deadlines and go over budget so often that they might as well say \u0027when its done\u0027. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Time\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EValve time\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-26T00:46:43Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2013 12:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NeMeSiS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo Kerbonaut","CreatedById":65299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T00:46:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOriginally Posted by Clockwork_werewolf View Post\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say this as one of the major updates this time was a speed upgrade, something which the average player may not see or appreciate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lantay77\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lantay77\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIMO, this was the best thing about .23\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI totally agree with this. 0.23 is so much faster than any other version for me (playing since 0.19).

KSP has not since I started playing back in .19 had any sort of game breaking bug or glitch that I remember. The other two? Well one of them hasn\u0027t had anything horribly game breaking but they did have a few that greatly hindered playability (almost to the point that you couldn\u0027t play), the other had a bug show up on its test server that wouldn\u0027t allow certain people to log in to the game it would crash at the loading screen. But because of their hard deadline schedule they went ahead and launched the update anyway. You would think that with roughly 35-45% of their playerbase (not official, player estimated) not able to get into game they would roll out a fix right away right? Nope. It took them quite a while (3 weeks give or take a few days) and this wasn\u0027t even the first time they had problems like this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my money I would rather wait a bit and get something that actually works.
