Romfarer Lazor is messed up as well; cant get parts to load (both Romfarer and Interstellar Tree Part placement is in work).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWish me luck ... !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECmdr Zeta\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T00:22:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreetings,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeadin for the hills thats what Jeb says ... we got 50 Science and pretty much had to move a chute up to get into advanced rocketry just to get there !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENasaMissions are INOP so I ported some asteroids over yo harr ... now I got asteroids whenever I need em !
