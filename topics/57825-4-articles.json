How can you be here arguing about this stuff and not even know the basics of what SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, or Orbital Sciences are?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElon Musk helped start or founded Paypal and Tesla Motors, as well as SpaceX (in 2002.) They privately funded the development of the Falcon 1 light launcher on their own (and it was the first privately funded rocket to orbit something, in 2008.) In 2006 NASA awarded the COTS (Commercial transport) contracts to several companies including SpaceX to design and built something capable of servicing the ISS. We now know they succeeded with the Falcon9 and Dragon. The company wasn\u0027t founded on NASA money and it had its own business before the contract. It did take a HUGE risk to expand itself in order to achieve the Falcon9 and Dragon program, and without earning the rest of the government contract money (which had REQUIREMENTS that had to be fulfilled) they would have failed and likely closed, but they did it. And now they have a full slate of private launches lined up too, so much that they want to expand into one of the old shuttle pads that NASA is leasing out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnited Launch Alliance is a cooperative effort between Boeing and \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EMcDonell-Douglas\u003C/span\u003E Lockheed Martin (two aerospace companies with decades of history with the US government, especially the military) that operates the Atlas and Delta launcher families. Before the \u0022alliance\u0022 was created they each had their own programs. Their primary customer IS the US Goverment, and they are the primary launcher for most of their payloads, be it things like MAVEN, Curiosity, and such from NASA, or recon satellites for the NRO. In addition to their contracts, they receive a \u0022stipend\u0022 in order to stay functional so the government has guaranteed access to launchers and thus do not have to develop their own. Neither Atlas or Delta really had the capability to service the ISS (since there was no compatible orbital craft they could launch) and neither were man-rated. ULA has also taken part in the COTS and Commercial crew programs on smaller scales, for the latter mostly to get the Altlas V man-rated so it can potentially launch the CST-100 and/or DreamChaser. The Delta IV Heavy will launch the Orion test mission in late 2014 as well (since the SLS is years away from being done)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital Sciences Corp is another government contractor that has built satellites, GPS systems, missile defense systems and operates some launch vehicles and the new Cygnus craft out of the WALLOPS launch site in Virginia. They have been around since the 80s and have launched payloads using Pegasus, Taurus and Minotaur since the 90s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also several other companies which have received money from the Commercial Cargo/Crew programs like Sierra Nevada, ATK, Blue Horizons, etc. Some of them only made it through 1 or 2 steps of the selection process, others are still active (Sierra Nevada with Dream Chaser) or working on smaller systems instead of full launchers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the US government has funded a lot of programs through contracts, and the reason they do so is because the competitive process makes it cheaper.

The basics are that the US private space sector was killed off in the 80s and 90s due to a monopoly held by the Shuttle for launching things, which was sort of true. They were actually still using a lot of Titan, Atlas and Delta rockets during that time, but the claim was that they couldn\u0027t keep their business running (and thus support the governments with launchers) without federal aide, which they were granted. its one of those iffy government \u0027pork\u0027 projects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupposedly they claim they still require it, though there is some skepticism since a lot of the other private companies are finding business now without a stipend on top of their government contracts.
