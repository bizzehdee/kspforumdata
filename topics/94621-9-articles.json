I think procedural fairings does something like this, although I looked in the .cfg file and could not find anything to suggest such. I was thinking someting like cost = mass (tonnes) * 1000. So a 2T wing would be 2000, whereas a .1 ton wing would be 100. Currently I just have a flat price of 2500 which I think is fair for wings but if anybody could figure out how to implement a scaled cost like it does for mass? (at least I am assuming mass scales with size). Great mod though, I just deleted most of the B9 wings (except the winglets with built in flaps, I love how they look!) and SPP wings as well, kept a few stock wings for nostalgia purposes though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bac9","CreatedById":57757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T04:06:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EVersion 0.16\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://bitbucket.org/bac9/b9_aerospace_plugins/downloads\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://bitbucket.org/bac9/b9_aerospace_plugins/downloads\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZZbqMmO.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZZbqMmOl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZZbqMmOl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWings support thickness of up to one meter from now on\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERemoved leading and trailing edge multiplier property from wings\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded leading edge root/tip width and trailing edge root/tip width properties, all four of them can be adjusted from zero to one meter, allowing you to set up vertically elongated edge cross sections, horizontally elongated edge cross sections and cross sections proportional to arbitrary wing thickness values alike.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded collapsable categories parenting logical property groups (dimensions, materials, edges and so on) to the tweakable menu, making the selection and adjustment of numerous properties more manageable\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAll tweakable properties are no longer initially open in the context menu, being hidden under categories\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReplaced all edge models with new ones, improving cross section polycounts and adding hard material edge that looks better under arbitrary thickness and edge width combinations resulting in stretching\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReordered edge models: first type is circular, second type is biconvex (between sharp and circular in shape), third one is triangular, which makes a bit more sense (progression from smooth to sharp shapes instead of random order)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReordered and renamed some properties for convenience\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded flat fill support (fifth material type) to edges\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EImproved aerodynamic value calculation for wings, edges now properly contribute to the behaviour\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EImproved aerodynamic value calculation for control surfaces, trailing edge widths are now taken into account, along with contributions of offset properties to taper ratio\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EInternal fixes and refactoring in geometry handling, setup sequence and field updates\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETop and bottom surfaces of control surfaces and wings are collapsed into one mesh with a slight benefit to performance (separate material selection still available, shader based switching makes use of one mesh a non-issue)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESlight improvements to text in alternative UI\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENote: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis update can potentially make the crafts made with previous version of the mod unstable, due to changes in aerodynamic value calculations for FAR.

I somewhat offset this with layered tweakables for the parameters with the biggest value sets (like semispan), but still, I will never introduce ranges like 0-64 meters or increments like 0.01, because they will impair some precise designs and selections rather than broaden the options.
