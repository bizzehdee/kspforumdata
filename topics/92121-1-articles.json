So can someone here give me some tips or tutorial/link to one that explains how to get into a counterclockwise/clockwise (depending on what i need to do) orbit around a body, and also it would be nice to get some help optimizing orbital maneuvers. Also, is it possible to reverse a orbit using a mun\u0027s gravity slingshot or something?
