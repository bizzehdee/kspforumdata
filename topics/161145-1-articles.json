For \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, I suggest you did a surface one instead on orbit, since a full tank of ore that you get is producing less than a tank of fuel, for a sake of convenience, have it refined on surface to fill a tank before transporting it to orbit. For location, it\u0027s up to you, having duna as the location means you can easily have a vessel set an orbit for orbital refueling, however, duna have attmosphere and it\u0027s gravity is higher than Ike, so your refuel vessel had to deal with it. Ike, however, have a lower gravity and no atmosphere, which makes it easier for your refuel craft reaching orbit at the cost of having you to do additional burn for target vessel to set orbit around Ike.
