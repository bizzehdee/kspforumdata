That\u0027s about it. My name is Jellotickles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know a lot of stuff about KSP already. I\u0027ve already gone to Duna and the Mun. Landed on both of them too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched a series of satellites all with the first letter of the planet and O.S, standing for object surveyor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve launched 2 of them by myself. One being the first satellite I launched, dubbed the Kuputnik. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat one hardly has any instruments, just 3 symmetrical communication antennas. The other one is the K.O.S \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Kerbal Object Surveyor). The last two is another one I just thought about that I launched by myself (with a regular rocket I\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emean of course.) dubbed the M.O.S (Munar Object Surveyor). Last one I launched was the L.M.O.S. Dubbed the low munar object surveyor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T23:11:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
