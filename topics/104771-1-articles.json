One of the enemy \u0022ships\u0022 was a giant (flashing?) cube that sends out fighters (I think).\n\nThe game manual had a size comparison chart in the back, and the main ship you fly around in is (I think) basically the size of manhatten (or something like that).\n\nThe player\u0027s main was shaped something like this: \n\n![XTkWoCZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/XTkWoCZ.png)\n\nAnybody have any ideas? It was about 20 years ago, so my memory is a bit fuzzy.\n\nIf this is too vague, I\u0027ll try to remember more details.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T18:05:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 06:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam\\_Jones**\n  \nGrammar"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:13:09Z","Content":"It could help if you can remember the system you played this on?"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:15:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It could help if you can remember the system you played this on?\n\nIt was PC.
