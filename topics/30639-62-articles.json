Now I know, the atmoshperic delta-v game is all about momentum, not speed. The more momentum you can carry the less power you need to accelerate. Because of the effect of drag, you need to put on vertical momentum in the opening section of your ascent profile. Then, when your turbos hit maximum efficiency(25km) you need to add on your horizontal momentum. If you cruise up to 32km at which point you get up to speed, it means that you have no vertical momentum and all your weight saving efforts go to pot when you have to light your rockets to hop out into space, or push fast enough to get your apogee high enough to overcome remaining drag and gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that. if your payload fraction is small, you should not be firing up your rockets until you are well into space anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatNoob","CreatedById":59238,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T20:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI want to show my SSTO rocket-thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/4RA2c\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/4RA2c\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA crew shuttle bus for getting crew to the station\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KissSh0t","CreatedById":57142,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T21:35:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ThatNoob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ThatNoob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI want to show my SSTO rocket-thing.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/4RA2c\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/4RA2c\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA crew shuttle bus for getting crew to the station\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust adding it so images show in the thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1tVP2lc.png\u0022 alt=\u00221tVP2lc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FZTLhrC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FZTLhrC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0XxZ5fv.png\u0022 alt=\u00220XxZ5fv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DY94Fly.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DY94Fly.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oEzzmcc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oEzzmcc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E: \u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T21:52:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spartwo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spartwo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell yes getting your speed up in the atmosphere will be more efficient,but worth it?.When you have the option of 5-10 minutes less flight time,ease of use,and increased range when refueled in exchange for 15% less mass and increased atmospheric abilities which would you choose?.Of course that\u0027s entirely dependant on your playing style which is individual to each player.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you had twice the climb rate, yes, you would save 5 minutes on the climb, and it sure makes for a more fun handling on low atmosphere, feels much more sporty.

The total mass of their turbojets is about 15% of the launch mass or 25% of the dry mass of the ship, including payload. With enough lift, you can probably remove half of the engines and the associated fuel tanks, increasing the payload fraction by a few percentage points (from around 30% to 30-35%). The ship would have less engines than the \u00221 turbojet per 10 tonnes\u0022 guideline many people suggest, but it would not be too underpowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two important effects of lift during the acceleration: you lose less thrust to fighting gravity, and your intakes work a bit better. This essentially allows you to maintain a higher climb rate during the acceleration. With intake-to-engine ratio 1, the difference isn\u0027t too significant, because you are still operating very close to the speeds where re-entry flames start showing up. If you climb too fast, you don\u0027t gain enough speed to keep the turbojets running, and the flameout will occur many kilometeres lower at speeds that are several hundred m/s less. You also can\u0027t dive down for the final ascent maneuver, because that\u0027s a sure way to kill your speed. Overall, winged planes may need a bit less fuel for the rocket stage to reach the orbit, but the difference means at most a percentage point or two higher payload fraction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on this, I would say that the difference between the payload fractions of wingless SSTOs and spaceplanes with intake-to-engine ratio 1 is at most 5 percentage points. The actual numbers are something like 30% vs. 35% for relatively unoptimized designs, and probably a bit higher for optimized ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith more intakes, you can accelerate at higher altitudes, where you don\u0027t have to constantly balance between ridiculous drag and early engine flameout. This gives you more room to maneuver, and allows having significantly less fuel for the rocket stage.
