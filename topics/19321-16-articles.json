I have actually got a working variable incidence wing, but just moving fuel using TAC fuel balancer is a more sane idea. Just add a tank or two towards the front of the plane you can empty \u0026amp; fill on demand, if your TWR is low enough that you need to retrim that much then it\u0027ll have burned enough off to make a difference by 10km alt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T07:31:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eferram4: thanks.
