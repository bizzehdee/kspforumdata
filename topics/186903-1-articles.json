One of them (I think Kerbalism) probably did something about the science being transfered through antenas. Now whenever I have a set of science instruments and an antenna, the sound of science being transfered via comm net plays non stop. Its really annoying, specially now that i\u0027m seting up a space station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t got the patience to actually seek out the root cause of this.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe simple solution would be to delete the file responsible for the sound altogether.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it possible? Would it cause crashes or even krakens?
