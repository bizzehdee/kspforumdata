I\u0027ll definitely have a go at that once I finish a couple more parts.\u003Cp\u003EAlso I hope you don\u0027t mind me changing the geometry a bit on certain things. On most of these I have to redo them completely, because of export derps, and on others they\u0027re just a tad bit inaccurate in terms of size, so I feel that I need to fix that. You don\u0027t have to use what you don\u0027t want.

I also added more detail to the inside of the cap, as you can see in the picture. I\u0027m hoping to turn the geometry down a bit more before I start texturing this, and I also need to do the parachutes and whatnot, which are going to be hard for me since i\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m going to have to edit the part config.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat docking port looks great!

I\u0027ve \u0022fixed\u0022 this locally by changing their module type to Part from what they were. I don\u0027t think the LM ascent module itself is fixable in that regard because of the way it works as both an engine and a pod. However, I do suggest lowering the roll force on it to 5 from 25. It\u0027s a bit crazy to control \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this isn\u0027t a gripe so much as a \u0022Hey I found a bug.\u0022 There\u0027s this strange white blob that follows the LM ascent module around and can only been seen from a certain angle. It appears seemingly randomly in-flight and flies into the distance as a static object, but appears to be \u0022attached\u0022 to the LM. It can be seen as a static either on the pad (as seen in the screenshot) or during timewarp. I don\u0027t know crap about modelling otherwise I\u0027d probably tell you what it actually was.
