This mod also features a lot of small but beautiful 0.625m parts and is worth looking at if you like building small or on a budget.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also the nano-sat from Knes which has a built-in decoupler and is otherwise pretty similar to the Luciole cubesat in size and function. It also gives you the solar panels as a separate part for the times when you need a teeny tiny amount of extra power. Knes is basically the European counterpart to BDB/Tantares as it replicates many of the past and present European rockets, so it\u0027s quite parts heavy, but you can delete parts if you don\u0027t want them and just keep those you do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SSR micro-sat is the next smallest I can think of and has a nicely rounded set of parts- direct and relay antennae, solar panels, battery, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E and both chemical and ion propulsion systems. It also has a nice little tie-in with Near Future Electrical where you get a tiny capacitor, and a tie-in with Near Future Propulsion where you get a little argon tank to match the xenon one. The only thing it doesn\u0027t have is an adapter from the 0.35m size to the standard 0.625m \u0027small\u0027 size; it has one between the octagonal ion fuel tanks and the other square parts though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOctoSat is also worth a mention, it\u0027s a very modular way to build octagonal satellites with a diverse range of parts. Fairly low mass, a selection of propulsion systems and very configurable fuel tanks make it a good option for making compact probes and has an adapter to mount it on a 1.25m stack; a bit bigger than the others but still smaller and more capable than building something similar out of stock parts. They unlock late in the tech tree though and can result in fairly high part counts due to its modularity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is not strictly on topic as it\u0027s not about cube sats but probes in a more general sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor something a bit bigger, ProbesPlus gives you a lot of good parts at low prices (in career mode) which are designed to replicate real spacecraft like Voyager, Venera and Cassini-Huygens among others. It also includes new science parts and some engines/service modules and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E systems too. They are quite large though so definitely not \u0022cube sats\u0022, although the Barquetta is slightly smaller than the stock QBE and has built-in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E so that\u0027s a good one to pick for small probes and relays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther mods that are good for probes include: Near Future Exploration, which adds a lot of useful parts and a novel range boosting system for comms parts, but is designed to look like other Near Future parts and Restock (all made by the same person) so doesn\u0027t fit in so well with the regular stock parts; RLA Reborn, which adds a number of probe-related parts plus some bigger ones and which fits right in with the stock art style (but not the Restock style); and Restock\u002B which is an optional extra for Restock that adds extra parts to plug some gaps in the stock parts lineup- a full set of Oscar fuel tanks, mini \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.
