I\u0027m not even sure the Gilly miner did cross, one of the ships did go through Mun\u0027s SOI but I think it was the Evestation. As best as I can recall it was pretty far out, I was intending to miss the Mun entirely and was not happy when it intersected--I had been doing periapsis pumps due to the station\u0027s low TWR (single nuke, heavy ship) and after several iterations was finally ready--just as Mun moved in the way. Did the best radial burn I could to avoid getting pulled off course entirely. \n\nAnyway, then I went over to Hummlebee for a while and worked on the Ike landings. By the time I was done with that, all the Eve ships had cleared Kerbin SOI. The Gilly miner happened to be the first one I looked at, and it had NaN readings similar to (but I cannot swear identical to) the composite picture above.

I have Kerbal Alarm Clock set to create SOI-change alarms automatically 5 minutes prior, so I personally walk each ship across the boundary instead of letting nature take its course. I find this a bit safer in reducing the number of Kraken attacks and limiting the damage to the 1 doomed ship. Once the Hell Kraken attacks, the whole game\u0027s display is hosed as long as you keep running it so I just immediately exit the game.
