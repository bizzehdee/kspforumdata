But is it just impossible to get the game to consider those tanks linked fully at both front and back? At first, it claimed the engines had no fuel, because it couldn\u0027t seem to find a path from engines through docking rings to tanks. I fixed that by telling it to undock the front docking ring on each orange tank, which seemd to force the software to consider the lower docking ring the prime one, meaning the engines were able to trace a path to fuel through the orange tanks. And as I understand it, the next time the game loads that ship, it should consider docking rings that are touching to be liked, right? So I exited the game and started it up again.

Fuel should flow from the upper orange core to the lower orange core because they\u0027re directly connected, then through the fuel lines to the upper whites, then vertically through the docking links to the side oranges and side whites, and then straight into the engines.

I feel that it sort of takes away from the game, as some of the parts packs are so massive that I found myself not actually using the stock engines and fuel tanks. I felt that if I wanted to do anything, then I could do it with the stock parts, as that\u0027s what they were designed to do. I even found myself struggling to make even a Munar transfer without the aid of MechJeb and the powerful rockets. However, mods such as ISA MapSat, Kerbal Engineer, and the Kethane pack add a new dimension to the game, while not feeling so \u0027cheaty\u0027 as adding more powerful engines. Kerbal Engineer is my absolute favourite, as I\u0027ve learned a lot about delta-v and TWR which has expanded my abilities greatly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I understand your hesitation to install mods, but be aware that there are mods out there that expand on one\u0027s experience in the game, rather than detract from it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ringer","CreatedById":47747,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T23:24:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe core and drive section have bi-couplers for that very reason.
