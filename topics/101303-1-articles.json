If you want a short travel time, you need a high energy transfer, which costs a lot of dV. If you want to plant a flag, you need to capture into orbit. If you have a high energy transfer and want to capture into orbit, you\u0027re going to have to brake hard, which costs a lot of dV. Gravity assists can save some of that dV, but they also cost extra time in return again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why IRL, the Dawn probe is such a big deal. It\u0027s not flying high energy transfers, but it is going around, orbiting one body, leaving, then reaching another body and orbiting that too. Two orbit missions in one. That\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eexpensive\u003C/em\u003E. RL spacecraft don\u0027t do such a thing, generally, precisely because it\u0027s so prohibitively costly in terms of dV. In Dawn\u0027s case, they\u0027re using solar electric propulsion. In your case, that\u0027s not a valid choice because there\u0027s no sunlight worth mentioning out there at poor Pluto. You could, however, use nuclear electric or nuclear thermal propulsion, provided you have the technology (and the necessary part mods).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have neither... well. You already mentioned New Horizons. Maybe you can not only throw your spacecraft on such a trajectory, but also the propulsion stage required to slow it back down at Pluto... of course, it would be a one-way trip for the Kerbal. Unless, perhaps, the propulsion stage could be undocked and a fresh one docked in Pluto orbit. You\u0027d have to throw the fresh one onto the same trajectory, along with a third one to slow \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E back down at Pluto...
