If you want a short travel time, you need a high energy transfer, which costs a lot of dV. If you want to plant a flag, you need to capture into orbit. If you have a high energy transfer and want to capture into orbit, you\u0027re going to have to brake hard, which costs a lot of dV. Gravity assists can save some of that dV, but they also cost extra time in return again.\n\nThis is why IRL, the Dawn probe is such a big deal. It\u0027s not flying high energy transfers, but it is going around, orbiting one body, leaving, then reaching another body and orbiting that too. Two orbit missions in one. That\u0027s *expensive*. RL spacecraft don\u0027t do such a thing, generally, precisely because it\u0027s so prohibitively costly in terms of dV. In Dawn\u0027s case, they\u0027re using solar electric propulsion. In your case, that\u0027s not a valid choice because there\u0027s no sunlight worth mentioning out there at poor Pluto. You could, however, use nuclear electric or nuclear thermal propulsion, provided you have the technology (and the necessary part mods).\n\nIf you have neither... well. You already mentioned New Horizons. Maybe you can not only throw your spacecraft on such a trajectory, but also the propulsion stage required to slow it back down at Pluto... of course, it would be a one-way trip for the Kerbal. Unless, perhaps, the propulsion stage could be undocked and a fresh one docked in Pluto orbit. You\u0027d have to throw the fresh one onto the same trajectory, along with a third one to slow *that* back down at Pluto... That\u0027s the Tyranny of the Rocket Equation for you."},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T22:40:51Z","Content":"It might be possible to shorten the trip time by initially launching on a Solar escape trajectory, and then doing a flyby of Neptune and/or Uranus to slow down to an elliptical transfer orbit (or you could even aerobrake!).

I don\u0027t think the two bodies\u0027 respective orbits are very conducive to such a transfer either; your solar orbit during the transfer to Uranus will be too eccentric to get a useful reduction in svelocity. Uranus\u0027 orbit will be almost perpendicular to your direction of travel, whereas you want to be travelling parallel to its orbit to reduce your velocity (and to achieve that would take an insane amount of time or delta-V).\n\nUsing a Earth-Venus-Jupiter-Low Solar-Pluto set of Hohmann transfers, meeting Jupiter at the Pluto-Jupiter AN/DN to use Jupiter\u0027s gravity to perform your inclination change, and meeting Pluto at Periapsis, you could get there in maybe 35-40 years and your circularisation burn around pluto would cost around 6-7 km/s (Disclaimer: That was a complete back of a napkin calculation and I accept no liability for its potential inaccuracy).\n\nI\u0027m not prepared to give a predicted DV cost of the entire trip, but you would be able to save a lot of DV with the suggested gravity assits.\n\nIt also would require a near miraculous aligning of the planets and execution of the transfers. Any minor blip in your Sun-Pluto transfer could cost you years.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T23:08:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rusty6899**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T14:18:04Z","Content":"Well really you\u0027re going to have to pick.
