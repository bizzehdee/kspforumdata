After this disclaimer to the point...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany (most of them in fact) mods on the spaceport are not properly tagged. People seem to just select all the subcategories no matter what they release. This makes searching the SpacePort a fair bit of a pain and not fun at all. Whatever the cause of this, be it people trying to get more attention for they stuff or maybe the upload interface being somewhat unwieldy, i think an effort should be made to introduce and maintain a clear policy on this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for a demonstration, say i want to get me a fancy new engine. So i go to the spaceport and click on \u0022Propulsion\u0022. As of this moment from the 9 entries on the first page, only one (Draktec Vtol) is clearly an engine (maybe 2: WT-51 seems to be a complete custom craft and might contain engine parts). The other 7 have nothing to do with propulsion at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i would like to appeal to the modders out there to please tag they stuff appropriately. Also maybe admin action is called for, in setting and perhaps enforcing some rules.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T18:35:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe know, we\u0027re going to be changing how that system works in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
