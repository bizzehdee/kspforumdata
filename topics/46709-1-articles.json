I always test my landers before I bring them out to interplanetary space so I don\u0027t end up with stranded Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I tested my Tylo lander by bringing it into Kerbin orbit without any launch stage below it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m trying to think of a way to test an Eve lander. Obviously it has to get into Kerbin orbit, but it needs far more delta-v than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had two ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. strap parachutes to the bottom, deploy them low to the ground, then continue getting into orbit \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. purposely make an extremely inefficient gravity turn at something like 1km, or maybe even 500 meters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T21:54:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you could use hyperedit to put you in orbit around Eve, then land it like usual.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moar Boosters","CreatedById":79218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T22:53:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEve has almost double the gravity of Kerbin, so you wanna test your ship\u0027s thrust/weight ratio by seeing if it can get airborne on kerbin using 50% throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume it\u0027s got some sort of complicated asparagus staging? You could try using action groups to disable the engines and the drop fuel tanks early. If it takes around 4500 to orbit kerbin and 12500 to orbit eve, you should drop them when they\u0027re still about 60% full, using half thrust the whole way, and see if you can orbit kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
