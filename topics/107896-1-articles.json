Once set up you can upload the ship which is currently loaded in your editor with one click. Downloading a ship is equally simple, just select it in the list and click Load or Merge, which functions exactly like the Load and Merge in the stock dialog to load a ship. The rest you can see on the screenshots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea originated when I was chatting with a friend of mine about our current inventions and I had to realize that there is no simpler method to share than to actually pass the .craft files around. The only thing that came close to what I had in mind was \u003Ca href=\u0022http://KerbalX.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://KerbalX.com\u003C/a\u003E but that also involved throwing around .craft files and I didn\u0027t like that. I wanted something faster and more lightweight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn its current state I can\u0027t host a public server for everyone to test this mod, because I have not implemented any security whatsoever. Right now the server functions like a folder with read/write permissions for everyone, i.e. everyone can upload, download and even delete everything without any authentication. I could add stuff like that, of course, but the purpose I originally had in mind was sharing inventions with my friends only, and I trust these people to not delete everything and upload manipulated ships which will make my computer explode. Trusting random people on the internet is a different story though. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would really like to hear feedback what you guys think about this project and especially if you think it is worth it to add more features and possibly get it to state where a public server is feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA download of both the server and client source will be available as soon as I get it on GitHub.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EUpdate\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI renamed the project to KerbalCraft and the source is now available on GitHub: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/JcBernack/KerbalCraft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/JcBernack/KerbalCraft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does not look very different on the surface but the rest is almost totally new.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe server is now able to parse the uploaded craft files and fill in some information automatically, like name, type, size, part count, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ingame GUI now uses asynchronous requests which will stop the UI from hanging while a request is pending and the window is now available from all scenes of the game, not only the editors. Outside the editors you can only view the list, to load or share a ship you must enter an editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course fixed more bugs than I can count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last thing missing before I could think about a public server is some kind of authentication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just don\u0027t want everyone to be able to delete all the ships on the server or upload crappy ships with my name. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/4v6NE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
