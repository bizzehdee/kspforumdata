Once set up you can upload the ship which is currently loaded in your editor with one click. Downloading a ship is equally simple, just select it in the list and click Load or Merge, which functions exactly like the Load and Merge in the stock dialog to load a ship. The rest you can see on the screenshots.\n\nThe idea originated when I was chatting with a friend of mine about our current inventions and I had to realize that there is no simpler method to share than to actually pass the .craft files around. The only thing that came close to what I had in mind was [http://KerbalX.com](http://KerbalX.com) but that also involved throwing around .craft files and I didn\u0027t like that. I wanted something faster and more lightweight.\n\nIn its current state I can\u0027t host a public server for everyone to test this mod, because I have not implemented any security whatsoever. Right now the server functions like a folder with read/write permissions for everyone, i.e. everyone can upload, download and even delete everything without any authentication. I could add stuff like that, of course, but the purpose I originally had in mind was sharing inventions with my friends only, and I trust these people to not delete everything and upload manipulated ships which will make my computer explode. Trusting random people on the internet is a different story though. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI would really like to hear feedback what you guys think about this project and especially if you think it is worth it to add more features and possibly get it to state where a public server is feasible.\n\nA download of both the server and client source will be available as soon as I get it on GitHub.\n\nUpdate\n\nI renamed the project to KerbalCraft and the source is now available on GitHub: [https://github.com/JcBernack/KerbalCraft](https://github.com/JcBernack/KerbalCraft)\n\nIt does not look very different on the surface but the rest is almost totally new.\n\nThe server is now able to parse the uploaded craft files and fill in some information automatically, like name, type, size, part count, etc.\n\nThe ingame GUI now uses asynchronous requests which will stop the UI from hanging while a request is pending and the window is now available from all scenes of the game, not only the editors. Outside the editors you can only view the list, to load or share a ship you must enter an editor.\n\nAnd of course fixed more bugs than I can count.\n\nThe last thing missing before I could think about a public server is some kind of authentication.\n\nI just don\u0027t want everyone to be able to delete all the ships on the server or upload crappy ships with my name. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
