Some kerbals think the only way to buy enough time is to freeze the new Kerm seeds until we have enough soil to plant them.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;other kerbals think this is wrong.

Truck after bright yellow truck rumbled past on heavy winter tyres, doors and roofs emblazoned with a Kerm leaf cluster in a circle of woven vines - the international symbol of disaster relief assistance used by all the Regionalities of Kerbin.\u00A0Four aircraft circled high overhead, dark shapes against a crisp blue sky, flying a slowly shifting racetrack pattern, that kept them within spotting distance of the convoy. Three of the aircraft kept a loose wedge formation, their lone companion watching them from above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRecommend we come round another five degrees, boss and pull in the northbound leg of the loop.

Leave the thinking to those that can do it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey - I was just saying!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI got an inbound here, boss,\u201D Ferl announced, \u201CMaybe a couple - hard to tell at this range.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal snapped to attention. \u201CDirection?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBearing eighty-five relative.

Keep it together, Vanguard - we\u2019re on the right side of the border and we\u2019re here with a medical aid convoy. No need to get rattled.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal swallowed hard. \u201CCopy, boss. No need to get rattled.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly a new voice crackled out from all four Vanguard radio receivers.\u003Cem\u003E\u201DHostile aircraft, this is Firesvarn Airborne Defence Force. You are in violation of Firesvar regionality airspace. Acknowledge message and return to your nearest airfield.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal keyed her microphone. \u201CFiresvarn Airborne Defence Force, this is Commander Valentina Kerman, Vanguard patrol, Kolan border security.

Maps have changed.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne Firesvarn pilot waggled his wings, then abruptly peeled away from his commander, swinging wide then rolling level, lining up on the Kolan planes. Both pilots flipped back a cover on their control sticks, gloved thumbs reaching for the buttons underneath. Four under-wing pylons sprang open, releasing four slim tubular shapes studded with stabilising fins.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree solid rocket motors ignited with a roar. A jammed steering vane sent one missile corkscrewing wildly through the sky. Seconds later, onboard sensors tripped a switch and the out-of-control rocket tore itself apart in mid-air. A fourth missile failed to start and tumbled away harmlessly towards the ground whilst high overhead two smoke trails lanced through the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerl\u2019s threat warning systems shrieked in his ear. His eyes snapped to his radar screen, widening at the two clear returns still several kilometres distant. \u201CInbound! Break, break, break!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstinctively, Val rolled inverted, hauling back on her control stick and throttle and sending her Cloudrunner into a screaming dive. The g-forces crushed her into her seat, canopy and cockpit instruments blurring at the edges of her vision. The pursuing missile wavered for instant, its target\u2019s sudden change in direction momentarily confusing it\u2019s sensors. Then it steadied, target reacquired, nose pulling round and down to intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSpeak to me Ferl! What we got?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI got nothing! Got a heat return then nothing! Inbounds are still way out of range!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal pulled out of her dive, jinking hard left then right, head twisting in all directions. \u201CCal, Gil - you see anything?\u201DA roar of static and an abruptly cut-off scream drowned out Cal\u2019s reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026oh Kerm-oh-Kerm-oh-Kerm! Gil\u2019s down - no chute! No chute!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal\u2019s stomach turned to ice. \u003Cem\u003EKeep moving, keep moving\u2026\u003C/em\u003E She slammed her aircraft into another turn, a quicksilver bright something in the distance flashing past the corner of her canopy and out of sight. \u201CSomething on my tail! You reading anything, Ferl?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNegative, boss! No emissions, no returns, no visuals!\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy. Both of you - hard moves. Whatever it is - keep it off your back!\u201D \u003Cem\u003ENo emissions\u2026no emissions.\u003C/em\u003E Behind her oxygen mask, Val\u2019s eyes widened in sudden understanding. Instinctively she wrenched her throttle back to idle power and pulled her aircraft\u2019s nose up into a zoom climb. The Cloudrunner reared skywards, rapidly shedding speed, teetering on the brink of a stall. Val\u2019s grip tightened on the throttle lever\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe missile wagged from side to side, seeker head trying to reacquire the heat source so abruptly whisked away from it. Milliseconds later, its guidance system concluded that the target was lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe detonation flared in Val\u2019s rear view mirrors. Fragments of white-hot steel whickered through the sky, shredding tailplanes and engine cowling alike. The Cloudrunner bucked wildly, tipping onto one wing and tumbling into a flat spin. Val took one look at the constellation of warning lights across her instrument panel, braced herself against her seat and pulled the ejection handle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cockpit canopy blasted clear and was promptly whipped away by the slipstream. A fraction of a second later the ejector seat fired, hurling Val free from her plummeting aircraft. The howling wind battered at her flight helmet, pinning her against the seat backrest, harness straps digging painfully into her flight suit. Automatic retractors whipped in the straps around her calves, tight enough to nearly cut off the circulation to her legs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next handful of seconds hurtled by in a blur of sharp, popping explosions, deafening wind, and gut-wrenching changes in direction and speed. Val clenched her teeth, not even daring to scream in case the next tooth-rattling jolt removed her tongue. Then it was all over. The seat fell away from under her, leaving her bruised, battered but alive; hanging against the sky, survival pack dangling from her waist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe impact drove the wind from her body. Jaw set against the pain flaring across her ribs, Val shrugged out of her harness and began to gather up her parachute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney closed the door to the Mission Control Centre and stood for a moment, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. Light streamed from the windows of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E 1, illuminating the lines of kerbals filing quietly into and out of the main doors. Across the Space Centre grounds the dark bulk of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E 2 and its machine shops blotted out the night sky, all construction work for\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EPioneer 7\u003C/em\u003E on hold although not, Geneney hoped, for long. He rubbed his eyes, yawned hugely and set off in search of a mug of \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLetting himself in through the side door, Geneney blinked at the closed canteen door and the light spilling out of the windows. The television was on, casting flickering shadows over the far wall. Curiously he peered through the nearest window, heart suddenly sinking at the sight of the lone figure staring at the screen, a drift of abandoned and, Geneney suspected, largely ignored papers scattered over the table in front of him. He closed his eyes for a moment then, squaring his shoulders, quietly pushed open the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u2026shot down whilst escorting a medical convoy. The surviving pilots report being fired on by guided rocket weapons although Wakiran and Kolan officials have not yet commented on the truth of those allegations. Statements from the ruling Councils of both Regionalities are condemning the attacks in the strongest possible terms\u2026\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEvening, Jeb.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb turned his head, staring listlessly back at him. \u201CGenie. You\u2019re up late.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney walked over to the kitchen cupboard and retrieved a mug and a sachet of \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E. \u201CJust off the late shift for Prospector 1,\u201D he replied, pouring boiling water into his mug. \u201CHabitation module\u2019s holding up well. You want a coffee?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shook his head. \u201CNot for me. Not getting much sleep as it is.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney sat down opposite him and took a cautious sip. \u201CI know that feeling,\u201D he said. \u201CI always need something to dilute the console coffee before bed too.\u201D He made a face at his mug. \u201CEven if it\u2019s just a djeng. The powdered stuff that Derny came up with seems to be keeping the crew happy though.\u201D He watched Jeb\u2019s face but his friend\u2019s expression didn\u2019t even flicker. \u201CAnyway - you\u2019re not exactly having an early night yourself?\u201D The question hung in mid-air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEarly or late - makes no difference,\u201D said Jeb. \u201CDoesn\u2019t help the sleeping.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney saw his eyes flick towards the television screen. \u201CDo you want to talk about it?\u201D he said gently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a second, a spark of defiance flared in Jeb\u2019s eyes but was quickly snuffed out. The veteran kerbonaut slumped in his chair, seeming to fold in on himself. Eventually he lifted his head, staring helplessly at his friend through hollowed-out eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201D Geneney said quietly. \u201CI just thought it might help is all.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think it might,\u201D said Jeb finally. He twisted his fingers together, leaning back in his chair. \u201CWish I knew how to start though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe beginning is always a good place,\u201D said Geneney.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shot him a miserable look. \u201CThis is going to sound stupid but I think that would be Pioneer 4. At the time I told myself I was just being an idiot - I was finally off to the M\u00FCn for Kerm\u2019s sake, something I\u2019d been dreaming of since the Institute. The thing is, Genie, even back then I knew Lodan had plans for us - and sitting out there on the pad just felt like we were waiting for the end.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded. \u201DAnd then seven days later\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt was all over,\u201D finished Jeb. \u201CYears of junkyard rocketry, shoestring budgets, deals, planning, building, flying and dreaming - done. Finished.\u201D The old Jeb danced briefly behind the hollowed-out eyes. \u201CWe sure went out in style though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn peace for Kerm and kerbal,\u201D murmured Geneney. Jeb\u2019s expression turned bitter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah. In peace for Kerm and kerbal. Except we didn\u2019t quite manage that little detail did we. The landing, Obrick\u2019s big speech. None of it made any difference.\u201D Jeb gestured at the television. \u201CWe got a war anyway - and every day it just keeps on getting worse. We built rockets to explore the universe, Genie. We never meant them to be used for shooting down planes or murdering each other.\u201D Jeb\u2019s eyes blazed. \u201CBut we did \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E just fine! We built a stupid, lashed together, \u003Cem\u003Escrapheap\u003C/em\u003E of a rocket trainer - and we let Ornie fly it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOh Kerm.\u003C/em\u003E \u201CThat wasn\u2019t your\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb rounded on him. \u201CWasn\u2019t my fault? It was \u003Cem\u003Eall \u003C/em\u003Emy fault! I was there first, Gene - I got to him first. And what did I do?\u201D Tears spilled from the corners of Jeb\u2019s eyes and he swiped them angrily away. \u201CNothing! That\u2019s what. Some kerbonaut. Some \u2018beacon of the kerbal spirit\u2019. A fraud who fell apart when he was needed most!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Geneney firmly. \u201CA friend who did the right thing. You didn\u2019t know how badly he was injured; moving him could have made things worse. There was nothing else you could have done, Jeb.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fire went out of Jeb\u2019s eyes. \u201CAnd that\u2019s the worst part,\u201D he said dully. \u201CDoesn\u2019t matter how often I tell myself exactly that - it doesn\u2019t help.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course it doesn\u2019t,\u201D said Geneney, \u201CWouldn\u2019t expect it to.\u201D He looked at Jeb sympathetically. \u201CIt sounds like a dreadful cliche, old friend but I think you need a holiday. Have a break, maybe go for those sailing lessons you always meant to take. Or we can set you up a workshop next to Roncott\u2019s. Somewhere you can just build stuff like in the old days. If you want something more constructive, there\u2019s no shortage of Pioneer parts you could start on. Take it easy - if a day doesn\u0027t feel like a working day then don\u0027t worry about it.\u201D He squeezed Jeb\u2019s shoulders. \u201CMost of all, if you ever need to talk, we\u0027re always here. Me, Bob, Bill, any of the gang.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb stood up, walked over to the television and switched it off. \u201CThanks, Genie, that\u2019s\u2026 good of you. He looked at Geneney hopefully. \u201CThink I\u2019ll have a \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E myself, stay up a while longer then try and get some sleep. Are you good for staying up a bit longer?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney forced a smile. \u201COf course. Like I said, Jeb - we\u2019re always here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalsy punched a code into the combination lock and opened the laboratory door. He flicked the lights on and stepped aside for the others to file in behind him. Gerselle looked around curiously, taking in the the rows of bottles on their shelves and the workbenches full of glassware, mysterious boxes and other, more complicated looking pieces of equipment. A pair of tall refrigerated cabinets stood against one wall, next to a rack of gas cylinders. A forest of tubing connected the cylinders to a long glass fronted cabinet that occupied most of another wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett pointed at the refrigerators. \u201CYou keep them in there?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin nodded. \u201CYes. We\u2019ve been collecting them for some time, mostly from Spierka and Forseti I believe although I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we have some from elsewhere. Discreetly of course - we don\u2019t advertise the facility for obvious reasons. Personally, I suspect the Veiidan diplomatic bag has carried more than one or two but naturally, we don\u2019t ask.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalsy walked over to one of the refrigerators and opened it. Gerselle caught a glimpse of shelves and what looked like thick glass spheres. Halsy lifted one of them onto a nearby bench before quickly closing the refrigerator door again. Close to, Gerselle saw that the sphere was actually two flattened half spheres clipped together along a thickened rim and topped with a glass tap. Inside, a Kerm seed rested on a metal grille.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVacuum desiccators,\u201D Erlin explained. \u201CWe use them for drying out samples in the lab but with a couple of modifications they work well for storing Kerm seeds. The seeds themselves are pretty robust - the hard part was working out the right combination of temperature, humidity and atmosphere to preserve their fibrous coating. We can\u2019t keep them under vacuum of course - which is why the desiccators are clipped shut instead.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett squatted down and peered at the seed. \u201CNitrogen?\u201D she asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMostly,\u201D Halsy answered. \u201CWith some carbon dioxide and just a trace of hydrogen sulphide. We found that the fibres got too badly damaged if we cooled them down to normal seed storage temperatures, so we use a higher storage temperature along with hydrogen sulphide to lower their metabolism.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle frowned. \u201CThat must have taken a lot of experimenting to work out,\u201D she said. \u201CHow did you\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalsy smiled. \u201CDon\u2019t worry,\u201D he said. \u201CEven in these desperate times we wouldn\u2019t experiment on live Kerm seeds. He led Gerselle over to the long cabinet. Inside Gerselle saw rack after rack of sealed flasks holding fragments of matted fibre in various states of decomposition. At the back of the cabinet, clusters of syringes hung from clamps, each of them connected to one or more taps by a thin rubber tube. Another bundle of tubes connected the flasks to a larger, insulated pipe protruding from the cabinet wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is just a mockup of course,\u201D said Halsy, \u201Cbut we thought you - and Elton - would be interested in seeing how we ran the experiments. All the flasks are nitrogen cooled with a water jacket to stop them getting too cold. That bunch of syringes all connect through to these gas cylinders here, letting us inject whichever mix of gases we like into a flask. As for the tissue samples\u2026\u201D Halsy bowed his head. \u201CWe recovered them from the Blight, or rather our colleagues at the Accident Investigation Department did.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle looked at Gusemy who gave her a grim look in reply. \u201CWe did,\u201D he said quietly. \u201CJust after the first villages were Blighted, I had Erlin do some research in the Berelgan archives. It quickly became clear to both of us that long term storage of Kerm seeds would be needed before the end of the Seeding, to give us enough time to find a solution to the crisis. The Department began an urgent search of any new Blighted areas for seed fragments. At the same time we began construction of a storage facility on the Spierkan coast. As soon as Erlin\u2019s team had a reliable storage protocol we began saving seeds. We thought they would be safe there.\u201D Gusemy\u2019s expression darkened. \u201CWe were wrong.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin sighed. \u201CWe were.\u201D He shook his head. \u201CBut hopefully this planting will begin to change that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf the Kerm survives,\u201D said Gerselle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin bowed his head in acknowledgement. \u201CIndeed.\u201D He picked up the desiccator with both hands, holding it carefully level. \u201CShall we?\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone nodded. Halsy picked up a large, round-bottomed flask and filled it with water. He followed the others out of the laboratory, switching off the lights and locking the door behind him. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe drive out to the planting site was sombre, each kerbal lost in his or her thoughts, not even commenting on the newly completed Dunan agronomy complex. Erlin stared at the Kerm seed in his hands, Halsy cradled the flask of water in his. Sitting in the front with the driver, Gerselle was surprised to see a sizeable crowd of Berelgan staff waiting for them by the side of the road.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as the van stopped, two kerbals stepped forward to open the doors. Obrett and Gusemy climbed out first, then helped Erlin and Halsy out. By the time Gerselle joined them, the crowd were\u00A0 forming up into two lines to let them through, Erlin and Halsy in the lead. As they set out across the field, the two lines merged into a solemn procession behind them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe planting site was marked by a single spade thrust into the earth. Gerselle pulled it out with a grunt of effort and set to work digging a shallow trench, measuring its depth against the spade handle. Satisfied, she stepped back and watched Erlin step forward. He knelt, placing the desiccator on the ground beside him. The crowd held its breath as he opened it and lifted out the fibre-swathed Kerm seed. Working quickly, he placed it in the trench, packing earth around and over it before tamping it down with his spade. He stood, accepting the flask of water from Halsy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin paused, gazing round at the crowd, one hand hidden behind his back. Then he solemnly up-ended the flask over the patch of fresh earth. Silently, Gerselle watched him uncross his fingers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2922499\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E Chapter 72\u003C/a\u003E: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022text-align:left;text-transform:none;text-indent:0px;letter-spacing:normal;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:underline;word-spacing:0px;white-space:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2977868\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 74\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-01T14:43:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2020 02:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-05T21:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, yay!

So an\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eolia-Kerm \u003C/em\u003Eis an attacker of the Kerm, conversely a \u003Cem\u003EKerm-olia \u003C/em\u003E(or\u00A0kermol\u00A0for short) isa defender or protector of the Kerm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpanding on this a little (fresh from the department of extemporaneous worldbuilding \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0), we can\u00A0examine the word bar-katon (or Barkton for short)\u00A0in more detail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EKat \u003C/em\u003Eis the noun for \u0027forest\u0027, \u003Cem\u003Ebar\u003C/em\u003E is a case marker that roughly translates to \u0027possession of\u0027 and \u003Cem\u003Eon\u003C/em\u003E is (yet another\u00A0marker) signifying dependence. So \u003Cem\u003Eon-kat \u003C/em\u003Esignifies some kind of dependence on the forest, whereas \u003Cem\u003Ekat-on \u003C/em\u003Esignifies independence from the same.\u00A0Thus, bar-katon (by convention only the first hyphen is included) translates to \u0027possessing an independence from the forest\u0027, or more simply \u0027freedom from the forest\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that one might equally well write \u003Cem\u003Eon-katbar\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0or literally\u00A0\u0027not possessing\u00A0a dependence on the forest.\u0027 Grammatically, that would be perfectly correct, although bar-katon is more emphatic. In English it would be the difference between \u0027CatastrophicFailure is not evil\u0027 and \u0027CatastrophicFailure is good\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-07T09:26:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2017 09:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-07T16:28:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u00A0This is some Tolkien-level linguistication right here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkOwl57","CreatedById":161624,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-07T17:31:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever before have I seen an author so involved in their story that they explain the language.....
