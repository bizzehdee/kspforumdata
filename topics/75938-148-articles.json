This feature is not yet ready for the public, or even the rest of the development team, but that will also include a number of configurable fields for just about everything that goes into the calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I share what the calculation looks like, so you can get a better idea of how to use these fields, I want to talk about the rather vague particle emission fields from above such as Energy vs. Emission. From what I have gathered from testing the various variables in the particleEmitter class is that Energy represents the apparent \u0022thickness\u0022 of the effect and Emission represents the maximum particles to produce per second (not real time, based on the time scale of the simulation which varies quite a bit sometimes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, using all of these fields to tune the dust can be a challenge when you have no idea how they are used.

This effectively clamps whatever the expression puts out to the values specified or calculated in the min/max parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this gives you all a better idea of how things are done right now.

It\u0027s awesome but is a bit hard to integrate with other components. The K\u0026amp;K colonization elements kinds of sort of fit the front and aft nodes. (as seen above) but I keep seeing screenshots of it being used with some sort of roll-cage cockpit. Is that something from a different mod or is it a beta item that hasn\u0027t been included in the library yet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did find one small bug, the rear attachment node is a tiny, tiny bit low. If you put a procedural tank in that spot that is fit to the port diameter, there is a small gap above and a small overlap at the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf work is still ongoing on this part, I would like to make a few feature requests:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - A separate version or a switchable variant that gets rid of the air intakes and instead uses those side lobes for a ton of reaction wheel control (say 200\u002B). It\u0027s always tricky to maintain fore/aft balance when using vertical thrusters. (in this case, a pair of the K\u0026amp;K colony thrusters) Even if it\u0027s balanced in the VAB, things can get out of wack pretty fast as the CoG moves with fuel usage. Having a lot of reaction wheel command authority really helps to counteract this but my rovers are now studded in reaction wheels and it looks kind of dumb. It doesn\u0027t have to have a visual change but if there were one, I was thinking that the side lobes would lose the yellow intake grids and gain a series of circular lumps along their length.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Fore/aft RCS ports! 0-G maneuvering requires adding some fore/aft thrusters and doing so tends to mess up the cool lines of the body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - More powerful thrusters - given the mass of the rovers that get made with this part, 1 kN thrusters are a little wimpy. Maybe bump them up to 2? I went into the part definition and edited this and 2 seemed to be pretty good for maneuverability without being overpowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - At least one bottom node - making it simpler to attach this part radially onto rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Some sort of vertical bipropellant (or NTR if I\u0027m wishing for a magic pony) thrusters that can be plugged into the fore/aft of the craft. Or if Santa comes early this year, integrated into the main lander body? I\u0027m using the K\u0026amp;K \u0022Meerkat\u0022 thrusters right now and it works but it\u0027s really janky.
