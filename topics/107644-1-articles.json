So aerobraking during noon is convenient. Or if you aerobrake on the night side, you can align the solar panels into streamlined position using the sun and when the sun is blocked by Duna they will be they will be fixed in position relative to the spacecraft. Good luck on not seeing sunlight before aerobrake is over.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [...]Build a rover with a claw [...]drive up to your defunct mining rig and bump into it with the claw to \u0022dock\u0022.

It\u0027s useful when you\u0027re building something like a fuel truck as you can just drive it up to anything without worrying about precise alignment. It\u0027s not really what it\u0027s intended for, but then we don\u0027t currently have fuel hoses/power cables so it\u0027s the next best thing.\n\nBeware when using it on the surface though- if you claw-connect while focused on the vehicle without the claw, the planet surface can disappear and bad things usually happen ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T12:17:07Z","Content":"Yeah, the claw is a bit kraken-baity in general, the the connection is less rigid than proper docking ports.
