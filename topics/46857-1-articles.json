That could be one source of the problem, as unbalanced thrusters can make it difficult to maneuver your ship. Additionally, if it\u0027s taking you a long time to get into position, your position relative to your target is changing as you both orbit around Kerbin. You can tell this is happening if your relative velocity is zeroed out and you head in for docking, but by the time you get there, your target is rotated out of position. There\u0027s a few solutions to this problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Dock faster.
