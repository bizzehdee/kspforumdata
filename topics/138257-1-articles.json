I think it\u0027s a great way for Squad to broaden the scope of the game and reach a whole universe of gamers (and thus new potential customers) but at the same time, the limits of traditional console gaming also seem to possibly detract from one of KSP\u0027s biggest attractions: the essentially wide-open mod-ability of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, a recent blockbuster console hit, Bethesda\u0027s Fallout 4, has now broken the \u0022console barrier\u0022 by not only announcing official support for console mods, but also releasing a video yesterday\u00A0demonstrating how it will work in practice, and promising to start rolling out support as soon as the next few weeks. So my question is, do you think Squad should do so in a similar manner, and more importantly, will they?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd let me just say that with my main computer being a 5\u002B year old Mac but having the Xbone sitting five feet away, I\u0027m tempted to buy the console version simply to avoid buying a new game computer! If I could add a handful of \u0022must have\u0022 mods like KER or MJ, KAC and Chatterer, I\u0027d be able to play the vast majority of everything I\u0027ve ever done or wanted to do long-term in KSP. But at the same time, without access to such informational and planning mods (plus Chatterer for fun), KSP on a console would unfortunately remain just a novelty for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-27T15:13:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2016 03:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by LameLefty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos, clarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"teag2","CreatedById":119694,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T15:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe that Squad will do everything they can to allow mods on console.

I don\u0027t know if Squad stepped back and realized just how much mods make their game complete. Even something as simple as MJ or KER is probably on the vast majority of installs. Not even having a basic Delta V readout in vanilla install is going to drive a lot of people away from console version unless they have an easy way to get mods.

I mean Squad made it so you can get money back by recoverng spent boosters but made no easy way to do it. \u00A0the list goes on. Squad really needs to step back and think about integrating these features into a console edition, or KSP for console should be renamed KSP Lite, because let\u0027s face it the game has relied on the fantastic mod community to make a pretty barebones game into a feature complete game. I will never touch a vanilla install of ksp, it\u0027s just too shallow for me and has this weird duality of trying to be a realistic simulation and complete arcade game at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-29T07:30:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2016 07:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by jedensuscg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T10:58:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m curious about how practical this \u0027mods for consoles\u0027 business is.\u00A0 Normally a console game has to go through all sorts of approvals before it can be published.. will a mod have to undergo the same scrutiny and approval?\u00A0 Will this process and install be compatible with the GPL?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T16:00:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222547883\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138257\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461927522\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002296629\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Renegrade\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Renegrade said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m curious about how practical this \u0027mods for consoles\u0027 business is.\u00A0 Normally a console game has to go through all sorts of approvals before it can be published.. will a mod have to undergo the same scrutiny and approval?\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0 Will this process and install be compatible with the GPL?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood point - and for that matter, not all mods are licensed under the GPL; some use Creative Commons, I\u0027ve seen other mods using still other license schemes.
