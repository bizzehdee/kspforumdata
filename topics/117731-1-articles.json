If you have a SSTO, then that\u0027s probably not an issue. However I bring the point up in case it is ever an issue in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA perfect example of what I\u0027m talking about is the Apollo missions to the moon. Let\u0027s say you are on your way to the moon and your vehicle includes the CSM and LM. You want to calculate the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv remaining in your service module. Well, the CSM is 30 t with propellant and 12 t empty, the LM is 15 t, and the ISP is 314 s. So your calculation is easy, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv = 314*9.81*LN(45/27) = 1573 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut hold on a minute. You perform orbit insertion with the LM docked to the CSM, but all your other manuevers are performed without the LM. Your dry mass is not constant, it changes after you ditch the LM. The above calculation is rather meaningless because it doesn\u0027t provide the data you really want to know. But the above it what KER will tell you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing you have to do is calculate the amount of propellant burned during lunar orbit insertion. Let\u0027s say orbit insertion in 900 m/s. Therefore,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E900 = 314*9.81*LN(45/(45-m\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E = 11.4 t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore the amount of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv remaining in the CSM after the LM has been detached is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv = 314*9.81*LN(18.6/12) = 1350 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the total \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv that you\u0027re going to get out of the service propulsion system when you consider all the stagging is, 900\u002B1350 = 2250 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to be careful not to always take what KER tells you at face value. There are some calculations that the various tools in the game just can\u0027t give you because they can\u0027t anticipate what you plan to do. There are times when you\u0027re going to have to carefully think through each step of the mission and perform the calculations by hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T05:46:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 05:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
