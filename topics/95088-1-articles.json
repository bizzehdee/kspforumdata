In KSP terms, this is acheived by pushing something into the line of an engine\u0027s exhaust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor almost a year, there had been several designs of MAC Cannon in the RB thread, with Probe-Tek and DAEcorp leading the way. Zokesia, like most companies, preferred to stick with the known: heavy, complex guided missiles. The overall thought on MACs was that they were fuel-guzzling and couldn\u0027t penetrate armor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, no one in Zokesia Skunkworks had ever really put the theory to the test. In late December, with the recent design of the \u003Cem\u003EVictory\u003C/em\u003E class Cruiser, a team of engineers saw the strong body and wondered if they could put a MAC cannon on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3A1Zs7J.png\u0022 alt=\u00223A1Zs7J.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe leader of the project, Koodman Kerman, wrestled with the administrators and budget hawks for weeks, before he was given a big break - the structural fatigue test hull of the \u003Cem\u003EVictory\u003C/em\u003E. Koodman and his engineers got to work right away. The barrel mounts were taken off, and two LVT-30s as the MAC weapons. They stripped off two of the propulsion engines and replaced them LVT-30s as the kickpack dampening engines. Then they grabbed a huge tin box and threw it around the engine, and began strapping MAC rounds to it. The first test of the craft was launched on a Cira IV, into Low Munar Orbit to test the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HCMwbeJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HCMwbeJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight away, there were problems. The rounds were packed in in such a way that, even though 16 were carried, 8 of them clipped with each other, and so half of the shots were completely off track. But the MAC itself worked, and a repair shuttle was sent up to rearm the gun and refuel the ship. The second round of tests proved it worked; the rounds left the barrel at 200 m/s and consistiently in the same direction. The unnamed \u003Cem\u003EVictory \u003C/em\u003EMAC was left in orbit to be resupplied for further tests, but for now her purpose was completed. Now, they could move on to a more powerful version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003EVictory \u003C/em\u003Ewas built as a replacement for the aging Drek XXVII in the Cruiser role, but Koodman saw life in it yet as a MAC destroyer. He also needed it to keep his project alive; he still needed to prove to High Command the concept was effective against armor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new ship was similar to the Victory in general design. Major differences were the increase in shots to 32 and a large Mainsail engine on either end. In the front they added a gun guard of 8 landing legs, in order to cover the gun when it wasn\u0027t firing. When the gear was open, the ship looked like a big crossbow, and the previously unnamed group dubbed themselves \u0022Project Crossbow.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/homawHT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022homawHT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitial tests proved disappointing - half of the projectiles would launch at 200 m/s, and the MAC ran out of fuel way too fast. They went back and took off the first 16 projectiles, and they found the ones closer to the engine would launch at 400 m/s, so they left them and shortened the barrel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TGyVEWi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TGyVEWi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now, they had to prove their design; they were almost out of money. Koodman set up a meeting with one of High Command\u0027s admirals to observe a life fire test against a captured MX-3 Ingressor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe modefied XXVII, now called the \u003Cem\u003EZNS Crossbow\u003C/em\u003E, was launched and soon moved into firing position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yUKyBki.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yUKyBki.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETarget was in sight - the admiral was watching now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IEuKvv6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IEuKvv6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey opened up at 200m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jlRJGjJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jlRJGjJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....But it was a dismal failure. After 6 rounds, the MAC had used 25% of its fuel. 2 projectiles had missed outright; of the 4 that hit, only minor damage to the wing armor over the missiles was actually knocked off. The admiral was not impressed; no more funding went to Project Crossbow. A week later, the building the handful of engineers had used was closed, and they went their seperate ways. In an excerpt from a critic\u0027s final report in the Project, their failure was explained:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mass Accelerator Cannons and Feasibility: In Conclusion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mass Accelerator Cannons and Feasibility: In Conclusion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....MAC Cannons have always been an interesting pipe dream, but these tests only proved their uselessness. The craft were too big to aim them correctly; the projectiles themselves were lopsided, causing shots to be wildly inaccurate; the MACs Guzzled so much fuel they would surely strand their own ship with a single volley, and on top of it all, they do not penetrate thick armor like conventional missiles do. They are like fighting a tank with ceremonial swords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EZNS Crossbow\u003C/em\u003E was scrapped, and the unnamed \u003Cem\u003EVictoria \u003C/em\u003Eclass was abandoned in munar orbit. The project seemed to prove all the old wisdom - that MACs weren\u0027t going to cut it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrew123","CreatedById":46719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T04:15:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHehe.
