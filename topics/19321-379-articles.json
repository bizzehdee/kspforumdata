I tried for three hours to build something that would make sense, and it was all unstable, fiddly and more chore than it was fun. Then I deleted it and tried newSTOCK, but got bored again after three hours as its model of air seems to be filled with tiny invisible people that gently (actually not so gently) guides your plane to its destination.. So I went to bed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I downloaded it again. And spent about two hours properly learning to use the tools, and read up a bit more about plane forms and area rule etc. I then carefully built a boring plane (Mig 15 lookalike). It flew... Like a Mig 15. I then built a Mig 25 lookalike... Which flew like a Mig 25. I just now built something betweeen a TSR2 and an XB70... and it did a 1000m/s circumnavigation of kerbin at 18000m (59l liquid fuel remaining) with two AJE J58s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.
