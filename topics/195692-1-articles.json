Unfortunately, i cannot find such an option in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and i can\u0027t select any part of the rover on the launch pad because they are safely inside an aerodinamic fairing. it goes without saying that i cannot launch a rover, full of wheels and dangly bits, inside the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could add another probe core on the launcher, but it would be wasteful and, worse, inelegant. the only other solution i can conceive is to disassemble the rover and reassemble the forward-facing module first; i assume the game interprets the first command module you attach as the control point. but... let\u0027s just say that there are a lot of parts attached in peculiar ways that the editor had trouble recognizing, and then moved and aligned with extreme care. it would be very complicated to reassemble it correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nare there other ways for me to fix this issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003E1 the reason is, the command module is a cupola, so i can drive the rover from a first person perspective and feel like i\u0027m really there. but the cupola is made to see upwards, it needs to be angled down to have a good visibility of the ground.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-18T13:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you make one of those probe cores that faces the correct direction into the root part (using the reroot tool), that should do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, it really isn\u0027t\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0hard to zoom your camera inside a fairing to select a part and say \u0022control from here\u0022.
