While the most common fan reasoning is that all Kerbals are either clones or members of a very large extended family, I\u0027d like to offer the following alternative explanations, if only for giggles:\n\n**1) \u0022Kerman\u0022 is not actually a surname, but an honorific / means of address**\n\nMuch like how western societies use Mr./Mrs./Miss./Ms. and the Japanese use -san/-kun, it is possible that we humans are actually misinterpreting the suffix Kerman as a surname, when in fact the word could easily simply denote that a Kerbal is referring to another Kerbal, rather than a named animal/inanimate object.\n\nIn other words, \u0022Jebediah Kerman\u0022 refers to the badass Kerbalnaut, but \u0022Jebediah\u0022 on its own might refer to some random Kerbal\u0027s pet Kerdog or another random Kerbal\u0027s speedboat.\n\n**2) All Kerbal surnames are spelt as \u0022Kerman\u0022, but differ in pronunciation**\n\nTaking a page from Groot from *Guardians of the Galaxy*, perhaps Kerman is indeed still a surname shared by all Kerbals, but each Kerbal family uses pronounces their surname slightly differently from their neighbours - emphasis placed on different letters, different inflections, precisely-placed clicks between letters/syllables/vowels etc. Again, our human perception may prevent us from actually noticing these finer nuances.\n\nIn other words, Jeb\u0027s surname might be pronounced simply \u0022Ker-man\u0022, while Bob\u0027s might be pronounced \u0022Kay-R-Man\u0022, Bill\u0027s \u0022Keer-man\u0022 and Val\u0027s \u0022K-*click*-er-ma-un\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Fendleton","CreatedById":22867,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T21:33:46Z","Content":"Personally I\u0027d go for \u0027Kerman\u0027 being the honorific/title for the job.

What this would mean is that we actually identify them by their surname which traditionally was a thing in English speaking schools and the military (not sure about Spanish schools!). This reverse ordering of surname at the front is also done in other earth languages too.\n\nAs for why every kerbal is given the name Kerman, who knows? In one of my years at school in a class of thirty I had six James and seven Andrews in my class of thirty!
