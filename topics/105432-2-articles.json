Most of the issues I take with it are pretty marginal, oftimes even petty. It\u0027s my favorite KSP update yet, and that\u0027s saying something.\n\nI lost two pilots in my career game due to heatshields producing some kind of weird phantom force that veers them off course. I\u0027ve since found a workaround through modifying the related .cfg files, but given you can\u0027t play more than a few launches into career mode without rockets blowing up for reasons beyond your control, I\u0027d say even that alone is very close to being a showstopper, and not something that new players will have any idea how to resolve.\n\nThere are other issues as well of course, and ones that likely would have come out very quickly in testing, as they have today.\n\nAs I said above, I think this is likely the best release of KSP yet. Really like it, and if it wasn\u0027t called 1.0, I\u0027d be unlikely to object too strenuously. However, it definitely does have problems, and ones that even a moderate amount of testing would have quickly revealed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T00:53:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 12:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T00:51:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Don\u0027t get me wrong, there\u0027s some great stuff in here, and if it weren\u0027t called 1.0 it would likely be the best release yet.\n\nExactly!\n\nAll the 1.0 hype and the 1.0 expectations are fuel for disappointment.\n\nSo far I\u0027ve been reasonably happy.

I for one am just happy about the fairings because of their stellar looks and good functionality, despite their mass, which is greatly offset by the new practically no-drag atmosphere.
