If you want to have OP parts you can get there in a few minutes by editing .cfg files.

I was sticking to my guns because I\u0027d done the balancing based off of steel, however aluminum is much lighter than I realized. That would require some substantial .cfg rework. (argh) I really need to rework things anyway.... looking at it in detail now.
