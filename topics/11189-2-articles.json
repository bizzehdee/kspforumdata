Bob, are you alright?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob pointed out the window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Ya know, you don\\\u0027t usually see clouds in space. Especially green ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Shit, we can\\\u0027t maneuver in time. Brace for impact!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: With a cloud?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: With whatever is *venting* it! There\\\u0027s probably a loose oxygen tank in there somewhere!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill shut his eyes. When he opened them again, several seconds later, the mist was gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Well, that was trippy. It reminds me of this guy I know who grows the best...Wow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob was making a sound reminiscent of a balloon with a tiny leak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: What...oh.

But you can see the constellations...we must be, well, close to home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Did something happen to us, or did something happen to Kerbin? Look for landmarks--anything that could give us a clue where in the world we are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Looks like they got the extra long tour, eh?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: What?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: The passengers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Oh god, the passengers!

I\\\u0027ll try to fix the computer. Oh, and get Bob out from under his seat...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the better part of an hour, Jeb surveyed the barren, primeval world beneath them. Had they been catapulted to some distant place? Or had they traveled through time, and were now witnessing the birth--or the death--of Kerbin, their home world? A curious rock arch caught Jeb\\\u0027s eye, sticking up from the rim the large crater they were passing over, but like every other strange sight it only brought questions, not answers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone flinched as the Windows startup sound blared through the cockpit speakers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Okay, I think I\\\u0027ve got the computer fixed.

Our flight computer wasn\\\u0027t designed for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: We could point the plane at that big round thingy and fire the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Wait--what\\\u0027s that, off to the side? Is that the cloud that brought us here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Well, I dunno, call me racist but all green space clouds look the same to me. Uh, Bill? Rockets? Big round blue thingy?

No communication from satellites. Can\\\u0027t test star tracking until nightfall. Radar blank, terrain mapping nonfunctional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: No response from KSC. There\\\u0027s a weak signal, though, and I can make out some local rock and roll channels and somethin\\\u0027 aboot \u0027Iteration one-zero-whatever\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Local radio uses longer wavelengths and the plane has a special antenna for that. Unfortunately the transmitter is short-range only; we won\\\u0027t be able to raise KSC until we\\\u0027re right on top of them. Everything else--satellite communications, KPS positioning, radar--all use the microwave antennas, which must have been damaged during re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Or, ya know, I doubt the warranty covers green space clouds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Engines and control systems check out OK. Altimeter OK. Gyrocompass OK. We can fly by dead reckoning, but without knowing our position, it doesn\\\u0027t do us much good. Jeb, get the charts. Hopefully we\\\u0027ll be able to recognize landmarks this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: What about secondary airports?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: What if we-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Only as a last resort. KSC has the only functioning runway rated for spaceplanes, the rest are under construction. We\\\u0027ve already taken damage and navigation is shot; trying to land on a shorter runway would be suicide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Maybe they could clear a long stretch of highway?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Or better yet-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Uneven, risky, not something I\\\u0027d want to try either. Still, if we happen to fly over a big city, try to reach someone by radio. At least they might point us the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob sighed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: I doubt we\\\u0027ll reach anyone anytime soon. Of all the land on Kerbin we could have found, why did it have to be the middle of a featureless plain? We could be almost anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: I think I could, um, work out our coordinates by the clock and Kerbol\\\u0027s position in the sky. Assuming the clock is right, of course. Give me a couple-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill grabbed the mic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: This is your captain speaking.

We apologize for the inconvenience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe clicked the mic off again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: I need to go talk to the flight attendants and let them know what\\\u0027s going on. Hopefully they can help keep the passengers calm. If anyone asks, we\\\u0027re on our way to KSC and everything is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill left the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: And while we\\\u0027re busy finding our ass from a hole in the ground, let\\\u0027s have some rock and roll!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe tuned the radio and the cabin was filled with the fuzz guitar of Kerman Greenbaum\\\u0027s \u0027Spirit in the Sky\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: COULD YOU TURN THAT DOWN, PLEASE?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: WHAT?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: TURN IT DOWN NOW!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: NO, SORRY, I\\\u0027M NOT CLEARED FOR THAT ACTIVITY. YOU\\\u0027LL HAVE TO TAKE IT UP WITH COMMAND.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob cranked the dial down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Ya know, I\\\u0027m gonna to have to report you for that, eh?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: You *bleep*ing bastard, are you *trying* to screw this mission?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Hey, little guy, I\\\u0027m just kidding. And stressed. And frustrated. We\\\u0027re *home*, how can we be so lost?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: *sigh* ...Sorry. I think the stress is getting to me, too. I tried triangulating our position using the ship\\\u0027s clock, but no luck, so I figured it must have been reset when we lost the computer. Then I tried using my own watch, and it still didn\\\u0027t add up. I guess the radio was just the last straw. I was out of line. I...want to go home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: You and me both, kid. But chill and think about somethin\\\u0027 else for a while, ya know? Like--why does the plane have a FM radio, anyway--I thought they took out everything non-essential to save on weight? Think some engineer just needed his music fix?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Oh, no, FM is only a side effect. The low frequency radio is mainly for old-style air-to-air comms and... Jeb, you\\\u0027re a genius.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: I know. How?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: The low frequency radio is required safety equipment on all large aircraft, used for VOR and ILS in case of satellite outage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Come again?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: The old instrument landing systems. No one uses them anymore, but major airports still have to operate it. Why didn\\\u0027t I think of it earlier? We may not know where we are, but if we\\\u0027re on the same side of the planet as KSC we could ride its beam in like a homing missile!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Ride in like a homing missile... Mind if I write that down? I\\\u0027m going to use that line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Just try not to go kaboom at the end. Anyway, here in the chart book is KSC\\\u0027s frequency and I\\\u0027m locking it in now. Yes! It\\\u0027s weak, but it\\\u0027s there! We\\\u0027re going home!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WCglF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WCglF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe door opened and Bill stepped into the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: I felt the plane bank. Have we got our position?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Not exactly. Bob figured out how to lock on to KSC\\\u0027s beacon; we\\\u0027re riding it in like a homing missile!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Hopefully without the boom at the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: That\\\u0027s what-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Nice work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Thanks, it-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: So, do we have an ETA? I\\\u0027d like to have something to tell the passengers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Well, I didn\\\u0027t have much luck getting our location, as our clocks seem to be off and the beacon only gives us direction. I did some calculations on the signal strength, and time of day, terrain features, and the relative strength of stations from known locations-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Jeb, do you know?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Bob told me it\\\u0027d be aboot an hour, give or take. The autopilot\\\u0027s locked in and we could sleep through the rest of the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Thanks, Jeb. I\\\u0027ll go talk to the passengers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob whined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb spent the next half hour thinking about the flight\\\u0027s events. How could they have traveled to the Mun? How did they get back? Was it a natural phenomenon, something which defied everything he had been taught, or was it some sort of constructed gateway between worlds? What did it mean?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Bill returned, the plane had begun its long descent. This was, under normal circumstances, the most dangerous part of a flight. The huge plane had to descend nose-up, and the heat shield blocked view of the ground below. It was hard enough to trust the autopilot when they had the benefit of satellites and terrain maps; how much more with only a radio beam and barely functioning communications and radar? Jeb and Bob handled the the stress in their usual manner--Jebediah wore his trademark grin, while Bob was hunched in a fetal position in his chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/anYPa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022anYPa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Have we tried raising KSC?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Ten minutes ago. Some static, not much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: We should give it another go. Even with a broken antenna we should get some signal at this range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Kerbal Space Center, this is Pan Kerbal Flight 33. Do you copy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough the static, a distorted voice replied \u0027This is Kerbal Space Center, say again? Message not received.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill grabbed the mic. \u0027Kerbal Space Center, this is Pan Kerbal Flight 33. Our navigation system has been damaged. Please confirm our approach trajectory, over.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Negative, Flight 33. Our radar is not yet operational. We have a visual on your plane and you appear to be on a good approach, over.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tower helped walk them down through the last stages of descent. Finally, the autopilot leveled the craft out, the gear lowered, and they saw the familiar building of Kerbal Space Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Uh, Bill... where\\\u0027s the runway?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8rKb3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228rKb3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure enough, there was only a barely leveled dirt strip where the enormous KSC tarmac should have been.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Oh god...Autopilot off!

There\\\u0027s the map, there\\\u0027s the frequency, there\\\u0027s the radio. It checks out. Besides, they identified themselves as KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Um, I have a theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radio crackled to life again. \u0027What the hell are you kids flying?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Tower, please identify yourself.

Even if we could, who knows where it would send us next?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: At least we now know our location--so we can plot a course. The space plane runway at our KSC was already built in 3439, before the rest of the base; they used it for freight carriers. Assuming we can reach it, we can land, refuel, and plan how to get back to *our* Kerbin. And if we end up stuck here, we might even set the space program ahead a couple decades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Any port in a storm, then?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob and Jeb studied the charts, fuel consumption tables, and finally worked out a flight plan that would reach home just as fuel ran out.
