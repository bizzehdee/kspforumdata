Everything is as far forward as possible (including even the landing gear), but it can still be endo-ed.\n\u003E \n\u003E Two coping rules for flying this plane:\n\u003E \n\u003E [list type=decimal]\n\u003E \n\u003E [li]Don\\\u0027t push the angle of attack too hard, the the plane has a limited turning stability window. Keep ASAS on as much as possible (pulse off with F to maneuver). Watch the ASAS force in between adjustments - if it\\\u0027s moving the canards over 25%, you\\\u0027re about to \\\u0027spin out\\\u0027, so don\\\u0027t turn any harder until the plane\\\u0027s velocity catches up with wherever you\\\u0027re pointing. Use ASAS force as an indicator of how close you are to the dragon\\\u0027s tail.[/li]\n\u003E \n\u003E [li]Further, your angle of attack must always be nose-up. Never point the nose below your velocity vector (green circle) - if you really need to dive (like you just overshot KSC), roll inverted, then pull up. The only thing keeping the plane stable is the wings being slightly offset on the fuselage, so if the plane is pulling negative Gs, it\\\u0027s at risk of rolling out of control.\n\u003E \n\u003E [/li]\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Flight plan to orbit:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - [li]Turn ASAS on and takeoff full throttle. Pulse ASAS for your takeoff roll, which should be easy (since the gear are forward). Careful not to shear off the rockets.  \n\u003E [/li]  \n\u003E [li]  \n\u003E Once airborne, pick up a bit of speed then pulse ASAS and patiently rotate to an 80 degree climb. Don\\\u0027t rush it or it\\\u0027ll flip!  \n\u003E [/li]  \n\u003E [li]  \n\u003E Climb, monitoring engine performance.   \n\u003E [/li]  \n\u003E [li]  \n\u003E When engine intake force is at about 100/200 (At about 8000m), pulse ASAS to let the nose gently drop to about 30 degrees. Your speed should pick up, hopefully keeping the turbojet running at 60/60 flow.  \n\u003E [/li]  \n\u003E [li]  \n\u003E Adjust your nose-up to maintain a climb rate of about 10 m/s. When the turbojet can\\\u0027t accelerate any more, press space to activate the rockets.  \n\u003E [/li]  \n\u003E [li]  \n\u003E Pitch up to 90 degrees in as large increments as you dare, tapping ASAS off to pitch, and checking the ASAS force in between adjustments. Keep the ASAS force below 30% or you are asking for trouble!  \n\u003E [/li]  \n\u003E [li]  \n\u003E The turbojet should run out of fuel on its own. Continue climbing at 90 degrees orientation.  \n\u003E [/li]  \n\u003E [li]  \n\u003E When your periapsis is about 60,000m, pitch the nose down to the horizon. Never let off the throttle!  \n\u003E [/li]  \n\u003E [li]  \n\u003E Adjust your pitch to keep the periapsis about 10s in the future. Nose up to raise and delay your periapsis, nose to the horizon for efficiency. Your aim is to reach 2,300 m/s with your periapsis and apoapsis just over 70km.  \n\u003E [/li]  \n\u003E [li]  \n\u003E To return from 72km orbit, burn to put your periapsis at 45.3km over KSC. The plane can glide surprisingly far (thanks to the funky physics), but if you think your approach isn\\\u0027t perfect, fix it now!. Burn due north or south if your orbit is misinclined.  \n\u003E [/li]  \n\u003E [li]  \n\u003E Your periapsis should disappear as you pass over KerIndia at 43km. If you think you\\\u0027re coming up short, you should have spare fuel to boost up a bit. If you\\\u0027re coming in long, well, tough.  \n\u003E [/li]  \n\u003E [li]  \n\u003E Re-read post-it notes 1 and 2 before re-entry - the nose should be just above your green velocity vector before you pass 30,000m or you will be in tailspin land. Re-entry speeds make a lot of lift and the center of gravity is as far aft as it\\\u0027ll be.  \n\u003E [/li]  \n\u003E [li]  \n\u003E Mind your ASAS force on re-entry... you can do S-turns or nose-up if you want no-fuel course corrections to KSC, but when the ASAS bar creeps up, get that nose in line. Resist the urge to pitch up too soon as you nose-dive past 15,000m - that way lies death.  \n\u003E [/li]  \n\u003E [li]  \n\u003E On the plus side, this thing will glide plenty far with 5 degrees nose-up at 50m/s.[/li]\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T01:06:12Z","Content":"Off to go make the biggest one! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"keptin","CreatedById":8884,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T02:30:41Z","Content":"Going for big.

We seem to have suffered some instrument and communication malfunction, but everything is currently under control.\n\u003E \n\u003E He turned off the cabin shade.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: As you can see, we have returned to Kerbin and are en route to KSC for landing. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\u003E \n\u003E He clicked the mic off again.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: I need to go talk to the flight attendants and let them know what\\\u0027s going on. Hopefully they can help keep the passengers calm. If anyone asks, we\\\u0027re on our way to KSC and everything is fine.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill left the cockpit.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: And while we\\\u0027re busy finding our ass from a hole in the ground, let\\\u0027s have some rock and roll!\n\u003E \n\u003E He tuned the radio and the cabin was filled with the fuzz guitar of Kerman Greenbaum\\\u0027s \u0027Spirit in the Sky\u0027.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: COULD YOU TURN THAT DOWN, PLEASE?\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: WHAT?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: TURN IT DOWN NOW!\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: NO, SORRY, I\\\u0027M NOT CLEARED FOR THAT ACTIVITY. YOU\\\u0027LL HAVE TO TAKE IT UP WITH COMMAND.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob cranked the dial down.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: Ya know, I\\\u0027m gonna to have to report you for that, eh?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: You \\*bleep\\*ing bastard, are you \\*trying\\* to screw this mission?\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: Hey, little guy, I\\\u0027m just kidding. And stressed. And frustrated. We\\\u0027re \\*home\\*, how can we be so lost?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: \\*sigh\\* ...Sorry. I think the stress is getting to me, too. I tried triangulating our position using the ship\\\u0027s clock, but no luck, so I figured it must have been reset when we lost the computer. Then I tried using my own watch, and it still didn\\\u0027t add up. I guess the radio was just the last straw. I was out of line. I...want to go home.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: You and me both, kid. But chill and think about somethin\\\u0027 else for a while, ya know? Like--why does the plane have a FM radio, anyway--I thought they took out everything non-essential to save on weight? Think some engineer just needed his music fix?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: Oh, no, FM is only a side effect. The low frequency radio is mainly for old-style air-to-air comms and... Jeb, you\\\u0027re a genius.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: I know. How?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: The low frequency radio is required safety equipment on all large aircraft, used for VOR and ILS in case of satellite outage.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: Come again?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: The old instrument landing systems. No one uses them anymore, but major airports still have to operate it. Why didn\\\u0027t I think of it earlier? We may not know where we are, but if we\\\u0027re on the same side of the planet as KSC we could ride its beam in like a homing missile!\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: Ride in like a homing missile... Mind if I write that down? I\\\u0027m going to use that line.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: Just try not to go kaboom at the end. Anyway, here in the chart book is KSC\\\u0027s frequency and I\\\u0027m locking it in now. Yes! It\\\u0027s weak, but it\\\u0027s there! We\\\u0027re going home!\n\u003E \n\u003E ![WCglF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WCglF.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E The door opened and Bill stepped into the cockpit.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: I felt the plane bank. Have we got our position?\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: Not exactly. Bob figured out how to lock on to KSC\\\u0027s beacon; we\\\u0027re riding it in like a homing missile!\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: Hopefully without the boom at the end.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: That\\\u0027s what-\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: Nice work.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: Thanks, it-\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: So, do we have an ETA? I\\\u0027d like to have something to tell the passengers.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: Well, I didn\\\u0027t have much luck getting our location, as our clocks seem to be off and the beacon only gives us direction. I did some calculations on the signal strength, and time of day, terrain features, and the relative strength of stations from known locations-\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: Jeb, do you know?\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: Bob told me it\\\u0027d be aboot an hour, give or take. The autopilot\\\u0027s locked in and we could sleep through the rest of the flight.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: Thanks, Jeb. I\\\u0027ll go talk to the passengers.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob whined.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb spent the next half hour thinking about the flight\\\u0027s events. How could they have traveled to the Mun? How did they get back? Was it a natural phenomenon, something which defied everything he had been taught, or was it some sort of constructed gateway between worlds? What did it mean?\n\u003E \n\u003E When Bill returned, the plane had begun its long descent. This was, under normal circumstances, the most dangerous part of a flight. The huge plane had to descend nose-up, and the heat shield blocked view of the ground below. It was hard enough to trust the autopilot when they had the benefit of satellites and terrain maps; how much more with only a radio beam and barely functioning communications and radar? Jeb and Bob handled the the stress in their usual manner--Jebediah wore his trademark grin, while Bob was hunched in a fetal position in his chair.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![anYPa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/anYPa.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: Have we tried raising KSC?\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: Ten minutes ago. Some static, not much more.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: We should give it another go. Even with a broken antenna we should get some signal at this range.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: Kerbal Space Center, this is Pan Kerbal Flight 33. Do you copy?\n\u003E \n\u003E Through the static, a distorted voice replied \u0027This is Kerbal Space Center, say again? Message not received.\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill grabbed the mic. \u0027Kerbal Space Center, this is Pan Kerbal Flight 33. Our navigation system has been damaged. Please confirm our approach trajectory, over.\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0027Negative, Flight 33. Our radar is not yet operational. We have a visual on your plane and you appear to be on a good approach, over.\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E The tower helped walk them down through the last stages of descent. Finally, the autopilot leveled the craft out, the gear lowered, and they saw the familiar building of Kerbal Space Center.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: Uh, Bill... where\\\u0027s the runway?\n\u003E \n\u003E ![8rKb3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8rKb3.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Sure enough, there was only a barely leveled dirt strip where the enormous KSC tarmac should have been.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: Oh god...Autopilot off! Abort! Abort!\n\u003E \n\u003E As they stopped their descent, a piercing alarm filled the cockpit.\n\u003E \n\u003E TERRAIN--PULL UP--TERRAIN--PULL UP\n\u003E \n\u003E They were heading straight for a canyon wall a short distance ahead. Whatever normally frequented this airstrip must have been far nimbler than a spaceliner.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: We should probably do somethin\\\u0027 aboot that, ya know?\n\u003E \n\u003E Punching the throttle and pulling hard on the yoke, they were able to steer up and out of a slightly shallower part of the canyon, though they came far too close to the rim for anyone\\\u0027s liking.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![zkmH0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zkmH0.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: What just happened?\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: Yeah, so KSC is in the mountains now? I should probably sell my surfboard.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: Did you lock on to the wrong beacon, Bob?\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb grabbed Bob\\\u0027s chart book. \u0027Looks fine to me. There\\\u0027s the map, there\\\u0027s the frequency, there\\\u0027s the radio. It checks out. Besides, they identified themselves as KSC.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: Um, I have a theory.\n\u003E \n\u003E The radio crackled to life again. \u0027What the hell are you kids flying?\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: Tower, please identify yourself. Over.\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0027This is Kerbal Space Center. Who are you people, over?\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: Excuse me.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: Kerbal Space Center is on the coast. Impersonating a traffic controller and operating a false beacon is a criminal offence. I can have you arrested!\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: Um, Tower, what year is it?\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0027Kerbal Space Center is RIGHT HERE, and it\\\u0027s September 13, 3439. Now get off this frequency! I\\\u0027m reporting this incident to the KAA! Out!\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill switched off the radio in disgust.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![igOBG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/igOBG.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: That explains it.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: Explains what?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: This is where the KSC was originally built; where the first few satellites were launched. The equipment was later moved south, to the equator, when we started launching rockets in earnest.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: But I\\\u0027ve been with the program for a decade. I\\\u0027ve never heard of operations going on at this location.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: Because this KSC hasn\\\u0027t been here for almost twenty years... our time.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: Our time? Wait...are you saying that nut job is right and it IS the year 3439?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: It makes more sense than building a fake base where the old KSC used to be just to fool wayward space planes, doesn\\\u0027t it?\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: Curiouser and curiouser, eh?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: So assuming I believe you--which I don\\\u0027t--what\\\u0027s our next move? Can we reach the green cloud again?\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: Nah, rocket fuel\\\u0027s gone. Even if we could, who knows where it would send us next?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: At least we now know our location--so we can plot a course. The space plane runway at our KSC was already built in 3439, before the rest of the base; they used it for freight carriers. Assuming we can reach it, we can land, refuel, and plan how to get back to \\*our\\* Kerbin. And if we end up stuck here, we might even set the space program ahead a couple decades.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: Any port in a storm, then?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob and Jeb studied the charts, fuel consumption tables, and finally worked out a flight plan that would reach home just as fuel ran out. Bill tried to reassure the crew and passengers, and they set out on the long journey back home.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![A65vb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/A65vb.jpg)![SRnXf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SRnXf.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: Huh, there it goes again.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: What?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: For just a second, we had what looked like a weak satellite signal. That\\\u0027s the third time in the last hour.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: That\\\u0027s good, right?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: But in 3439, these satellites didn\\\u0027t exist yet.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb: That\\\u0027s still good, right?\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: I don\\\u0027t know. I hope so.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![LM3DV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LM3DV.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E After hours of flying, and with the fuel tanks all but empty, they finally spotted the familiar mountains and coast. Home was just ahead!\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: Still negative response on VOR and IFR. We\\\u0027ll have to fly in the hard way. Fuel\\\u0027s gone, but it shouldn\\\u0027t matter now.\n\u003E \n\u003E Just then, the radio crackled to life. \u0027Unknown craft on approach vector, this is Kerbal Space Center. Please identify, over.\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill grabbed the radio. \u0027Kerbal Space Center, this is Pan Kerbin Flight 33, requesting landing assistance, over!\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0027Flight 33? Boy, are we glad to see you. You disappeared from our scopes shortly after launch; is your transponder malfunctioning, over?\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E Bill: Our microwave antenna is damaged. We need someone to guide us in, over.\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0027Roger that. Your vector is looking good. We will continue to advise.\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: And tower... what year is it?\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0027It\\\u0027s...well, it\\\u0027s 3461.
