I wanted some new planets to go to so the mods I installed were Kerbal Interstellar, Krags Planet Factory, and Kerbal Engineer as I figured these three would probably not conflict. I have installed mods without issue for other games, and followed all installation instructions for these mods. When I loaded up my game everything looked good, I could see all of the new parts for the interstellar mod in the tech tree and the vehicle assembly building and see the new planets/systems from the space center. But, when I try to go to the launch pad instead it just puts me at some random point in space (really far out, the altitude was measured in Megameters) and I cannot control my vessel or do anything. I assume that this is probably due to the planet factory mod but I guess it could be any of them. If anyone can give me some advice to maybe get these mods to work together that would be awesome! I also just tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game from Steam to get it back to the original but when it reinstalled it still had the mods. Should I just go into the steam directory and delete the game files manually then reinstall? I made a backup of the game in a different directory so I\u0027ve been playing it from there but I would ideally like to make these mods work or at least get the game back to normal so I can play it through steam. My specs in case its helpful: Windows 7 64bit, Intel i7 950, 9 GB ram, Radeon HD 6770.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T19:28:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a problem with KSP in that the Mods can conflict with each other and mess up the core game itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way around this, is to install one mod (or group) at a time and try it out on a \u0027test mission\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point you\u0027ll start picking up problems, so you\u0027ll have to uninstall the latest mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also no guarantee as there are also intermittent problems that pop up now and then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are about 4 or so mainstream big mods, which have been \u0027tested and working\u0027 with a group of mods - it\u0027s probably better to go this route, as at least you\u0027ll get some bang for your buck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T11:42:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry without Krag Planet Factory.
