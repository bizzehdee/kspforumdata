KSP doesn\u0027t look for them in the gamedata folders, and even breaking the mod \u0022keep it all in gamedata\u0022 design by putting a TTF file in $KSP_HOME/Resources or $KSP_HOME/KSP_data/Resources won\u0027t allow it to be loadable by the mod writer (I know, I\u0027ve tried all of these).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only fonts mod writers are capable of using are the ones in the list above. And the problem is... none of them are monospaced. I\u0027ve been trying for days to be able to provide the users of the kOS mod with an in-game text editor widget using Unity\u0027s GUI.TextArea, and I cannot seem to escape from the fact that to do so I must use a proportional width font because that\u0027s all KSP will allow a mod to use. For typing in script program files you really should have a monospace font.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the kOS mod resorted to for its terminal window to look monospaced is to create a texture file of hardcoded bit image tiles for each character and it manually does all the work of placing each character\u0027s image on the screen in its correct location individually as an image texture. This of course precludes using any of Unity\u0027s built-in GUI text tools to do anything with this kind of \u0022font\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I really could use is either:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Provide the ability for Mod writers to load their own fonts into Unity by giving them a place to put .TTF files in their GameData folder that will be checked and loaded by KSP when it scours the mod GameData folders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I can understand if there\u0027s a desire not to have a proliferation of many fonts as that can make programs look random and ugly, so instead have SQUAD add a monospace font of their own choosing to the Unity Resources that they load. (Be careful to choose one that doesn\u0027t cause important symbols like \u0022[,],(,),{,}\u0022 to be shown as ambiguously identical, as some fonts do that and that makes them less universally usable). A number of different fonts are available for download from the internet under various licensing terms and I\u0027m sure one can be found that is legal to include in a commercial product free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now if a mod maker wants something monospaced in their mod they really have to do it entirely by hand and can\u0027t use Unity\u0027s gui tools for it, and that seems like a rather awkward and unnecessary limitation. It would hardly take any work to just add one font file to the Resources in the next release (solution #2 above). I\u0027m sure kOS can\u0027t be the only mod that\u0027s trying to make something that looks \u0022computery\u0022, and a monospace font is useful for doing that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T18:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI totaly agree with that, one additional font can\u0027t hurt that much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T00:38:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d suggest Anonymous Pro for use -- I think it\u0027s got the right licence for it, too.
