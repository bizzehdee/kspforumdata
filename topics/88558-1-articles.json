For now you can only have gears that deploy directly to the side (front/back in reality), then when it\u0027s mounted sideways, it appears to deploy to left/right. parts aren\u0027t mirrored left/right, if you look closer at the inline main gear in RF, you can see the wheel brackets are both on the left side of the wheel, instead of opposite sides like they should be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-27T15:29:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2014 03:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by nli2work\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T16:14:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee the discussion following \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80796-0-24-Spaceplane-Plus-1-3?p=1392939\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1392939\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80796-0-24-Spaceplane-Plus-1-3?p=1392939\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1392939\u003C/a\u003E for what PJ might possibly be working on, BTW.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T16:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egreat suggestions, but a lot has to change under the hood in KSP for those to work properly.

There\u0027s nothing that allows independent XYZ directions for landing gears that I know of. Closest to that is BahamutoD\u0027s adjustable missle rail; but that\u0027s a set of preset lengths you cycle through, not scaling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
