It is probably quicker to just do one mission first for science before shooting into high orbit. Otherwise, a long wait is the penalty people get to pay for cheesing parachutes. As for me, I ride it out to 1-2km high where I\u0027m going maybe 220 m/s before opening the parachutes. Then I\u0027ll crank up warp to x4 for the rest of the trip. I try to drop warp right before impact, but even when I fail that, I haven\u0027t had any warp krakens hit in 1.0. \n\nFor long burns and cruising to 70km, I just alt-tab to reddit... or whip out a phone or tablet if I want to keep a glancing watch. \n\nAnyone know if there is a way to bypass the x4 warp limit?
