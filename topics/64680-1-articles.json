Is it the allure of the science that brings us? Is it the constant action in the game that brings us in? Or is it none of the above?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some, it could be both, however for me it\u0027s something much different. I play because I feel I owe it to the Kerbals. They\u0027ve approved an unlimited budget and all the resources on their planet to the space program and have also appointed me as their administrator of their space program in hopes I can lead them to, hopefully one day, entire space colonization. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve set them off constantly. \u0022I need to do this, I have to do that,\u0022 yet I haven\u0027t done anything to further their last hope other than a probe on a couple of moons and planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese Kerbals will (sometimes) happily risk their life for the greater good of all Kerbalkind. The engineers and scientists will work 24/7 for you, to continue their dream, their destiny, and possibly last hope. They work for you as an ant works for its queen or as a bee does for its hive. No human idea has this kind of dedication, initiative, or ambition. The mission controllers and researchers have dedicated their life to the only thing on their awfully small (but incredibly dense) planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYOU owe it to them, as administrator of their most funded agency, department, or even branch of military, to send them where no Kerbal has gone before, to let them reach their limits and then some. They are volunteering and sacrificing their time so YOU can help and lead them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you put off KSP, you let down the ones that made you their leader. You were their last hope and you failed them. Get on KSP! Go to your limits! Push yourself even farther! Go make a Grand Tour VTOL SSTO! Go without boundaries, for the only thing holding you back is yourself! Your skill level is irrelevant, only your experience counts but you will not make it anywhere being on the forefront of safety, being in your comfort zone! As a famous KSP Forumer once said: \u0022I do not fear failure. Failure is data. I fear not learning from failure. Failure to learn from failure is stupidity.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgress in KSP is measured both in failure and success. Your crash in a manned mission to Duna proves to be a learning experience for later on when you send an armada to Jool. Your success in achieving orbit for the first time gives you the information you need to do it time again and again. Your successive launches from Kerbin tell you what you need to know to orbit on Laythe or even Eve. Your many attempts to make it out to Eeloo are what the Kerbals strive for. That\u0027s what they will live and die for, whether or not they live to see it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is much more than just a game with explosions; it\u0027s almost a responsibility to those who depend on you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow go forth, fellow space program administrator, fellow space defense contractor!
