That\u0027s a major loss in my opinion.\n\nNow that the stock mesh switcher is a thing, people who make mods like Mk2 Expansion, after this, would have prior knowledge to make their parts with skin options that aren\u0027t bound to a specific propellant or propellant mix-- that the skin options would be purely cosmetic or vaguely tied to certain sets of propellants or other resources.\n\nIf the parts were (re)made, without explicit ties to certain fuels/fuel mixes, that\u0027d be fine I guess. But it\u0027s not worth the trouble in the end, to check and make sure your obviously \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tank isn\u0027t actually holding Mono, and that your obviously Mono tank isn\u0027t holding \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E or Xenon. It gets worse as part count inflates when you build really fancy ships.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-25T16:35:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2018 04:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by JadeOfMaar**"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-25T18:47:05Z","Content":"I\u0027ve tried to keep M2X as little dependent on other mods as possible, if only to stave off some annoyance every time KSP updates and breaks a dependency. When the stock switcher came out, I looked at it as a possible replacement for IFS, but the stock texture/mesh swapper was built with one purpose in mind, allowing a stock method of painting your rocket NASA white or Soyuz green (or insulation orange, or whatever) on parts configured for it. If all the part swapping M2X did was, say, offer a similar cosmetic choice between the standard Mk2 paint scheme and a pre-KSP 1.0 style ventral HSRI tiles variant\\*, then the stock switcher would be fine, but using it to swap meshes/textures, and leave the tank contents to a tank manager mod? At that point, why not use a purpose built texture swap/tank manager mod from the beginning?  \n\nThe point of using IFS, or soon the much more lightweight and low profile B9PS, was to originally avoid taking stock part bloat up to eleven. The Service Tank, for instance, is a quarter length tank that can hold a variety of resources that would be useful to have in a quarter length segment, and is one configurable part, whereas in stock, it would instead be a 1/4 length \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E tank, a 1/4 length \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O tank, a 1/4 length mono tank... etc. Multiply that by every other part that has variants. I acknowledge that tying M2X to IFS is inconvenient since IFS adds a whole bunch of irrelevant ancillary stuff that is a pain to deal with, hence the transition to B9PS which is a plugin .dll and nothing else, but ultimately having to rely on a part swapper mod as a dependency is a necessary evil.\n\n\\*I have no plans to implement this at this time, but if enough people ask for it, I might reconsider.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-25T18:48:55Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2018 06:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by SuicidalInsanity**"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-24T20:50:34Z","Content":"Should have gotten this out sooner.
