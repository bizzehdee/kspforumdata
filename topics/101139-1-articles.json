Realistically this only would have worked because the weight was hung below wings spread out along the length of the craft, so no part of the fueselage had to support much weight other than its own cross-section...), and relatively high Thrust for a plane (in the lower atmosphere, the spaceplane was capable of an almost-vertical ascent before it started to run out of atmosphere for its Thermal Turbojets and had to level out for speed...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAll this aside, there was still room for improvement...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor one, I made use of a tri-wing design as the front two wings were actually both giant canards that evolved from an earlier failed design (which had only one pair of canards instead of two). However I would like to try enlarging the front canards and rear wings, and doing away with the middle canards altogether so that I can make use of larger, more highly-swept wings for the improve Lift/Drag ratio that they would offer at hypersonic speeds (the Lift/Drag fell below 1.00 soon after switching to rocket-propulsion, due to the 45-degree delta shapes used for the wings instead of something more highly-swept...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I would love to figure out how to pre-cool more of my air intakes, as Thermal Turbojets are theoretically capable of operating up to a bit over Mach 5 (both in-game and in real life) with sufficiently powerful and advanced pre-coolers, but I was forced to rely on a combination of precooled inline-intakes and radial intakes that were not attached to any precooler (KSP-Interstellar Extended makes it possible to pre-cool radial intakes, but they still have to be attached directly to a precooler to receive its benefits...) limiting their operation up to about Mach 4.3 (which, in practice, meant I could operate them up to my maximum speed before activating the rockets, but could not take much advantage of the ram-effect that operating a mixture of rockets and jets provides to shove more air into the intakes and allow higher Thrust-production by jets under intake-limited operating conditions...) due to compression-heating in the Thermal Turbojet\u0027s compressors forcing a shutdown at around Mach 4.4 to avoid the Thermal Turbojets failing (read: exploding) due to overheating!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, it was a highly-successful ascent (read: the plane made orbit in one piece, even if the ascent was not the most fuel-optimal possible- in fact it fell back into the atmosphere after apoapsis before circularizing...) and the spaceplane soon began with its mission-objective for its virgin flight: which was to recover Bill Kerman form the Munar-1 Lander, where he had been waiting in orbit for over 24 hours...
