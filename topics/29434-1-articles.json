The commission behind the project was KRASHinc, an old and experienced committee, and the goal was set by the committee for a prototype of what was to be known as the \u0027I-10\u0027 Series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0027I\u0027 standing for Interceptor, the \u002710\u0027 standing for the committees generation of aircraft, as delegated by the number of generations of aircraft the committee has developed successfully. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual name itself \u0027Black Dog\u0027, was chosen on the initial completion of the prototype. The meaning behind the name comes from the mythical beast known as, The Black Dog. The Black Dog is said to stalk it\u0027s victims under the cover of darkness. The mythical creature often said to be associated with the Devil or a Hellhound, had an appearance regarded as a portent of death and it is generally supposed to be larger than a normal dog, and often has large, glowing eyes. It is often associated with electrical storms, with places of execution and ancient pathways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe failure of design:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe project ran into major delays on the run up to the test flight of the prototype, as the shortened engine mount made to keep the overall length down, had fuel feeding problems.

Although the craft it was meant to replace, the AFI-8 K-12 AFMPP, was reliable and tested, it was the 138th version since the first prototype in July 2012 the AFI-8 A \u0027Griffon\u0027. The committee was eager to create a new design to fulfill all the previous specs, improve the outdated airframe, increase pilot survivability and if possible reduce costs to manufacture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA key problem for the committee attached to the project, was trying to juggle all these requirements at once, which the AFI-8 wasn\u0027t even designed for, but proved it\u0027s worth in. In short, the AFI-8 was a miracle for how good it was in all areas, and somehow the committee had to do better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe name \u0027AFI\u0027, standing for Attacker, Fighter, Interceptor, was basically a re-designation of the \u0027MR\u0027 or multi-role series. There is actually no AFI-7, because before the AFI-8, the designation was \u0027MR\u0027, and so the AFI-7 is actually the MR-7. The reason for the re-designation was simply because the previous designation implied that the series was good for bombing, scouting and all manner of other things. Since this was not the case the actual roles were turned into the new designation to avoid confusion, AFI. The \u00279\u0027 is the number in the series of aircraft, this being the 9th.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual name of \u0027Basilisk\u0027, comes from the mythical creature called the Basilisk, a beast said to kill it\u0027s enemies with a single stare. Unfortunately the naming of this craft was rather tragic, as the craft was named before even the prototype was completed. It was named after a very deadly creature, because it was expected to be an improvement over the AFI-8, and so the name sadly, was more a name for the idea of what the craft was hoped to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe failure of design:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe project ran smoothly for the first week, the prototype was finished, initial hopes were high and all seemed good. The problems started however, when time came for beginning the initial tests, to see if the project was on track before heading onwards at full speed. The first sign of a long road ahead, came when the craft failed miserably at the payload tests, and then on the stability tests, and then even on the basic survivability tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft could not lift the required 5 tons and maintain maneuverability, the craft could not recover from a flat spin unless piloted by veterans, and the craft was virtually unflyable on one engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn shock, the committee stepped back, and immediately began a program of hotfixes in attempt to rectify the problems. Although with some success, the craft still had horrible handling characteristics, and a somewhat temperamental attitude to wanting to stay airborne, even after the long hotfix program ended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe project was finally cancelled after 2 long months of attempted revivals, and the loss of 4 brave kerbal test pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i1207.photobucket.com/albums/bb466/jabbo12/Complete%20Gamers/screenshot17-2_zps05c6d5e2.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImage 1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i1207.photobucket.com/albums/bb466/jabbo12/Complete%20Gamers/screenshot18-1_zps3d1923d6.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImage 2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i1207.photobucket.com/albums/bb466/jabbo12/Complete%20Gamers/screenshot19-2_zps372252e9.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImage 3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E____________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know if you want to see some more, any feedback comments are appreciated, and thanks for reading! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T03:44:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI quite like the writing style you\u0027re using.
