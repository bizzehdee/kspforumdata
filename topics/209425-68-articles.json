My mobo supports 3 way crossfireX/SLI but I\u0027d need a 900\u002BW PSU to handle just 2 (plus I\u0027d turn it into a furnace).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it falls apart when you combine multiple high-end GPU\u0027s, though mid-range to lower high-end cards will even work on a much more frugal PSU. Two 270X\u0027s will most likely run on less than 400 watt, \u003Cem\u003Eincluding\u003C/em\u003E the rest of the system. That leaves a very sparse and small group of people putting multiple very high-end cards in a system, so realistically people will not have to deal with this. It is possible to consume washing machine like amounts of power with a PC, but in general people grossly overestimate what a system uses, even when it is a very sporty setup with lots of high-end goodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EThere are a couple of AMD processors that use ridiculous amounts of power, but I am not really sure you should consider those indicative. For instance, the FX-9590 is so power hungry the cost difference with a faster Intel chip is made up in mere months if you take the price of power into account.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DuoDex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DuoDex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEstimated wattage for what I have now is 450ish watts.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you list the hardware?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T00:55:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, so here\u0027s a new question.

Does the i5 use the IGP or does it have a separate GPU? The i5 is faster processor wise as it has a better single threaded speed, but the A10 has an edge when it comes to video processing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
