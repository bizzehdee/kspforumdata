You have to follow the tutorial exactly for it to progress to the next stage, even if it makes you worse off. I think the area you are at is where you use the RCS thrusters to get yourself to 0 meters per second relative to the target ship. What you have to do is keep holding H until it gets to 0. The problem is when you start getting near 0 the prograde switches to the opposite side and since you are going so slow you don\u0027t have the option to auto click prograde if you stop. The key is keep holding H and don\u0027t let up until you get to 0 exactly. If you do release H accidentally speed up a bit until you are moving fast enough to get the options to auto target and try again."}]}
