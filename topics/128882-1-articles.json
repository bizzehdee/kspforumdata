Your ship points due retrograde. You don\u0027t touch the controls until precisely the time before hitting the ground that you need to kill all velocity. Then you burn retrograde at full thrust. As your horizontal speed falls, \u0022retrograde\u0022 will lift to the vertical and you follow it, so that you come to a dead stop just inches off the ground. It\u0027s called a suicide burn because if you leave it just a couple of seconds too late or fail to calculate the timing correctly, you will hit the ground at dozens or even hundreds of m/s and there is virtually nothing you can do to save yourself at that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Econstant altitude burn\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E starts off like a suicide burn, preferably with a trajectory which is virtually flat at the point that it touches the surface (or even not quite touching the surface), except you start a little earlier and point slightly up from retrograde. Therefore, while you are reducing your horizontal velocity you are also preventing the addition of a vertical velocity component. This makes it far safer than a suicide burn because - especially with a low TWR craft - you can vary your inclination on-the-fly to stop yourself falling while shedding horizontal velocity. The disadvantage is that very slight changes in inclination will make a very big difference to the exact point that you land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally don\u0027t see how it is possible to consider the \u0022constant altitude burn\u0022 to be efficient.

The overall efficiency (in mass, part count, cost, and/or fuel usage) of a vessel that needs to do a constant altitude burn may easily exceed a more powerful one that can do a suicide burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, although your arguments based on the relatively minor losses on burning off-retrograde are entirely convincing - and it is an interesting point to bear in mind in future missions, I cannot agree with your conclusion because it seems to confuse two different issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 - suicide burn angle of impact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you deorbit, you bring your trajectory down to touch (or nearly touch) the surface. If the body is a perfect sphere without any hills, then a steep descent with a high impact angle (a) costs more in the deorbit burn, (b) adds a greater vertical component to your velocity and (c) requires a higher TWR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, on the plus side, (a) it makes your final landing spot far more accurate and (b) the horizontal component of your velocity will be lower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may be wrong on this (but I don\u0027t think so...) but it seems clear that the horizontal velocity savings of a high impact angle will never compensate for the vertical velocity increase. Therefore, for any suicide burn the more acute the angle, the better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is true of a perfect sphere remains true for a hilly terrain, except that an extremely shallow angle may be impossible. Therefore in any event, the most efficient suicide burn is going to be the most shallow-angled approach possible within the constraints of the body you\u0027re landing on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 - how constant is a constant altitude burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only possible situation where you have zero vertical velocity before starting your burn is if your trajectory barely grazes the surface. On a perfect sphere this is fine, inasmuch as you can be mere metres above the surface when you start the burn and then simply stick to a virtual orbital path as you follow the surface while slowing. However in that case your burn has to start off with being purely retrograde anyway (and even radially out from retrograde, since otherwise you\u0027ll rise until you\u0027ve slowed enough to bring Ap down to the same as Pe). I can agree that this will probably be the most efficient landing on a perfect sphere, but then again this is merely an extension of the previous point: this is just taking the suicide burn at its most efficient (very shallow impact) and then taking it one step further (i.e. no impact).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn any other surface than a perfect sphere, you have to add height. This means either starting higher (Pe hundreds or thousands of metres above the surface) or actively negating your vertical velocity at the start of your burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is where I can\u0027t agree with your statement that \u0022Going to longer times, but with lower vertical velocity and vertical thrust means lower total gravity losses\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the two assumptions - \u0022lower vertical velocity\u0022 and \u0022lower vertical thrust\u0022 - cannot both be true. On any given deorbiting trajectory, you start your burn by negating almost exactly the same vertical velocity component that the suicide burn negates, but at an altitude and not on approaching the surface. For every second that you remain at that altitude you are adding 1.6 m/s (for the Mun) or whatever to the vertical velocity that you are effectively countering. And if there are any hills in the way, then you\u0027re going to accumulate another 30s or a minute or so of vertical velocity at that same 1.6 m/s (or whatever) as you fall into that (most inefficient of all) vertical landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis confusion of the issues it what I was originally trying to address with my \u0022definitions\u0022, and I should have added an \u0022efficiency\u0022 definition while I was at it. However, separating the issues still (IMHO) leads to the inescapable conclusion that a suicide burn at the shallowest possible angle for a given terrain will always be more efficient (for a given vessel that is capable of it) than any other approach for that same landing site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I just checked back to the beginning of the thread, and I think I\u0027ve found where I really can\u0027t agree with you:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere you said \u0022The constant altitude burn is designed to likewise minimize gravity losses by preventing gravity from accelerating your rocket vertically\u0022, I just cannot agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay you are hanging motionless in space above the Mun, and you have 10 m/s delta-v left in your rocket, and you have 6 seconds in which you can decide when to spend it.
