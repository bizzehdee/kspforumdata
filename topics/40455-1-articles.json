It is instead used to compensate for any errors in flight. For example, imagine you damage your wing and the jet start turning slightly to the left. Once you trim the jet it will once again keep flying straight because the control surfaces have been set to bypass that previouse error and compensate for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T19:37:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIRL, trim allows the pilot to relieve pressure on the yoke or stick. It allows the pilot to place the plane at a particular attitude and have the plane remain in that attitude without any pilot intervention. It is almost a mechanical autopilot.
