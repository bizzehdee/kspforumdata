I hope you get what it does now and it\u0027s useful to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejlcarneiro: Entirely likely. Antenna range doesn\u0027t just switch your comms off like RT does. When you go out of range it ramps up the power usage proportionately to how far over you are (and the icon turns yellow I think). Fusebox doesn\u0027t get any wind of that so it just reports the \u0027normal\u0027 usage which AR passes to it. For example one dish will just about go to Minmus but it\u0027ll turn yellow out there and cost ton of extra EC when transmitting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
