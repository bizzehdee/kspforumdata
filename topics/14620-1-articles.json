It might be possible in a game, where the physics are just approximations of reality, to a greater or lesser degree. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in the real world air is a gas, which means means it moves fluidly. Thus a big, fully inflated parachute (bearing a capsule or whatever) is under the influence of gravity, and wants to move downward. The air beneath the parachute will be forced aside, allowing the whole thing to descend. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThicker atmosphere might slow that process. But unless the air were solid, it will move always out of the way eventually.
