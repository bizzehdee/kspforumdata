Being as such, and having access to the rather pretty B9 parts pack, among others, I set out to make my own so-called aircraft carrier. It was only after I built the darn thing that I realized there actually was an aircraft carrier mod, but oh well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design process was long and started off simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qJ5cvFc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qJ5cvFc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut quickly I turned to larger, less-floaty designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v54dV21.png\u0022 alt=\u0022v54dV21.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnmanned testing proved the concept sound, but the execution was clunky, unpolished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UkLwqll.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UkLwqll.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then, suddenly, divine inspiration struck me: if it took 100,000 liters of fuel to go 3 kilometers in the water, but also had to roll down the runway, why did it even have to go in the water in the first place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, ladies and so-called gentlemen, let me present to you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMerriam\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E, Amphibious Carrier mk.

I\u0027m not quite enough of a design genie to make one that can land 40 tons of fuel on the carrier\u0027s short deck, but seeing as how the carrier has a 1,500 kilometer range at 30m/s, I\u0027m not too worried about fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IcISEjq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IcISEjq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WAUcFi0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WAUcFi0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe carrier, using a KW 3.75m engine at the rear, can climb up to 45-degree slopes and hit 60m/s on flat surfaces, as shown here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/95KLWT4.png\u0022 alt=\u002295KLWT4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding, especially for me, is tricky, seeing as how I\u0027m pretty bad at actually flying planes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c5LnKpB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c5LnKpB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with patience, it can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3QyY595.png\u0022 alt=\u00223QyY595.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttempts to make a carrier that could hit 100m/s over land proved destructively inconclusive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u1yvJSx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022u1yvJSx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was really fun to do and build.

There are wheels on all of the fuel/ chassis system tanks, and (were) three shock-absorbing wheels at the bow where the ship makes contact with steep hills occasionally, which were also useful for steering. They got knocked off when I was trying to go faster than 60m/s, unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere you can see how the bow wheels lift off the ground when cresting a hill. Eventually the deck flexes enough to bring them back into contact, but the ship can be supported by just the central three rows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/56ANc3y.png\u0022 alt=\u002256ANc3y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA camera bug demonstrates how the frame is built.
