For some reason, when I download this mod, only the Ranger parts show up in my VAB and hangar. What is the correct and proper way to move the files into my KSP folders so that I may use the Endurance and Landers as well? I use a mac if that changes anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I absolutely love using the Ranger and Interstellar was easily one of the best movies I have ever seen. Also, another question, is there a hot-key enabled to toggle the lift engine? It seems a bit hard for me to right click and disengage engines one by one, especially when trying to land somewhere...it leads to very bad things \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E RIP kerbals :\u0027(\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
