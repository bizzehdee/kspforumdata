(Thanks Mr Speed)\n\nAs it is the first burn you have to do is over 5 minutes and because the LV-Ns are attached to tiny, tiny fuel tanks they easily overheat and explode. \n\nIs this a joke?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T17:56:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sonny\\_Jim**"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T15:26:05Z","Content":"I guess it\u0027s really easy to find something to complain about these days.\n\nI mean, it\u0027s not like Science or Reputation is on the line.

I think v1.0 is awesome!\n\nWhat I do think though is that with v1.0 a lot of new players will be trying KSP for the first time and considering the difficulty curve, a lot of these players will be looking at the tutorials for hints and ideas on how to build their craft. With this in mind the tutorials should be a shining example of what a \u0027good\u0027 craft should be.\n\nI feel that this craft is a very poor example of an asteroid grabber and looks to me that the tutorials weren\u0027t played through properly after the addition of heat generation."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T16:52:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I guess it\u0027s really easy to find something to complain about these days.\n\u003E I mean, it\u0027s not like Science or Reputation is on the line.
