The difference is that instead of a expansion of gasses caused by detonation pushing the projectile out of the barrel, the projectile is accelerated through some other means. This is usually a series of electomagnets around the barrel that switch on sequentially, which pushes the (magnetic) projectile out of the barrel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-29T08:27:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2013 08:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T07:58:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are sometimes called Coil Guns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a great site for this kind of thing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacegunconvent.php#id--Kinetic_Kill_Weapons--Coil_Guns\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacegunconvent.php#id--Kinetic_Kill_Weapons--Coil_Guns\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T08:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECoilgun is just one of several kinds of linear accelerators.

You load the bucket with rocks, used baby diapers, belly-button lint, old AOL CD-ROMs, or whatever spare mass you have. The bucket is magnetically accelerated coilgun fashion. At the end of the driver, the bucket is braked to a halt, and the bucket contents go whizzing off into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen used for propulsion, typical figures I\u0027ve seen say a representative model would require about 350 megawatts, engine mass about 150 metric tons, thrust about 20,000 newtons, specific impulse about 3,000 seconds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe attractive part is that you can use any mass for propellant. So an asteroid miner could land one on a valuable asteroid, and use the mass driver to alter the asteroid\u0027s trajectory. Naturally the astromilitary of the various spacefaring nations will have their warships closely monitoring this, so no evil person or nation covertly alters an asteroid\u0027s orbit to strike Earth (or Kerbin) or to take out a space station or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass drivers can also be used for transport, this was how they were designed originally. You site one at a mine on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn which produces titanium or aluminium. You use the mass driver to send blocks of ore into orbit to the future site of a huge L5 orbital colony. A \u0022catcher\u0022 at the site intercepts the ore, which is then refined into structural members for the colony. You go to all this trouble instead of sending the structural members up from Kerbin because of the insanely high delta-V cost to boost into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T02:44:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother advantage of the rail gun design is you can use a nonmagnetic though conductive projectile, as long as it will hold electric current you can apply a force to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
