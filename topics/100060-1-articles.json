But then, they can just eat Kerbol\u0027s gravity! They eat the GRAVIOLIES. Of course! The Negative Gravioli container, like Ravioli! A food! The negative ones are the ones that pull you down, and thus can be used to measure a planet\u0027s pull. Positive graviolis are emitted by mass just as much, but only gravitationally affect anti-matter. It\u0027s the trip to Eeloo that worries me. That far away, Kerbals might starve. So they drink \u0022Happiness\u0022 a nickname for monopropellant. They drink it and then expel (read: urinate) it. Both chemicals are equally volatile, so they just put it back into the same tank. Once at Eeloo, they can eat Eeloo\u0027s gravity.\n\nBut wait. [http://i.imgur.com/ZHWSKxL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZHWSKxL.jpg)\n\nThere\u0027s a Food and Not Food drawer in the Hitchhiker Storage Container. If Gravity=Graviolis=Food, then what\u0027s Not-Food? ANTI-gravity! And if Kerbals have a box of antigravity then why are they messing around with rockets? Simple! The Gravity/Antigravity reaction powers the... wait for it...
