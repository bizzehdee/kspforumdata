But then, they can just eat Kerbol\u0027s gravity! They eat the GRAVIOLIES. Of course! The Negative Gravioli container, like Ravioli! A food! The negative ones are the ones that pull you down, and thus can be used to measure a planet\u0027s pull. Positive graviolis are emitted by mass just as much, but only gravitationally affect anti-matter. It\u0027s the trip to Eeloo that worries me. That far away, Kerbals might starve. So they drink \u0022Happiness\u0022 a nickname for monopropellant. They drink it and then expel (read: urinate) it. Both chemicals are equally volatile, so they just put it back into the same tank.
