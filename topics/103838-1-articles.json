peeve of mine.\u00A0 Most software engineers I\u0027ve known share the same attitude, and I\u0027m guessing Squad is no different.\u00A0 So I gotta get this out of my

it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe devs don\u0027t have the bandwidth to read everything in this forum.\u00A0 Yes, some of them do spend a lot of time here (\u003Ca

him in here, when he\u0027ll step in to provide an authoritative answer to a particular technical question).\u00A0 However, there\u0027s just no way for them to cover everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t be shy about logging bugs.\u00A0 Obviously I can\u0027t speak for Squad, but I\u0027ve been a professional software engineer for a very long time, surrounded by other professional software engineers, and I\u0027ll say this:\u00A0 We take pride in our work, and we want our work to be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egreat\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and we\u0027re highly motivated to fix problems.\u00A0 When you log a bug on a software product, you are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edoing the engineers a favor\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 They like it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not to say you should waste folks\u0027 time, or that a bug report is always the best venue.\u00A0 Two things in particular that (IMHO) do not belong in a bug report:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFeature requests.\u00A0 i.e. the \u0022bug\u0022 is basically \u0022missing feature\u0022, where you\u0027re asking for someone to design and implement something that doesn\u0027t exist.\u00A0 There\u0027s nothing wrong with feature requests, but they don\u0027t really belong in a bug database because, first, they\u0027re typically a lot of work to add, and second, there\u0027s no way for Squad to gauge how important it is to add the feature unless there\u0027s a feel for how many people need it.\u00A0 There\u0027s a \u0022Suggestions\u0022 forum which is the perfect place for this sort of thing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nComplaints about as-designed behavior.\u00A0 i.e. the thing you\u0027re calling a \u0022bug\u0022 is something that they did on purpose because they like it that way.\u00A0 \u0022My rocket keeps flipping\u0022 would be such an example.\u00A0 Aerodynamic stability is supposed to be important, it\u0027s why they put it in there, they \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewant\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E you to have to think about how your rocket is shaped.\u00A0 So it\u0027s not a \u0022bug\u0022 if your poorly-designed rocket flips around.\u00A0 (A counterexample would be \u0022it\u0027s impossible to reenter with a capsule \u002B heatshield because it keeps flipping over and burning up.\u0022\u00A0 That was a legitimate bug in 1.0, which they quickly fixed because it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewasn\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E intended behavior.)\u00A0 That doesn\u0027t mean you have to agree with what they decided, but a bug report isn\u0027t really the right place.\u00A0 Again, the \u0022Suggestions\u0022 forum would be great for this.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than the above:\u00A0 anything that negatively impacts the player\u0027s experience, which isn\u0027t intended behavior, is a bug.\u00A0 I don\u0027t think that anyone at Squad consciously intended to obfuscate the contracts.\u00A0 I don\u0027t think anyone started to write \u0022Have a Mobile Processing Lab at the outpost\u0022 and then stopped and thought to themselves \u0022no, that\u0027s too easy, better make it harder to understand\u0022 and wrote \u0022research lab\u0022 instead.\u00A0 Almost certainly what happened was that it simply didn\u0027t occur to them that a player might not know what \u0022research lab\u0022 means, and they had 100 other things to do that day and didn\u0027t spend much time thinking it through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFixing this sort of information is a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egreat\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E bug report because it causes legitimate customer pain, and (this is likely the real kicker, from Squad\u0027s point of view) is probably \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Every quick and easy to fix\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 This is a well-understood and reproducible problem, and it\u0027s just text, not program logic, so they don\u0027t have to do a bunch of testing to see whether the fix breaks stuff.\u00A0 If it takes more than ten minutes of some developer\u0027s time to fix, I\u0027d be
