IT is a combination of reputation and completing x plane/moon to get it. Used to be in 0.90 Doing Mun got you Minmus (doing a fly-by basicly an encounter then exit), Ike (landing or orbit on Mun) and Duna (landing or orbit on Mun). Eve landing on Minmus. Gilly you had to do Duna and Ike expolre contracts completely. Eve and Gilly You got Jool and its moons. After Jool is Dres then Eeloo then Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah. I do agree it would make more sense if when we finish or do parts of the contract that other contracts pop up. In 1.0.2.. Duna and Ike still pop up after doing the Mun Explore.
