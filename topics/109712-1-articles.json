The four part Explore contracts do not always show up, and which ones do show depend on your progress. The reason being that there are also now \u0022World Firsts\u0022 contracts that appear that are similar, so I think some of the explore ones don\u0027t show up to prevent too many repetative contracts. If you notice a World Firsts contract, keep your eye out for follow up ones. Often, when you complete one of those contracts, another related one will show up.\n\nPersonally, I also miss having all of the Explore contracts. Those ones feel like some sort of a collection to me.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"HyperbolicKerbonaut","CreatedById":141355,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T17:51:48Z","Content":"The Explore contracts definitely feel like a collection, like a preamble or gateway to future missions on a given body. \n\nDoes anyone know how they\u0027re triggered?

IT is a combination of reputation and completing x plane/moon to get it. Used to be in 0.90 Doing Mun got you Minmus (doing a fly-by basicly an encounter then exit), Ike (landing or orbit on Mun) and Duna (landing or orbit on Mun). Eve landing on Minmus. Gilly you had to do Duna and Ike expolre contracts completely. Eve and Gilly You got Jool and its moons. After Jool is Dres then Eeloo then Moho.\n\nYeah. I do agree it would make more sense if when we finish or do parts of the contract that other contracts pop up. In 1.0.2.. Duna and Ike still pop up after doing the Mun Explore. Just have not gotten the Minmus one to pop up yet on my current play though."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPropelledGiraffe","CreatedById":143863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T05:19:22Z","Content":"It seems to me that for each body you can either get the \u0022Explore\u0022 contract or the series of World First contracts \u0022Fly by\u0022-\u003E\u0022Orbit\u0022-\u003E\u0022Land/Splash Down\u0022.
