The way I see it, one can look on KSP in one of two ways. Either you think KSP is a \u003Cstrong\u003Esimulator/emulator\u003C/strong\u003E where you construct your own rockets, fly to the places you want just because you want it and explore the KSP universe simply because its fun. Or, you consider KSP to be a \u003Cstrong\u003Egame\u003C/strong\u003E and load up career mode, struggling to manage your base, upgrading the right building at the right time, choosing the right contract and try to make as much roots as possible (to get to that next upgrade.)\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for this poll is that I myself used to see KSP as a \u003Cstrong\u003Esimulator/emulator\u003C/strong\u003E, playing a lot in sandbox just because it was fun (for a few hundred hours since a couple of years), using mainly MechJeb as a mod. Lately though, career mode on hard has grown on me, and I have started to look at KSP as a \u003Cstrong\u003Egame\u003C/strong\u003E. Though when I start to express that I think that career mode on hard stops being fun when you start going to other planets (it works beautifully while inside Kerbin SOI) I got shot down by many who suggested for me to find a mod to fix this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see it, using a mod when you play the \u003Cstrong\u003Esimulator/emulator\u003C/strong\u003E part of the game is perfectly fine and fun, but to use a mod while playing the \u003Cstrong\u003Egame\u003C/strong\u003E... Consider for example Mass Effect. If you just play random fights and chose to install a mod which makes the weapons 500% more powerful, just to see the enemies explode in cool ways, I think that is perfectly fine. But if you load up a new campaign on hard, but then uses that same mod making the fights super-easy, I fail to see the point. To me, when playing a campaign in a \u003Cstrong\u003Egame\u003C/strong\u003E, I want to play \u0022the way the creator intended\u0022, i.e. without mods that seriously change the way you play the game (ruining all balance.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to the poll. Before I make another try to discuss whats wrong with career mode on hard (and career mode only), I would like to know what others think about this game. If everyone see this game as a \u003Cstrong\u003Esimulator/emulator\u003C/strong\u003E, there is not really any point for me to start arguing whats wrong with the \u003Cstrong\u003Egame\u003C/strong\u003E part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo vote and argue.

It\u0027s not my fault everyone so far has misinterpreted my poll (or maybe it is my fault that I can\u0027t explain what I mean... :S )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, it\u0027s obvious that the game has both simulationy and gamey content (contracts, for example being more on the gamey side, and the new aerodynamic model being more on the simulationy side (even though some may argue it is not advanced enough to be a true simulation)). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, a thread can always evolve to include discussions and subjects that was not the original thread-creators intention (as for me in this case.) I would however like to make one final attempt to steer this discussion in the direction I meant for it when I started it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy concern is as follows: Most people (all?) who are registered here on the KSP forum, are people who love KSP. I would guess that most of you like realism in games, and feel it is necessary with, for example, a really good aero model (like FAR), to get the most out of your game. So when Squad asks this forum what you want more of, you\u0027ll answer re-entry damage, aero model, x64 version (stable) etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, when KSP hits 1.0 and starts selling to average players, I think Squad might have a problem. I don\u0027t think many average players find realism in games that interesting. In my opinion, an average gamer won\u0027t find any (meaningful) difference between the new and the old aerodynamic model. My fear (a too strong word, but I can\u0027t find any better right now) is that KSP will flop with average players, because KSP is too realistic and too little \u0022gamey\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, does that matter? I would say it depends on Squads intention. If their economic calculations are that they will sell on the niche market \u0022engineering interested persons who like realism in games, who are willing to mod their game to satisfaction\u0022, then I see no problem (unless perhaps, if all those in that market already has bought an early release and there are none left to sell to). But if they calculate to sell \u0022to the masses\u0022, ie more casual gamers, I think they have to rethink some parts of the game (after my own observations playing career mode.) It is, without mods or pen and paper (which I don\u0027t think you can expect an average, or at least a casual, gamer to use) too difficult to go to other planets. I strongly suggest Squad to integrate some kind of delta-v map and delta-v calculation tool for interplanetary missions, it is really difficult to plan a mission to the SOI of another planet as it is right now. Now, I expect most of you reading this to do that with your left and right hand tied to your back. But then you are not an average gamer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, why do I care? Two reasons. First, I respect Squad and HarvesteR for their vision and what they have done and wish them a true success. Second, I want them to succeed, so that they can continue to produce updates and add-ons for a long time, and then, KSP 2.0. (Yes, I know they have promised updates. But everything can change. If they somehow run out of money, that could change quickly.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my reason for this poll was to see if my thinking was correct, ie that most people on this forum love this game because of its more simulationy content, and are not that very interested in the more \u0022gamey\u0022 parts of KSP (which for me means they are not average players.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T16:57:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brainlord Mesomorph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brainlord Mesomorph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGame.\u003Cp\u003EAn actual sim of this would be WAY too hard.

It would actually be boring. Unless you think the player is mission control, then maybe you set the maneuvers, but then you need not actually do the piloting, the pilot would do that. Many games treat \u0022realism\u0022 as the player doing things that would in fact be the simultaneous jobs of many people, then claim this is \u0022realism.\u0022 If you go down that road in defining realism, then really you should pick a single role for the player, and the rest should be AI.
