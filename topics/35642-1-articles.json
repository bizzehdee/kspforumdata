For example, \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003EFlightGlobals.Activevessel.acceleration\u003C/span\u003E indicates the acceleration of the spacecraft relative to the orbited body (say, Kerbin). So even if you are in a free-fall circular orbit and not feeling any acceleration inside the spacecraft the acceleration will read as not-null towards the ground. Same goes for gforce etc. I could really use a \u0022perceived acceleration\u0022 value for multiple purposes in my mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes any of you super-modders have any suggestions for this?
