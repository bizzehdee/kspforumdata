The case was also 40% off on Newegg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI absolutely loved the case. Of course I hadn\u0027t worked with a new case in over 6 years, but I was impressed with the improvements that have been made over time. The case has room for a lot of fans (2x front, 1x side, 1x bottom, 2x top, 1x back) and I\u0027m sure that you could do water cooling if you wanted. What I liked most about the case is the sound dampening foam on both of the sides, the top and also in the front - this makes the case very quiet. Some of these can be partially removed if you want to have more fans or just open exhaust holes. I ended up adding 1 fan to the 2 the case came with so I have 2x 140mm up front and another 1 in the rear. There are removable dust filters on the front and bottom intakes (the PSU is bottom mounted). This is a case with lots of little things done right like rubber cushions for the PSU mount and for the 3.5\u0022 HDD bays. I would totally recommend this case to anyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MB install was pretty easy, I just needed to connect a couple cables along the top of the board before screwing it in place. With the huge after market CPU cooler in place the top of the case had the least room to place your hands so it helped to connect the top cables beforehand. Everything else connected very easily and there is plenty of space behind the motherboard to handle cable management. The modular cable system for the PSU is a new feature for me and I found that to be very handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI debated between the GTX 970 and the Radeon R9 390 for a while, but ultimately the extra 4GB of memory and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/sapphire-nitro-r9-390-8g-d5,4245.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis great TomsHardware review\u003C/a\u003E made me pick the AMD GPU and specifically this one from Sapphire. I was impressed with the physical appearance of the card. It is quite heavy but that is because it is made of quality and durable parts. This particular model had a backplate which I also like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to spend a little more than I originally planned on the keyboard because I wanted to have a quality mechanical keyboard. The SteelSeries model is extremely sturdy and I really like the action of the keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOverclocking\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have overclocked the CPU to 4.5GHz with a voltage max of 1.38. I know that the CPU can handle more than that, but I don\u0027t want to push it too much. I also overclocked the video card to 1090 MHz core clock and 1625 MHz video memory clock - I basically followed what they did in that TomsHardware review.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGames\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I have only installed a few of my Steam games. I run everything at 2560x1440 resolution, which is the native resolution of my display. I was able to run Skyrim at ultra settings and it looks great. The real test will be Fallout 4 next week (I preordered it when I bought my PC parts), and I am also interested in seeing how Directx 12 changes things later on. KSP looks fine so far, but I haven\u0027t really done many tests with it yet - I am mostly waiting for 1.0.5 to arrive for a new career I am planning to start. I also need to figure out what mods I want to run, including any that may help me benchmark test KSP itself. I know DasValdez has a mod that shows the percentage value for the physics load in the upper left of the screen, I may find that and give that a try and anything else that would help to benchmark the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also picked up Ark: Survival Evolved, but I\u0027m not sure what to expect on the graphics of that game as it is still in early access and I can tell there are still visual bugs and glitches for them to iron out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I initially had a Corsair LM3 gaming mouse, but it was horrible and I replaced it with the Gigabyte one which is much better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-06T05:43:49Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2015 05:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kelderek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T12:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMain is a 21.5\u0022 1080p BenQ display.

I just knew I didn\u0027t want a full tower case and so I focused my search to only mid-tower cases. I also knew that a window would be pointless because of how I planned to position the case on the corner of my desk - in fact the looks in general did not matter much beyond having a quality finish. I don\u0027t care much for flashy LEDs or anything like that in my PCs. Besides, by forgoing a window I get an entire side panel lined with sound dampening foam which is nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T21:51:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E(Sorry, have to show off somewhere \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have terrible money management skills and just bought this case:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://tpucdn.com/reviews/Thermaltake/Level_10_GT/images/Level10GT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Level10GT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally wanted the Limited Edition one (because it makes this case look like brick) but it was $1,100, which is a \u003Cem\u003Ebit\u003C/em\u003E beyond my budget \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould be getting delivered tomorrow.

Going the route of the A10 means he won\u0027t have to replace the Mobo right off the bat (ergo cheaper in the short run, but more expensive next time upgrade-time rolls around), but going the route of the FX-series likely means more power and smoother gameplay, but a bigger investment off the bat (it would require a new Mobo, CPU, and PSU).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly he doesn\u0027t have the budget to go Intel, otherwise it\u0027d be an easy choice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E So, should he stick with the A-series, or would it be a better use of resources to go straight to FX-series?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T23:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the CPU-only upgrade, I\u0027d recommend the Athlon X4 860K.

My buddy ended up ordering the A10, which I installed for him yesterday. Despite being in a mini case (I felt like I was performing surgery on a midget, especially being just after installing all my components in the Termaltake Level 10 case) it was actually the easiest CPU change-out I\u0027ve ever done. Both the CPU and Heat Sink were very cooperative, and the PC only required one restart to get going. He can now run WoW on Ultra (although he could do that with the A4), and can run Titanfall and BattleField 4 without hiccup, and both look beautiful. Looking forward to getting Battlefront.
