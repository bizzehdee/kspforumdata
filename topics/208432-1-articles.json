I want to disable testflight parts failure or minimize it because that\u0027s so annoying and RP-1 is enough challenging for that. The problem is that I don\u0027t find anything that can help me to do it, so if someone can help me that would be welcomed. ps:\u00A0 I have testflight 2.2.0.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-03T03:25:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to add on discussion\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pehvbot","CreatedById":182810,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-04T07:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can disable it from the TestFlight panel in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E view.
