It hasn\u0027t been updated in quite a while but the only thing I am aware of that is different in 1.0 is that engines can override the flow mode for each of the resources they use (jet engines do this in 1.0 to make the fuel draw like monopropellant rather than liquid fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Laie said, radial decouplers have allowed crossfeed since at least 0.23.5 and almost certainly earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T01:29:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not apparent in the picture, but the SRBs are topped with small LFO cans.

I wound up ditching the design. Finding out that an FL-T800 and a LV-T30 gives better dV and comparable trust to a Kickback for less funds has killed the viability of large SRBs for me. Now I just stack Fleas for a launch TWR of 6\u002B to get to high subsonic (250 m/s) faster, then linger there until terminal velocity is over 500 m/s before breaking the mach barrier. Current design is focused on a higher dV last stage on a 909. However, I\u0027ve unlocked nukes and turbojets. Now I\u0027m transitioning to nuclear tugs, space planes, and ultra-efficient vacuum rescue pods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
