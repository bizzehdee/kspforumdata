(un)Fortunately it has a very low take-off speed, making landing pretty hard at speeds above 25 m/s. Water landings should be nice and gentle, and I wouldn\\\u0027t go faster than 30m/s. To take off from the water you should come to a full stop, pull back on the stick and open the throttle, the plane should leave the water swiftly. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T03:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s beautiful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pingonaut","CreatedById":15723,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T16:20:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s really amazing, nice work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tembaco","CreatedById":26566,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T21:46:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGlad you like it, I hope this\\\u0027ll inspire some people to make seaplanes as they are quite rare.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razgriz86er","CreatedById":13111,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T01:38:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESea planes are a bit tricky for me.
