Each Sequencer has it\u0027s own set of States.\n\nKnown issues:\n\n- AGX support is temporarily disabled (will be re-enables on release, given that AGX will be updated).\n- Multiple IR capable crafts in physics range was not tested properly, please report any issues.\n\nDownload: ~~[https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/IR-Sequencer/releases/tag/1.0-beta2](https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/IR-Sequencer/releases/tag/1.0-beta2)~~\n\nUse beta3  [https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/IR-Sequencer/releases/tag/1.0-beta3](https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/IR-Sequencer/releases/tag/1.0-beta3)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-22T17:31:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2016 05:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Ziw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kardel","CreatedById":118358,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T02:49:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, Tirehtoori R.I.P said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E and you can\u0027t make a walker using only 2 rotatrons in one leg ^^\n\u003E \n\nExcept you can, My mech is merely an attempt to do something based on this.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9iO-9aTtycQ?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIt only uses 2 Sequenced rotatrons for movement and a kOS script to detach the grapple foot on it\u0027s respective side whenever hes going to give another step.\n\nThe \u0022schematics\u0022 you gave me, as I said before, I wanted to do something simple, and thats nothing but really similar to the complicated set up you did in one of your videos.
