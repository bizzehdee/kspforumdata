Has anybody made the connection between Kerbal-space and the Haruki Murakami (a recurring Nobel favorite) novel 1Q84? In the book, the protagonist finds herself in a slightly skewed parallell world that she calls 1Q84 (instead of 1984 - the year the story takes place). One of the things that makes her realize this isn\u0027t 1984 in Japan is that there is a second moon in the sky. It\u0027s small and pale green. Perhaps it was the inspiration for Minmus?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway - a real question: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in the middle of a very interesting career game in 0.24.
