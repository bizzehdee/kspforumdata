I know I could do a mobile mining set-up in case I find something better but I have a more permanent set-up in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERovers on Minmus, about how much mass do you need for the wheels to get a decent grip (I\u0027d rather avoid downward facing thrusters)? I landed a rover with a mass of roughly 5 tons and that seems to be way too light; lot\u0027s of tire spin, understeer, and slow to come to a stop. I\u0027m guessing that with Minmus\u0027 low gravity this problem will not be entirely erased, but is there a mass \u0026amp; tire combination that seems to help alleviate this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi Fenris\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo somewhere around the equator of Minmus i think you can find still more Yield... i have found a comfortable place with more far more than 8.0... How it is at the higher latitudes and poles... i am researching still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMining in Low gravity... i think you found your answer by yourself... i personally ended up with a huge thing on Minmus, after many severe problems... it is somehow very complex getting that ore and move/transfer stuff around safely. Manouvering on ground is tricky. I have 8 Wheels on my crafts up there, tweaked breakingtorque in front and back... maybe sixwheelers work also but fourwheelers... i guess not so good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe personally i prefer mobility than precise landing. The last meters to the Fuellifter rolling, connect and putting down the drills... easy. And moving around Ressources... the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther makes no sense to me, a all in one system seems not efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T17:23:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mikki\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Homusubi","CreatedById":137156,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T15:23:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got a Minmus miner on the ground today. Rockomax 32 (big) fuel tank, a few much smaller ones, one ore tank, four drills, one ISRU, some surface and hexagonal scanners, two Gigantors, and two nuclear charge generators. not exactly thrilled with progress, but it\u0027s probably more convenient than most of what\u0027s been exhibited here (I haven\u0027t read all ten pages), for the simple reason that it only takes one Kerbin launch to get it to Minmus (so if I want to add more solar panels, I can do so easily - which I will have to do seeing as my current setup is only sustainable with three drills active).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it carries way more fuel than is required to land on Minmus from a fairly low Minmutian (is that the adjective?) orbit, so it is then possible to simply bring the mining station up to my interplanetary rocket rather than using shuttle craft while still being able to transport about 2/3 of a big Rockomax tank\u0027s worth of fuel each time.
