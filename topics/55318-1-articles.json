My question is not how could it be done, what design would it take, but the practicality of it. Sort of. Let me explain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you\u0027ve got a large station, in the form of an O\u0027Neill Cylinder, the whole thing is spinning enough to give close to 1g at the outer edge, the amount doesn\u0027t really matter. These have been used a lot in sci-fi shows, the one that comes to mind and actually brought on this train of thought is Babylon 5. If you\u0027re standing inside this thing, you can look \u0022up\u0022 and see the land curving up over your head until you\u0027re looking across the diameter of the station to the land on the other side, where everyone there is \u0022upside down\u0022 looking \u0022up\u0022 at you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the artificial gravity reduces the closer you get to the center of the cylinder, and is effectively zero at the exact center, climbing a ladder or some other means to get to the center reduces the gravity you\u0027re experiencing until it becomes zero, or at least very small, correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here\u0027s the question, since this type of gravity isn\u0027t \u0022real\u0022 but is determined by you having a centripetal force applied to you from being in contact with the rotating portion of the ship, if you climb to the center of the thing, then let go, won\u0027t you effectively be in a zero gravity situation, or close to it, allowing you to then float down to the \u0022ground\u0022 because you haven\u0027t touched the rotating part of the station in order to have the force applied to you again? Say you have a small thruster pack or MMU on you, could you then maneuver around just above the ground in essential zero g to do whatever task needed to be done that would normally require a ladder?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems to me that would be how it would work? Until you touch the outside, spinning, part of the station, you\u0027ll essentially be in zero gravity? Let\u0027s for the sake of argument say there are no other forces acting on you like air movement and such, or they are at least negligible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can imagine people in such a station climbing the center to achieve zero g and then float down to the ground to see just how close they can get without touching it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless I\u0027m completely wrong, which is quite possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T21:13:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, if you ignore the air you can do that on earth as well: just run with oribital velocity at ground height.

The main reason is that while here on Earth air counteracts the force of gravity during a free fall, in a rotating station the air is doing both adding to the gravitational effect AND counteracting it. This creates a funky acceleration that can fluctuate based on air density which might not be even.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- The rotational effect causes a curving effect on any ballistic trajectories.

Otherwise, if you approach it in a straight line as most spacecrafts will travel, you will experience a very quick singular rendez-vous (which will feel a lot like crashing into the side if you don\u0027t time it perfectly). The one place where this won\u0027t be an issue is encountering the station at it\u0027s ends, near the center of rotation. Which is what they did in Rendez-vous with Rama. It\u0027s the same problem you\u0027d experience rendez-vous-ing with the interior edge if it was a vacuum and you were just floating by, close to the inner surface.

You have a ship already sitting on the floor. You get in and tun on the lifting engines. They lift you off the floor. Did you suddenly start having control issues? No. From your perspective, you are just affected by gravity. The ship is already moving with the station, and keeping its orientation with respect to station. All you have to do is manage thrust to get hover. It\u0027s no harder than flying a VTOL jet on Earth.

I seem to recall that they did that - ships would approach the end of the station right on its center axis and drift inside through a giant set of blast doors. They never showed how the ships moved after that, but I imagined that the hangar bay inside was a big space with berths around the edge of it that you drifted out to and then had to match velocities with. As long as the berths are much closer to the axis than the outer floor of the station is, they\u0027d have lighter \u0022gravity\u0022 and slower sideways velocity to contend with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of other things they sort of \u0022got right\u0022 - ish were that the fighters (okay, yes even HAVING some sort of manned fighter is a bit silly, I\u0027ll grant you) were launched from berths in the outer wall of the station, mounted in clamps that aimed them downward facing the \u0022floor\u0022, so that when the clamps let go the fighters would be naturally flung outward from the station\u0027s rotation. (I note they never tried to explain how the fighters came back and got re-installed in those launch bays after use.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey also had the notion that housing was not all at the same radius - that there were several floors of residential decks and the aliens lived in whichever deck was at the right radius to give them a fake gravity closer to what they were used to on their home planet.

First, we agree that we can set up a pass at an almost arbitrary distance from the station to have ship at rest at closest approach, right? There is question of precision, but we aren\u0027t trying to grab a dumb cargo drone with a station. We don\u0027t need it to pass within inches or even meters of the station. If you can give me \u002B/- 50m, I\u0027d shoot for a 100m approach and it\u0027d be fine. Rest can be covered under power. Ideally, you need to go from free-fall to accelerating at 1g precisely as you pass under the station, at which point you are hovering and the rest of approach is trivial. Realistically, you can\u0027t do that, but you don\u0027t need to, either. What you do is start throttling up a few seconds in advance, which will bring up the line of closest approach closer to the station, curving in your trajectory. So long as you watch the time to closest approach, closest approach distance, and your velocity relative to the station, it\u0027s a pretty straight forward maneuver with a window in tens of seconds at 1G.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure that what you were working on required a perfect approach precision and an instant transition from inertial to accelerated movement. This is not the case with a ship being flown by an experienced pilot. It\u0027s just not the same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you know what? I\u0027m prepared to bring it down to a simulation. I have a VTOL simulation I\u0027ve written a while ago. With a few modifications, I can get it to simulate something space-worthy. All I have to do is get rid of all of the aerodynamics code, modify thrusters a bit, change the control scheme, and add a bit more info on the HUD. Oh, and I\u0027d have to model and simulate a simple station, I guess. That will require a few extra bits of collision code, but it\u0027s no trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I need from you are parameters you are willing to accept. Specifically, with what precision you would allow me to measure my velocity and position relative to the station? I\u0027d also take accelerometer data and combine it with tracking data via Kalman filter. So I need error on acceleration data as well. And what about the Shuttle? For simplicity, lets say maximum linear and angular accelerations you\u0027d allow. Naturally, I need something in excess of 1G along the vertical axis. Everything else will be pretty gentle, but I\u0027m worried if I just make up numbers you\u0027ll accuse me of rigging it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the station, lets say 40 RPH as mentioned earlier? That would put the station\u0027s diameter at about 4km to provide 1G at the outer edge. That\u0027s a nice big target to aim for. I can do either a wheel-type station or a tether.
