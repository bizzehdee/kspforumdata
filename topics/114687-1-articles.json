Experiment results will be converted into varying amounts of points in these sub categories (which categories get the points depends on the experiment), then different combinations of these points will be required to unlock different tech nodes.

The plan is to keep the same science values with all experiments, just split those points among the categories (in different proportions depending on the experiment), so the stock science points would be equal to the sum of all the new categories and could still be consumed when a tech node is unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I just monitor for the transmission/recovery of experiments (maybe just by tracking changes to the science archives?) then I can trigger the addition of the points to the category totals. I\u0027m betting if I look at Kerbal Construction Time\u0027s delayed research feature I can figure out how to control research node unlocking to also require the designated amounts of subcategory points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince mobile lab research doesn\u0027t return its science as a result of a particular experiment (does it?) that would be a trickier one to deal with. An easy solution would be regularly comparing the stock science totals to the category totals, then adding equally to all category totals until their sum matches stock points again. If I could capture and maintain a list of experiments that are added to labs as data I could at least create some sort of weighted distribution ratio to be used in those checks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part I have the least idea how to approach is presenting the relevant information in a useful way.
