There\u0027s no good contract packs! Some of my favorites are the SETI pack, the RT pack, and the \u0022giving aircraft a purpose\u0022 pack. Also tourism plus was nice.

Are there any contract packs at all that are updated for 1.2 yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-20T16:21:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince (nearly?) all contract packs require contract configurator, and contract configurator is not updated for ksp 1.2 yet, I do not expect any of them to be cleared for ksp 1.2 at the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
