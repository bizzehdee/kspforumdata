First the RAPIER is a great engine at high altitudes and speeds, but mediocre at idle on the ground. If your plane is heavy it might not have the thrust. The wiplash is much better at lower altitudes and speeds, and not bad at high speeds and altitudes. I\u0027ll often use one wiplash and an appropriate number of RAPIERs on my SSTOs since it gives the plane a good all around capability (it is completely possible to create an SSTO that uses only one or the other though). You may also need to adjust your landing gear placement because you need to have some leverage to pull up and take off. Generally you want your landing gear just behind your CoM and RAPIERs are heavy enough to shift it a little. You also may not have enough pitch authority to pull up, though it doesn\u0027t take much and you can take off with a different engine so it isn\u0027t as likely, still a canard or tail plane may help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To build a cargo SSTO I usually build an SSTO that is a little overbuilt and add a cargo bay roughly at the CoM (this keeps flight characteristics roughly the same after you drop off your cargo). You might need to bump up the engines and fuel to compensate for the dead weight. The hardest part is often times building the payload in the bay. Usually I attach a docking port to the outside, build my cargo, and then move it into the cargo bay using the \u0022node attach mode\u0022 (hold the \u0022mod\u0022 key for your OS) so it snaps to the node instead of surface attaching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor docking ports I usually use the protected docking port as a nose code, though it probably won\u0027t fit the style you\u0027re going for. The inline Mk2 or inline clamp-o-tron are usually pretty easy to add to your design and they give it a nice look and feel, but they are a little harder to dock with though that is just my opinion. Any of them are perfectly usable, just make sure the inline ones are placed far from any obstructions like tail fins that might prevent you from docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My overall advice is to keep your SSTO as light as possible. Reducing weight is often much easier than adding more engines or fuel. The \u0022more engines\u0022/\u0022more fuel\u0022 cycle is a trap I often fell into when I starting making SSTOs. Don\u0027t be afraid to remove unneeded fuel, you can keep yourself from reaching orbit by carrying around a few extra tons of fuel. Try to find the right balance of LF and LF\u002BO tanks, because it is a waste of fuel to send up oxidizer you can\u0027t burn because you used the corresponding fuel with air-breathing engines. Don\u0027t be afraid to go through some trial and error. SSTOs are a lot of fun, but they usually operate on thin margins because they don\u0027t have the luxury of dropping the extra weight of a stage once you\u0027re done with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile they are pre-1.0 the best generic aircraft guides I\u0027ve run across are \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080\u003C/a\u003E and\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-TFRnVyjso?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E.
