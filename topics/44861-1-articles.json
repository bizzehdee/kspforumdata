The technique is exactly the same as for setting up a rendezvous with anything else. Going to other planets is, after all, nothing but a solar orbit rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Get into solar orbit with your rescue vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Set up a manoeuver node to plan the intercept. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Once you get to the intercept point, thrust directly towards the target until you\u0027re even closer, then start to slow down and match velocities, and edge your way in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only difference is the scale. Your \u0022closest approach\u0022 is likely to be several thousand kilometers away. That\u0027s OK! Since solar orbits are so huge this does not mean you are going to miss your target, you will have plenty of time to do your approach burn and then your synchronization burn. You are, of course, also going to need to take a vessel with enough delta V to get into solar orbit and back to Kerbin, but this is only an engineering problem, not a problem with solar rendezvous in itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my \u0022legacy of the astraeus\u0022 video I use a Dres slingshot to get one massive ship into solar rendezvous with another massive ship. There\u0027s half a minute or so of footage of the map view while I\u0027m doing this which demonstrates just how far away you can be from your target and still perform an intercept, even with ships that accelerate very very slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-04T02:38:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2013 02:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T10:33:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had the same problem once, but I only just left Kerbin\u0027s SOI so my Kerbol orbit was almost the same as Kerbin\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the years vessel and planet showed a close encounter - with what was left in the RCS tanks I closed the distance of this encounter from the other side of the star (practically) and managed to enter the atmosphere (no DeadlyReentry installed yet, do not know what would have happened ...) for a mostly glorious landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe select your craft, target Kerbin and time accelerate until you get a good encounter?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T11:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MrKicker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MrKicker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E.....
