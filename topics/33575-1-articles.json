It is written by a chief chemists working in the middle of everything, and he has a lot of interesting stories. This book contains advanced chemistry, but it is written with humor (see the second quote in my signature). If you know a little chemistry, it\u0027s even better, but it is fun to read even if you don\u0027t have a lot of knowledge regarding chemistry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this book is quite old, so if you want it in paper, you\u0027ll have to go to the nearest antique store and ask them.
