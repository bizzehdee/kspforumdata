I\u0027ve broken down and decided to add my first mod, the Subassembly Loader; that one just strikes me as being useful without necessarily being \u0022cheating\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I was wondering first if there were any folks out there swapping around customized parts they\u0027d developed, and if so if anyone could point me in the direction of a \u0022heavy docking port\u0022. I saw a picture not to long ago where someone had strutted up four docking ports to the side of a Rockomax Adapter 02; something like that one would be awesome if it\u0027s available. The interplanetary ship I was building (the one with five LV-Ns) assembled the way it was designed but I discovered that it wobbled pretty badly under thrust - steering was a bigger nightmare than I anticipated, to say nothing about keeping a steady course. Any help here would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sol_Rokks_Teddy","CreatedById":57145,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T21:36:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFusTek adds more docking ports that are much strogner than the stock ones.

Quantum strut is also very good for strengthening docking connections.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T21:41:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i34.tinypic.com/4k8kyb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224k8kyb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i36.tinypic.com/2rh37k5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222rh37k5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i38.tinypic.com/6oorpk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226oorpk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust download the craft files at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24990-0-19-1-Orbital-Propellant-Depot-Olympus-II\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24990-0-19-1-Orbital-Propellant-Depot-Olympus-II\u003C/a\u003E and save the part as your own subassembly\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T21:42:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep - that\u0027s the one.
