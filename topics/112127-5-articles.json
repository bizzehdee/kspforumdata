I guess your part is most similar to my newer \u0027dark\u0027 (e not light driven) parts. For them I\u0027ve started using an \u0027inheritance hierarchy\u0027 style, making some parts a copy \u0026 modify of a parent part and just adding model and resource processing scaling (e.g. DarkRedS.cfg scales DarkRedM.cfg etc) just to move the \u0027magic\u0027 numbers \u0026 most of the processing definition to one place - DarkGreenL.cfg is the root of that attempt and references the actual magic numbers in SoylentConfig.cfg. I tried to make those balance with the \u0027host\u0027 LS and then \u0027backed out\u0027 human scale realistic mass \u0026 volume for the parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You could take a similar approach and \u0027base\u0027 your part .cfg on one of mine (add what scaling you think appropriate) and it will get any change I make \u0027for free\u0027 (any mistakes also). Or you could make your .cfg a \u0027base\u0027 and ref my config for the magic numbers, and get any changes there \u0027for free\u0027. Or just cpy paste the resource processing bits into your config.\n\u003E \n\nThat sounds really useful.  And yeah, that was basically the plan - to add a Soylent mode to the algae container.  (I may also do a hellfire container based on the current fuel cell, and a Soylent Starter based on the current Xenon container.  Just to have a full set.)  As I said: I\u0027m focusing on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS, since that\u0027s what my mod touches, but if it\u0027s that simple I may make a full set for Nils277.  (Depending on how much work I feel like doing when I get to that part.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-01T00:22:16Z","Content":"Hi all, I\u0027m trying to adapt this to Kerbalism Simplified but I\u0027m struggling.
