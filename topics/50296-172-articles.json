As I\u0027ve said before, DRE does not implement its own thermodynamic system. It modifies the existing stock thermo system that was introduced in KSP 1.0 and it relies on the existence of certain data called PartThermalData (that\u0027s the actual name of the class, I\u0027ll refer to it as PTD) and it is generated for every single part that exists in KSP regardless of whether it is marked as \u0027physicsless\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe absence of the PTD is what was causing the nullref errors for some players before. So I checked to make sure that the PTD was actually present (and not null) before moving forward with further thermal related code. But I was logging the error and that caused performance killing lag for players so I removed the error logging code. That and the aforementioned changes treating massless parts as having a minimum of 1kg of mass is really the best I can do. Bottom line is that if I don\u0027t have that PTD to work with then it\u0027s going to cause problems. And it didn\u0027t go missing because of a bug in Deadly Reentry.

What\u0027s the best ascent profile for the recent version of DE? I\u0027m a new player. Trying to maintain low speed and making a smooth gravity turn makes velocity vector fall down the horizon. Increasing thrust makes the rocket fall apart. Struts and fuel lines go first, that makes further flight almost impossible. I understand the physics of the process and how it works in real world, but can\u0027t figure out how to complete it in the game. Also try to build my rocket as aerodynamic as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShall I just go straight up to the upper atmosphere and then make a pitchover maneuver?
