Hope that answers your question. (overall it will be about 5500 Delta-v). To measure how much delta-v a ship has you can use Mechjeb or Kerbal Engineer Redux. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: manuvering to Mun:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elaunch, gravity turn at 10 KM, when Apoasis is at least 70 Km, turn completley horizons ways until you have a periapsis of 70ish also. Next, warp until the Mun is on the Prograde horizon, the horizon you are moving towards. Go to map view, burn prograde until you see a mun ecounter. The burn in different directions until you see your future Mun periapsis dropping. Eventually the Mun periapsis sign will dissapear, but there will be a yellow orbit line going into Mun. That means you have a crash course. Hope this helps? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-19T03:43:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2013 03:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mr.Rocket\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T07:08:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMuch like Rocket said, but it\u0027d be better to play around with nodes than random burns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
