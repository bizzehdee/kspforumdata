A first attempt was made with Kerbal 4, but not 3 minutes into the launch, a malfunction caused the Service Module engine to fire while the core stage was still boosting. Thankfully, the new emergency abort systems worked flawlessly, and the Kerbal 4 crew (Henfred Kerman, Geofvey Kerman, and Corbo Kerman) escaped with no injuries. The same could not be said for their underwear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter tracing the flaw to improper wiring and stage-control programming, KSC decided to try again. Kerbal 5 was prepared with a new crew. Bill Kerman was selected as Commander, with Dilfel Kerman as pilot and astronomer Sigdorf Kerman as mission specialist. This would be Bill\u0027s second space mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReaching the Mun\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal 5 launched on Day 180, and achieved orbit with none of the problems that plagued Kerbal 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ft8zbfy.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022Ft8zbfy.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELiftoff!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/prGj7sV.png?2\u0022 alt=\u0022prGj7sV.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKerbal 5 separating from the KerbalLifter-III core stage.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite suggestions from some scientists that Kerbal 5 should employ something called a \u0022free return\u0022 trajectory, KSC mission planners opted for a more direct approach. Kerbal 5 took a little over 5 hours to reach the Mun once it completed its trans-Munar injection burn, and entered into a prograde orbit. Here the first real concern manifested itself when Dilfel reported the spacecraft\u0027s fuel consumption. As a result, plans to place Kerbal 5 in a 100 km circular orbit, inclined for maximum coverage of the Mun\u0027s surface were scrapped, and the spacecraft settled into an elliptical orbit with a 350 km apoapsis and a 150 km periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d3c4Gvk.png?2\u0022 alt=\u0022d3c4Gvk.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKerbal 5 conducting its Munar orbital insertion burn.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless, the views of the Mun were superb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mjbdJfw.png?2\u0022 alt=\u0022mjbdJfw.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESigdorf: \u0022So many craters...

However, while conducting the burn to place the spacecraft into Kerbin orbit, Dilfel\u0027s worst fears were confirmed - the spacecraft exhausted its fuel supply before it could complete the burn. Kerbal 5 was trapped in an elliptical orbit, 194 km Pe / 445 km Ap, with no way to return home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately for the crew of Kerbal 5, help was a lot closer than they could have dreamed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9RhFsfX.png?2\u0022 alt=\u00229RhFsfX.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESupporter 1 under construction in the VAB.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next scheduled mission to KerbalLab would have involved a mid-mission resupply of the space station by a robot supply ship. This vessel, Supporter 1, had just cleared its ground checks when Kerbal 5 was stranded in orbit. As Supporter 1 was designed to carry 4 tons of fuel, and another 4 tons of RCS monopropellant, Flight directer Gene Kerman ordered the supply ship to be launched at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kP3YOdp.png?2\u0022 alt=\u0022kP3YOdp.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESupporter 1 approaches the stranded Kerbal 5\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tnP0Ygg.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022tnP0Ygg.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESaved!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The supply ship took close to 4 hours to rendezvous with us, and docking was nearly flawless,\u0022 Bill Kerman reported shortly after Supporter 1 began to transfer its vital cargo. \u0022Nobody tell Jebidiah that a robot beat his docking record.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1uEnVyP.png?2\u0022 alt=\u00221uEnVyP.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIt\u0027s job complete, Supporter 1 burns up in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a fresh supply of fuel, Dilfel was able to circularize the spacecraft\u0027s orbit, and even attempted to bring the capsule down near KSC.
