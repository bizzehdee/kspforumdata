There is nothing quite as frustrating as placing your ladder 1 micron too low and the stupid Kerbal won\u0027t climb up on to the cockpit of the plane. Especially problematic since they redid the Mk1 Cockpit model. Those air intake looking things that aren\u0027t actually air intakes make it hard to get the ladder just right."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerano","CreatedById":107460,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T02:16:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There goes my hopes of another guy who knows about the book...\n\nI was going to add that we\u0027ve never been at war with Eurasia either, but then I realised we probably have. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"boxley","CreatedById":111449,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T02:17:22Z","Content":"val has the perfect 8D face"},{"CreatedByName":"Yellowburn10","CreatedById":107558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T02:27:37Z","Content":"WAIT Wait wait wait wait waitwatiwatiwaitwait \n\nSquad actually posted a *release date*?? \n\nLike, so we actually *know* when it will come???\n\n**WHAT IS THIS BLASPHAMY**\n\nI mean, the countdown riddles were giving a pretty good idea of when 1.0 was coming out, but when\u0027s the last time squad actually said \u0022Ok guys, so-and-so release is coming out on this-and-this date?\u0022\n\nThis is a legit question\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T02:33:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 02:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yellowburn10**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T02:30:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E WAIT Wait wait wait wait waitwatiwatiwaitwait \n\u003E Squad actually posted a *release date*?? \n\u003E \n\u003E Like, so we actually *know* when it will come???\n\u003E \n\u003E **WHAT IS THIS BLASPHAMY**\n\nThere is a precedent...
