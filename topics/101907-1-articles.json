So Valentina would be Jeb\u0027s sister. No there\u0027s nothing wrong with a brother loving his sister, but I don\u0027t think Jebediah would *ever* think his sibling would be cool, or anyone for that matter. I think his ego is too big for that. Also, Val is a pilot, I doubt she\u0027s be taken by *science* specifically.\n\nStill though, I *really really* like the art. I am just imagining it is different Kerbals instead of Jeb and Val, especially since they\u0027re in their EVA suits. The proportions are just right for Kerbals, and I like how you imagine the texture of Kerbal Hair actually flies out in the \u0022real-ish\u0022 world. These drawings are all adorable and fun to look at. The \u0022plot\u0022 of this one is just the only problem i have with it. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nMinmus Ice Cream is truly magnificent. I\u0027ve always wanted to see this picture done properly, I couldn\u0027t make it look right in pencil.\n\nThe first drawing, the Eve one is interesting. The mountains seem too tall for Evian Gravity, and the snow-tops of them don\u0027t seem to fit with Eve\u0027s heat. The picture of Val and one of the other orange-suits at Val is also really great. You do the facial expressions magnificently.\n\nThe Kraken Attack picture as also really good. The cell shading and coloring on it was done really nicely, and you can tell it took a long time to do, it looks great. The Kraken looks like a 10-Kilometer-Wide beast enveloping the space around Bop. Again, the facial expressions look great here.\n\nOn many of the drawings, I love the background stars and galaxy, and some of the surface details on Minmus or Eve and the jetpack exhaust near Vall."},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T19:14:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Personally I am a firm believer that the orange suits are all siblings.

It\u0027s pretty weird, now that I think about it.\n\nI have to admit, I do draw their a bit too \u0027floofy\u0027 for my own liking. But it\u0027s impossible for me to draw their hair as it is canonically, \u0027cause it sorta grows inwards to the middle of their heads while remaining perfectly flat, and that doesn\u0027t make any sense in reality.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Minmus Ice Cream is truly magnificent.
