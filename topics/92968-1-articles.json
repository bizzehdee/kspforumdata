I know we are in Beta now, but it\u0027s still more dangerous to land in water than on land.. Example.. earlier I was playing and had a tiny lander with a parchute on it coming down and landed it on Kerbin after some long science collection.. Now.. after this I used the same ship.. went and collected more science stuff, but my end trajectory planted me in the ocean.. Well, coming down I was at the same impact speed, but when I hit the water, my entire ship blew apart, and I lost all my science.. Now, not that I ever finished college, but shouldnt hitting water at 8-10 mps be safer than hitting land at 8-10 mps? not to mention the ship is made of metal (unless kerbals somehow use plastic on everything) why is it completely disintegrating on water landings, and not on land landings? (o.0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This isn\u0027t really something that needs to be discussed as it is part of the game that is pretty much broken.
