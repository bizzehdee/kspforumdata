Likewise for the new Antenna, due to the way it folds, it has to be mounted on the top of the probe in order for it to point to Kerbin. Also, the larger solar panels aren\u0027t enough to power \u0022Dawn\u0022 so they\u0027re next to useless for this project.\n\nI only ask that Surface Mounting support be added to the Infrared Camera \n\n-or-\n\nadd stack nodes to the sides of the probe core\n\nI\u0027m not sure how to fix the Antenna issue, and the power output of the new solar panels should be upped to a minimum of 3 or 4.\n\n![ivduTmq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ivduTmq.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T06:02:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 06:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xyphos**"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T05:37:43Z","Content":"I see your Problem and understand what you mean.\n\nYou could place the parts on top of the Probecore and rotate it round by 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\n\nThis would make the camera face the right direction but would also make it look more like a contraption than a high-tech space probe ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBut yeah.

Stick it on a cubic strut, surface mount the strut then gizmo it to hide the strut. Not sure a side mounted stack node would help you all that much. I know past versions of KSP had some weird quirks with that, the 6 way hub a prime example, although I havent actualy used that thing in 1.x so not sure if they managed to work that out.
