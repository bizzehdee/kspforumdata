When inserting pictures in a forum post you have the option to \u0022Insert existing attachment\u0022 or use an image from a URL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, I have no existing attachments. But the fact that such an option exists implies there\u0027s a way to upload attachments. But I can\u0027t for the life of me figure out how to do that.
