Those aren\u0027t really game breaking, they\u0027ll just need a small transition on the user\u0027s part.

The default crew, no crew, and random crew modes are already supported inherently through the Clear (All) and Fill (All) buttons, combined with the randomize option. I suppose the \u0022rotate crew\u0022 option isn\u0027t, but apparently that wasn\u0027t functioning in RealRoster anyway? If enneract decided to submit some code to KCT to improve the crew selection, I would gladly accept it (or even work with him on some features). It was mentioned previously that defaulting to having a pilot in an otherwise unpiloted ship would make sense, as would options for \u0022senior crew\u0022 or \u0022newbies\u0022 so you can have your best crew or newest members (by experience and level) easily assignable.

If I could get a list of Kerbal names in the order they should be added to a ship, I can make KCT use that as the default arrangement. Then that mod could work for the stock game as well as for KCT, and would save me the time of writing my own code for doing crew rotations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-09T18:29:24Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2015 06:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T19:10:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SaintWacko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SaintWacko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother bug I ran across last night: If you have a ship sitting on the launch pad (and probably in storage as well) and edit it so the edit makes it too heavy for the launch pad, when you hit Save Edits it will give you the message about it being too heavy, and the editor will close, but the ship will no longer be in storage, it is just lost.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can say I\u0027ve had this happen as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ogamaga","CreatedById":66292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T21:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was very worried when I saw all of the missing scenarios (things used to save data to the save file), but then I realized this is a save with a bunch of mods removed.

I resolved the earlier issue by fixing the name list so that all the names have Kerman as a last name - the same fix has been applied here and it isn\u0027t working. I\u0027ve checked the output log, and nothing is screaming out errors about updating the save as far as I can see.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T05:35:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis one looks like it\u0027s specific to KCT (maybe with something else intertwined?) but I\u0027m not positive as to the cause quite yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I noticed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the SpaceCenter scene, this occurred during loading, indicating an issue with ContractsWindow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E1/9/2015 8:00:25 PM,ContractsWindow,Parameter Type List Cannot Be Generated Or Loaded: System.FormatException: Input string was not in a correct format.\u003Cbr\u003E  at System.String.ParseFormatSpecifier (System.String str, System.Int32\u0026amp; ptr, System.Int32\u0026amp; n, System.Int32\u0026amp; width, System.Boolean\u0026amp; left_align, System.String\u0026amp; format) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at System.String.FormatHelper (System.Text.StringBuilder result, IFormatProvider provider, System.String format, System.Object[] args) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at System.String.Format (IFormatProvider provider, System.String format, System.Object[] args) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at System.String.Format (System.String format, System.Object[] args) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at ContractsWindow.DMC_MBE.LogFormatted (System.String Message, System.Object[] strParams) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at ContractsWindow.paramTypeContainer..ctor (System.Type PType) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at ContractsWindow.contractScenario.OnLoad (.ConfigNode node) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring flight, upon reading the persistence file and then it immediately being saved (kind of weird behavior) KCT logged this, but I\u0027m not positive why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[KCT] Reading from persistence.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[KCT] Setting active site to Stock\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[KCT] Setting active site to Stock\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[KCT] Saving KSC Stock\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003Cbr\u003E  at KerbalConstructionTime.KerbalConstructionTime.DelayedStart () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at KerbalConstructionTime.KerbalConstructionTimeData.OnLoad (.ConfigNode node) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at ScenarioModule.Load (.ConfigNode node) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at ScenarioRunner.AddModule (.ConfigNode node) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at ProtoScenarioModule.Load (.ScenarioRunner host) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at ScenarioRunner\u002B\t.MoveNext () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re running RSS, which kind?
