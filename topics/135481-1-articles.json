Ideas are needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for other systems, I had a few thoughts on this. The first step would be finding a system, which would mean having a large space telescope in orbit somewhere.\u00A0For the travel itself, I\u0027d take some cues from Larry Niven\u0027s \u0022Known Space\u0022 fictional universe. In that universe, the ancient Thrintun (my avatar is a Thrint!) hyperdrive required a realspace velocity of 0.8\u003Cem\u003Ec\u003C/em\u003E, while the modern hypedrive only needed to be outside of a gravity well. Combining those two for KSP purposes, you get a hyperdrive that needs to be traveling at a very high velocity, outside Kerbol\u0027s SOI. Basically, one would have to get on the correct\u00A0escape trajectory with a minimum energy (velocity based on distance from Kerbol, which would translate to the required velocity outside the SOI) at which point the hyperdrive would get the green light, that it\u0027s ready to activate once it has left the SOI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat would you find when you get there? I\u0027m not sure if it should be a randomly generated system so everyone gets their own experience, or a standard system so players can help each other out with tips and advice. Or a variety/selection of standard systems. I would think any target system should have at least one gas giant to help with capture, and at least one habitable oxy-atmosphere planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what would you do when you get there? Interstellar colonization is the ultimate challenge, which requires a colony ship. Rather than building some zillion part monstrosity, the crowning achievement of Kerbin\u0027s R\u0026amp;D facility would be the development of the hyperdrive and a \u0022colony module,\u0022 both of which should be sizable and massive. The colony module (which would hold at least a few dozen kerbals, if not over 100)\u00A0is the piece that needs to be landed on the habitable planet, and\u00A0would serve as the new tier zero\u00A0KSC (basically just a barn VAB), capable of bootstrapping everything the new colony needs, starting with resource gathering. I see two mineable resources being needed: ore for metals, and volatiles for fuels. As resources are gathered, more buildings can be built, like upgradeable manufacting facilities\u00A0and a tracking station and so on, to be able to build bigger and bigger rockets to explore the rest of the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, a system that complex is deep into mod territory, if not too deep. I think it would be worthy of paid DLC if it became part of KSP as the ultimate end-game, which would actually become a new beginning. More fleshing out is needed, but I think I\u0027ve presented a decent framework.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisclaimer: I haven\u0027t tried or even looked at the \u0027Interstellar\u0027 mod, so I have no idea how that works\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angeltxilon","CreatedById":149432,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-01T10:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222484632\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135481\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459411746\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161008\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RenegadeRad\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 31/3/2016 at 10:09 AM, RenegadeRad said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould we have more planets out there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea of new planets and moons has been suggested many times.
