And let me offer you some perspective. My area of specialization is U.S. History and U.S. Foreign Policy and most of my peers where I work have been teaching a lot longer than I am - and they have no concept of how to use technology. So they still assign work as they did back in the 1980s and 1990s, not realizing how computers and technology can work, be utilized, and be very beneficial within their courses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I suspect is your teacher doesn\u0027t understand technology and does not trust the student body to do what they are supposed to be doing. A brighter screen means he can see what you are working on as he walks by or scans the crowd with little difficulty. If you dim the screen, this makes it harder for him to see what you are doing from a distance. And in today\u0027s educational environment, teachers can be held accountable for anything students access in class and on the Internet. Now I am not saying you are not trustworthy, but there are some in your class whom you probably know should not be trusted. And unfortunately, your teacher cannot choose favorites to allow you to do something that he would not allow other students.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that said, and with today\u0027s environment, I have no idea why anyone would ever want to go into public education. Ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd about the assignment - ok, so he wants you to use tables. One of the requirements I have as a professor of history is I must publish something every two years (yeah, next year is that year for me...) Now I do not put paragraphs within tables, but I do use tables for data. But here\u0027s the thing - for whatever reason, he has decided it is part of the assignment. Therefore, just do it. It may not make sense, it may be a complete time waster, and believe me, I understand. But do it. I\u0027m willing to bet he is an older gentleman who was taught that you had to do it that way...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow about the depression - I\u0027d like to offer a recommendation that works for me: Get some time by yourself outdoors and away from a computer. Your brain and body were designed to be outdoors. Lack of sun, fresh air, and exercise can actually compound depression. For me, I walk five miles every morning - and it really makes a difference in how severe my depressive episodes get. Also, get rid of sodas; too much sugar can also cause depression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-08T22:29:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223143191\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156614\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221502196976\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289014\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022adsii1970\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, adsii1970 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow about the depression - I\u0027d like to offer a recommendation that works for me: Get some time by yourself outdoors and away from a computer.

I made the decision to learn coping skills and natural remedies rather than to turn to prescribed medications. I did this with the consent of my primary care doctor and against the wishes of the counselor. It was tricky, but I learned some things about human behavior. Fresh air and being outside help with the depression. Changing my diet and reducing the simple carbs and sugars also helped, as well as getting rid of all sodas. I\u0027ve even learned that at night, I needed to reduce the amount of artificial light about two hours before bed time - and that include exposure to computer screens and televisions, too. So now I use that time to read real (paper) books.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-08T23:49:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/177973-roadrunneraerospace/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022177973\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/177973-roadrunneraerospace/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RoadRunnerAerospace\u003C/a\u003E, it\u0027s nice to know that I\u0027m not the only cat in space around here!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoadRunnerAerospace","CreatedById":177973,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-08T23:51:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyup, sadly, I already changed my name, but now I want to change it to something more cat-like (AspacialCat?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StupidAndy","CreatedById":171175,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-09T22:21:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteam wont open, it just wont, so now I can\u0027t open any of my steam games, even if I have them on my desktop \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-09T23:20:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUPDATE: I got my computer back again, and, to my great surprise, everything was untouched!
