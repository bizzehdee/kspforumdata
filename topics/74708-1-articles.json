Why can\u0027t we do the same thing, but with more things to do and play with? Here\u0027s how I would see it: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When you create a new game, sandbox or career, there is a little box in the bigger create save box that shows how many rival space programs you want to compete with for fame, reputation, popularity, and money in said save file. The default would be 0 and you can set it to however high Squad wants it to be (that is if they ever go forth with this idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E. For now though, let\u0027s say the limit is 4 rival space programs. So you select how many rivals you want, let\u0027s say 1, and then in the same create save box there is a horizontal slider across the bottom of the create save box about the length of the box itself, this controls the difficulty (or how fast the rival space program(s) progress) with the left side being the easiest difficulty and the right side can be the hardest. This slider may be also used for setting how much money you start out with, how much money you get from missions, and etc. Anyway, say you set it to normal, or medium and then you create your save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You are in your new save file, you play around for a bit. To see how your rival space program is doing, you can go to the mission control building and have a look at their \u0022intel\u0022. There, you can see how your rivals are doing, you can see what ships they are building what publicity they are getting,how much money they are getting from grants, and what new missions they are planning, that they may or may not reveal to the public. If they are doing better than you, and they are planning a new mission, you can sabotage it in some ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E There are two ways to sabotage their launch, at least from what I can come up with. The first way is to do it yourself. You can quickly throw together a rocket or spaceplane, launch it, and crash it into the rival\u0027s rocket just as they are about to launch. This seems a little bit on the dark side, but desperate times do call for desperate measures, or maybe you might get a kick out of it, I don\u0027t know. The craft can be manned or robotic. I believe it should be robotic because when kerbals come to investigate the crash site and they find a body and you\u0027re the only other space program out there, you get accused and your program gets shut down. That is also why you must ensure that all parts of the craft are completely obliterated or else they might trace the parts back to you. Another way is to pay someone at the other space center(s) a lot of money and I mean a LOT to have them \u0022accidentally\u0022 mess up the mission in some way (make a \u0022mistake\u0022 in wiring the ship or maybe have one of the launch mechanisms fail causing the launch to fail, as well as the mission. This also comes with it\u0027s risks. For instance, the guy you hired may squeal to law enforcement either voluntarily or by force, so you can may extra Kash to \u0022ensure\u0022 that doesn\u0027t happen. The sabotage thing seems a bit weird, but hey, there is a little bit of corruption in almost everything!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That was my suggestion! If you have anything to add to this, want to share a thought, or just tell me \u0022Great idea!\u0022 please feel free to reply to the thread. I really do hope Squad puts this into the game, or at least have someone make it into a mod, but I would probably jackpot the lottery before that happens! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E Anyway, thanks for reading here and have a nice rest of your day! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-10T22:26:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2014 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by plainawesome\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMinor typo.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-10T23:02:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI greatly dislike the idea of factions in competition, violent or not.
