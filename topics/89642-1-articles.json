Sure you can build an aeroplane, but there isn\u0027t anywehre to go. Sure you can build a shuttle or spaceplane, but its way easier to just build another rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps if there were another ground site or two, doesn\u0027t have to be a full space centre, they could just be small towns or whatever. - alternatively, they could be full KSC clones, or perhaps rearranging the building wouldn\u0027t take too much effort?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you could have missions/contracts such as \u0022transport 20 kerbals from site A to site B\u0022, and other, more imaginative assignments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other ways to increase aeroplane content?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
