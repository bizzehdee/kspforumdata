I was wondering, having watched many youtube videos with differences, is there a better launch profile that is very fuel efficient. I guess it probably changes depending on your destination but generally what is most fuel efficient way to launch a rocket if say you are heading to the mun. (At what altitude do you begin a slight gravity turn? When do you turn completely parallel to kerbin and other such things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholas4132","CreatedById":30242,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T20:25:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to learn how to launch a rocket into orbit, download the mechjeb mod, and use the ascent autopilot to get to orbit. I usually orbit around 100km. Watch mechjeb carefully, and just mimic it the next time you launch a rocket without mechjeb. That\u0027s how I learned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boex","CreatedById":19600,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T20:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy \u0027parking orbit\u0027 is generally as low as possible, normally 70-80km. Launch profiles also depend on the power of your rocket. A powerful rocket I normally start my gravity turn at 10km, to about 45 degrees pitch. When my Apoapsis hits 50km I normally head completely horizontally. I\u0027ve been meaning to try more a few different approaches, but mine seems to be pretty efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbow","CreatedById":37863,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-03T00:28:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt 10km I tilt over to about 45degrees. Keep burning to I get apoapsis to 100km then cut power go horizontal until 30-20secs from Ap. Then burn to I get to orbital velocity. Probably not the most efficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the most efficient way is to keep pro-grade(orbital) but thats not always the most effective to get the orbit you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-03T08:15:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Munar/Minmus transfers, I usually make a parking orbit of 160km, because you can warp faster above 150km. If I want to do geosynchronous orbit, I use a parking orbit of 475km, because you have a nice convenient 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle to launch to GEO altitude. If I want to practice docking, I usually go to 475 or higher, because you are moving slower than in low orbit and the relative speed between the two ships is easier to manage with RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best moment to start the gravity turn depends a lot on your ship, but it\u0027s usually between 15 and 30km. You want to be pretty much horizontal when you reach 70km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pebble_garden","CreatedById":30150,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-03T08:34:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen to make the gravity turn depends a lot on your launch vehicle. I like to wait until it\u0027s climbing at 300m/s before I think of making the turn. But that generally happens between 10-20km. You don\u0027t want to turn too early or you spend too much time slicing diagonally through atmosphere. Yet you don\u0027t want to wait too long either, as it can waste fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found that if you make the gravity turn to 45 degrees pitch and your velocity vector drops below that, you\u0027ve turned too early. On the other hand if you adopt the 45 degree angle and the velocity vector doesn\u0027t follow, you\u0027ve turned too late. Ideally they should move in synch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re above 45-50km you can feel free to rotate to any pitch angle you like; the atmosphere is too thin to cause significant drag issues. So at that point I start pitching over to horizontal (or even a bit below that!) to start thrusting sideways and putting energy into my orbital velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne trick I\u0027ve learned is to mouseover your apoapsis and watch whether it\u0027s rising or falling as you start to burn sideways. If it\u0027s rising above your target orbit height you can burn a few degrees groundward to stop that. How many degrees you burn down depends on how far around your orbit you are from apoapsis. I don\u0027t recommend cheating down across that angle by burning more than 5-10 degrees before the phase angle of your apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-03T08:39:47Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2012 08:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by pebble_garden\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serratus","CreatedById":12069,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-03T10:41:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI make first gravity turn as soon as I clear the tower.
