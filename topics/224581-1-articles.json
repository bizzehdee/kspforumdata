It\u0027s not alphabetical, by size, by mass, or by part type. At least not consistently across all nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance here\u0027s a few nodes that directly follow each other in Tier 3, [Part name (Size - Part Type)]:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEnlarged Power Systems:\u003C/strong\u003E SP-XL \u0022Gigantor\u0022 (MD - Solar Panel), FC-01 (XS - Converter), Z-1K (S - Battery)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELong-Range Generation:\u003C/strong\u003E PB-NUK (XS - Generator), Z-4K (M - Battery), RA-100 (S - Transmitter), Communotron 88-88 (S - Transmitter), FCA-06 (S - Converter)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENuclear Power: \u003C/strong\u003EZ-375 (L - Battery), SP-XXL \u0022Colossus\u0022 (L - Solar Panel), KR4-P3 (S - Converter)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027re all over the place!

I wouldn\u0027t call this a bug because technically there isn\u0027t anything wrong, I don\u0027t know what the correct order would even be, it\u0027s just a weird quirk to the layout of parts in the nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be nice to see some cohesion in the parts list for the nodes just for the heck of it, but I recognize this is about as pedantic as a suggestion gets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-25T04:09:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would assume it\u0027s the internal part number, which likely is roughly in order of when the parts were added to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I don\u0027t know how to find that out. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KiwiShark","CreatedById":63364,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-25T12:26:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224382429\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224581\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221714018151\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Superfluous J\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Superfluous J said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would assume it\u0027s the internal part number, which likely is roughly in order of when the parts were added to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I don\u0027t know how to find that out. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo they have a hidden id like that?
