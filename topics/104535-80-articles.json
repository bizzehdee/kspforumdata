So if a certain force makes it turn, so it does, but once that force is removed it gently rubber-band back to it\u0027s original position?\n\n![]()![5B7PouF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5B7PouF.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-11T04:01:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2017 04:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by JeeF**"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-11T04:35:40Z","Content":"It used to be possible back in the day, but do not know if the method works under the newest KSP.\n\nYou can try though by making a copy of a part you want, renaming it, and playing about with its jointSpring and jointDamping values.
