I should have made a screenshot in case it wasn\u0027t a known bug but oh well, if needed I will post one later. I have noticed this same issue on many ships. If you make Onion staged ships it activates often. I am not sure what exactly the trigger is since not every onion staged ship shows this behavior.

First you have to set it up so that the center stage will burn out first if at full throttle, then by adjusting the limit of the center stage you can divine the rest. The burn time will go down as you increase the center stage throttle limiter and then stop changing as you hit the burn time of the boosters.
