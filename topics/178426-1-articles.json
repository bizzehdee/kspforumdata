You don\u0027t specify what version of the game you use, but this has been part of the game since 1.1.0, so you probably have them too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, make a backup of your current persistent.sfs (maybe add a date or something to the name so you can identify it later).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the directory \u0026lt;KSPinstalldir\u0026gt;\\saves\\\u0026lt;yoursavename\u0026gt;\\backup, you\u0027ll find 5 backup files of previous moments in your save. Test those to see if they will fix the issue, by copying them into the main save directory and renaming to persistent.sfs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
