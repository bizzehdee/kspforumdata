You\u0027ll notice the pods say \u002Bx oxygen and -y CO2 because they\u0027re consuming oxygen and producing CO2, and the recyclers are the other way. It\u0027s kind of arbitrary, but that is the way the game defines resource usage and I decide to match that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe likely reason you\u0027re not seeing oxygen go up when running a recycler is it\u0027s not producing oxygen faster than the kerbals are consuming it.

It could be you\u0027re short on power; even with a lot of batteries it\u0027s unlikely you\u0027re able to run through the night. It could be you\u0027re short on CO2. The recyclers don\u0027t have 100% conversion rates so unless you let the CO2 build up you\u0027ll never see them produce oxygen as fast as the kerbals are producing CO2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESplitting the recyclers and CO2 tanks is a possible idea. I don\u0027t really see much point in having more CO2 storage though. Either you\u0027re destroying it with a scrubber or converting it into oxygen with a recycler. You only really need enough storage to survive while the recycler can\u0027t run, for instance through the shadow of a planet.
