So, I looked for videos of anyone that has landed on the Mun on the default \u0022To the Mun\u0022 training/mission and couldn\u0027t find any! (share link if you know one)This one guy tried it and successfully got to the Mun but exploded on landing,... as have I multiple times now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the mission may seem like quite a simple one to the more advanced players,... and it might well be. But i think maneuvering with limited fuel for the landing might present an added challenge. It could also be a great contribution for novices like me to learn from, and for the person who does it, to flaunt their awesome skills and be hailed as a hero by the community for their awesome accomplishment\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESo without further ado, I challenge anyone to: Land the Landing Module on the default \u0022To the Mun - Part 1\u0022 training/mission, and post a link to the video on this thread\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EGod speed and good luck!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-06T19:09:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2018 07:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by AstroNate\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrvDancer85","CreatedById":180954,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-09T19:37:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing your just a bit to fast for the small landinggear at touchdown.
