More engines would also be nice. The only engine\u00A0that I can think of and is semi realistic, and could run on xenon would be VASIMR. Though it would probably need sick amounts of power to run on full thrust. I think nuclear reactors would be needed for those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-23T16:46:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222422049\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132613\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456039270\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022159023\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Destroyer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/21/2016 at 4:21 AM, Destroyer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd stock life support if u have time *wink*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s on the do not suggest list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease read it next time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-25T17:56:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore efficient engines would fill the very noticeable spaces between engines...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T05:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222422049\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132613\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456039270\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022159023\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Destroyer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/21/2016 at 11:21 PM, Destroyer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this may sound silly, but there should be some way, to get xenon from some sort of air intake or something.
