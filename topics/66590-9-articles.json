If you look at the cross sections of the Apollo CSM\u0027s you can see where Paul got the initial wedge concepts from - its far easier to service and swap out bays stacked around a central core, with generators and converters sharing the same space.

Sure, real space craft are designed with custom tanks that procedural parts models well, but that\u0027s not always the case. Gemini Titan was built around an existing ICBM as was Mercury Atlas and Redstone. Even the Saturn 1b was build from existing parts (Juno and Redstone tanks) so there is a precedent for having to use off the shelf components. Even the SLS uses many shuttle components. Ultimately though I like the challenge of having to complete this mission with those parts. My goal is to give you parts that are modular and customisable enough to make unique and efficient craft whilst still imposing the limitations of off the shelf part selection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus I love all the added EVA opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T16:26:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Duxwing\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Duxwing\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, procedural Parts has a procedural Life Support tank that can be smoothly tweaked to contain whatever TAC supplies, whereas this mod makes storage chunky and imperfect.
