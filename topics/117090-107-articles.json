And I\u0027m sure glad you adjusted the ablator value for the B CM. Due to the simple fact if you don\u0027t slow down enough to at least 5200 m/s before hitting atmosphere, you will cry.

poor frame rate.\u00A0 Though a \u0026lt;30 part (all stock) SSTO still killed my FPS during ascent (aero graphics I think).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGraphics\u003C/strong\u003E = bad.\u00A0 It looks like most stock parts have lost their specular mask entirely; shiny-metal things are... not.\u00A0 All of the parts in the editor are washed out and appear to lack depth due to the flat / ambient shading in use (combined with the loss of specular highlighting).\u00A0 No Unity Standard Shader support as far as I know.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUI (in-game)\u003C/strong\u003E = good and bad.\u00A0 The widgets are too big, the text is too small.\u00A0 So when you scale it to make.. for example the nav-ball.. be smaller, all the text becomes unreadable.\u00A0 They\u0027ll likely

I\u0027m not even going to try.\u00A0 -After- the initial 1.1 update I\u0027ll start using the save-game conversion methods that were introduced... but there will be so much changing during this
