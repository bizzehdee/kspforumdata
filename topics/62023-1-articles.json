The skycranes and orbital debris tugs that it enables more than make up for the occasional rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and don\u0027t worry about Kethane breaking your game. Majir (The guy who makes Kethane) usually has a new version mere minutes after a patch, I think he has beta access or something. Mods in general don\u0027t tend to break your saves on updates. Worst that can happen is that you lose a few ships that rely on mod functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripzter","CreatedById":75335,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T06:02:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo i started downloading some mods.
