Unless the post-encounter is wildly different from pre-encounter, I find myself unable to plot any more maneuvers on the pre-encounter part, no matter how far I zoom in. Is there any way to place a maneuver node pre-encounter once this situation arises, without resorting to mods?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T22:15:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 10:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordCurlyton**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T21:55:02Z","Content":"Yes, there is.

You may well be able to do it without a node at all - just thrust limit your engine, use the navball markers to get into the right directions for what would have been the node handles and do small, small burns and see how changes your intercept. It\u0027ll probably be a enough to give you a handle on the (probably) two different vectors you\u0027ll need to make adjustments in, and I\u0027ve often found doing the burn manually with a limited engine gives much more fine control and is therefore easier than trying to adjust the node handles - once I know which direction I need to thrust.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T16:57:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E if you\u0027re far out, you\u0027ll only need tiny dV changes to tweak your intercept.

But tweaking an encounter with poor plane alignment? Even \u0022was it Normal or Antinormal\u0022 aside, a small Normal/Antinormal burn will totally change the orbit radius - often for 3ms of normal burn I had to add 40 of retrograde.
