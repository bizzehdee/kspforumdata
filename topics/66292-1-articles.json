I love KSP, I love Cosmos, and I finally plunked down the money for an inexpensive Dobsonian telescope. I couldn\u0027t justify it in the military, but now that I\u0027m not moving all the time I felt comfortable getting into it finally. I got the base put together yesterday, collimated (is that a word?) the mirrors, and since it was overcast across the whole sky put it away until tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI eagerly awaited sunset and went out to enjoy the evening and get really anxious as it slowly got darker. When it got a bit dark, I began training my telescope on constellations I know. I\u0027ll be honest, I wasn\u0027t seeing much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWound up training my spotting dot on an unusually bright star and looked through the lens. Boom, 5 bright lights in a diagonal line (almost). One much larger than the others. Instantly my mind realizes what I\u0027m looking at. That\u0027s Jupiter!! And 4 moons!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I want to study charts and begin looking for other things. I want to play hours of KSP. And I want to binge watch old and new Cosmos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there is no real reason for this post, except to share my enthusiasm. Anyone have some advice for someone new to the hobby? Dress more warmly is a lesson I\u0027ve already learned....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Accelerando","CreatedById":543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T04:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour peripheral vision tends to see a little more light than your eyes\u0027 focus.

It excels at deep space objects more so than planets. Dobsonians, apparently, are great at gathering light with their large base mirrors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re also pretty big. The XT8 is pretty light, I can move it around by myself. It is a manual tracking telescope. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was $350 American on Amazon, don\u0027t know what the price may be outside of America.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
