This is fantastic! No need for me to write one now. One thing I was going to do is perform soil analysis from orbit, similar to NASA\u0027s LCROSS experiment to find water. Right now, you need to fly the M4435 Narrow Band Scanner near the surface in order to unlock the biome. I was instead going to do a LCROSS experiment that would let you unlock the biome from orbit. Maybe that\u0027s something the flashometer could do. If you decide to do that, I can share what I\u0027ve learned about unlocking biomes. I\u0027d definitely recommend your mod, well done. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T05:00:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 05:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DennyTX","CreatedById":92389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T17:20:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eare impact\u0027s experiments nonrepeatable? i have placed seismometr on mun, did first impact, got data. transmitted it. did second impact. no data... it should be so?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T06:20:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery impact should always place a new result into the seismometer.
