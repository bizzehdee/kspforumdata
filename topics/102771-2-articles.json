This is fantastic! No need for me to write one now. One thing I was going to do is perform soil analysis from orbit, similar to NASA\u0027s LCROSS experiment to find water. Right now, you need to fly the M4435 Narrow Band Scanner near the surface in order to unlock the biome. I was instead going to do a LCROSS experiment that would let you unlock the biome from orbit. Maybe that\u0027s something the flashometer could do. If you decide to do that, I can share what I\u0027ve learned about unlocking biomes.
