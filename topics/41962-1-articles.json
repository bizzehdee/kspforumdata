I highly recommend reading up on asparagus staging styles and a few tutorials on YouTube, as it is a very good tool and KSP videos are bountiful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor planets, play around with Maneuver nodes, as you\u0027ve already got a small taste of how transferring is done with the Mun. Try Minmus next, then Duna or Eve. You may also want to get Protractor and Kerbal Engineer, as those are also very helpful tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T22:44:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo get a full orange tank into kerbin orbit, you will generally need to use a huge rocket to get it up there. My current lifter is seven mainsails; one central, six radially around it. An orange tank and a x32 grey tank for each motor, with two additional stripey tanks on each booster for launch, dumped when they\u0027re empty. Fuel lines running inwards, and tanks dropped when they\u0027re empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat gets a full orange tank into orbit, along with a lander, two nuclear engines, and a third of the fuel on the central Mainsail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor traveling to other planets, first escape from kerbin\u0027s orbit by burning prograde at periapsis. Set a target of where you want to go. Then set up a maneuver node; drag prograde or retrograde to get an intersect with the orbit of the planet you want to get to, then drag it around the orbit until you see the \u0027closest approach\u0027 markers. Fiddle with prograde and retrograde and node position until you get an encounter with the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen skip forwards to the node. Start burning when you\u0027re half the burn time away from the node, keep burning until your orbit turns purple, signifying an encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the encounter, burn retrograde at periapsis until you\u0027re in orbit. Then further retrograde burning will cause your orbit to intersect the planet. The rest is like landing anywhere else. Just make sure your lander is tailored to where you\u0027re landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat may not be the best way, or the most efficient way, but it\u0027s how I\u0027ve gotten to Eve and Duna recently, so it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an interplanetary transfer stage, I generally use an orange tank (or two x32s stuck together), with two nuclear engines on the side. That\u0027s achieved with a girder segment on each side using two-fold symmetry, a small fuel tank on each one, and the nuclear engines on the bottom of that. Struts as appropriate, fuel lines going out from the bottom-most of any tanks you\u0027re using to the small tanks the engines are stuck to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could use one stuck to the bottom, but that WILL overheat and explode on an orange tank, and it takes ages to do burns. Two engines is less efficient and has less thrust to weight ratio due to the struts and girders and extra tanks, but basically halves the burn times, and your rocket is a little more stable on launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a lander, I generally use the smallest Rockomax tank with a capsule or lander-can on top, with the Inline Control System on top of it, along with another set of reaction wheels should I need it. Stick legs and a ladder on the tank, and either use the Lv909 engine, or 4-6 of the little orange radials. I use the radials, as that allows for a compact rover to fit under the lander, sandwiched between it and the lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, not the best, but it works for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keome","CreatedById":72332,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T00:45:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo get an orange tank into orbit, try this.

Take an orange tank, put a Mainsail on the bottom. On top, put a probe core and docking port. Attach whatever else you need to the orange tank to get it into orbit.
