It is in a 3.3-1 resonance with Duna. I tried for a 3-1, but I didn\u0027t know about the specific equation involved. Also, I didn\u0027t have Universe Sandbox 2 yet. Anyways, Lentum orbits in a relatively crowded area of space. But its size (1.1 Kerbin Radii) and mass (1.4 Kerbin Mass) gave it a gravity of about 1.5 gees, enough to clear out its orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EScientific Backstory\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLentum was once a planet a lot like Duna, except over twice as large. However, an icy object about the size of Moho intruded the planet\u0027s orbit. This object was large but had a fluff-like density, similar to Daphy from Kerbol Origins. The \u0022Doomsday Fluff\u0022 broke up near Lentum and peppered the planet with large impacts. The crust remained solid, once again due to the fluffy density of the object, and greenhouse gases were emitted into the atmosphere. Lentum\u0027s temperature rose to a comfortable 303\u00A0Kelvin, warm enough for the collections of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGallium\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0in the craters to melt. Life first evolved from the underground caves of water, but adapted to use the liquid Gallium as a food source. All life on Lentum is bacterial. They are mostly green in color and are bioluminescent. They have colored both the surface and atmosphere a pleasant green color. Very enjoyable for your victi-- I mean kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EDevelopment\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLentum is a very old concept. Even before I got KSP, I had envisioned a 5-planet system called Kyzor. Kyzor was a K-Type dwarf star with 45% the Sun\u0027s radius and 37% its mass. Two of its planets were in the habitable zone, and one of them was Lentum. Despite some similarities between the two designs - giant craters and rings - they were very different. Original Lentum was over twice the size of Earth (or Kerbin) and had no atmosphere. All life, water, and air on the planet was blown off by a giant impact event that nearly destroyed Original Lentum, unlike New Lentum\u0027s collision. Original Lentum\u0027s crust was stripped off, and ejecta from the event peppered the other side. The planet was given a huge tilt of over 120 degrees.\u00A0Four moons and a ring system were formed from the event.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelieve it or not, Lentum went through even more changes during development. My entry for KCM 2 was going to be a ravine-run planet called Kesa, which had giant plateaus and water-filled rivers. However, I scrapped the idea because of its resemblance to Asclepius and how bad the texture was coming out. So I decided on reviving Lentum from the Kyzor System project. This New Lentum had a much more vibrant texture with two sets of craters - the main basins, and smaller pockmarks from the ejecta. But that texture was replaced after issues with getting the liquid Gallium inside of the basins. Colors were being changed during texture development. Lentum\u0027s life-colored land was originally going to be a greenish-purple, but I couldn\u0027t make a similar color that didn\u0027t look so dreary. Over the course of Lentum\u0027s development, barely anything stayed the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EScreenshots\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EHere, have some pictures of the new and original textures!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[Sorry, none yet.
