This will easily get you into LKO with a bit of fuel to maneuver around up there. Turn on the SAS, throw the throttle to 100%, pull up at the end of the runway, and you\\\u0027ll easily take off. Pull the nose up to ~45 degrees and stay there until ~14km up. At this point eject from the plane (doesn\\\u0027t really matter now, but it has the fuel to make it back to KSC...), and ignite the LFE after you\\\u0027ve dropped a few meters. Try to point the nose toward the vertical until your trajectory is approaching the 45 degree mark, around then it\\\u0027ll switch to \u0027orbit speed\u0027 and you\\\u0027ll want to cut your thrust soon and coast to apoapsis. It\\\u0027s actually pretty smooth as long as you keep SAS on.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![i16an.png](http://i.imgur.com/i16an.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![jcm1g.png](http://i.imgur.com/jcm1g.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![o6nWQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/o6nWQ.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![QdnIh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QdnIh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nOld planes 0.15 planes:\n\n[MiG-29](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12372.0) (It flies poorly)\n\n[Rockwell-MBB X-31](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12468.0) (Fun if you have a joystick!)\n\nCraft files below:\n\n[X-31](http://www./?gctr2w6ngqlhd8q) craft file.
