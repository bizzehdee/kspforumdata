A \u0027consistent glitch\u0027 is kind of an oxymoron when you\u0027re talking about how the universe works - if it behaves consistently, we usually just call it a physical law. If you like, you could say that the Casimir effect is a glitch in reality, and that exploiting it to make a quantum vacuum plasma thruster is building a Kraken drive, assuming such a device is even possible. Personally, I\u0027d be more inclined to call it a harnessing of physical principles rather than the exploitation of a glitch, but it really just comes down to terminology."},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T01:26:12Z","Content":"Isn\u0027t [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97806-Cannae-EmDrive](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97806-Cannae-EmDrive) an instant of a K-Drive?

It is the [Mossbauer Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ssbauer_effect). In order for it to actually be usable as a space drive, however, the universe would have to contain a lattice. That might be possible if universe is a closed manifold with a satisfactory symmetry condition. It would then make a lattice with itself, in a sense.\n\nEven then, however, getting a recoil is going to be very difficult, and by no means 100% efficient. So I can only see this as an improvement on photon drive efficiency. Not a total replacement. And, naturally, you\u0027d need to have energy source that makes photon drive feasible to begin with. That\u0027s almost exclusively a realm of matter-antimatter drives.\n\nStill, the wonderful thing about the relativistic rocket formula is that if we can boost a photon drive by even 50%, it would open up a world of opportunities for interstellar travel. So this might have practical applications eventually. But not any time soon. We simply aren\u0027t talking about the sort of delta-V where we can rely on anything fancier than an ion drive."}]}
