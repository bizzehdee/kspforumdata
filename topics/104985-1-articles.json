A \u0027consistent glitch\u0027 is kind of an oxymoron when you\u0027re talking about how the universe works - if it behaves consistently, we usually just call it a physical law. If you like, you could say that the Casimir effect is a glitch in reality, and that exploiting it to make a quantum vacuum plasma thruster is building a Kraken drive, assuming such a device is even possible. Personally, I\u0027d be more inclined to call it a harnessing of physical principles rather than the exploitation of a glitch, but it really just comes down to terminology.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T01:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97806-Cannae-EmDrive\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97806-Cannae-EmDrive\u003C/a\u003E an instant of a K-Drive?

So I can only see this as an improvement on photon drive efficiency. Not a total replacement. And, naturally, you\u0027d need to have energy source that makes photon drive feasible to begin with.
