Broadly I like it, but I noticed some bugs with the GUI of some of my mods in game. Not all the text gets upscaled when you change it in settings. So I just set the game to 1920x1080 and I assumed it would just map the game\u0027s output to the monitor\u0027s exactly, 2x2 in height and width. But the actual result is... very blurry. Here the letters (I zoomed in just to be clear) end up about 18px or 20px in font size. And the blur\u00A0is so bad many of the letters are blended together. I think this might be because the game or the computer is interpolating the pixels instead of mapping them directly. It\u0027s not just the monitor because when I zoom in I can see the pixels have been smooshed as they were produced by my computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, is there an easy way to stop it from doing this? It\u0027s frustrating when the whole point of a 4K monitor (improved crispness and better resolution) is completely undone and everything looks more blurry than before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nyqgb7U.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022119.86\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/nyqgb7U.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-02-23T02:01:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2020 02:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-22T20:56:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm going to guess that when you play the game in 1920x1080, the monitor itself is still in 4k mode, which would mean that either the.
