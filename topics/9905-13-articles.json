It is not caused by a bug in Lazor System. But Lazor System is triggering it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me explain:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way Lazor System triggers this bug is because Lazor System modifies the loading and unloading distance for all vessels in the game. Normally this distance is something like 2250 but Lazor system sets this to 95000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe direct cause of the bug seems to be a ksp bug related to rapid loading and unloading of vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the range extending features of Lazor System. Your vessel A2 is loaded and unloaded every time it passes over the Lazor System vessel on the launch pad. And when you crank the warp up to 1000x it loads and unloads the A2 vessel faster than the game can handle, which causes a nullpointer exception which in turn makes it impossible to end flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo illustrate this i have created a test case which will trigger this bug in KSP with no mods installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteps to re-produce:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoad up the attached persisten.sfs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet the time warp to 1000x. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few passes this will trigger the exception.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will forward this bug report to the devs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed that your Lazor System vessel from the persistence.sfs file you attached is not set up correctly. You probably made it like that to illustrate the bug, but if you have problems using the system i\\\u0027ll be happy to explain it. I can also fix your persistence.sfs if need be.
