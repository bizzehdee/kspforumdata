I know there is a punishment for not following the rules like for anything you break a rule there is a punishment. My question is still is why would they follow the conventions rules? There\u0027s nothing stopping them like in World War Two both the axis and ally\u0027s both followed the convention mostly.\n\nthis might be the wrong forums to ask this but it\u0027s been bothering me lately especially with Isis."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T01:34:46Z","Content":"Discussions of international laws and politics never end well on the forum, and for that reason, have been ruled off-limits ([2.2.b](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064-Community-Rules-October-27th-2013)).
