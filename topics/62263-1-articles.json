Various smaller mods like precise maneuver nodes, city and clouds, crew manifest, fuel balancer, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am familiar with the forum thread that shows how to correct a -docker- -dockee- bug that can arise with clampotrons. I\u0027ve used that method a couple times to overcome docking issues. But now I\u0027m running into a far worse bug that happens repeatedly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is that when I dock two ships, they merge into one and the docker is eliminated from existence. The clampotron retains an option to -undock-, but clicking it does nothing. In examining the save file, the two craft are treated as a single craft, with two docking ports that show the correct docker and dockee, but of course the dockee ship no longer exists. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t had a trouble-free docking action for a long time now. It\u0027s so consistent I\u0027m starting to just do EVA transfers to the rescue ship instead. And I\u0027m completely screwed for such actions as kethane mining and transfering fuel to refuel stations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother clue to the nature of this issue may be from what I think is a remotetech bug: It\u0027s not uncommon for me to switch to another ship and in doing so I lose the ability to see any ship and I lose the ability to interact with any mod toolbars. I can select planets only. Switching to the space center gives me a wierd stratosphere view and I can\u0027t click on any buildings. On exiting the game and returning, there\u0027s always a couple duplicate probes which I must promptly delete in the space center or they will annihilate eachother if I try to control them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all an unpleasant situation but supposedly these mods are all cross-compatible...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
