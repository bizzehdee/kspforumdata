There have been reports that HarvesteR has been working on Patched Conics for 1.1, though it could be pushed to 1.2 (Because it\u0027s looking like 1.1 will be almost exclusively Unity 5) and we have no guarantees that what he is/was working on will correct these kinds of problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this is one of my 2 or 3 most hated bugs.
