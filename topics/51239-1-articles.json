But in general no, sorry there is a maximum practical size for a vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake tanks for example. The Germans were trying to build some really ludicrous sized tanks in WW2, they actually fielded one which was nearly 190 tonnes. The problem with this is that their mobility sucks. Modern tanks have stabilised at about a maximum of 40-50 tonnes, adding any further size and weight actually makes them less effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of the problem is that if you scaled a vehicle up its weight would increase at the cube of the size increase, but the area of it\u0027s tracks only increases at the square, so the pressure per unit area goes up. Ground pressure strongly affects off-road performance. Total weight also limits what bridges the vehicle can use, as not all rivers are fordable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis problem means that if you wanted to create a really big vehicle you\u0027d want to build it very low and wide, to give it lots of area in contact with the ground. Tall and narrow (ie: humanoid) is the exact opposite of what you\u0027d want. In reality giant humanoid robots would have immense ground pressure, and would simply sink into the ground and get stuck when they tried to move. Contrariwise, building a very large low wide vehicle would also be of little use, since it wouldn\u0027t be able to use roads, tunnels, bridges, couldn\u0027t enter built up areas, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a reason why tanks haven\u0027t increased in size or weight much over the last few decades. They\u0027re pretty much at their maximum practical size and weight. Tank designers are now looking for ways to decrease the weight of the armour while improving performance. A decent airmobile tank is highly desirable, but all the attempts so far have been very limited compromise designs that aren\u0027t able to stand up to proper tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr_jt","CreatedById":58149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T14:22:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a limit on what can be moved and how fast it can be moved. The arms of a jaeger would be many 100 of tons to be effective as a battering ram. i.e. punching. The hydraulics would be massive for it and the speed would be limited to how fast you could pump the fluids around. Tying to armor all of the hydraulics would also pose a problem. Break a couple of lines and the arm is now just a useless weight you have to carry around. The whole leg assembly would not only have to move quickly but also carry the massive weight of the body and arms. All on just a couple of hip joints which would be of great concern for failure. To add more insult you would have these mega ton robots standing on a very small surface area. Just look at your feet and how small they are. The robot would have a hard time walking about because it would sink into the ground and in some places like the deserts or jungles they many sink quite a way into it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T14:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust take those \u0022Anti-Kaiju missiles\u0022 from the Australian J\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4ger and put them on an aircraft or a ship, much more effective than a giant robot that just can\u0027t work in realty anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-31T14:40:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2013 02:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Canopus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T12:53:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight, now having seen Pacific Rim I\u0027m going to double down on \u0022hell no\u0022.

The central engineering component of a tank is the turret ring. This element determines the recoil length of the gun. More powerful guns with more recoil require larger rings, which in turn require a larger chassis to accommodate the ring. This determines the actual size of the vehicle. The German superheavies were being built to accommodate a 128mm gun ordinarily fired from an open platform where recoil length was not originally a design concern. Modern Western MBTs use much more efficient penetrators, 4 kg compared to 28 kg, and so the weapons are much lighter. Tanks of that size were abandoned because changes in penetrator technology made such superheavy guns unneeded, which meant such large turret rings were unneeded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Because of their wide chassis, numerous heavy tanks had better cross-country performance and lower ground pressure than their weight class would suggest.
