I always whitelist the parts whenever I install a new mod using DMP options. Or maybe is there a way to disable the parts whitelist function completely? Why is the K\u0026amp;K mod not working with DMP? Also, to generate whitelist, I just go to options in DMP settings , then go to Mod Control, then I use Generate Whitelist\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-12T14:23:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2017 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by ajud\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
