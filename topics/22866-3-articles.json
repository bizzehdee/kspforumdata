But every time I launch a carrier I have to spend about 30-40 minutes meticulously destroying all the debris left in the water. I use a Romfarer Sunbeam Laser mounted on top of Wayland\u0027s Eagle which I land in the water nearby. Destroy all the debris near me, then fly up and splash down again and repeat until the debris is all gone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose we could use Hyperedit to place the carrier.
