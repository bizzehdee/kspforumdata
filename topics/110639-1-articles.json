I used to be able to bring up a to 100 tons of payload in LKO with a single rocket, but all that is in the past now ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) ! I would love to start making new designs, unfortunately I have to study since I am taking exams in a few weeks.\n\nWith the tests of SpaceX wanting to reuse the first stage of their Falcon9 rocket, I thought about a challenge that you guys might like and I made an account just to submit it, hoping to be entertained when I am not studying ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) !\n\n**Objective:**\n\nDesign, build and fly a SSTO following a flight plan of your choice to put the largest payload possible in low Kerbin orbit, deorbit and then return to/land near KSC.\n\n**Orbit:** equatorial orbit , periapsis and apoapsis between 95 and 100 km.\n\n**Landing:** you must land on land ( ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) not water I mean) and be able to see KSC from your landing zone.\n\n**\u0022Rules\u0022:**\n\nOnly stock parts (obviously), no mods/flight help. (old school pilot skills ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ) \n\nNo parts being destroyed during ascent/descent or landing. Every thing that takes off must land and be ready to fly again with the exception of fuel (no sh\\*t) and ablator from heat shields!\n\nBasically, make something that seems possible to you ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) ! Don\u0027t use any \u0022clever\u0022 trick to fool the game\u0027s physics, it\u0027s not the point of this challenge...\n\nYou are allowed to have payloads fairings, I don\u0027t consider it as real \u0022staging\u0022.\n\nSo you can use whatever you want, whether you go for horizontal or vertical take-off/landing, the winner will be the one bringing the heaviest payload in orbit. You can also decide how you want to fly your SSTO and the payload you take...\n\nLet the games begin !\n\n(I\u0027ll give it a shot when my exams are over, end of June ![-_-](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_sleep.png) )"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman Revolution","CreatedById":118094,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T01:43:52Z","Content":"not near ksc, but possible\n\n40t to orbit\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/y9ADt#1](http://imgur.com/a/y9ADt#1)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T20:28:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 08:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dman Revolution**\n  \nwrong imgur link"}]}
