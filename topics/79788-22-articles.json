Showing waypoints in the world is possible but not in my immediate plans. Of course, my plans change with feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mostly have no intention of doing this as of now because the locations themselves are abstractions rather than physical things (for now). They are an excuse to get players out there and actually exploring, but I make no assumptions on what you may find there. In a lot of my testing for aerial missions I did this one mission over a beautiful archipelago I never even knew existed with this river delta sort of thing going on. I never would have found it if not for the contract. Placing physical waypoints hovering in mid air kind of takes away from this, in my opinion. This abstract concept of what is actually at these places. Does that make sense?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow are you setting up your command pod (be it manned or unmanned).
