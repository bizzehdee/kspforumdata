If you see \u0022Build finished successfully\u0022 in the end, you may skip a pair of paragraphs of this text.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook for everything that\u0027s in blue and continues with \u0022Error\u0022. Read the description of error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it says \u0022\u0027\u0026lt;something\u0026gt;\u0027 does not implement inherited abstract member...\u0022, it may be just the file that the developer have started to implement but not finished. You may try just to remove it. Find the file\u0027s name at the end of the blue text starting the line. Find it in the project tree and delete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPress Alt-F8 again. After it builds you should see a new set of messages. Find an error again. Remember to ignore warnings or you\u0027ll mess something up. You should work with errors only. Below I\u0027ll describe some possible errors and what to do with them. In most cases you\u0027ll need to go to it\u0027s source by clicking the blue link starting the line. After that the cursor will be positioned in the source code exactly at the place you need to edit. After correcting an error try building the code again by pressing Alt-F8. You\u0027ll get a new set of messages. Proceed over again. You may meet one error several times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere go some of the error examples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Vessel\u0027 does not contain a definition for \u0027staticPressure\u0027 and no extension... - replace \u0022staticPressure\u0022 with \u0022staticPressurekPa\u0022 (without quotes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027CelestialBody\u0027 does not contain a definition for \u0027maxAtmosphereAltitude\u0027... - replace \u0022maxAtmosphereAltitude\u0022 with \u0022atmosphereDepth\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027CelestialBody\u0027 does not contain a definition for \u0027staticPressureASL\u0027... - replace \u0022staticPressureASL\u0022 with \u0022atmospherePressureSeaLevel\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo overload for method \u0027getAtmDensity\u0027 takes 1 arguments... - this error is about the getAtmDensity needs more arguments than provided because the method was changed in a new KSP version. Let\u0027s see. The arguments needed are at least pressure and temperature. Most likely there\u0027s only pressure. For the temperature you may use \u0022FlightGlobals.ship_temp\u0022, for example, or another temperature value if you know such. Of course you should study the context to use the right value but at least this is a some reasonable value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat exactly to do with it: look at the getAtmDensity(.....) method carefully. You\u0027ll see its opening bracket \u0022(\u0022. You need to find ITS corresponding closing bracket \u0022)\u0022. Insert the following text JUST BEFORE the closing bracket: \u0022, FlightGlobals.ship_temp\u0022 without quotes and don\u0027t forget the comma. So after that the method call should look like getAtmDensity(\u0026lt;whatever was here before\u0026gt;, FlightGlobals.ship_temp)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are sure that you have some coding skills, you may apply this to other methods that need to be corrected. Just start retyping the line that contains an error in a new line and after typing the \u0022(\u0022 after method\u0027s name the possible parameters required for the method will be displayed. Where to get them? Try to search around in the nearby context: when you hover a mouse over some variable the tooltip telling its type will be displayed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you have corrected (the proper words would be \u0022worked around\u0022) all errors and if after building by Alt-F8 you see \u0022Build finished successfully\u0022 in the output, the work is done and you may test the mod with KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstall the original mod as usually. Then go to its folder and find the dll file similar to that you\u0027ve recompiled. Replace the original dll with your recompiled version. You can find it in the subfolder \u0022bin\\Debug\u0022 of the projects folder. If it\u0027s hard to find then search by file creation date, it should be equal to the time when you compiled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that launch KSP and try, but read the below note first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E!!!NOTE that despite you may be successful at recompiling there\u0027s a high chance that the result would appear a piece of crap based on a brilliant work. It may even function as intended but you don\u0027t know what bugs you have put into it. It may even corrupt your saves. SO DON\u0027T SHARE THE RECOMPILED FILES WITH ANYONE! First, this may violate the original mod\u0027s license. Despite you have edited something it\u0027s still not yours. Second, people will have bugs with it (you may be sure, they will) and blame the original mod\u0027s developer for them, WHO ISN\u0027T RESPONSIBLE AT ALL. Thus you\u0027ll hurt the developer\u0027s reputation. SO IF YOU LIKE THE MOD THAT MUCH, PLEASE, RESPECT ITS AUTHOR, HIS RIGHTS AND REPUTATION.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t ask any questions on it here because this thread is not for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould Romfarer complain about this even though it doesn\u0027t violate the license, contact me by any means and I\u0027ll remove the post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. hope I\u0027m doing the right thing...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T15:51:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 03:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ser\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T15:20:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think, that moderators can notify Romfarer, that players still interested in his mod, so he can change license to less restrictive, because he don\u0027t plan to update this mod, or so I heard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T17:34:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt may be a poor substitute, but this will get you sorta the same view...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1002/Clamp-O-Tron%20APAS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1002/Clamp-O-Tron%20APAS\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ser","CreatedById":104207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T20:59:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, tg626, you saved me from doing it myself.
