Due to changes in when we received customer samples to test, they decided they wanted me to come in from 10 am to 2 pm. Problem was, there was no adjustment to pay, no increase in hours... They just wanted to shift my time by two hours. Over the course of 5 days a week, that would eliminate 10 hours of my afternoon, with no compensation for me. I argued against it, and suggested I come in at 9 am, but be permitted to come earlier, or stay later, as needed, when additional labor was needed, and when I could actually do so without interfering with my other jobs... It was great... At first. Then they asked that we \u0022check out\u0022 before clocking out. This was often cumbersome for me, as both my supervisors took lunch during the hour I normally would clock out at. Then things shifted from, \u0022Okay, see you tomorrow\u0022, to \u0022Okay, is everyone in your area fine with you taking off?\u0022, and then to \u0022\u0022Okay, is everything done in your area?\u0022 (That\u0027s what the full timers are for, aren\u0027t\u00A0they!?! To stay a full shift and finish up!?). Now it\u0027s become not replacing employees who are no longer working there, and asking for even more hours from only two people.

The green glow is the plastic glowing, not simply light shining through. The UV light fluoresces the plastic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, while I have definitely been out of the loop for a while, I\u0027m not gone. I have had even more practice working with KiCAD, and have no doubt that the FDAI controller boards will be more than possible to produce. I need to finish up a few things that are already started, such as modding my analog meters and finishing the DSKY diode ROMs (I still have one left to make).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, the reason I\u0027m talking about these glowy green mystery goo keys, is I\u0027ve decided to return to the original keyboard concept for the controller. The original plan was to mount an Apple //c keyboard into the controller. Then I got the Danger Zone key caps and built my custom keyboard using those. My revised plan was to simply have a notch in the controller that the keyboard would slide into when the desk\u0027s keyboard tray was retracted. Now that 6 years have passed since I built my computer, I realize it\u0027s getting to that time when I want to build a new one, and my workshop definitely needs a computer. My plan is to basically migrate the old computer to the workshop, and build a new one as my main computer. This brings up some interesting questions... Could my new computer be squeezed inside the kerbal controller itself? My existing computer is bare right now, and the Philco Radio case is in the workshop getting work done... It looks GOOD sitting on the desk in there. I\u0027m half tempted to leave it in there, but I DO like the thing to be more visible too... Thing is, it tends to be better lit and at eye level in the workshop, while it has to sit on a second level upper desk shelf to be in here. Anyway, regardless of what I end up doing, I\u0027ll be needing a Keyboard for each computer, so I may as well go back to building the keyboard into the Kerbal instrument panel. I\u0027ll still keep a retractable keyboard tray, and still have my Danger Zone keyboard, but it\u0027ll be stored away when not in use. I\u0027ve actually got a set of typewriter styled keys that I\u0027m seriously considering building up for the Philco Radio Computer. All that\u0027s up to whatever happens in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext big thing to do is to machine the front panel. It has to get done, no question. One of my roadblocks is the fact that all my parts are well... Parts. Once things start fitting together, I can actually begin wiring, and once I begin wiring, I can actually begin to figure out how to make every part of the system function.\u00A0The front panel is too big for my milling machine, so I need to deal with it in one of two ways... I need to either split it and machine each half separately, or finally try to get it done at the machine shop. My preference is to keep it in one piece. There\u0027s gonna be a lot of measuring to make it all fit. I am also definitely going to need to machine out a notch on the edge of one analog meter to fit it around the internal support frame for the front frame. I need EVERY MILLIMETER of space to fit everything... That\u0027s not a joke. I\u0027m even probably going to have to mill a notch out of the outer chassis mount on the other side to make room for yet another meter to skirt right up to the edge.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother roadblock ended up being the tape meter. The screen printing shop that I went to completely flaked out on me. I guess they decided a one off job wasn\u0027t worth the effort. I can give it another shot, but it looks like I\u0027ll be forced to use those stamp kits and build some manner of jig and do the whole thing manually. That\u0027s not gonna be very fun... But,\u00A0it\u0027s either that, or find another screen printing shop that\u0027s willing to take the job. I REALLY want the tape meter. It\u0027s such\u00A0rare piece, and I wanna make it work, I wanna make it fit... I just really wanna make it a reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah... Popping back on the radar here. Plan for now is to finish steps that I started on but haven\u0027t completed. Top priority is finishing the last Diode ROMs for the DSKY, finishing and backlighting ALL the analog meters, and making progress on the main front panel.

I could totally have driven them from an\u00A0Arduino or something, and it absolutely would have worked, but I simply chose a different route. the issue is most of the serial to\u00A0row/column driver chips aren\u0027t meant for driving over 8 segments. The popular (and cheap) MAX7219 and 7221 chips are not really able to drive 14 or 16 segment displays. You could get away with it using shift registers, or even port expander chips, or even just using the digital I/O directly. You may need a transistor to drive the displays, especially if you scan them. Fortunately, you only need to cover the number of rows and digits\u00A0with a\u00A0transistor driving each line, but you\u0027ll always need to control it by switching segments. There ARE controllers for 16 segment displays, like the Maxim MAX6954, but they tend to be expensive... Mouser has them starting at $18.76 per chip, and they can\u00A0drive\u00A0up to 16 digits of 7-segment displays, 8 digits of 14 or 16-segment displays,\u00A0or 128 individual LEDs. If you do get one of these chips, consider doing like I did, and ONLY place the 14 segment displays where you NEED them, and let the rest be 7 segment, That lets you use the cheaper, and much more common Max7219 on those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince microcontrollers are dirt cheap these days, I honestly recommend using one controller as a display driver if you have any concerns over whether or not you can support the timing. Have it handle the segment switching and scanning, and it\u0027s input would be the plaintext data transmitted by whatever is handling that. I absolutely plan on spamming controllers in my own project. Maybe it\u0027s possible to efficiently code one controller to multitask between several things... Or I can keep the code simple and have a controller dedicated to one simple task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, that\u0027s my plan for the FDAI controllers. Each axis will have it\u0027s own separate Arduino micro handling the packet input, and calculating the amplitude and polarity output that corresponds to that particular angle, and send that data tot eh DAC and analog switch IC. Since each axis is identical, with the only difference being the piece of data it reads out of the packet for updates, I can literally create code for one, and just copy it onto three microcontrollers,\u00A0changing only\u00A0the location in the data packet that it reads from. Depending on the memory available, I might be able to get away with an amplitude value lookup table rather than calculate it. Absolute value the number into a variable, add them together, if the result is 0, set the polarity output to represent negative, else set it to represent positive. So basically,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d start with whatever command(s) lets me read specific data out of an incoming serial packet and store that data to a variable (we\u0027ll use\u00A0PacketDataA).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003EPacketDataB =\u00A0PacketDataA \u002B 120\nPacketDataC =\u00A0PacketDataA \u002B 240\nIf PacketDataB \u0026gt;= 360\n Then\u00A0PacketDataB = PacketDataB - 360\nIf PacketDataC \u0026gt;= 360\n Then\u00A0PacketDataC = PacketDataC - 360\n\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter generating these three angles based on the angle sent by the packet, we want to then convert that to a sine value that corresponds to the attenuation at that angle of a syncro control transformer. As I said, a lookup table probably makes a lot of sense here. I\u0027d need to take the angle values in the three PacketData(A, B, \u0026amp; C) variables, and read out attenuation values out of the lookup table into three additional variables. We\u0027ll call them AttenA, AttenB, and AttenC.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003EB =\u00A0Abs(AttenA)\nC = AttenA \u002B B\nIf C = 0\nThen PolarityPin = 1\nElse PolarityPin = 0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... And basically repeat that three times total for each of the three attenuator values and their polarity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRepeat \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E of the above three times, to get the outputs required for all three\u00A0axes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPardon my lack of coding skills, my foundations are in BASIC, so it\u0027s not gonna be syntax correct for an Arduino, but I think the math is solid. I imagine it might be possible to easily code this all on a single chip, but why make myself suffer if I don\u0027t need too. I imagine I could maybe just run it all on one, and it\u0027ll be fast enough to keep the FDAI updated, but honestly, either way is fine by me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, back to the 14/16 segment LED displays. You can use a dedicated controller like the\u00A0MAX6954, or you can drive segments with row and column drive. If you\u0027re better with programming, and want to keep things simple, get either 14 or 16 digit displays and control up to eight at a time, per\u00A0MAX6954 chip. It\u0027s nearly $20 per chip, but at least they have a built in character font for the displays, and you can send the chip plain ASCII characters to display over SPI. I think the MAX7219 chips are simpler, and about half the price (cheaper ones are available on ebay, fully assembled on a PCB, with LEDs, but beware the quality and test them first).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-02T04:13:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2019 04:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsaven","CreatedById":138869,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-12T08:55:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223641815\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156435\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221564220238\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129946\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022richfiles\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/27/2019 at 2:37 AM, richfiles said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNerd stuff\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJesus dude you are like so far beyond the stuff I\u0027m trying to do \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a warning, because you seem . . . fairly . . . well versed in hardware stuff, I might end up pestering you a fair bit in the near future because jeeze do I need help.\u00A0 I\u0027ve got a very tenuous understanding of basic electronics and have played around with some Arduino\u0027s a few years ago to make very basic projects, but I\u0027m embarking on a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ZvjuqyV.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efar too advanced KSP Controller\u003C/a\u003E build myself as a learning experience and to keep me out of trouble.\u00A0 That layout isn\u0027t close to finished yet and I\u0027m worried I\u0027m going to have to expand the board because I keep adding features that I want...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be on topic, regarding driving 16-segment displays; I was able to find this useful little $6 item to drive 14-segment displays, which I think will do just fine: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.adafruit.com/product/1910\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.adafruit.com/product/1910\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour suggestion of only using the 14-segment displays for indication is exactly my plan, specifically to tell me if my AP/PE readouts are in meters, kilometers or more.\u00A0 And while I\u0027ll have to connect one of the two-digit segments to the controller board with some jumper wire, I can easily use that board to drive two separate 2-digit 14-segment displays for each of my indicators.\u00A0 And it works over IC2, so I can probably wire them up right in series with all of my other read outs for data as long as I\u0027m careful about the addressing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have another question for you; where the heck does one get those relegendable backlit push buttons that you said you salvaged from an old video controller board?\u00A0 Those sort of things are exactly what I\u0027m trying to find for my project, or at least a reasonable emulation of them.

The second panel is where the pushbuttons are actually mounted. The video effects panel switches I have are PC board mount, so you\u0027d need to solder them to a board, then mount that board to your panel with spacers.

I got the red/green bi-color LEDs from Digikey years back, and sourced them there, cause I knew exactly what I\u0027d be getting. For indicators, I highly recommend diffusing LEDs. They will have a lower brightness rating than clear lens LEDs, but the diffused lens will more evenly spread the light out over the button. You don\u0027t need that much for indication, else it could be a distraction. 10-14 mcd is common for indication. I know the bidirectional LEDs in my DSKY keypad work well.

One idea was to print a pattern on the backside of the tape, and have photodiodes detect the coding.

I did actually find a few that might work out okay, including a good brand name unit that only has 256 steps, a short but usable shaft, and is about $20, but now I\u0027m wondering if another device might work out just as well...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI saw an angular hall effect sensor: the\u00A0AS5600 Rotary Position Sensor\u00A0with 12 bits of resolution. It\u0027s basically a chip that senses the angle of a magnetic field. It\u0027ll output an exact value over I2C. I don\u0027t even need 12 bits. 8 bits is double the numeric position (I can code for tape positions equal to half steps, so point at one number, point at the space between two numbers, point at the next number, etc. With 10 bits of resolution, I can quadruple that, and again, it\u0027s more than enough for the tape meter to display it\u0027s values. Regardless of the version I buy, All I need to do is have the motor drive a toothed pulley attached to the tape meter\u0027s input cog, and have a magnet attached to the system. The drive wheel of the tape meter has\u00A020 sprocket pins in one revolution, with the tape being\u00A0120 sprocket holes in length, giving me a 6:1 ratio. I can handle that in two possible ways. I can have a 1:6 pulley driving the tape meter. It means the motor shaft would be pretty large, and it reduces my motor\u0027s overall torque being transferred to the drive sprocket. The low torque means it can\u0027t come up to speed that fast, and might lag.\u00A0The benefit, Is I can mount the magnet to the motor, and one rotation of the motor would then equal one rotation of the tape, and I\u0027d have a true accurate position feedback with minimal hardware. The second option is to have two pulleys belted onto\u00A0the motor. It\u0027d be more complicated, but I could even have the motor have an even smaller shaft than the drive sprocket, giving me more torque, but I\u0027d have another pulley, 6 times larger than the sprocket pulley, and that would only exist for the magnetic absolute position measurement. It requires I might need to do extra things, like maybe\u00A0have an idler wheel, and a serpentine belt configuration. Might be able to get away with a triangular belt configuration too. The meter is still a low torque thing. This configuration might end up being the route I actually take. The last option is to combine the absolute position sensor with some other sensor to determine which rotation it\u0027s on.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRegardless, whether I splurge for an optical encoder, or go with a magnetic angular position sensor instead, I finally think I have the tape meter figured out.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe carriage meter will likely be very similar, but I\u0027ll steal the head assembly from an electronic typewriter/word processor and drive that mechanism. I can drive the steel cable that moves it easily.I think I\u0027ll want 10-12 bits of resolution on that one.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, mostly brainstorming, and recording thoughts before I go to bed. A lot of issues got solved today, in a very short period of time!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-16T12:08:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TMz9jx2.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.87\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 width=\u00221013\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/TMz9jx2.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, did some mockups and measuring and researching parts online. Thanks to cheap CNC and 3D printer parts, toothed belts are dirt cheap online. I\u0027ve also got meter placement to worry about. Sadly, Space is very constrained in my housing, and adding the Delta V readout takes things from a comfortable fit, to shaving millimeters off bezels to find a working fit. The above image shows the fit around the DSKY.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00225zNhiqV.jpg?2\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002296.36\u0022 height=\u0022530\u0022 width=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/5zNhiqV.jpg?2\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dazhhE4.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022127.71\u0022 height=\u0022530\u0022 width=\u0022415\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dazhhE4.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wanted the keypad to be centered between the annunciator LEDs and the displays, but if I go this route,\u00A0I\u0027ll have to settle on centering the keyboard on the displays, due to the space taken by the pulley. You can see above, that the space is so tight, I\u0027ll even need to trim the edge of the PC board off, just to make room for the sprocket. I may or may not be able to shave a small amount of distance, depending on if I can shave out the inner diameter of the pull wheel to it fits over the bearing housing (the bit that sticks out behind the gear... That gear will be removed, and replaced with a toothed\u00A0pulley wheel)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI measured and cut out some mockups for the pulley wheels. The large wheel has 60 teeth, and the two small ones are 10 teeth, giving me a 6:1 ratio between the motor\u002Btape sprocket, and the large wheel. The large wheel will have one of those Hall Effect rotational position sensors reading a small magnet mounted into the wheel. Every six turns of the motor generates 6 turns of the tape sprocket, and one full loop of the tape, and one full turn of the large wheel. All I\u0027ll need to do is have a basic closed loop position based motor driver program. That\u0027s something I might even be able to just find an example online for, and throw an an Arduino Pro Mini or something. You just send a desired position to the microcontroller, and the program looks at the position sensed by the position sensor, and determines how much error there is, and runs the motor at a proportional speed to to eliminate the error.\u00A0I can put in a max speed limit and max acceleration/deceleration rate to protect the tape from being torn by agressive\u00A0motor movements.\u00A0The belt will be in a simple triangle configuration. The motor and the shaft\u002Bbearing that mounts the large wheel will just be attached to the plate that will screw into the main tape meter housing. If I slot one of the screw holes, I can adjust the tension out of the belt by sliding that assembly forward or back. It\u0027ll function the same way\u00A0the tape tension slot works (visible at the top of the tape meter\u00A0housing). Adjust the tension, and tighten the screw. That\u0027s it! I\u0027ll look through my collection of bearings and see if I have something that I can mount the large wheel to easily.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis all assumes I even mount it to the left of the DSKY. Left of the DSKY offers me one major advantage. There\u0027s literally nothing behind the annunciator LEDs, leaving me plenty of room for the mechanical elements, including the large pulley wheel. There are two other positions I could mount it, but there are issues regarding space for hardware in both of those positions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002237GMyJl.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022124.12\u0022 height=\u0022530\u0022 width=\u0022427\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/37GMyJl.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nERPuXa.jpg?2\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002285.48\u0022 height=\u0022530\u0022 width=\u0022620\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/nERPuXa.jpg?2\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI could optionally mount it right of the DSKY, and left of the vertical velocity meter. Mounting it here keeps the radar altimeter, altimeter, and vertical velocity all in a collected cluster of instruments, which I like, but I\u0027ll get to the issue that mounting it on either side of the DSKY results in, in a moment. On this side, the bulk of the Vertical Velocity meter packaging creates an obstruction, making the triangle belt configuration impossible. A simple solution is to add a fourth pulley, a non-toothed idler wheel that holds the belt below the edge of the VVM housing. It\u0027s a very simple solution, and won\u0027t hardly add any cost, and it should work just fine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHonestly, it might be easier to mount the LED displays below the VVM, instead of above. It gives me a little extra clearance, but still not enough to eliminate the idler wheel. I unfortunately do belive that space limitations dictate that I may need to buy smaller LED displays for this as well. That wasn\u0027t part of my original plan, but I wanted room for some pushbuttons, and some LEDs by those displays, and I think I just have no choice but to go smaller. That\u0027s alright though. It\u0027ll keep it from looking like the DSKY puked a few extra displays onto the side, and make that bit look like it\u0027s own module in the panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mvPyeIe.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022100.65\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 width=\u0022763\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/mvPyeIe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, there\u0027s the third possible mounting location, left of the Navball. I can\u0027t say I\u00A0really want to mount it here, because it makes for the hardest mechanism to build, as well as pulls it\u0027s information away from the altitude cluster of instruments, but I guess, photo included for reference purposes... Mounting it left of the Navball has some disadvantages, but it does one thing that\u0027s very lacking in this panel... It helps bring the Navball closer to center. Over time, I\u0027ve eliminated three of the seven edgewise analog resource meters (in favor of four dual readout meters). I\u0027ve also since come up with the idea for the Delta V carriage meter and found the tape meter to make into the Radar Altimeter. The LED display failures of the original smaller DSKY digits resulted in me buying larger LED displays, which also further widened the DSKY.\u00A0That took out three meters to the left, and added two to the right, plus the wider DSKY. This has had the unfortunate consequence of almost eliminating space for any large bezels, and\u00A0shifted the navball rather far from the central position, and honestly, I\u0027m not really\u00A0a fan of that. The Navball was supposed to be the star of this build! Anyway,\u00A0I mocked up the positioning of mounting the tape meter to the left of the Navball, main;y just to see how it looks.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Navball is very long (it\u0027s my longest instrument, depth wise), and \u003Cem\u003Ecompletely obscures \u003C/em\u003Ethe space beside the tape meter\u00A0for any\u00A0mechanics. If I did choose this method (I kinda don\u0027t really\u00A0want to though), I\u0027d have to use a double shafted motor with two pulleys mounted on each shaft. A short belt would sit on a pair of 10 tooth pulleys mounted on the motor and tape meter. The other side of the motor would have another 10 tooth pulley on the other\u00A0shaft, and would then connect with a second belt to the 60 tooth pulley for the position sensor. All that hardware would be positioned directly behind the tape meter. It\u0027s a bit more complicated, and I don\u0027t much care for the positioning though, so I likely won\u0027t do this.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Jcz9H9I.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002236.93\u0022 height=\u0022378\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Jcz9H9I.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat leaves the Delta V meter. I \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EREALLY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E want it to sit on the right side of the navball, just like the \u2206v meter built into the game... In fact, it\u0027s being built especially to model itself after the one in the game. I laid out all the instruments on the front plate to get an idea of the space I had available. I installed the bezels onto the two outer edgewise meters, and lined them up to the mark I made indicating the flange on the inside of the main housing. Since the Navball has an integrated bezel as well, I just left a very small gap between the meters and Navball. On the right side, I again aligned the Vertical Velocity Meter to come right up to the mark I made indicating where the main housing flange sits. Placing the Radar Altimeter tape meter and he DSKY in a reasonable position, I\u0027m left with the small gap between the Navball and the DSKY, which very nearly ends up being centered. Ideally, I\u0027d love to have two of the smaller display side by side. I need room for an LED illuminated scale on the side those displays in the center will have an LED masked to look like a pointer, and the entire assembly will be able to move up and down, just like how the \u2206v burn meter on screen, next to the Navball works. When set, the meter will physically move the displays to the top of the scale. When you perform a burn, the meter will move toward the bottom, indicating the percentage of the burn completed. The displays will display the \u2206v and the burn time. There may be some additional displays at the bottom to indicate more details, if needed. The big gimmick, of course, is the physical movement of the digital display and pointer LED. The mechanism will be different than the one for the tape meter, but reuse a lot of the same ideas. I\u0027ll snag the linear bearings out of a printer or typewriter, for the display assembly to move up and down on. A pair of pulleys will be mounted above and below the assembly, and a cable attached to the assembly will be spooled around a drum attached to a motor. This is literally just the guts from an electronic typewriter I have, reused. I\u0027ll have to figure out how much rotation of the motor translates into how much distance is moved by the display assembly. If I instal\u00A0a large enough drum, then the circumference itself could simply equate to the distance traveled, and again, I\u0027d only need to mount a magnet to the drum, and read it\u0027s angle with a Hall Effect Rotary Position Sensor, same as the tape meter. I honestly don\u0027t know yet just how wide the carriage meter will end up being. I\u0027m hoping it is narrower, simply so I have some space for bezels.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sbAs10e.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002297.25\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 width=\u0022790\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sbAs10e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne final note, I need to rework the current dropper resistors for the diode ROMs. Pic is a bit blurry, but if you look at the second row of pins, from the edge, you can see they\u0027ve all snapped off.\u00A0I took a gamble and tried to use ceramic surface mount resistors, mounted on end with the sockets for the ROMs mounted on the end of those.\u00A0I was very concerned that they could crack, given how brittle ceramic resistors are, and sure enough, it did. Why did I use ceramics, if I knew they had a risk of cracking? Simple... I had \u0027em on hand, and I wanted to see it light up when I built it.\u00A0The\u00A0solution is simple though.\u00A0I just need to order the\u00A0through hole version of the resistor, so I have sturdy leads to solder to. It\u0027ll probably take an hour or two to rework. It\u0027s more a waste of time than anything. There\u0027s about 30 resistors per display pair/diode ROM set, plus several\u00A0more for the \u0022Time To:\u0022 ROM, so just about a hundred to replace. Cost won\u0027t be an issue.\u00A0250 pieces will only cost me $3.84, and will be enough to do all the LEDs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-16T12:13:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2020 12:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Me!","CreatedById":201558,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-22T15:47:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is simply amazing! \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-23T11:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just had an absolutely hilarious idea...
