I\u0027ve gotten to the point where I can land reliably. But landing in the same spot twice (in order to build a base) is hard. I was trying to land this module next to the rover I sent ahead as a scout. I got to within 1.1 km and the rover drove over to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/44SoxPN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/44SoxPN\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T06:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELanding at your target can indeed be quite the trick. But there\u0027s some tools to help you! If you target your destination craft while coming in for a landing, then switch it back to Surface mode (you may have to do this multiple times; there\u0027s currently a bug in the system regarding switching to Surface when targeting), you\u0027ll get a marker for your target\u0027s location. Just try to keep your retrograde vector somewhat near the pink dot with three lines, and you\u0027ll land right next to it (or possibly right on top of it if you get a little too zealous!). Generally speaking, it\u0027s best to line up your incoming approach for landing first, and only start doing target-based fine adjustment when you\u0027re within about 5KM or so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoshJ5Hawk","CreatedById":63093,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T06:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood lord...
