I am getting kerbal rescue contracts (standard) for low Gael(Kerbin Equivalent) orbit. The only issue is that the orbits are often within the atmosphere - their AP is just in space but the PE is as low as 40-50km. Is this intentional?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo","CreatedById":150430,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-24T23:46:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would have to say in a 10x play through you will experience things like this pretty often, as the game wasn\u0027t meant to be any bigger than stock scale.
