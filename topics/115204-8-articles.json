I totally get where your at, believe me. \n\nIn the short term, if you need to get thru the next couple chapters, you may be best staying with 1.0.5, if it\u0027s working OK enough.\n\nBut I\u0027m afraid you may be stuck upgrading eventually.

You may end up with no choice in the long run.\n\nIf it were me, I would probably use 1.0.5 for now and do some serious thinking and re-writing and damage control, so to speak, and plan on how best to upgrade to 1.1.  Maybe your monster could be split into half a dozen huge class-E\u0027s?  IDK... I\u0027m just pulling stuff from thin air, and have no real idea where you want to take this... but I\u0027m sure if you think about it long enough, you can find a way to adjust things but still end up where you wanted to go.\n\nAlso remember, all of us here on the forum know how an upgrade can screw up a saved game using mods, and are very, very understanding of the situation.
