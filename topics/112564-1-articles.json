This thread will document my main career mode, Interplanetary Welcoming Express, which will be played as a lighthearted, comical, and often absurd quest to build a network of space hotels around the Kerbol system. Read on to learn more. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been a fan of KSP since the first public release and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m so happy that squad has seen their vision through to what it is today. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s high time for me to finally participate in the community, so I hope that you will take a minute to tell me what you think of my intrepid Kerbals\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 bold adventures. Thanks for reading! \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Will*\n\n![J7Adz4Y.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/J7Adz4Y.jpg)\n\n**The Story:**\n\nKerbals are an industrious little species, and they have taken to space with the kind of enthusiasm you might expect out of someone who has just learned that ice cream sandwiches are incredibly good for you. Every nation, corporation, and bold Kerbal with a tool kit and an unhealthy abundance of ambition is striving to make a name for themselves among the stars. **The Space Exploration Administration of Kerbin (SEAK)** was originally formed to be the best of bunch, the cream of the crop \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 to take Kerbalkind to new heights, and to become a shining star leading the way for future spacefarers of all kind! But this proved a bit too optimistic.\n\nThe universe is big, and surely Kerbals aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t the only spacefaring race floating through the void. They may not even be the greenest. One night in the aftermath of a particularly destructive staff party, the SEAK administrators determined that it was utterly pointless to try to be the best out of everyone in a universe where they couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be certain of just who \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ceveryone\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 was. In fact, the next morning in the aftermath of the aftermath of the party, they concluded that effort of all kinds was pointless due to the inescapable scale of the universe and the equally inescapable insignificance of Kerbin in the grand scheme of things.\n\nInspired by the kind of pessimism that can only exist in the deepest of hangovers, everyone more or less agreed that since life almost surely exists elsewhere in the universe, it will likely one day attempt to conquer, subjugate, or otherwise destroy Kerbalkind. They continued to agree that the best way to instill oneself in the good graces of an invading alien race would be to give them freshly made beds to sleep in when they arrive.\n\nSo, out of a combination of begrudging acceptance of their place in the universe and everyday boredom, the SEAK admins gave up trying to be the best at everything and resolved to build a network of space hotels around the Kerbol system instead. Although it has never been proven, the idea for this unlikely change of direction is most probably attributed to the group of hotel chain regional managers that snuck into that particularly destructive staff party when they found out that the minibars at their own hotel chain didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t come pre-stocked.\n\n![Yhf10uS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Yhf10uS.jpg)\n\nSo there we have it. After making it through the growing pains of space program infancy, SEAK was restructured and given a new, and (in the words of the SEAK public relations team) altogether more responsible and practical direction. So the Interplanetary Welcoming Express was born!\n\n**With a newly minted vision of exciting and efficient space hospitality, SEAK Interplanetary Welcoming Express has two primary goals:**\n\n1. Create a network of hotels (and necessary support facilities) spanning each terrestrial body in the Kerbol system\n2. Develop fast, cheap, and efficient ways of ferrying patrons to and from these futuristic abodes so that they can turn a profit until they are eventually inhabited by invading alien species\n\n Everything I do in career mode should lead to accomplishing these goals, although some unrelated missions may be necessary since I have to keep the funds, science, and rep coming in.\n\n**This will be the ongoing mission log, which will be updated as I play. I will attempt to document my missions and present them in an entertaining way with screenshots, text descriptions, and quotes taken from interviews with the various characters to add a bit of color.**\n\n1.

What better place to start than Duna? It is friendly, inviting, close by, and (most importantly) the object of some very lucrative contracts.\n\n* * *\n\n**Stay tuned!

Its design supports a crew of 3 Kerbals with an extra crew module solely dedicated to in-flight entertainment. It contains a zero-G ping-pong table, a small library of romance novels, and a sandwich-making station fit for a medium-size corporate catering outfit. Attached to the main body of the vessel are two SEAKmap Alpha mapping satellites and two unclassified surface probes named Calvin and Hobbes. *(Editor\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s note: You are expected to accept this and all future examples of human references overlapping Kerbal ones. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m only so creative you know).* The forward-mounted drive section is capped with a heat shield for aerobraking maneuvers, and its two nuclear engines are toed out slightly so that they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t cook the crew. Due to its weight and unwieldy shape, the craft was designed to be launched in two halves and connected in orbit over Kerbin.\n\nEven with two launches the old Centaur rockets weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t big enough. The engineers were tasked with designing a new launch vehicle capable of carrying the payload into orbit, which they did in record time thanks to obscene amounts of koffee - extra caffeine. Independent of any knowledge of human scientists, someone decided to name it the Newton V1. Everybody thought that sounded pretty swell so it stuck.\n\n![QkNtdBJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QkNtdBJ.jpg)\n\nThe craft was finished just in time for the Duna launch window, so Valentina, Eilla, and Neilberry began packing their bags and preparing for the long trip ahead. The drive section was sent up first. Everyone was very pleased to see that this occurred with a complete lack of unplanned explosions.\n\n![Gx2fv9w.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Gx2fv9w.jpg)\n\n![OkLzGJu.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OkLzGJu.jpg)\n\nThe next day the main body of the DunEx There and Back Again was launched, beginning an exciting new chapter in SEAK\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s brief, inconsistent, and to this point frankly uninteresting history. The Kerbal media seemed to focus heavily on the \u0022uninteresting\u0022 point. The SEAK media relations team felt rather hurt by this, and were quick to rebut that they shouldn\u0027t be faulted for a taking a while to hit their stride. After all, they protested, nobody was perfect. They felt this was a winning argument and patted themselves on the back. \n\n![bauWiq4.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bauWiq4.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n**#2**\n\n![9lCi7fu.png](http://i.imgur.com/9lCi7fu.png)\n\n**Service Mission:** Mun Base Alpha\n\n**Moniker:** MunServ 1\n\n**Objectives:** Test crew ferry design elements, return long-duration base crew to Kerbin\n\n**Vessel:** Mun Service Bus\n\n**Crew:** Unmanned (3-Kerbal capacity for return)\n\nWhile the DunEx crew settled into their bunks aboard There and Back Again, the watery eyes of the SEAK admins turned back to local matters. The crew of Mun Base Alpha had been dutifully picking through nondescript, grey, sulfur-smelling dust for long enough that they were starting to name Mun rocks and keep them as pets. The admins decided that it was time for a rotation, especially so that they could pry Jebediah away from composing elaborate back-stories for his Mun rock pets and return him to active duty flying mission for the Interplanetary Welcoming Express.\n\nSince the main engineers had been too busy working on the DunEx launch, the only design available for a crew transfer lander had been sketched up on the back of candy wrappers by a class of students that had visited the VAB on a field trip. In an inspiring demonstration of faith and pride in the Kerbal youth, the SEAK admins decided to actually launch the design. Fortunately, they had just enough sense to make it an unmanned test.\n\nThey loaded the child-designed Mun Service Bus up on a Centaur rocket and launched for the Mun.\n\n![WFpxgVx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WFpxgVx.jpg)\n\nAwkwardly, nobody had bothered to check the Munar calendar before they launched, so the robotic Mun Service Bus would need to land in the dark. The engineers didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t find this too alarming, until they learned that the craft\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s AI was bewilderingly programmed to use its onboard cameras for landing rather than any of the more sophisticated options readily available. To add to the problem, the lander\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s robotic brain was \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 for a reason no one could adequately explain \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 programmed with propensity to throw caution to the wind and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cdo it live\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 in a desperate attempt to impress the female AI that controlled Mun Base Alpha\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s solar panel alignment.\n\nThe robotic Mun Service Bus bravely hurtled towards the uneven ground near the base, bravely attempted a 180-degree turn right before landing so that the pretty solar panel AI could see it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s good side, and then bravely crashed into the surface. *(Editor\u0027s note: I do not have any images of this exciting event. I was a bit preoccupied attempting to prevent it. Don\u0027t worry, in the future, entertainment shall come before safety!)* Jeb consoled his frightened Mun rock pets and walked out to investigate the crash.\n\n![b2CdGMO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/b2CdGMO.jpg)\n\nThe craft was remarkably salvageable, but didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have enough fuel left for the return trip. Jeb and Katmie the Mun Queen shrugged it off and happily returned to discussions on Mun rock breeds and mineral husbandry.\n\n![0UcmBZn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0UcmBZn.jpg)\n\n(Editor\u0027s note: You are expected to ignore the fact that Mun Base Alpha is clearly adorned with a NASA flag. It was built before I had created the custom SEAK flags. It will be fixed for future missions.)\n\nThe SEAK staff back on Kerbin fumed and mumbled expletives through clenched teeth, but decided it was in poor taste to swear about a design created by bright-eyed children. They felt as though they needed to preemptively make up for the bad behavior they had considered exhibiting. The public relations team began looking ahead on the calendar to plan an ice cream social for the neighborhood kids so that they could feel better about themselves.\n\nWith Val, Eilla, and Neilberry on an interplanetary trajectory aboard There and Back Again, the overarching mood at the KSC was one of excitement. The Interplanetary Welcoming Express was underway!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T15:04:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 03:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GehringGame**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T00:53:45Z","Content":"Appreciate the kind words and glad to have you as a reader!

This opinion was shared by all of the project managers at SEAK, so when the admins requested that the launching of a new communications network be moved to the top of the priority list they were met with a room full of project managers staring fixedly at remote corners of the room and mumbling about how pleased they would be to do it if it weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t for some very good reason they couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t bring to mind at the time.\n\nThe public relations team, who were desperate for anything that the public might relate to, explained that high-qaulity television satellites would be a much more popular option. This was met with wild applause. The admins conceded the fact that having over two thousand channels of premium programming would be a nice draw for future space hotels. However, they insisted that long range communications capability be built in to the satellites. The DunEx There and Back Again would be out of range of ground communications before long and the admins found this distressing. The project managers thought that the admins were distressed entirely too easily, and suggested that the DunEx crew had talked too much when they were on Kerbin, and maybe everyone would like some peace and quiet. Somebody at the back of the room was feeling alliterative and starting chanting \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNo noise from Neilberry! No noise from Neilberry!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nEventually, it was decided that the communications capability should be included, but not actually be used to communicate with the DunEx crew until the staff was done enjoying their absence (and they still might not talk to Neilberry).\n\nThe news circulating around the SEAK offices the next day did not have to do with television entertainment. Everybody had been so excited to launch the DunEx There and Back Again that nobody had paused to consider the cost of developing it. This was particularly embarrassing for the accountants, who now had to break the news that SEAK was very nearly out of money. The administrators were in no mood to hear this and quickly made it someone else\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s problem.\n\nChief Engineer Bill Kerman wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t the least bit pleased to learn that something had just become his problem. However, he grasped the handle of his koffee mug firmly, prepared his system to receive and unhealthy dose of caffeine, and went to work developing a cheap, reusable rocket that could launch the premium entertainment satellites into orbit.\n\nTesting went hilariously badly.\n\n![sOlghUx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sOlghUx.jpg)\n\nIt took a couple of iterations to get things right, but Bill congratulated himself for persevering through adversity. He had come up with SEAK\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s first reusable rocket! The Virgil B is a small rocket capable of delivering satellites two at a time into orbit, then returning for a powered landing at the KSC. It is unmanned and is powered by the Virgil AI system (not by the Hactar system, thankfully). \n\n![suQvPdF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/suQvPdF.jpg)\n\nThe planned network needed seven satellites, so four launches were scheduled to put the craft into orbit. The Virgil B uses two pairs of relatively cheap solid rocket boosters firing in sequence to take it up to 12 km, then the main engine throttles up to take it into an 80 km orbit. *(Editor\u0027s note: We can imagine that the SRBs would fall back to Kerbin on parachutes and then be recovered and reused for the next launch. I just didn\u0027t bother simulating this in the game).*\n\n![Sg0nk4j.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Sg0nk4j.jpg)\n\nWith the payload delivered, the main stage performs a deorbit burn to take it down near the space center. Airbrakes deploy and can be controlled to adjust the descent path and select a landing zone.\n\n![K0CUDA2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/K0CUDA2.jpg)\n\nThe first launch revealed a flaw in the Virgil B\u0027s design. The battery overheated during reentry and the depleting electric charge muddled the AI core, causing a loss of attitude control a kilometer above the surface.\n\n![N3sGTzl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/N3sGTzl.jpg)\n\nThe rocket landed too hard and tipped over, forcefully rejecting the AI core that had caused it to crash and sulking about it. Even accounting for the control failure, a faulty descent profile lead to the Virgil B meeting the ground a good distance away from the planned site next to the hangar. The AI programming team scrambled to come up with a solution before the next launch. Meanwhile, the satellites from the first launch (KerbCom 1 and 2) performed the necessary maneuvers to take them into their final orbits.\n\nA small upper stage boosts the satellites to a higher orbit where they go their separate ways. They use their own thrusters to move into the appropriately inclined plane. \n\n![Sseutnn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Sseutnn.jpg)\n\nThe programming team found the error in the Virgil AI\u0027s targeting system, but decided it would be better to improvise an immediate solution rather than scrap the remaining three launches while they fixed the problem at its source. Their solution was to build a mobile tracking station that would use its own landing computer to guide the rocket stage down. With the tracking station in place next to the landing site, the SEAK staff crossed their fingers for a successful landing on the second attempt.\n\n![NjNSefS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NjNSefS.jpg)\n\nThe battery was given better insulation to guard against reentry heat. \n\n![shG2gZn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/shG2gZn.jpg)\n\nThe mobile tracking station guided the rocket down directly onto the prepared landing site. The main engine fired up to land the rocket softly on its legs and.... touchdown!\n\n![0uSC6z7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0uSC6z7.jpg)\n\nThe fully intact main stage was refueled and reused for the remaining two launches.

At present, they were agonizing over which bed linen color would best communicate an atmosphere of comfortable opulence to future alien conquerors.\n\nThe reason for this three-day lunch meeting (other than the fact that it could be expensed) was to ensure that the Interplanetary Welcoming Express\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s first hotel on another world would be as wonderful and luxurious as everyone had dreamed. One of the web developers had accidentally launched the reservations website early, and as a result SEAK had been flooded with reservation requests for the Magical Minmus Resort and Creamery which didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t yet exist. The admins didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to lose out on this revenue, so they determined that the Magical Minmus Resort and Creamery should exist as soon as possible. They also determined that the name was stupid, argued over who\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s idea it was, and said that they would change it after lunch, which so far showed no signs of ending.\n\nSo Bill\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s engineering team was swamped with yet another last-minute project \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 designing habitation facilities for the Majestic Minmus Inn and Suites or whatever it was going to be called. Bill didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t like hotels, but he agreed to the project because it presented a challenge. The new habitation module would need to connect to the existing Minmus Science Lab, mostly because the admins wanted to save money by mooching electricity and central air circulation off of the other facility. This meant it would need to mate up to the old docking ports on the lab, and it would need to have a small enough utility footprint that the lab\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s existing systems could support it. It also would need to be small and narrow enough to launch on the Newton V1 because there just wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t enough money sitting around to design yet another launch vehicle.\n\nThe attempts made by the interior designers to communicate their vision of grand, beautiful opulence to a team of rocket engineers were about as effective as the earnest attempts of an American goldfinch to ask a blue whale out on a date. That is to say, not at all. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s hard to describe how exactly they managed to put a final design down on paper, but when they did it looked like this:\n\n![A7IS0nO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/A7IS0nO.jpg)\n\n*(Editor\u0027s note: Imagining these kinds of parts as hotel rooms on the inside takes a little lateral thinking. Some may look more hotel-ish than others, but a certain amount will be left up to the imagination.)*\n\nGiven the inflexible size constraints, the interior designers were forced to see efficiency as beauty. Inside each of the Mk2 crew sections is a private, two-kerbal suite packed with the most extravagant bed linens selected during the SEAK admins\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 extended lunch meeting. Each suite connects to a living area with a full kitchen, bath, and top-of-the-line personal ice cream maker.\n\nTo economize their launches, SEAK had decided to send the replacement science team for Minmus Science Lab along with the new hotel section. Wilfel and Caldorf (two rookies) were selected for the assignment. There were some concerns about the mating of the two sections once on Minmus. Since the science lab didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have a resident engineer at the time, Bill Kerman volunteered to ride along and provide support for the unwieldy chunk of metal his team had createad.\n\nWhen launch day rolled around, the Magical Minmus Resort and Creamery (nobody got around to changing the name) was carted out to the launch pad atop a fueled and primed Newton V1. All fragile decorations had been secured for launch and the three-kerbal crew were strapped into harnesses in one of the living rooms. Despite having three living crew members on board, the entire mission would be controlled remotely.\n\n![UlWnuBG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UlWnuBG.jpg)\n\n![G9hy6jj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/G9hy6jj.jpg)\n\nThe Magical Minmus Resort and Creamery was equipped with a descent system similar to the design that had originally landed Minmus Science Lab back before the Interplanetary Welcome Express was envisioned. It would touch down vertically on the main engine, then pitch forward and use RCS jets to fall gently into its final horizontal position. The landing was conducted at night, which as we know can be problematic for the Hactar 1 AI system. Fortunately the programmers sorted out that issue and the landing went over as well as anybody could reasonably expect. What the programmers did not sort out was the constant stream of questions along the lines of, \u0022The AI controlling those solar panels, do you think she is single? I bet she has a bunch of AIs chasing after her, what do you think? Do you think I have a chance? No seriously, you think I do? Do you think she saw that landing? Was she impressed?\u0022 it went on for quite some time.\n\n![JznDB6H.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JznDB6H.jpg)\n\nOnce on the ground, Bill had to spend quite a bit of time swearing at the Hactar 1 as it attempted to position the base for docking. It turns out that due to some oversights nobody was willing to accept responsibility for, the RCS jets used for the docking procedure weren\u0027t quite strong enough to lift the heavy descent system off the ground. This meant that there was a very tense moment in which the Hactar 1 fired the main engine to lift the whole thing off the ground rather more suddenly than anyone was comfortable with. Bill imagined this is what it would feel like to be agonizing over which wire to cut to disarm a bomb, only to have a hilariously incompetent and juvenile computer jump in a select for you. Luckily, nothing exploded, and the Magical Minmus Resort and Creamery was finally ready to dock!\n\n![13XgTBm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/13XgTBm.jpg)\n\n![eKtqk2t.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/eKtqk2t.jpg)\n\nWith the two sections connected together and power flowing into the luxury hotel suites from Minmus Science Lab\u0027s main system, the order came through from SEAK mission control that everyone should spend a few days enjoying themselves in their new home. \u0022But, please,\u0022 they added, cutting Karsy and Megcie off mid-cheer, \u0022don\u0027t break anything because the first guests arrive next week. The long term goal is providing nice, welcoming hotel rooms for visiting aliens, but the short term goal is sweet, cold profit. So keep things looking nice!\u0022 Karsy had already stopped listening and was extending the TV receiver dish. Bill, on the other hand, was taking a moment to look out over Minmus\u0027s flats and think. \n\n![9QzKltv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9QzKltv.jpg)\n\nAs the sun set on the base, dynamic science duo Megcie and Karsy were showing Wilfel and Caldorf around their new science lab, but mostly around the arts and crafts station that they had constructed to pass the time. Bill was still looking out over Minmus and thinking about the future of SEAK and the Interplanetary Welcome Express.\n\n![Lx8srOJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Lx8srOJ.jpg)\n\nBill soon found his train of thought tiring and returned to thoughts about riding giant columns of explosions up into the sky. \u0022Rockets RULE,\u0022 he thought. He liked this thought, and went inside to share it with the rest of the crew.\n\n* * *\n\nThanks for reading!

Finally, they were coming down the home stretch.

Valentina, Eilla, and Neilberry did not. The trio couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t wait to set foot on Ike so that they could get more than a few meters away from one another. Since that wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t an option aboard the There and Back Again, each crew member had devised their own way of passing the time. Eilla enjoyed reading through the ship\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s collection of romance novels at marathon pace. Valentina enjoyed beating Neilberry repeatedly at zero-g ping-pong. Neilberry (who thought the whole trip was just a blast and didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know what the other two were all annoyed about) ate sandwiches and told jokes which he just *knew* were professional comedian material.\n\nDay 275 marked the final correction maneuver that would take their periapsis down into Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s upper atmosphere (actually it was planned for day 278 but Val was impatient). It was a short burn at minimum thrust, but enough to force Eilla and Neilberry to sit together for a few seconds.\n\n![2fsSFxt.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2fsSFxt.jpg)\n\nAfter the correction burn Val and Eilla suited up for a tandem EVA to check up on the There and Back Again\u0027s systems before Duna arrival. They checked the two SEAKmap Alpha satellites and the Calvin and Hobbes landers, then they just floated for a while enjoying the rare and wonderful silence, totally devoid of Neilberry\u0027s humor. \n\n![Sj3dlBj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Sj3dlBj.jpg)\n\nSoon they would be able to complete their mission and enter into celebrity in the eyes of the SEAK staff. Just 26 days to go, with plenty of sandwiches to go around.\n\n![IMOY3rw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IMOY3rw.jpg)\n\nMeanwhile back at KSC plans were already underway for missions to each of the other bodies in the Kerbol system. Before the next launch could happen however, SEAK needed to do some personnel management and bring in some contract funds. The first Mun Service Bus attempt had left the long term Mun Base Alpha crew stranded for an even longer term stay. It was high time to bring them back. With Bill absent on Minmus, the rest of the engineering team puffed up their chests and asserted that they could do just as good a job without him. They proudly proposed a nuclear powered lander, built it in record time, and strapped to the top of a modified Centaur rocket. Not ten minutes after they had finished telling all of their friends how perfect the design was, it spontaneously combusted on the launch pad.\n\n![ruvLWaw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ruvLWaw.jpg)\n\nFortunately no Kerbals were aboard at the time of the blast, but it did leave a black mark on the egos of the engineering team, and the destruction of the modified Centaur left a red mark in the accountants\u0027 ledgers. Everyone sheepishly agreed that maybe they had better call Bill after all."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T15:33:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Dozens of LV-Ns spontaneously combust each year--it\u0027s just not widely reported.\n\nAnother great update!

This anxiety reached an all-time high after the engineering team\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s attempt at a nuclear lander suddenly became many small, burning pieces of a nuclear lander. The call was made to Bill out on Minmus and he painstakingly dictated a proper design over the phone. For now, SEAK just needed a craft capable of ferrying up to five Kerbals between Kerbin and its moons. In the future, the technology tested on the Crew Service Bus could be used in a more luxurious hotel shuttle.\n\nThe first order of business was scrapping the painfully Hactar 1 AI core and never speaking to it again. Since the... enthusiastic personality of the first iteration caused it to crash into the Mun\u0027s surface, It\u0027s replacement, the Hactar 2, was designed not to have a personality. When the lander was fully assembled according to Bill\u0027s instructions, the engineers found a non-exploded Centaur rocket and modified it to carry the heavier payload. \n\n![slt4sMn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/slt4sMn.jpg)\n\nThe primary objective of the MunServ 2 mission was to return Jebediah and Kenoly Kerman from their extended stay at Mun Base Alpha. The secondary objective was a bit more interesting. Two astronauts from a rival space program (Ribrey and Bilmund) had been on course to rendezvous in Munar orbit for a spot of tea. Embarrassingly, when they arrived at the Mun they discovered that they had were orbiting in opposite directions. Their own space program disowned them and made a public statement about not tolerating incompetence, etc. The SEAK admins, however, thought it was admirable that two kerbals would go to such lengths to meet for tea. The admins declared that Ribrey and Bilmund would be rescued and given the opportunity to join the Interplanetary Welcoming Express. They also made sure that they had stocked the Crew Service Bus with light refreshments and popular magazines so that the new astronaut\u0027s first impression of SEAK would be a good one.\n\nThe Crew Service Bus had been equipped with flashing orange lights to help the stranded kerbals locate it in the blackness of space. *(Editor\u0027s note: New mod!)* Ribrey spotted it right away as it approached and wasn\u0027t the least bit hesitant to climb aboard. He had spent the last half a day shouting insults at Bilmund when he passed by. It had taken a long time to complete a meaningful insult since Bilmund passed him at over 600 m/s and he could only get a single word in each time.\n\n![ckuc0Wd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ckuc0Wd.jpg)\n\nAfter picking up Ribrey, Hactar 2 guided the Crew Service Bus down to the surface. It was a clinical landing with absolutely no personality by design. The Hactar 1 module from the original Mun Service Bus scoffed at the lack of pizzazz, but was envious of how close Hactar 2 got to be to the pretty solar panel AI he had been trying to woo this whole time. \n\nJeb and Kenoly said farewell to their Mun rock pets and climbed aboard. Tanwig, who had been chosen to stay behind and continue doing science, was sullen. Katmie the self-named Mun Queen, who the SEAK psychologists thought had a \u0022seriously weird\u0022 relationship with the Mun, stayed behind happily. \n\n![xoMd3fm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xoMd3fm.jpg)\n\nHactar 2 took the Crew Service Bus back up the way it came and into a retrograde orbit to rescue Bilmund. Bilmund, who had passed the time stranded in orbit by making several expensive bets that he would be rescued before Ribrey, was none-too-pleased to see his colleague aboard. He spent the rest of the ride home making phone calls to explain that, yes, he had the money, but couldn\u0027t everyone just be happy that he was rescued for a minute and forget about the bet?\n\n![itwfkgf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/itwfkgf.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n**#6**\n\n![9lCi7fu.png](http://i.imgur.com/9lCi7fu.png)\n\n**Service Mission:** Minmus Science Lab\n\n**Moniker:** MinServ 1\n\n**Objectives:** Test crew ferry design elements, return long-duration base crew to Kerbin\n\n**Vessel:** Crew Service Bus\n\n**Crew:** Unmanned (5-Kerbal capacity for return)\n\nThe MunServ 2 mission was so successful that the admins were quick to request a similar mission to Minmus in order to retrieve Bill (who was clearly needed at home) and dynamic science duo Megcie and Karsy. The Crew Service Bus was refitted and relaunched.\n\n![T582DkI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/T582DkI.jpg)\n\nThe mission went off without a hitch. Hactar 2 performed another purposefully dry and uninteresting landing, Wilfel and Caldorf bade Megcie and Karsy farefwell, and Bill sat comfortably in the command pod of the Crew Service Bus as it didn\u0027t break in any way.\n\n![LKIF8Zf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LKIF8Zf.jpg)\n\nNow, with five valuable crew members returned from their posts, and two new additions to the Interplanetary Welcoming Express team, the SEAK admins could start planning their next interplanetary mission in earnest.\n\n* * *\n\nThanks for reading!

Actually, most of the SEAK staff had been so busy testing new technologies for their next mission that they had forgotten all about the the antiquated There and Back Again.\n\nIt seemed the Interplanetary Welcoming Express had a shorter attention span than the 303 days it took for a trip to Duna. Eventually word got around to everyone, usually met with something along the lines of, \u0022Oh, *that* mission? Wow I totally forgot about that. Ok, cool.\u0022\n\nVal, Eilla, and Neilberry shared considerably more enthusiasm about the event.\n\n![PPPUl4c.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PPPUl4c.jpg)\n\nThe There and Back Again was designed for an aerocapture trajectory to save fuel. Over the course of their journey, Val had had plenty of time to check the fuel levels and conclude that the fuel budget was quite a bit tighter than anyone would have liked, so special care was taken to make sure she got the maneuver absolutely right.\n\n![D73qxBw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/D73qxBw.jpg)\n\nThose back at the space center (those that were paying attention at least) watched as the new apoapsis settled down right onto Ike\u0027s orbit. Val had performed the maneuver impossibly well. \n\nAfter spending the proper amount of time staring slack-jawed and watery-eyed at the red planet, the crew got to work deploying the Duna component of the mission. Eilla had grown attached to her probes during her many EVA\u0027s to escape Neilberry. She felt like a proud mother sending her children off to the first day of kindergarten. Remedial kindergarten maybe - the probes had been hastily and sloppily designed - but nobody wanted to tell her this.\n\n![GN7wMcu.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GN7wMcu.jpg)\n\nSimultaneously plotting the correct trajectories for the two surface probes and the mapping satellite proved too much for Neilberry to comprehend. He apologized cheerfully to a fuming Val and called Bob for help.\n\nThe Hobbes probe was easy enough. It would land near the equator at the mouth of one of Duna\u0027s prominent canyons. The Calvin probe and the SEAKmap Alpha satellite, however, needed to move to a polar orbit. Bob tried to make this a teaching moment for Neilberry, but after spending the better part of an hour trying to explain that the term \u0022orbital mechanics\u0022 didn\u0027t actually mean guys that will fix your car if it breaks down in space, Bob decided just to do it all himself and send over the final calculations. All it took were a couple small burns and a friendly helping hand from Ike.\n\n![rWVdBpd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rWVdBpd.jpg)\n\nThe crew had indeed forgotten to install the antennae on the SEAKmap Alpha satellites. They decided it was easier to blame someone else. It had probably been the job of some junior engineer back at the space center, right? Although the two satellites would be useless without antennae, they decided to put them into their respective orbits anyway. The surface probes, they hoped, didn\u0027t have any major flaws.\n\nHobbes was the first to begin its descent. It was targeting a scenic canyon that the SEAK admins thought might offer breathtaking views to future hotel guests. Unfortunately, the probe was another casualty of the engineers\u0027 koffee-addled brains at the time it was designed. The solar cells hadn\u0027t been intended for atmospheric entry, and they broke away during the descent. Although the probe landed safely, power ran dry and communication was lost before it could transmit any meaningful data. \n\n![2sKcEwh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2sKcEwh.jpg)\n\nThe Calvin probe adjusted for the problem and was able to use its landing engines to slow its descent over the edge of the south pole. This time the solar cells survived and the probe landed fully intact.\n\n![qTSwbqk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qTSwbqk.jpg)\n\nThe first images of the landing site were enough to sell the SEAK admins on the south pole as the location of their Duna hotel. It had everything! It had a view of Ike, it was flat, it was exclusive, and, most importantly, it was pink.\n\n![Zj8HSzQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Zj8HSzQ.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\nNext up: more updates from the DunEx crew as they explore Ike!

Yeah I used to play without it, and for a while I used it sporadically since it kept getting turned off by the xbox controller bug. Now that I\u0027m using it consistently I can\u0027t live without it. It looks particularly good on Duna\u0027s south pole!\n\nAs for the antennae - yeah that was just a bonehead move on my part. I really need a pre-launch checklist. I\u0027ve toyed with the idea of using kerbal attachment system to fix antennae to them in a later mission, but I\u0027ll probably just bring new satellites with me and scrub the old ones. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I hope the update dont break your crafts...

I\u0027ll check things out once I have some more play time. Lot\u0027s of things to do IRL is definitely going to slow me down! Hopefully I can keep the updates coming at a 2-3 per week pace. Oh man, I\u0027m not sure that looking at all the details is a good thing! I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll make a continuity error at some point. Actually I just realized that the image of the orbits shows the Hobbes lander already down on the surface.

Fortunately, the crew of the DunEx There and Back Again were oblivious to the schemes forming back home on Kerbin. The Duna portion of their mission was over and the Calvin probe had discovered the perfect location for the Duna hotel. Now, it was on to Ike, where Val and Eilla could finally reestablish a comfortable bubble of personal space. Before landing, they dropped off the other communication-less SEAKmap Alpha satellite. \u0022If it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to be dead in the water it might as well have a nice view,\u0022 they thought.\n\n![fzZ0HW4.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fzZ0HW4.jpg)\n\nNobody (except maybe Neilberry) was too reluctant to disconnect from the recreation module. The smell of mayonnaise from the oversized sandwich kitchen had become pretty overpowering. With the drive unit and recreation module left in orbit, the crew burned for the surface like a child chasing an ice cream truck.\n\n![WUYPdmH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WUYPdmH.jpg)\n\nThey stood next to each other just long enough to admire Duna on the horizon.\n\n![wnnU1BD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wnnU1BD.jpg)\n\nThe crew had three days of surface time to enjoy. Neilberry added to his already annoyingly high self-confidence by successfully performing the mission\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s list of science experiments, Val wandered around staring at Duna and thinking about how it was possible for Neilberry to be so confident and so incompetent at the same time, and Eilla just went straight out to the edge of her EVA range and sat behind a rock in silence. For the three Kerbals it was paradise. \n\n![nl4GCvy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nl4GCvy.jpg)\n\nThe three days of surface time went by in a flash, and soon the crew was strapped back into the capsule for the return to orbit. \n\n![hkFkhay.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/hkFkhay.jpg)\n\nThe crew docked with the other half of the There and Back Again and the smell of condiments and lunchmeats wafted nauseatingly into the capsule. Home sweet home. Neilberry was somehow giddy with the prospect of yet another sandwich lunch.\n\n![qVQIquv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qVQIquv.jpg)\n\nWhen the return window rolled around Val fired up the nuclear engines and set the There and Back Again on a course to return to Kerbin. The SEAK staff were already caught up in planning the next mission, so the crew was left enduring Neilberry\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s insecent terrible jokes on the 299-day trip.\n\n![LBPCxmt.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LBPCxmt.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\nThis update took some time due to issues with my game. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m now playing without issue in 1.0.4 although some mods still need to update.
