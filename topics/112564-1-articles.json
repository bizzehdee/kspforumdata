Every nation, corporation, and bold Kerbal with a tool kit and an unhealthy abundance of ambition is striving to make a name for themselves among the stars. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe Space Exploration Administration of Kerbin (SEAK)\u003C/strong\u003E was originally formed to be the best of bunch, the cream of the crop \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 to take Kerbalkind to new heights, and to become a shining star leading the way for future spacefarers of all kind! But this proved a bit too optimistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe universe is big, and surely Kerbals aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t the only spacefaring race floating through the void. They may not even be the greenest. One night in the aftermath of a particularly destructive staff party, the SEAK administrators determined that it was utterly pointless to try to be the best out of everyone in a universe where they couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be certain of just who \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ceveryone\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 was. In fact, the next morning in the aftermath of the aftermath of the party, they concluded that effort of all kinds was pointless due to the inescapable scale of the universe and the equally inescapable insignificance of Kerbin in the grand scheme of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInspired by the kind of pessimism that can only exist in the deepest of hangovers, everyone more or less agreed that since life almost surely exists elsewhere in the universe, it will likely one day attempt to conquer, subjugate, or otherwise destroy Kerbalkind. They continued to agree that the best way to instill oneself in the good graces of an invading alien race would be to give them freshly made beds to sleep in when they arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, out of a combination of begrudging acceptance of their place in the universe and everyday boredom, the SEAK admins gave up trying to be the best at everything and resolved to build a network of space hotels around the Kerbol system instead. Although it has never been proven, the idea for this unlikely change of direction is most probably attributed to the group of hotel chain regional managers that snuck into that particularly destructive staff party when they found out that the minibars at their own hotel chain didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t come pre-stocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Yhf10uS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Yhf10uS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there we have it.

This opinion was shared by all of the project managers at SEAK, so when the admins requested that the launching of a new communications network be moved to the top of the priority list they were met with a room full of project managers staring fixedly at remote corners of the room and mumbling about how pleased they would be to do it if it weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t for some very good reason they couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t bring to mind at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe public relations team, who were desperate for anything that the public might relate to, explained that high-qaulity television satellites would be a much more popular option.

At present, they were agonizing over which bed linen color would best communicate an atmosphere of comfortable opulence to future alien conquerors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for this three-day lunch meeting (other than the fact that it could be expensed) was to ensure that the Interplanetary Welcoming Express\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s first hotel on another world would be as wonderful and luxurious as everyone had dreamed. One of the web developers had accidentally launched the reservations website early, and as a result SEAK had been flooded with reservation requests for the Magical Minmus Resort and Creamery which didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t yet exist. The admins didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to lose out on this revenue, so they determined that the Magical Minmus Resort and Creamery should exist as soon as possible. They also determined that the name was stupid, argued over who\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s idea it was, and said that they would change it after lunch, which so far showed no signs of ending.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Bill\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s engineering team was swamped with yet another last-minute project \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 designing habitation facilities for the Majestic Minmus Inn and Suites or whatever it was going to be called. Bill didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t like hotels, but he agreed to the project because it presented a challenge. The new habitation module would need to connect to the existing Minmus Science Lab, mostly because the admins wanted to save money by mooching electricity and central air circulation off of the other facility. This meant it would need to mate up to the old docking ports on the lab, and it would need to have a small enough utility footprint that the lab\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s existing systems could support it. It also would need to be small and narrow enough to launch on the Newton V1 because there just wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t enough money sitting around to design yet another launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe attempts made by the interior designers to communicate their vision of grand, beautiful opulence to a team of rocket engineers were about as effective as the earnest attempts of an American goldfinch to ask a blue whale out on a date. That is to say, not at all. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s hard to describe how exactly they managed to put a final design down on paper, but when they did it looked like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A7IS0nO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022A7IS0nO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Editor\u0027s note: Imagining these kinds of parts as hotel rooms on the inside takes a little lateral thinking.

Inside each of the Mk2 crew sections is a private, two-kerbal suite packed with the most extravagant bed linens selected during the SEAK admins\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 extended lunch meeting. Each suite connects to a living area with a full kitchen, bath, and top-of-the-line personal ice cream maker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo economize their launches, SEAK had decided to send the replacement science team for Minmus Science Lab along with the new hotel section. Wilfel and Caldorf (two rookies) were selected for the assignment. There were some concerns about the mating of the two sections once on Minmus. Since the science lab didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have a resident engineer at the time, Bill Kerman volunteered to ride along and provide support for the unwieldy chunk of metal his team had createad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen launch day rolled around, the Magical Minmus Resort and Creamery (nobody got around to changing the name) was carted out to the launch pad atop a fueled and primed Newton V1. All fragile decorations had been secured for launch and the three-kerbal crew were strapped into harnesses in one of the living rooms. Despite having three living crew members on board, the entire mission would be controlled remotely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UlWnuBG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UlWnuBG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G9hy6jj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022G9hy6jj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Magical Minmus Resort and Creamery was equipped with a descent system similar to the design that had originally landed Minmus Science Lab back before the Interplanetary Welcome Express was envisioned. It would touch down vertically on the main engine, then pitch forward and use RCS jets to fall gently into its final horizontal position. The landing was conducted at night, which as we know can be problematic for the Hactar 1 AI system. Fortunately the programmers sorted out that issue and the landing went over as well as anybody could reasonably expect. What the programmers did not sort out was the constant stream of questions along the lines of, \u0022The AI controlling those solar panels, do you think she is single? I bet she has a bunch of AIs chasing after her, what do you think? Do you think I have a chance? No seriously, you think I do? Do you think she saw that landing? Was she impressed?\u0022 it went on for quite some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JznDB6H.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JznDB6H.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce on the ground, Bill had to spend quite a bit of time swearing at the Hactar 1 as it attempted to position the base for docking. It turns out that due to some oversights nobody was willing to accept responsibility for, the RCS jets used for the docking procedure weren\u0027t quite strong enough to lift the heavy descent system off the ground. This meant that there was a very tense moment in which the Hactar 1 fired the main engine to lift the whole thing off the ground rather more suddenly than anyone was comfortable with. Bill imagined this is what it would feel like to be agonizing over which wire to cut to disarm a bomb, only to have a hilariously incompetent and juvenile computer jump in a select for you.

This anxiety reached an all-time high after the engineering team\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s attempt at a nuclear lander suddenly became many small, burning pieces of a nuclear lander. The call was made to Bill out on Minmus and he painstakingly dictated a proper design over the phone. For now, SEAK just needed a craft capable of ferrying up to five Kerbals between Kerbin and its moons. In the future, the technology tested on the Crew Service Bus could be used in a more luxurious hotel shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first order of business was scrapping the painfully Hactar 1 AI core and never speaking to it again. Since the... enthusiastic personality of the first iteration caused it to crash into the Mun\u0027s surface, It\u0027s replacement, the Hactar 2, was designed not to have a personality. When the lander was fully assembled according to Bill\u0027s instructions, the engineers found a non-exploded Centaur rocket and modified it to carry the heavier payload. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/slt4sMn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022slt4sMn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary objective of the MunServ 2 mission was to return Jebediah and Kenoly Kerman from their extended stay at Mun Base Alpha. The secondary objective was a bit more interesting. Two astronauts from a rival space program (Ribrey and Bilmund) had been on course to rendezvous in Munar orbit for a spot of tea. Embarrassingly, when they arrived at the Mun they discovered that they had were orbiting in opposite directions. Their own space program disowned them and made a public statement about not tolerating incompetence, etc. The SEAK admins, however, thought it was admirable that two kerbals would go to such lengths to meet for tea. The admins declared that Ribrey and Bilmund would be rescued and given the opportunity to join the Interplanetary Welcoming Express. They also made sure that they had stocked the Crew Service Bus with light refreshments and popular magazines so that the new astronaut\u0027s first impression of SEAK would be a good one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Crew Service Bus had been equipped with flashing orange lights to help the stranded kerbals locate it in the blackness of space. \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Editor\u0027s note: New mod!)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E Ribrey spotted it right away as it approached and wasn\u0027t the least bit hesitant to climb aboard.

I\u0027ve toyed with the idea of using kerbal attachment system to fix antennae to them in a later mission, but I\u0027ll probably just bring new satellites with me and scrub the old ones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mikki\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mikki\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI hope the update dont break your crafts...

I\u0027ll check things out once I have some more play time. Lot\u0027s of things to do IRL is definitely going to slow me down! Hopefully I can keep the updates coming at a 2-3 per week pace. Oh man, I\u0027m not sure that looking at all the details is a good thing! I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll make a continuity error at some point. Actually I just realized that the image of the orbits shows the Hobbes lander already down on the surface.

Fortunately, the crew of the DunEx There and Back Again were oblivious to the schemes forming back home on Kerbin. The Duna portion of their mission was over and the Calvin probe had discovered the perfect location for the Duna hotel. Now, it was on to Ike, where Val and Eilla could finally reestablish a comfortable bubble of personal space. Before landing, they dropped off the other communication-less SEAKmap Alpha satellite. \u0022If it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to be dead in the water it might as well have a nice view,\u0022 they thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fzZ0HW4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fzZ0HW4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody (except maybe Neilberry) was too reluctant to disconnect from the recreation module. The smell of mayonnaise from the oversized sandwich kitchen had become pretty overpowering. With the drive unit and recreation module left in orbit, the crew burned for the surface like a child chasing an ice cream truck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WUYPdmH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WUYPdmH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey stood next to each other just long enough to admire Duna on the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wnnU1BD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wnnU1BD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew had three days of surface time to enjoy.

For the three Kerbals it was paradise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nl4GCvy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nl4GCvy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe three days of surface time went by in a flash, and soon the crew was strapped back into the capsule for the return to orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hkFkhay.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hkFkhay.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew docked with the other half of the There and Back Again and the smell of condiments and lunchmeats wafted nauseatingly into the capsule.
