I believe that having multiple kerbal space companies(controllled by AI) in career mode will make the game more lively as it will be cool to see some AI to launch their own rockets into space, and maybe even more fun to sabotage their space station,rocket or finding a way to steal their science points. It can be realistic too as in the real world, there is alot of competition. In fact so much that some corrupt people/companies use underhand methods to get the advantage. I want to do that ingame \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course a police AI should be added too if the AI keeps on sabotaging the player or the player keeps on sabotaging the AI. Maybe alliances could be formed between companies. In short, i am suggesting AI so that we(the players) can do a bit of \u0022espionage\u0022 warfare or indirectly attacking other companies. I find that this can be added along with multiplayer(should it be added)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you guys know what i mean, sorry for the lack of details of it. I am very tired now. Maybe i will improve this post another time when i can\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T17:07:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe AI\u0027s would always be smarter than you or less smart than you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor example, you placed a lot of rocks in orbit and they kill lots of AI\u0027s but you have a magic rock shield\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor you could place a lot of rocks on their spaceships and they would blow up\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolitic","CreatedById":79738,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T17:59:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENah, I dont want this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DragonShadow","CreatedById":103304,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-02T04:47:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dunno about full-fledged competitors, but the Kerbol system does feel a bit empty without any other activity going on besides your own. It would be cool if, say, you could designate a location as something (a colony on a planet, a station for refueling or research) and then there\u0027d be automated flights made to those locations and just some general background busyness. Refueling stations could have regularly scheduled flights, colony\u0027s could send out rovers or planes to explore the planet, etc. Nothing that gets in your way, just stuff to give it a more lively feeling, like the inside of the SPH and VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I think about it, that could be extended into contracts (rescue this broken down rover from your Mun Colony, blah blah).
