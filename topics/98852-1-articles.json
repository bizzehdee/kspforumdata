Out of dispair which wheels are the one \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethose kerbals asking for I put a pair of wheels of each sort to the outpost. Additionally I already unlocked the whole tech tree including all wheels available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering the number (wheelS!) the condition is complied. Nonetheless the contract isn\u0027t achieved yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any suggestions how to solve this problem?
