I tried Rhinos but the Klaw is not durable enough and once clamped to the asteroid, all stabilizing \u0022enhancements\u0022 just fail, phasing through the surface. I managed to push it with triple Rhino, attached to flat MK3 tanks, as I undocked and just pushed against it - but getting it to push at the center of mass in any reasonable direction was about impossible. I tried landing legs around the Klaw and they just sunk into the surface.\n\nAre there any smart techniques to improve the Klaw attachment to the asteroid - make the joint firmer? Or some other way to provide more thrust than what one gets off a couple flimsy nukes?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T10:50:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 10:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T08:22:39Z","Content":"30k or 3k ton?

And power usage unfortunately.\n\n(even if you have nukes, [Lf\u002BOx] \u002B [LqdFuel] produces at 1.45 the speed of [LqdFuel] alone.

I mean, IT IS A BIG ROCK. Kranefly has six LV-Ns which I think gives it an acceptable ~0.03 TWR when pulling something this size. It takes several minutes to do a big burn. That\u0027s why you have to...\n\n--Plan ahead to make your burns as small as possible. Adjust the asteroid\u0027s path when it is still months away from its destination. Do inclination burns at the high-altitude node. Make liberal use of gravity assists, etc.\n\n--Always pull, don\u0027t push. But this means you have to:\n\n(1) Make sure your engines are far enough away from the rock to operate. Otherwise they will not thrust, AND heat may blow up the asteroid! \n\n(2) Get your ship lined up right. Step one, set the maneuver node and orient the ship in the right direction. Step two, target asteroid center of mass and WITHOUT CHANGING SHIP HEADING get docked to the asteroid. Yes you will have to fly around the rock on RCS to do this. Now your ship/asteroid rig is aimed in the right direction and you will have minimum perturbations as you tow. Ready to tow? Not yet! You must\n\n(3) SET KLAW FOR FREE PIVOT and if you controlled from the klaw to grab, RESET CONTROL TO FORWARD PART OF SHIP. Note that any time you leave the ship and come back to it, the klaw may lock again and you have to make sure it\u0027s on free pivot all over again.\n\n--Now you can tow wherever you want--note that every time you change direction on a rock this big, you have to undock, orient to the next maneuver, and re-acquire the asteroid. I remember sharing my v0.90 Kranefly with someone a while ago, and that lovely person said the ship was no good because he couldn\u0027t steer the asteroid to a new heading...using reaction wheels. :facepalm: IT IS A VERY BIG ROCK!\n\nHope this helps!"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T16:38:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That was a bug in 1.0.2.
