Wendt (August 28, 1923 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 May 3, 2010) was a German-American engineer noted for his work in the U.S. manned spaceflight program. An employee of McDonnell Aircraft and later North American Aviation, he was in charge of the spacecraft close-out crews at the launch pads for the entire Mercury and Gemini programs (1961\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u01531966), and the manned phase of the Apollo program (1968\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u01531975) at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). His official title was Pad Leader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a McDonnell engineer, Wendt supervised spacecraft launch pad preparations at Cape Canaveral during the Mercury and Gemini manned space programs beginning with the flight of Ham the chimpanzee in 1961. He came to be regarded as a welcomed good luck figure to the astronauts; always the last reassuring earth-bound face the crew members saw, kidding with them and wishing them a successful flight as he directed completion of the complex pad close-out procedures just prior to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWendt\u0027s was the final word for the launch tower white room team responsible for loading and securing the crewmen, ensuring that spacecraft instrumentation, switches and controls were correct for launch, and securing the hatch. Nobody touched anything without his permission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWendt is a recipient of NASA\u0027s Letter of Appreciation award, the Silver Snoopy award[3] and several Group Achievement awards. He received a NASA Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Credit to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guenter_Wendt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWikipedia\u003C/a\u003E, find more sources from there]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, Mr. Wendt was a sort of a big deal. Not only is he the last person the astronauts saw before they blasted off, he was the one responsible for making sure that they\u0027ve buckled up snugly and shares good-natured jibes with the crews. It\u0027s sad to say that he passed away in 2010, because now that I know who he is, I\u0027d like to shake his hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn interesting note: Because he had a quite thick German accent to his English, he was nicknamed the Pad Fuhrer.
