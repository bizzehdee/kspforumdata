Steering is extremely heavy, though, so actually managing that would be difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stuff at the top is actually part of the initial boost phase - Couldn\u0027t place them on the lower \u0027legs\u0027 without it inducing unwanted rotation that would eventually result in spectacular failure without adding struts (and thereby more weight, even if just a little), but due to the sheer length of the thing they\u0027re actually far enough above everything else that they can fire safely without damaging the lower parts. That whole SRB assembly is gone before the rocket even reaches 3000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo SAS modules after the top boosters are gone makes it important to never let it gather any turning momentum, or you won\u0027t have the steering torque to recover it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy best launch so far managed this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img546.imageshack.us/img546/732/giganteimproved9600ms.png\u0022 alt=\u0022giganteimproved9600ms.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole thing is actually an evolution of a previous design for v0.85, which could manage 7500m/s on a vertical launch and just scrape past 8200m/s on an oblique launch. The improved staging controls in 0.9 let me replace a bunch of SRBs with additional liquid fuel tanks though, as well as cut out some heavy stack decouplers and add the whole top booster assembly to assist with the early takeoff. So thanks a ton for 0.9 and the far more powerful stage management system. Couldn\u0027t have built this without it ;D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ultimate hope is to build something that can reach Earth\u0027s escape velocity though (which is around 11.2 km/s), so there\u0027s a ways to go yet...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit] Typos fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit 2] Tried an oblique launch. Initial boost phase wasn\u0027t my best ever, but still managed this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img18.imageshack.us/img18/5100/10400ms.png\u0022 alt=\u002210400ms.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow wondering if adding a fuel tank or two to the final stage might give a bit more speed. Would definitely cost some speed early on, but a single fuel tank should add something like 400-500m/s at the other end if the extra weight doesn\u0027t cause too many problems elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit 3] Added two fuel tanks to the final stage, briging it to eight total.

Straight to about 10k to clear the densest atmosphere and then slowly lowered the nose towards the horizon. At the time I hit the final stage I was at around a 57k altitude, with a speed of around 3400m/s and a velocity vector just a tad above the horizon. Sadly, staying in orbit isn\u0027t an option going from there. At that speed, no matter what you do, increasing it further will mean leaving the planet behind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Minthos","CreatedById":2634,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-17T13:33:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou broke my record, nice work.
