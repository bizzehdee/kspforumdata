The issue lies in the MATLAB graphics renderer. The \u0022opengl\u0022 renderer, which is what MATLAB uses as of recently, does not want to render that other spacecraft when it passes behind that red orbit arc. The old renderer, \u0022painters,\u0022 does render the spacecraft, but it\u0027s also 10 slower so that\u0027s a no-go.
