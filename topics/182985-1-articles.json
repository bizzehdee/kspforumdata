When I am in the Astronaut Complex, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u00A0the tracking station or even in space controlling a spacecraft, everything runs fine, the framerate is good. Does the problem come from the mods? I would not say I run a lot of mods (49, is that a lot?) and I do not know one that could cause this kind of problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy GPU driver is up to date and I run the latest version of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
