Good to hear you are catching on pretty quick! You heard right, docking is one of the most difficult things for beginners to master. If you are patient and take your time, you\u0027ll be a pro and before you know it, you will dock without having to really think about it at all. I made a great walkthrough tutorial for docking it\u0027s in my sig. It\u0027s helped many others achieve their first dock! Good luck and happy flying!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T21:53:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
