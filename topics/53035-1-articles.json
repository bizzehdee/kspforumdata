You can\u0027t see it but there hollow section in the centre of that plane (yes that ball of fire is a plane) that should house a lander module and it was the lander module that caused the problem. It wasn\u0027t even being built using symmetry but there where the tell tale signs of symmetry fail when I first attempted to launch it. I knew I\u0027d hit the symmetry bug because the lander was sitting at 90 degrees to the main plane, there was smoke coming out of the runway and bits of debris which, although several meters from the plane, behaved like they were still connected to it. I returned to the SPH and attempted to remove the lander module, again the tell tail symptom of pulling multiple parts out of a shimmering part, but I appeared to have removed the lander and everything looked ok in the SPH. So I hit launch and boom, that above picture was taken seconds after hitting launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a known bug (I think) so I\u0027m not doing a bug report for this (unless you think I should), just thought I\u0027d share one of the most \u0022wut moments\u0022 I\u0027ve had in KSP in a long time.
