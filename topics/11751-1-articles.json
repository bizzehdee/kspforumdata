Close look at wings surfaces can scare any seasoned rocket builder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut simplicity of concept and big size of construction, withstand that flaws.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs test flight, my time for was not so good due to unnecessary testing maneuvers and well, it was my first time flying that plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took about 6 hours and 24 minutes of game time. That time could be lessened to a 5 hours at least. That abot 3800 km on always 90 degreas course. That direction drastically reduces flight path, virtually adding speed at your actual speed, due to Kerbin rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i will just try to give some recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull thrust at liftoff, drop 2 thrust clicks after gear retracting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to 10 - 11 km height band (actually lesser, when full, but try to aim that numbers), Maintain height and lower your thrust as fuel burns out, keeping your eyes on AOA, try to keep it under 20 degrees and not less than 15 (not less than 10 when half of fuel burns out). That should work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you afraid that you will burn out of fuel, keep in mind, that i had around 1/3 of last 3 fuel tanks, when ended travel. Also, on \u003Cstrong\u003Efull\u003C/strong\u003E thrust 1 tank of fuel burns out in 20 minutes if used by one Turbo Jet Engine. So, its about 1 hour 20 minutes on 1/4 of thrust, Last 6 tanks burns out really slow, because they provide enough power for optimal flight speed on 1/4 of thrust. And last thing to keep in mind - You can always glide with power off, if needed. From 11 km to 1 km height Albatros glides about 2 hours With at least 400 km glide path (its painfully slow to relay on this, but, hey,- on 90 deagres course - just glide and let the Kerbin rotate beneath you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext things in mind - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround Kerbin travel through the poles and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSAKA all the way full throttle plane.

Actually atmosphere rotates too.
