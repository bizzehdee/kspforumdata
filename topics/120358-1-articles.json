Yesterday in one of threads a statement was made that conservation laws were conserved up to TeV range. Well not exactly, only within a statistical range can all momentum be analyzed, some of the momentum in the collisions ends up in undetected particles, particles that need to be mathematically corrected for. Some of the collisions are glancing blows and the result particles end up in detectors far from the collision along the path of travel. What this means is that at these ranges they only verify if the observations are consistent, but small differences from the expectation could potentially go undetected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis colliders offers a simpler type of collision, one fermion against its anti-particle. Since these are simpler particles the accounting is far simpler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://scitechdaily.com/plasma-wakefield-acceleration-a-step-toward-smaller-particle-colliders/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://scitechdaily.com/plasma-wakefield-acceleration-a-step-toward-smaller-particle-colliders/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T16:58:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy are you making all these threads for things you don\u0027t understand, then get offended when it\u0027s pointed out that you don\u0027t understand them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFine, I\u0027ll go through it once more.

Lepton collisions, e.g. electron-positron, \u003Cstrong\u003Eare\u003C/strong\u003E simpler to analyse though, assuming you can build a practical accelerator around them. A neutrino-neutrino collider would be challenging to build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with regard to conservation of momentum, any detected \u0022differences from the expectation\u0022 would be extremely exciting - not because we\u0027d broken conservation of momentum but because we\u0027d (probably) found a new particle. The neutrino was originally postulated as a mechanism to conserve momentum in beta decay, and was only observed experimentally much later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Modern particle detectors are also pretty darn good and the statistics for claiming any sort of discovery in particle physics are pretty darn rigorous.

Particularly, that I have had the same Win7 system on a Router and Modem combo for 7 years and it worked fine. And also I have a day in store of transferring every thing from my old machine to a new computer because some weirdness of communication. Not to mention reinstalling programs and I am going to have to install Office 2010 or later which means, after long and intentional delay I will have to migrate (a very cheap word to describe a very difficult topic) all my VBA aps to VB.Net (including things like changing the base values of all arrays to 0). There are offenses, and then there are offenses. The only good thing today is that the USB3.0 install of 10 on an SSD took about 5 minutes,and I am finally going to install linux and hopefully divorce myself from all this Windows forced cycling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T20:24:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t make it personal, guys.
