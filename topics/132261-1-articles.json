I don\u0027t expect it to be as good as subnautica, but having played it, and considering it also has a very similar full axis of freedom, it made me just more aware of how awkward \u00A0KSP Eva are, and trust me I\u0027ve gotten pretty good at KSP eva...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing I really like about it, is being able to move around inside your sub and base.

Or walk around in your muname base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion would be even something good as simple as a procedural or modular interior segments in some standardized format. Maybe a couple specialized models for cockpit window frames, but honestly if everything else was pretty generic I\u0027d be okay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetter yet if you could developed this into a internalized service Bay mechanism, you could use something like KAS/KIS\u00A0to install modules I side the space ship vs outside surface attachment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I don\u0027t know if such a system would work with 3rd person, but it would be very cool to allow you to \u0022live\u0022in your space station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geromey","CreatedById":158566,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T17:07:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that it would be pretty cool to move around in a space station, but from how KSP works at the moment, space Stations are a bunch of fast moving parts and connecting them would be hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only solution I see is hollow parts because they are already in some mods.

In Subnautica you have a fixed reference system (the planet you landed on) while in KSP the reference system changes with SOIs and directions change while you orbit around your current celestial. Also in Subnautica you stop moving (after a while) because of the water drag, or reach a limited top speed because of water drag. In KSP you drift through empty space and can accelerate to very high relative speeds (as long as you have monoprop left).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSubnautica has indeed a very smooth movement\u00A0while KSP eva is still clunky.
