This means usually the payload\u0027s fuel gets burned BEFORE the rocket\u0027s fuel when trying to deliver the payload.

I will be doing it in a week or so since im currently at work out in the baltic sea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere will be one basic orbital station with some rcs and habitat. That you can add more of to get more space and livingquarters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only mods i use is: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: MechJeb cause im lazy doing the same thing over and over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: IonCross (oxygen mod for added reality) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using lifterparts from Temstar that currently have a PM waiting if i can use hes creations in the \u0022release\u0022.

In addition they include one setup with an \u0022NTR stage\u0022 that is something like a bolt on long distance engine/fuel setup. If you just take off some engines in the payload and maybe slap on some larger docking rings you\u0027ll have one decently large fuel tug. Or you could just peek at how they put it all together and mimic it using stock parts (This is always fun!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
