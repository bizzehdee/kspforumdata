I\u0027m using the PTD01 as a connection tube between structures. With docking collars as the connection. I\u0027m testing the construction near the launch pad to ensure everything will come together when I go to build it on the mun. When I release the tube to the ground it just bounces in place constantly and will no stop. I have just tried the tube on end by itself and it constantly bounces up and down slightly but enough that it says i\u0027m in motion and can\u0027t switch to my tug to move the unit around. \n\nIdeas or help would be great. Right now I\u0027m 2 days in to construction and have been stuck on this one issue. I\u0027ll try to upload a video if someone needs to see what it looks like.\n\nThanks Damack"},{"CreatedByName":"mackadelik","CreatedById":143364,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T16:58:04Z","Content":"I\u0027ll be watching for replies as well. I\u0027m not having these issues and was really lucky 2 days ago with a space station. i managed to get the fuel right and docking of 3 out of 4 parts on my first try! Sadly, yesterday I spent 2 hours trying to place the 4th and final part (identical to the 3rd part) and was not able to get it to match up for docking manually or with MechJeb! Sheesh. Back to your Mun Base... You might consider testing your skills at dropping module down onto the Mun next to each other instead of attempting to attach them. Its not a real solution, but if you\u0027re building a base on the Mun the parts don\u0027t really need to attach so long as each module has power. Also, a pic or two would be cool, I\u0027d like to see what you are building!"},{"CreatedByName":"Pax Kerbana","CreatedById":129558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T18:21:25Z","Content":"I think a gif or video is in order... I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve run into the issue you\u0027re describing and have a hard time understanding your problem. Are you using only the tube with two ports, one on each side? Does it look like this: \n\no=o\n\nor like this?\n\no======o\n\nIf so, I think you\u0027ll have problems on Kerbin at the launch pad and a runaway tube on the mun. In space it would work great. Easy solution is to add a probe core or never detach the whole thing at once, keep it connected to either your tug or the base. You can test by launching the tug with the tube attached and driving off the ramp. Then launch you base, switch to the tug, drive up and dock. Keep in mind that if you\u0027ll need to account for the higher gravity of Kerbin, the tube will sag much more than on the Mun. What might not work on Kerbin may work well on the Mun.\n\nEdit: One other point I may add is to test all your base on the dark green grass around the space center, not the launch pad or runway. Even the light green grass is more uniform than the dark.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T18:24:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pax Kerbana**"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T02:45:08Z","Content":"This might help.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48876-The-art-of-modular-base-building](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48876-The-art-of-modular-base-building)"}]}
