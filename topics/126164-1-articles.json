Tought id leave this one unarmed to save on some weight and make it fully stock.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunetly i had to remove the VTOL system from it when i noticed that it didnt work too well and was very unpractical.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was heavy, the aircraft was hard to control durning vtol mode (could have propably fixed this) and it would run out of oxidizer way too fast for it to be practical (about 20 seconds worth of fuel).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis caused a problem wher the aircraft woul run out of oxidezer before it could reach enough speed/altitude to fly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe big S flaps would also over heat and explode cause they get in front of the engine exhaust when pointing the nose down. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only use i found for the VTOL system was to use it to land into water without the plane getting damaged.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut as a regular plane its not too bad at all, it flyes around pretty well but is a little slow with a top speed of 160 m/s in low altitude.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis caused by the fact that the design is pretty heavy and could really use some bigger engines. Currently uses 8 \u0022juno\u0022 engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere are some picks of one of the test flights.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/dFn8XYE.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Jbquu9s.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt had 12 \u0022twitch\u0022 engines on the underside as the vtol engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/LWcc0ck.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo there it is for you, the Harrier jump jet.
