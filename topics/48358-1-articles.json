That is, slow down till the ship drops closer to the Sun, then pick a point to accelerate from (since you go around the Sun pretty fast, you get at almost any angle), and look for the intersect with the maneuver nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules are the same as with regular ship rendezvous.
