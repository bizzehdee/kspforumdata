Probes, being very small, can go VERY far on a little fuel. Also, because they\u0027re light, cheap, and unmanned it doesn\u0027t hurt to lose one. You can bounce around a half dozen times around Mun until you find a nice flat spot and then when you\u0027re landing your base, you can go right for the probe and be sure that if you land near it, you\u0027ll have a flat area for your base.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"el_coyoto","CreatedById":49292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T11:32:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tend to use probe cores everywhere, even on my manned vehicles.

There wasn\u0027t much more to it than what I wrote.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea seems pretty straightforward. Say you want to go to Duna and assume the probe is already in place. You create a maneuver node on the probe\u0027s orbit. Add prograde until the probe\u0027s orbit touches Duna\u0027s orbit. Then grab the maneuver node and slide it along the orbit line until you get an encounter. If you don\u0027t get one, right-click the maneuver node and use the little button underneath to advance the maneuver node one or more full orbit(s), and then slide it around until you have an encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou then know when to launch to have an encounter with Duna. You can then remove the maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would imagine you might want to add a small amount of time to the time shown by the maneuver node, because Kerbin will be slightly behind the probe. Of course, you still have to make sure you get the ejection angle right as well as the timing, but that is just about patience and fine-tuning the maneuver node that you actually use for your burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T14:53:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starhawk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"el_coyoto","CreatedById":49292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T15:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Warzouz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Warzouz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes yes.

In a career game I\u0027ll drop three or four probes in different parts of a body.
