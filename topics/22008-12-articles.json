In the current version, sometimes, the envelopes flicker in and out of existence. Normally, that\u0027s not much of a problem, but recently, I\u0027ve launched an aerobot to Eve in preparation of a later manned mission, and had the devil of a time with getting it to fly straight while in transfer -- center of mass kept shifting around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially I thought that the real reason for this is ISA MapSat probes attached to the sides misbehaving -- MapSat is misbehaving in general, so I had to reassign models to being simple structural parts while I\u0027m launching anything with more than one dish on it -- but upon detaching the probes, the effect did not disappear, and only went away when the envelope unfolded and the aerobot went down into the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is very similar to what was happening to KAS parts while the KAS plugin was not yet updated to 0.20 -- the parts would not work, while they still loaded fine. But that was quite deceptive, as they would also flicker like this when in orbit, \u003Cem\u003E(not on the ground, for some reason, and the higher you go the worse it gets)\u003C/em\u003E briefly disappearing and reappearing. This was apparently confusing the physics engine enough, that it thought the center of mass was far outside the body of the ship, making every flight with anything KAS on it \u003Cem\u003E(which, in my case, is every flight period)\u003C/em\u003E unflyable until the plugin was fixed.
