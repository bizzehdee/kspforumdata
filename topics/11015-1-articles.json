To keep the thrust somewhat inline with the center of mass, the \u0027top\u0027 of the 3 gimballing engines does not fire at the start. SAS should be engaged to fly the craft, and manual input to keep the craft facing vertical during flight may also be required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The craft is stable until approximately halfway through the second tank of the strap on boosters where upon the centre of mass varies to much. Jettisoning the boosters (after killing thrust temporarily) is advised. After this point, the craft should again be stable, and as it is getting to the upper atmosphere, tilt over and start to gain some more horizontal momentum. partway through the last tank of the strap on fuel, the craft should again become unstable, but this can be used to tilt over into an orbital direction if you\\\u0027re tricky. Upon jettisoning the strap on tank (again, killing thrust is advised), the final engine on the main craft can then be activated to give uniform thrust on the shuttle body. Simply boost into a ballistic trajectory with an apoapsis of \u0026gt;70km, and circularize when you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, there won\\\u0027t be much fuel to spare at this point, so trips further afield aren\\\u0027t possible, and if the wrong flight path is taken on the way up you might not be able to achieve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e149/thesneakster/ShuttleMK2sunset.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ShuttleMK2sunset.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ELanding\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft can be landed as a glider upon reentry. It is advisable to use SAS to hold the craft pointing towards its direction of travel, as due to its instability if it is pointed more than around 30 degrees from the direction of travel it may back-flip. Its twitchy flight handing characteristics make it difficult to land. I\\\u0027ve found holding the nose at an angle of attack of around 20-25 degrees with SAS on the glide in approach is required to have minimal vertical velocity. upon contact with the ground, stage to activate the parachute brakes. With luck you\\\u0027ll have the shuttle ready to refuel and reuse. With a little less luck you might have a spectacular explosion but otherwise unharmed Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e149/thesneakster/ShuttleMK2approach.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ShuttleMK2approach.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e149/thesneakster/ShuttleMK2landing.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ShuttleMK2landing.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EFurther Improvement\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy disabling the flow of certain tanks until later in the ascent, the stability of the rocket might be maintained for longer, allowing more fuel to be burnt from the tanks which otherwise need to be jettisoned full right now. Reducing the boosters by a single tank (or perhaps just replacing them with 2 sequential pairs of SRB\\\u0027s) and changing the non fuel structure parts in the shuttle to fuel tanks would also probably result in a much better design. I may make a revision of the design in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComments, criticism and questions welcome, enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T14:04:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe can rotate SHIPS and not only parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T14:05:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kreuzung\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kreuzung\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can rotate SHIPS and not only parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup.
