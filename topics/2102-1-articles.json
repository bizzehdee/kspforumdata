It is quite stable, it works with a minimum of struts and SAS modules, and can break the atmospheric barrier. Top height with this design is somewhere around 70km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, it has quite strange flight characteristics. The first three booster stages all result in an insane clockwise spinning - the SAS module is working always on top. The fourth booster stage is always spinning counter-clockwise. As soon as you decouple these booster, the remaining booster stage is whirling around uncontrollably for some seconds, so DON\u0027t ignite it immediately, but stabilize it first!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-04T17:47:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool but a large portion of the community has already made asterisk SRB rockets \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monger","CreatedById":4143,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-04T19:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is really just a test dummy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027d really like to know where the spinning is coming from.
