Well, to a practical device, only a tiny fraction of that is accessible. How much? Well, give or take a factor of 1000 and some pis and twos we\u0027re going to drop right away, a microwave cavity has access to one mode of vacuum fluctuations, the one of the frequency it is excited with. Its energy is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE = hbar * omega\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand that energy has to be though of as distributed over the whole cavity.

Losses from internal friction and so forth because of tolerances would have made the larger engines much more efficient than smaller ones. A quick Wiki check shows a difference in engine powers of a factor of ten for 4 cylinder early designs.

Here it is. It\u0027s not a reactionless thruster, and it does not violate momentum conservation.\u003Cp\u003EBasically, it\u0027s a microwave pumped solar-sail in a shoebox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt a glance, you\u0027d assume that radiative pressure would be the same at both ends of the resonating chamber. But according to Shawyer there\u0027s a doppler shift occurring between the two ends and the photons at the tight end are lower frequency than at the wide end, yet they have the same speed (c ) so they do not have the same momentum when they bounce on different ends, and that is where the thrust comes from. The pumping required to force the waves inside the chamber and shift them in frequency is where the energy for the momentum gained comes from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupposedly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you say you would get the same result using an microwave transmitter and a directional antenna who is that the solar sail would work like if shaped like an parabola. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short the minimum effect we will get would be an photon drive.
