It\u0027s a little trickier to do now that the chutes are more fragile but the increased physics range inside the atmosphere allows more dispersion of parts without them auto deleting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BowWhalley","CreatedById":149344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T14:24:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThankyou, this has helped me out alot! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand btw Red Iron Crown, unfortunetly I can not use mods as I am in demo atm.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thegamer211","CreatedById":149354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T21:33:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75170-WIP-Plugin-(0-90)-Burn-Together!-Alpha-v7-0-(3-29-15)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBurn together mod.\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt allows you to control multiple rockets at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
