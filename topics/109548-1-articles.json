I can\u0027t tell what you are asking for but I will try my best. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are asking if it can be built out of parts in-game, the answer is no. There is a range limit for physics. On Kerbin this range is 22.5 Km. Outside of this range nothing is loaded into memory and thus is not simulated. In space the range is still 2.5 Km (I THINK). So same thing applies. This means that the largest thing someone could possibly make would be 2500 meters in size and still be able to fly it in space. Most likely such an object would probably kill most computers due to part count and trying to simulate that many physics interactions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are asking about making a stand alone mod to create a static building similar to the mod Kerbin-side, then I have no idea if it could be done or not. IF it could be made then it would be one heck of an undertaking and I would applaud the mod maker that could do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T22:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGameplay-wise, this would just shove you into orbit without using fuel; you can use HyperEdit for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe closest thing is an old \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/45229\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emass driver\u003C/a\u003E made with KerbTown that just shoves you into orbit.
