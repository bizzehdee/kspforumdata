I think it would add an interesting new game mechanic that could make mission planning more important.

I also think that a 3.75m crew tank would be a great addition, this is a large enough size to incorporate sleeping, living, and exercise quarters for a small crew. If morale or sanity is implemented parts like this will be required because even kerbals will go insane from being stuck in a cockpit for years on end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I design space stations I have habitation modules with a population capacity equal to the number of crew members doing useful things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vindelle_Sunveam","CreatedById":70755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T19:38:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease, Stratoroc, don\u0027t make it another \u0022slow and painful death\u0022 thread.

Since the SLS parts are designed around a large heavy lifter and nothing more. Making more parts that are of that size requires other parts to support it, soon you\u0027ll need a larger diameter to support the new 3.75 parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife support i feel should come sooner rather than later. It would add a whole new layer of game play, balance out differences between probe missions and kerbal missions, add another element of risk to missions that would further affect reputation. Overall Life support would be a big addition to the game in many ways. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith it there should come more Living Quarters. I feel instead of trying to cram all the designs into one object (the hithiker) there should a few to choose from. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst things first, reputation must be added to add risks to the game and then life support should come.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T20:43:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was disappointed when I saw the internals of the Hitchhiker for the first time - I had imagined it as storage plus a room for sleeping, and maybe an exercise bike; not as a big empty room with some jump seats and cabinets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven without a life support mechanic, it would be *fun* to have a greater variety of living spaces. MKI has a point that if you make a duplicate of every part at the new bigger size, you may begin to want an even BIGGER size booster. But other than that good point by MKI, I would want a larger living space. Having different variety of Hitchhikers just for flavor sounds unlikely to happen but I would enjoy it if it did.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
