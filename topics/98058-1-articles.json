I couldn\u0027t find the cause, so I decided to completely remove the game from my pc, and download it and install again (btw, it\u0027s a steam release).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs usual, the first thing I did was to make a copy of the fresh install, and leave the original untouched. This time, before putting any mods, I tried both the original and the copy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the original, I had no problems. I didn\u0027t test it very far but I noticed I could choose my flag when starting a new game. This is one of the main indicators I have to know if something is wrong (regarding this problem).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the copy, I couldn\u0027t choose any flag, so I guess something is wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea why this is happening?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I mentioned, I didn\u0027t test it intensively, and the tests were made without any mods, but I\u0027ll test it more and with mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP version is 0.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy system is: Win 7 Home Premium SP1 64bit (I play in 32bit), Intel i7 @ 1.6GHz, 6Gb RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GT230M. It\u0027s not a gaming pc, but I\u0027ve managed to play this game without any major problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T14:29:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you provide an output log from both the working and broken installations?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PCanas","CreatedById":1607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T14:47:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.filedropper.com/ksporiginal\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELog Original Version\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.filedropper.com/kspcopy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELog Copy Version\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(it\u0027s the file KSP.log, right?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PCanas","CreatedById":1607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T14:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t managed to reinstall the mods yet, been busy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E but maybe this weekend\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T22:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe copy seems to be having trouble accessing its files... and I\u0027d say it\u0027s because you\u0027ve copied it into a subdirectory of Program Files.
