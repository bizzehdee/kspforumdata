I am working on the assumption that you have access to the basic decouplers. Put the thumper at the top, and put another thumper below it as a 2nd stage. Then place some more thumpers (e.g. 4 of them) radially around the bottom one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the basic rocketry-violence sorted, you may want to look whether you\u0027re going to satisfy just that contract, or perhaps do a little science too.\u00A0If you are already at 240,000 m altitude, and you ignite that last thumper, you may reach altitudes that you haven\u0027t reached yet. Better do some science up there! However, landing the science equipment will also be more challenging than previous missions. You will need a heat shield, and depending on the design,\u00A0you may want to package the science equipment in some container to keep from exploding.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBtw, often the contracts also demand a certain velocity (next to the\u00A0altitude), which makes life more difficult. If your contract does not, don\u0027t worry about it. If it does, please update this thread, and we can see how that complicates things.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-23T15:28:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2016 03:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Magzimum\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T15:36:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, well this works to get you high enough - and is well within the 30 part limit.
