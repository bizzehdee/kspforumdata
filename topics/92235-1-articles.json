Whenever I try to grab something, as soon as I do I get a weird cutscene where the camera just zooms out infinitely and I can\u0027t play anymore. All I can do is go to the menu and reload quicksaves. Has this happened to anyone else? It kind of looks like a Spore cutscene.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T00:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t hear that specific reaction by the claw, but it is quite buggy.
