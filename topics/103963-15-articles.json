I\u0027ve made a few other configs with a higher atmosphere and I guess I\u0027ll include one of them in the next version, they look the same from the ground and they still look too thick from orbit, but climbing up it feels like the atmosphere is higher and mountains no longer stick out of it.

So to get a similar effect on smaller distances the effect is turned up and the atmosphere has to be thicker. In the future I\u0027ll get around this by using a different config from otbit and fading between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the mountains sticking out of the atmosphere, that\u0027s because I\u0027ve taken a 1:1 earth atmosphere and scaled it down and applied to kerbin, so what used to be an atmosphere height of 50 kms is now just 5kms, which means mountains are actually higher than the atmosphere. I\u0027ve made a few other configs with a higher atmosphere and I guess I\u0027ll include one of them in the next version, they look the same from the ground and they still look too thick from orbit, but climbing up it feels like the atmosphere is higher and mountains no longer stick out of it. They have a few problems with \u0022banding\u0022, where it looks like the colors aren\u0027t a smooth transition but form bands, which is why I didn\u0027t want to include them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done things like removing the mesh renderer: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Eif ( oceanMaterial != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; pqs.ChildSpheres.Length \u0026gt; 0)\u003Cbr\u003E                {\u003Cbr\u003E                    PQS ocean = pqs.ChildSpheres[0];\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                    pqsOceanContainer = new GameObject(\u0022PQSTangentAssigner\u0022);\u003Cbr\u003E                    pqsOceanContainer.transform.parent = ocean.transform;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                    keywords = ocean.surfaceMaterial.shaderKeywords;\u003Cbr\u003E                    originalOceanShader = ocean.surfaceMaterial.shader;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might be able to disable it more (get rid of the vertex\u0027s entirely, but I\u0027m not entirely sure how you\u0027d go about doing that.
