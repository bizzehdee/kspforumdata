I\u0027ve had the steam controller since before it was well supported in this game and I actually had a control scheme I made that I really really like that only involves two action groups but very effectively covers all aspects of the game. My issue is that while using my own control profile, the game still wants to switch between Squad\u0027s premade action groups on their default control scheme. So, my two action groups keep switching back and forth on their own between the map and everything else and it\u0027s throwing off my controls lol. Is there a way to turn that automatic action group switching off? I really like my control scheme and I\u0027m hoping not to have to remap everything in the default control scheme by hand just to work around this. If I have to, I have to. But I\u0027ve had things working this way for a while and it\u0027s really comfortable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: The issue seems to be intermittent, which suggests it\u0027s probably a bug where the game isn\u0027t consistently recognizing separate steam controller configurations. I\u0027ll report it as such but leave this up in case there\u0027s any thoughts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-26T16:52:10Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2017 04:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by TouchyHands\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
