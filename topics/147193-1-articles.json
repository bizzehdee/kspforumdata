This force is so great it makes playing impossible. The force goes away in time warp. And the force is almost due radial (I know this as I was able to virtually hover over minmus after I used cheats to get to the surface making landing completely impossible).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kraken doesn\u0027t manifest until I either open a bay or launch a craft with anything in a\u00A0bay or clip anything through a bay, I\u0027ve tested the mk2 mk3 and mk4 bays the kraken manifests with all of them. Once the kraken manifests it persists through vessel changes and will persist even after restarting the client. If I reload to a previous save and then restart the client the kraken goes away until I open any bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know it\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0as I slowly began to uninstall mods that I suspected (mechjeb, KSPI, tweakscale, Distant object enhancement)\u00A0thankfully \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E was the 5th\u00A0one I tried as reloading the client is a lengthy process with so many mods. Once I uninstalled \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E I was able to reinstall the other mods and everything was back to normal. I even pushed it by clipping 3.25 parts into 2.5 bays and clipping wings/other parts into and on top of those bays and parts.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone run into something similar or have a recommendation on what mods \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t play nice with?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
