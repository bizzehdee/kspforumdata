I\u0027m delighted by it, WIP-status though it is - it\u0027s already a 4.5 stars game and it\u0027s not even done yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that when you\u0027re looking at something all day you don\u0027t see rough edges and counter-intuitive UI elements because they\u0027re obvious to you. So I thought I\u0027d share my first-48-hours experiences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, given the complexity of the game the UI is a wonder of usability. I\u0027m really impressed. I had issues, but not nearly as many as I expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(In the following I\u0027ve left out things that I saw in the \u0022already suggested\u0022 and \u0022what not to suggest\u0022 pinned topics, but this isn\u0027t a feature request list so much as a list of things I found counter-intuitive, confusing, or hard to figure out from a UI and gameplay perspective)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I got really stuck on and had to dig around on the \u0027net for help were:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhy my probe just stopped responding to controls. (Out of batteries, hadn\u0027t invented solar yet). The UI should respond to attempted control input in a way that indicates that the craft can\u0027t respond. Showing a partial pulldown of the resources menu and flashing the power bar would be very helpful.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHow to collect the kerbal astronaut in orbit once I\u0027d mostly matched orbit with him. Having to press the [ key to switch control to nearby craft isn\u0027t discoverable or intuitive. Should be able to click on craft within range to switch control via menu.

The tutorial needs to cover this IMO, I got really frustrated wondering why my boosters with their adequate parachute loads still seemed to just vanish.

It doesn\u0027t help that the kerbal sometimes likes to leap away from the capsule when you exit, and did when I first tried EVA. So you have to figure out how to enable RCS on their suit (and that you have RCS on all EVA suits) and how to fly them back to the capsule. This is the kind of situation where situational help would be good - \u0022Hey, this is your first EVA, want a hand?\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDocking.

Sometimes. Seems to be to do with returning control to flight center and launching other vessels or switching control to others. Possibly also reverting to design after crash? Haven\u0027t pinned it down yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOn my system (Intel graphics, Fedora 20 Linux x64) the labels above the crew pictures are unreadable, there\u0027s no visible text in the buttons for EVA etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhen constructing vessels using symmetry, if you build a ring of boosters then want to put something in the middle, the central object won\u0027t snap to the surrounding ones.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESame as above, when trying to put an object inside a ring of boosters (big fuel tank, big liquid booster, whatever) sometimes it seems to work, but actually you\u0027ve created one copy of the object for each radially symmetrical booster. The inner objects overlap and ignore clipping, taking up the same space. I had six LV-12 boosters overlapping so they looked like one earlier. (In case you\u0027re wondering why I\u0027d do such a thing: I was trying to get an LV-12 booster to escape velocity for a contract, so it was payload.

I\u0027ve since read a bunch of the forum posts and gathered that impression as well.

Although occasionally impossible contracts have come up (not sure if it\u0027s still an issue in .25, but when contracts first came out, people might get contracts to test the launch clamps somewhere other than landed on Kerbin. Yeah, impossible \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it\u0027s true that some of the ridiculous ones can be fun challenges too - I did enjoy the challenge of getting a monstrous booster stage to escape velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess if the financial constraints were more real, so you couldn\u0027t solve every problem with \u0022build an even bigger rocket\u0022 it\u0027d be cool to keep the ridiculous ones. You get to judge if you can actually achieve them or not. Right now, it\u0027s a matter of \u0022build a bigger bunch of asparagus\u0022.

The actual force of drag from a part is also partly mass based, which is why a ship of all .2 drag parts won\u0027t automatically orient during free fall.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, so again it\u0027s a \u0022that\u0027s not finished\u0022. Fair enough; be nice if that was somehow visible in the UI so it wasn\u0027t quite so confusing trying to figure out what\u0027s going on when you start playing though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kujuman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kujuman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E 3) Style \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFair point. It\u0027s certainly prettier. I guess when drag is implemented properly it\u0027ll matter more too, big flat surfaces and sharp edges create horrible turbulence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kujuman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kujuman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E 4) Since one gets 100% refund of any launch clamps (since they are landed at the launchpad), just always add a few of them until you get an idea for what won\u0027t need them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I started doing. It\u0027s pretty minor really.

This is due to the game\u0027s design being more guess and check experimentation than exacting measures (boosters found by the side of the road and all). If Squad does think basic calculators should be in the final game (I don\u0027t know where that discussion is ATM), they\u0027d probably wait until it\u0027s almost ready. No point spending time \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E adding features a few very well maintained mods already add. Further, with a bit of experience, you should be able to get a feel for what will work. If in doubt, add more boosters \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Addendum: they do currently have thrust ratings and fuel consumption. Not sure by what you wrote if you\u0027re familiar with the extra detail menu in the VAB.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I use thrust and consumption data from the extra detail menu, it\u0027d just be nice to have the option not to have to do quite so much manual calculation for the simple and obvious repetitive stuff, so the brain work can be left for the \u0022interesting\u0022 bits of rocket design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a notepad with total burn times and total impulse from the engines I use, for example, but it\u0027d be handy to have that in the UI. Adding this sort of thing through the research tree and/or difficulty options would be nice. Blind experimentation is awesome fun for getting to orbit and the Mun, but gets pretty old by the time you\u0027re trying to get five-stage probes to the planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of a parts manifest for your rockets (per-stage or otherwise) makes it harder too, because you have to visually hunt around to figure out what the components are. Especially when using subassemblies where you might not immediately have the manifest for it to hand. And if there was a manifest, it\u0027d be a pretty un-fun part of the game to go down it with a calculator looking at the parts details and adding stuff up. Why not hide orbital tracks and make us do all the calculus for those too? (OK, that\u0027d be kind of cool in hard mode, in an infuriating kind of way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kujuman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kujuman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E 7) They seem to do so because they do.

The flat little model had me envisioning a single big wheel for rotation around the main axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if part descriptions should mention that they aid control in all three axes, or if that\u0027s just a \u0022well, duh\u0022 issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-04T05:17:00Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2014 05:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ringerc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFix quote formatting\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
