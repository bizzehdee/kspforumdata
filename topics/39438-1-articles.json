Moving fuel, cargo and sometimes even people to keep things to maintain optimal COG.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as space planes use fuel they become more and more tail heavy. Making them hardy and with many(most) designs it means that as you use the fuel your plane will have a tendency to spin out. Aircraft tend to use the fuel itself to maintain optimal balance. Shifting forward to back and vise versa. Wing to wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow Im not sure it would be possible in KSP and the unity engine to say move fuel in a way that would usable but even then you would want something more dedicated in KSP than fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking perhaps a set of parts used specifically for COG changes. Where just a weighted resource is exchanged. Perhaps with a similar use of trimming to the current aircraft system.(Hit Control Shift\u002BASDW to move COG) This system would move weight from one ballast tank to another. For example one a space plane. As you burn propellant you may find yourself needing to counter your engines wight. Shifting the ballast forward to maintain balance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr say your in space trying to dock. You notice rotating your craft makes you drift down. You can shift you COG back a little. Putting your COG back on your RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally believe this concept is better as it fixes a slew of issues in the core game-play at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an old Orbiternaut(HAIL PROBE) and a XR Series lover (Mach 27 Plus \u0026lt;3) Im use to having some limited control of the COG. Using it before the 1.5 version to do Negative lift entries. once someone sees it in action it becomes easy to understand how to use it. Yet a pilot would not be forced necessarily to learn to use the ballast. But advanced users will love it I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exothermos","CreatedById":41827,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T07:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApparently there is a mod for exactly these problems, so it\u0027s certainly doable. I enjoy the technical challenge of designing craft with CoM in mind, but the design opportunities that an autoballancer would open up would make up for any \u0022difficulty\u0022 lost, IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
