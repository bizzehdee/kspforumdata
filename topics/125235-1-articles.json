However, it didn\u0027t save properly, and I was forced to backtrack to my most recent manual save, which undid almost 10 hours worth of work. I would like to suggest adding in additional autosaves, where the game would overwrite the oldest autosave in the sequence, allowing you to jump back short distances if something goes wrong. Even just one extra autosave slot would be sufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Vlad","CreatedById":106306,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T21:39:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease, yes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
