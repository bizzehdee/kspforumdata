I am a proud kerbonaut who has sent around 10 successful missions(Not saying out of how many). But the reason many of my missions fail is the lower stages. Most of the times, here\u0027s what happens:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1-The ship blows up before launch. I add more struts, repeat until enough struts. Go to 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2-The ship now launches, but collapses into itself upon liftoff. Add struts. Repeat until enough. Go to 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3-One of the boosters dislodges sometime after launch, and procceeds to collide with the rest of the ship tearing it apart. Add more struts.

The mission report after you \u0027end flight\u0027 will tell you what went wrong. If the first malfunction is \u0027exploded due to overheating\u0027 then it\u0027s the exhaust thing.

The collapsing on the launchpad problem isn\u0027t a lack of strength and weight but a bending problem - you\u0027ve got all that weight. A long stick with weights attached to the sides isn\u0027t very stable even if those weights are even distributed. Moving the big fuel tanks down to the aerospikes are just above the ground and the boosters are resting on it will cure almost all launchpad wobbling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The large decoupler is rather weak currently and that seemed to be causing the non-wobble collapses. Replace with the small one (and three or four struts in the gap between the tanks to increase stiffness).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I never came across this problem. Given those large tanks seem to be fixed attachments rather than on decouplers it shouldn\u0027t be bending enough for impact or large enough stresses from a single SRB per decoupler. Possibly resonance built up from a good launchpad wobble?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t correct the first stage tipping so like you I ended up with far too many wagglers to brute force it. It\u0027s possible your orbiter/lander is a bit too heavy for the rocket and this is another weight distribution issue but winglets are a good enough fix to continue experimenting with that layout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve attached the end result, It\u0027s the same basic design with the suggested fixes from above but I made a couple more tweaks like moving the winglets down a stage (they\u0027re just dead weight when you exit atmosphere) and I had to improvise a top part as it wasn\u0027t in your picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH]31752[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robly18","CreatedById":37651,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T12:41:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the help.
