The closer you can get to the center of the sphere of influence without actually crashing (or aerobreaking in the cases of planets with atmosphere) the bigger then change in energy you get from passing by that planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tricky part of gravity assists when planning your course is that you effectively have to try and intercept each planet in orbits between you and your target, assuming they will even be in a position to practically do so by the time you cross their orbits. Make sure to plan your maneuver nodes to sling around the planet very carefully. Treat it like you are planning to visit that planet and want to enter a specific orbit, except you will be leaving again instead of actually orbiting, and get the exit vector to match the general direction you want to go as you leave. Then set up other maneuver nodes on the periapsis of your course around the planet, using that node to adjust your course to target the next planet in the sequence, and maybe do a little forward velocity adding burn while you are at it (lots of bang for your buck at low periapsis.) Repeat as necessary as you cross orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this method might extend your total range, letting you get out further for less fuel, I have found that in practice it does extend the time the mission takes.
