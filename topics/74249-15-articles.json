When it comes to performance you want to have your bases at least 20 - 30km apart. This allows unneeded vessels to unload. Also AAA guns track in a 3km sphere, I don\u0027t suggest using more than 2 guns per 3km area, more than that decreases performance. There is also an upper limit for bombs and guns firing at full rate. This really comes down to your computer and how amazing it is, HE bombs fragment on detonation, and depending on the mass of the HE bomb, there are many fragments that are created and have to be calculated, be aware of this when you are loading 12 x 2000lb HE bombs on your bomber! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E If you plain suck at bombing - you can drop a singular tallboy or daisycutter in either HE or Incendiary, the area effect should be upwards of 300\u002Bm, making accuracy a little less important unless attacking something like a battleship turret.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was writing up Skillful I envisioned 5 - 15 minute turns, played over skype between two people.
