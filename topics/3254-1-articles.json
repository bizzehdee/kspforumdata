It is, however, extremely important for the purpose of better understanding Mars. Same applies to all other bodies in the Solar system.

No manned flights, no planetary science, no hubble, no more rovers. NASA would have lost what little public attention it currently has. And with no public awareness the politicians funding it wouldn\\\u0027t have a fear of losing rep for axing other NASA programs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunding for manned spaceflight is still there. COTS and CCDev are still on. We\\\u0027re still paying to keep the ISS manned and running. SLS development is written into the budget. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, planetary missions usually take YEARS. New Horizons and Juno are both more than another Presidential term away from their destinations. The Mars Science Rover is on the pad as we speak, and is designed to last for another three years. If NASA\\\u0027s recent efforts in the post-Constellation-cancellation period are any indication, temporary funding cuts are not enough to stop them from making plans and preparing for the deed when the time is right. By the time the next spaceflight-friendly President signs more funding to them again, I\\\u0027m sure they\\\u0027ll have a handful of planetary missions ready to go just as soon as the checks can be signed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zool","CreatedById":3152,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-11T01:27:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis \u0027story\u0027, broken by the Washington Times, is, cover your children\\\u0027s ears... total bullshit.
