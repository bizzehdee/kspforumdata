When using such rockets, engines will tend to swing left and right, so you can use struts to keep them in place (click on one of the tanks, and then where you want to put the other point of the strut). It should help keep your rocket stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kodemunkey","CreatedById":41146,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-18T12:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see, thanks for explaining that.

Using liquid stages instead of solids is just a choice. They can last longer and help with control, but don\u0027t have that good power to weight ratio as boosters.
