(Happens at 90\u0027S as best I can tell.) I have a save about half an orbit beforehand and it happens every time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically every part goes from cold to the temperature of Stellar Plasma instantly and the craft explodes. At first I thought it was a service bay bug, because that was the first part to overheat on the incident report. But if I detach a probe with no service bay, still happens, only a battery is first listed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt happens to every vehicle in the active physics bubble. Whether one complete craft or 6probes, launcher and associated debris in formation. The only time anything survives is if I get it far enough away from the active craft in time, such as when I De-orbited the launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think this is mod related, but I don\u0027t have system space to run multiple installs (small SSD) to test. Only modded parts on the craft that I\u0027m aware of are KER circuit boards, DP-10 Antenna (RT2) and procedural fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods: FAR, Chatterer, Planetshine, RCS build aid, Procedural Fairings, Remote Tech 2, Tac Life Support, DMagic Orbital Science.

I was approaching the south pole by rover, maybe only going 8m/s max, when suddenly, the entire craft exploded. I checked the log and it stated that all of the parts had overheated. I sent a duplicate rover, quicksaved on landing, and approached the south pole. Same thing happened. Had Kerbal Engine Redux up, the point at which I exploded was -89 55\u0027 09\u0027\u0027 (or was it 56\u0027 09\u0027\u0027? One of those two). I will try to replicate this weird bug on a clean install soon: I too, was running mods, but none that change the atmosphere like FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA very strange and curious bug. And talk about a jump scare, I wasn\u0027t expecting something like that to happen at all, especially after just visiting the north pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Can confirm that the bug happens on a vanilla install, rover overheats in between the -89 59\u0027 09\u0027\u0027 and 11\u0027\u0027 mark. Leaving the death zone does not cool down the rover at all. Since this also appears to affect things in orbit, I\u0027m now curious if this \u0022death zone\u0022 is cone- or cylindrical-shaped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to put something on the cusp of Kerbins SOI in a polar orbit and wait for the fireworks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ITFnX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I resorted to using hyperedit to make my inclination exactly 90, since blindly trying to hit as close to 90 inclination without mods and then harmlessly passing by the south pole...is no fun.
