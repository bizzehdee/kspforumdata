SSTO aircraft are now properly hard. SSTO rockets are a little easier, but also not exactly easy. SRB\u0027s no longer fling you 90% of the way to orbit at a million miles an hour.

It\u0027s realistic enough that nosecones help instead of hurt in most cases, tail fins will try to keep the craft prograde when properly placed, orientation of parts matter, and dense things have a faster terminal velocity than less dense items. That\u0027s a huge step forward in realism compared to old stock aero. Still, if you really care about realism, you install FAR.

Pretty much everything I have put up so far has been fine, and until now I had not really understood what the fuss was about. I decided I wanted to put a space station up as a single launch rather than sending it up a few bits at a time and constructing it in orbit.\n\u003E The launch stage is a mainsail, and the upper stage is a poodle. Inside the equipment bay is a probe core and some batteries so that I can send it up unmanned.\n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E This thing went crazy wobbling about when it hit around 8 km at around 160 m/s. The first thing I did was to disable all the reaction wheels, using only the winglets and the engine gimbal for control. This reduced the wobble a fair amount, and it did flip out a few times, but I managed to get it into orbit, though it was 5 degrees off and needed some re-positioning up there.\n\u003E \n\u003E I then figured I\u0027d attempt to make it more rigid, so I put a bunch of structural girders on radial decouplers and strutted up the main structure. That would sort out the wobbles, but not the aerodynamic problems. I figured the root cause of the aerodynamic problems was that those AV-R8 winglets were just not up to the job of keeping such a large rocket under control I therefore replaced them with Structural Wing A and Elevon 1 for control, to give it better stability. The result was this\n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E The result was not pretty, but it went into orbit like a dream. I did my usual roll over 5 degrees at between 50 and 100 m/s, and fly it up with SAS off, controlling the ascent with the engine throttle.\n\u003E \n\u003E In addition to the old KSP rules of \u0022if it moves when it shouldn\u0027t, add more struts\u0022 and \u0022if it doesn\u0027t move when it should, add more boosters\u0022, I think we need a new rule: \u0022if it points the wrong way, add more fins\u0022\n\nI\u0027ve the same problems, but I solved them in a different way : Joints Reinforcement Mod by Ferram4\n\nThe wobbling problem is very different from the aero problem.\n\nThe New Aero model need us to train to send rockets to orbit. Design and flight are different. Using one of them from 0.9 will result in flipping rockets. But as many explained, once you\u0027ve understand how it works, it\u0027s quite easy. Note : bigger rockets are easier to fly than lighter ones. So to solve the Aero problem : just spend some time to try and learn how to do it. There are dozen of explainations here. \n\nBut the wobbling will wreck your flight or at least looking stupid an unrealistic (I bnever saw any rocket bend like this...). To silve that you need to add stupid contructions out of fairings (that make sens ?) to fix it. It\u0027s like fixing a bug.\n\nI hated the new aero, now I love it (planes are coolerto fly)\n\nBut I still hate this stupid wobbling. At least wobbleing should be removed inside Fairing. As it\u0027s mass is high, it could auto include some massive struting."},{"CreatedByName":"Johno","CreatedById":1491,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T08:36:29Z","Content":"Interesting, my experience is the reverse.\n\nThe new realistic flight model is SO much easier to handle.\n\nI was previously a pretty terrible pilot; never mind landing spaceplanes from orbit, I was doing well to get them roughly into the area of the spaceport before popping the chutes and letting them float to the ground!\n\nWith 1.0.2, I\u0027m ACTUALLY ABLE TO FLY. \n\nPartly, I think, this is because I can now use the reflexes I\u0027ve developed over years of using flight simulators (I used to have to countermand them)."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T08:49:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Interesting, my experience is the reverse.\n\u003E The new realistic flight model is SO much easier to handle.\n\u003E \n\u003E I was previously a pretty terrible pilot; never mind landing spaceplanes from orbit, I was doing well to get them roughly into the area of the spaceport before popping the chutes and letting them float to the ground!\n\u003E \n\u003E With 1.0.2, I\u0027m ACTUALLY ABLE TO FLY. \n\u003E \n\u003E Partly, I think, this is because I can now use the reflexes I\u0027ve developed over years of using flight simulators (I used to have to countermand them).\n\nYeah, I\u0027m much the same, but with experience on the stick of a real plane, including aerobatics.
