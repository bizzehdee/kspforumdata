Pretty much everything I have put up so far has been fine, and until now I had not really understood what the fuss was about. I decided I wanted to put a space station up as a single launch rather than sending it up a few bits at a time and constructing it in orbit.\u003Cp\u003EThe launch stage is a mainsail, and the upper stage is a poodle. Inside the equipment bay is a probe core and some batteries so that I can send it up unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing went crazy wobbling about when it hit around 8 km at around 160 m/s. The first thing I did was to disable all the reaction wheels, using only the winglets and the engine gimbal for control. This reduced the wobble a fair amount, and it did flip out a few times, but I managed to get it into orbit, though it was 5 degrees off and needed some re-positioning up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then figured I\u0027d attempt to make it more rigid, so I put a bunch of structural girders on radial decouplers and strutted up the main structure. That would sort out the wobbles, but not the aerodynamic problems. I figured the root cause of the aerodynamic problems was that those AV-R8 winglets were just not up to the job of keeping such a large rocket under control I therefore replaced them with Structural Wing A and Elevon 1 for control, to give it better stability.

Design and flight are different. Using one of them from 0.9 will result in flipping rockets. But as many explained, once you\u0027ve understand how it works, it\u0027s quite easy. Note : bigger rockets are easier to fly than lighter ones. So to solve the Aero problem : just spend some time to try and learn how to do it. There are dozen of explainations here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the wobbling will wreck your flight or at least looking stupid an unrealistic (I bnever saw any rocket bend like this...).
