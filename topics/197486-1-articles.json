Then, after doing other stuff for\u00A0a while, the issue resolved itself, the lander jumped up and settled on the surface properly and the rover became driveable again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond time was on Eeloo, the crew were driving to their objective and the rover suddenly lost traction and skidded to a halt, behaving the same as the one on Dres, I didn\u0027t disembark the crew this time though \u0027just in case\u0027.\u00A0 I tried quicksaving but it said I couldn\u0027t as I was \u0027about to crash\u0027\u00A0 I took the risk of going to the Tracking Station (ignoring the \u0027abandon mission\u0027 warning) and back to the rover with no luck, eventually after several tries, it fixed itself again.\u00A0 \u00A0This happened several times with the same rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere seems to be no obvious \u0027trigger\u0027\u00A0or \u0027click away\u00A0and reset\u0027 type work around like the fuel transfer bug.\u00A0 I have only just had it happen so\u00A0don\u0027t know if it is a new issue, or related to just these two bodies or not.\u00A0 Or even if could be \u0027hardware\u0027 related somehow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI run very\u00A0few mods,\u00A0of which SVE is the only \u0027biggy\u0027 the others are Alarm Clock, Window Planner, Tracking Station and Craft organisers, and Docking Port Alignment, so that could possibly\u00A0be a factor, but doesn\u0027t feel likely.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-14T20:37:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2020 08:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by pandaman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-14T22:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not had that happen, but I have moved your post to the support thread where others might have.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cattette","CreatedById":206142,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-15T12:00:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure those are all of the mods? SVE has kopernicus as an optional dependency so you might have it too. But i don\u0027t see any reason for the mods you listed to affect wheels. Try moving all your mods out of the gamedata folder and try driving\u00A0some rovers around in a new save file. If it works flawlessly then try adding the mods again and drive some more on this new save file. This will determine if the issue you are facing is due to the mods you have installed or if there\u0027s something wrong with the save file you are using right now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
