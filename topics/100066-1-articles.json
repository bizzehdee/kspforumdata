I never understand the position that good mods being integrated or reimplemented in stock is somehow a bad thing. One of the big benefits of the early access model is being able to add features or content that the community demonstrates is desirable.\n\nFrankly, the fewer mods I have to install, the better.

The fact that Squad has not announced years ago every feature they intent to implement, does not mean they have no ideas.
