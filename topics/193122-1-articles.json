The best place to find raw materials to build spacecraft and bases with, without having a pesky gravity field to deal with, is in the asteroid belt. This is why there are companies launching cheap space telescopes looking to find a large metallic asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, so find a big metallic asteroid and you found yourself all the metal you need to make an interstellar spacecraft. That\u0027s cool, but how do you fuel it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEasy, you find an ice asteroid. This time, you\u0027ll need to look much further out in the solar system. Out in the Kuiper belt to be specific.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you\u0027ve moved your metallic asteroid out to the Kuiper belt, and you\u0027ve put it next to a suitable icy asteroid. Now what?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAttach engines to the icy asteroid, and use the icy body as a source for fuel, reaction mass, and life support supplies for the interstellar trip. However, don\u0027t just convert it all at once and store it in tanks on the ship. You can build lighter than that. Take the whole ball of ice with you, and put it at the front of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe KSP2 won\u0027t simulate this, but if you do it that way the ball of ice acts as a shield against interstellar debris. Considering that something the size of a grain of sand at interstellar velocities would hit that shield with the explosive yield of several metric tons of TNT, it makes sense to have the \u0022fuel tank\u0022 also be the debris shield. However you might have to use some composites to reinforce the ball of ice so that it doesn\u0027t just shatter when impacted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you find a big enough ball of ice, you can even take the metallic asteroid with you, so you can build ships at the destination instead of having to carry potentially hundreds of parts worth of landers with you. That\u0027s the real tangible benefit for it for KSP2. Even if it\u0027s much better optimized than KSP1, there will still be a part limit that exceeds the capabilities of either the game, your computer, or both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t say it\u0027s an original idea, I stole it from the Orion\u0027s Arm world-building project, which is fiction but it\u0027s HARD Sci-Fi so they can\u0027t just go around fudging the laws of physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
