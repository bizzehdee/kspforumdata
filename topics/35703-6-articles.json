I really needed the 5 way symmetry for something and the vertical snap is also very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple of other features that would come in handy (for me, at least). First, a display of the angles the selected part is at (and also possibly a part which is mouse-overed). Second, some way of changing the amount that the wasdqe keys rotate the item by (possibly only the shift-keys that currently do 5 degrees). I would like to be able to accurately set angles down to 0.1 degrees, possibly better, so cycling through 5, 1 and 0.1 (and maybe 0.01) degrees for it would be ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if either of these is possible through KSP\u0027s editor interface. I am a programmer but have done very little C# and nothing with Unity. I\u0027ve taken a look at the source for this plugin (and some others) and it looks pretty simple as long as we have access to the part angles and angle increment properties. If anyone knows the minimal setup I need to be able to build the source for this plugin and can point me at any appropriate documentation of the editor then I\u0027d be happy to add the features myself (and maybe address some of the other issues/requests that have come up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mach_XXII","CreatedById":94457,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T00:25:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo this mod just adds better symmetry and the ability to switch between van and sph and turn radial attach on and off\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T13:47:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mach_XXII\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mach_XXII\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo this mod just adds better symmetry and the ability to switch between van and sph and turn radial attach on and off\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome indication of who you are replying to would be really helpful...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T14:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe current version of this mod is like 6 months old.

So you could select several parts (that are attached radially) and it would allow you to select different options for vertical and radial position. Vertical would allow to either align them by top, middle and bottom or distribute them equally in the space they occupy (top, middle, bottom, gaps). Radially would allow you to either align them all at the same radial angle or distribute them symmetrically around the parent part. This would allow you to throw parts onto your craft roughly and then ensure they are exactly lined up later. However, this would require you to be able to select multiple parts in the editor and this may not be possible (or be so difficult it is effectively impossible) without changes in the core editor code. Maybe it could use the tweakable window being open as the part being selected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know if there is any useful documentation on the core editor interface? I have experience of writing vector graphics editors (among other things) so have quite a good understanding of the various traps and pitfalls to avoid when writing this sort of code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that really bugs me about the VAB is that you can only attach a sub-assembly to your craft by the root part of the sub-assembly. This is most unhelpful and I don\u0027t see why the sub-assembly shouldn\u0027t allow you to attach it by any of its (unconnected) nodes. It may need to re-root the sub-assembly part tree before attaching it to the main tree but there are several plugins around that can do this so it shouldn\u0027t be very hard to do it in the core editor code.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T17:31:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically, you place a part using symmetry, but then if you want to modify only one of the set it\u0027s impossible.
