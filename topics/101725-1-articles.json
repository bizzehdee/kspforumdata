Presumably access to the smartboard should be password-protected. However things like this are often overlooked, or outright disabled because getting it working is often seen as more important than making it secure. I would look into whether the default password is still being used. Likewise, your teacher needs to consider how strong their password on their computer is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, is there a wireless network in use? This seems like the most likely vector in terms of how access is being gained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dominatus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dominatus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s one of the first two options, as the teacher mentioned her email being messed with remotely.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour teacher probably needs to change their passwords as a first step.
