Presumably access to the smartboard should be password-protected. However things like this are often overlooked, or outright disabled because getting it working is often seen as more important than making it secure. I would look into whether the default password is still being used. Likewise, your teacher needs to consider how strong their password on their computer is.\n\nSecondly, is there a wireless network in use? This seems like the most likely vector in terms of how access is being gained.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s one of the first two options, as the teacher mentioned her email being messed with remotely.\n\nYour teacher probably needs to change their passwords as a first step. It\u0027s entirely possible that the perp is just logging into her email account via a web console or somesuch, and not accessing her PC at all.\n\nBear in mind that there **should** be logs for these sorts of things, this should be the first port of call. **Make sure you have permission from whoever you need permission from if you intend on looking into this further yourself.** I have heard far too many horror stories about well-intentioned students getting the smackdown for trying to improve security in their schools. Strictly speaking this is the responsibility of your schools IT dept, not yours, and you need to be extremely wary of this."}]}
