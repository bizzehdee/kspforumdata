If they fix the issues with KSP1 regarding part-count-induced performance degradation, then the main reason for SSTU\u0027s existence will be moot.\n\u003E \n\nThat\u0027s kind of how I feel about Deadly Reentry. People have (ever since KSP 1.0) speculated on DR\u0027s inevitable demise since we now have atmospheric reentry heating. And yet of course DR is still around. First by implementing its own thermal system override on top of 1.0\u0027s thermal and then when Squad adopted *that* system there was still the need to rebalance max temps of parts that had all the thermal survivability of tungsten.\n\nSo it will be interesting to see how KSP 2 handles thermal."},{"CreatedByName":"StickyScissors","CreatedById":144204,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-28T07:46:59Z","Content":"ditto on the never playing stock beyond a few hours.

Indeed, the way I see it, the whole thing might just end up DOA because of just how out of touch the devs are with the community. They\u0027re not doing early access, *not one* of them had posted on the forums, but they are building up huge amounts of hype. Indeed, considering the standard KSP1 (and its mods!) has set, KSP2 might bomb if it ends up anything less, and if it does that, it might sink the whole franchise... except, of course, for modding community continuing to support KSP1 and its plugins. \n\nI hope KSP2 will be as good as they make it out to be, but something tells me we\u0027re looking at an overhyped flop in the making. KSP1 is great *only because* the community has been involved in it from the very start, pointing out errors, and even suggesting new directions to take the gameplay. Plugins were a huge part of it from the start. It isn\u0027t such a roaring success because of Squad (I\u0027d say, it\u0027s so despite Squad), it\u0027s **because of us**. They cannot hope replicate that without early access, and the only way for it to work out is if they make something that\u0027s more or less the same, but better on the technical end, and *then* listening to the community.
