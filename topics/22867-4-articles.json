I noticed two things. First, kind of strange to have (what appears to me) such a dark atmosphere, considering it\u0027s closer to the sun than Kerbin. True, Venus\u0027 sky might be dark too, but that\u0027s because of the thick clouds, and there are no thick clouds on eve. So I wonder what\u0027s causing the gloomy feel? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond point, my rover, after the batteries died (badly positioned folding solar array broke up upon deployment hahaha), just kept rolling on, and when encountering uphills, would then roll back down again...but I noticed that sometimes, it would slide slightly sidewards every now and then.

There is no reason no believe that Laythe\u0027s oceans are any more salty than Earth\u0027s because, contrary to your statement, Laythe\u0027s temperatures are not far below 0 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C; in fact, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eabove\u003C/em\u003E freezing, at a balmy 6.21 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.)

I\u0027ve made several trips to Laythe already, and with practice it could become a quite routine, if tedious, task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) There\u0027s an important difference between Io and Laythe, namely the fact that Laythe has an atmosphere. Not a thin one, either, but one nearly as thick as Earth/Kerbin. This alone would be enough to eliminate much of the radiation problem, but it\u0027s also quite possible that Laythe could have a significant magnetic field. After all, going by the acceleration due to gravity (which seem to me to be the best way to compare the bizarre Kerbal world to real life, as the strength of gravity is quite comparable between the two whereas mass, density, size, etc. are not), Laythe would probably be comparable in mass to Venus. Now, Venus doesn\u0027t have a global magnetic field, but this is because it rotates \u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u003C/em\u003E slowly and its core is not convecting, likely due to Venus\u0027 smaller size and thus lower internal temperature. Laythe, by contrast, rotates far more quickly and has its interior heated by tidal heating, which could very well be enough to produce a dynamo and thus a global magnetic field. Further supporting this is the fact that the real-life Galilean moon Ganymede has a magnetic field despite having a lower mass than Venus (and thus to the comparable mass of Laythe). It\u0027s highly likely, then, that Laythe has a rather strong magnetic field, which would shield it it from the radiation from Jool\u0027s magnetosphere and give it almost constant and absolutely \u003Cem\u003Estunning\u003C/em\u003E aurora.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, Laythe is far and away the most habitable place in the Kerb system aside from Kerbin itself, with the only real barrier to colonization being its distance from the homeworld.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maddmatts","CreatedById":21071,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T22:16:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest issue on the topic of terraforming Venus and Mars is their lack of a magnetosphere.
