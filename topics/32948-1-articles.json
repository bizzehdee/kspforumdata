I\u0027ve put the 1st part of a space station in orbit and am now working on meeting and docking with the station. I\u0027ve built a rocket with several stages that\u0027s more than capable, however I\u0027ve ran into a problem with my last stage in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my layout when I get into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking port\u0026gt;Pod\u0026gt;SAS\u0026gt;decoupler\u0026gt;fuel tank\u0026gt;LV-T30 engine\u0026gt;decoupler\u0026gt;fuel tank\u0026gt;LV-T30 engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this configuration when I get into orbit I still have some fuel left in the last fuel tank, and I use that up modifying my orbit and getting closer to my station. Generally when I drop that stage I\u0027m down to small maneuvers and getting closer to my station. This is where I run into the problem. When I activate the last engine, it doesn\u0027t create much thrust. To the point that in a nearly perfect orbit at 120k I\u0027m unable to de-orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this configuration I can change my orbit 20k meters with a burn of a couple seconds or less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking port\u0026gt;Pod\u0026gt;SAS\u0026gt;decoupler\u0026gt;fuel tank\u0026gt;LV-T30 engine\u0026gt;decoupler\u0026gt;fuel tank\u0026gt;LV-T30 engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this configuration (last engine and tank dropped) to change my orbit 20k it takes a 7 minute burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking port\u0026gt;Pod\u0026gt;SAS\u0026gt;decoupler\u0026gt;fuel tank\u0026gt;LV-T30 engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought maybe my saved build was bugged, so I built a new one and it did the same thing.
