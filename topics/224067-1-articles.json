This may offer the only chance you have to save the poor stranded Kerbals before they freeze to death in the bleak interstellar winds.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would take a deep breath, it will be OK even if they miss the station and disappear into the out reaches of the empty Void. There is a New Kerbal Management office at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. You can find it under the \u0022mods\u0022 office.

After filling out the proper KZX332 (DL MOD) you should be all set to recruiting new kerbals with whatever name you want.

How ever after that due to the fact that the lander pod still wasnt connected as it ran out of fuel the space station had no control to get back to kerbin. So also because it has no control it would also be super hard to dock with anything. So after that I just deleted the lander the flag that was planted and the station. The last I ever heard of the mission was when I opened a really old quicksave while doing a duna mission. Yea I just de orbited the station. Everyone still died\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-29T03:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, that\u0027s unfortunate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shammyofwar","CreatedById":233250,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-10T23:59:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRescue mission with a dockable command module add-on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
