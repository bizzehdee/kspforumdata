Tell them you are not challenged/interested enough, and ask what the possible solutions might be within your current school setup. The options seem to be to fix school for you, go to public school, or the most radical is what you suggest. What is lacking at private school, exactly from an educational standpoint? Mid school is more constrained than high school, usually, so you might have to do your time before you can take more control over what classes you take.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo, assuming the first thought is fixing school, I would talk to the school (or have your parents do so) about how challenging the classes are, and what you can do to keep it interesting. I say this because the opportunity cost of homeschooling is likely in fact more than the 2 tuitions, so why not let the infrastructure of a, you know, \u003Cem\u003Eschool\u003C/em\u003E, work in your favor, and get them to tailor a better education for you. For what \u003Cem\u003Ewe\u003C/em\u003E pay (my kids got to private schools), if my kids are not challenged, we would raise a little hell with the school, or look at another school (doesn\u0027t seem to be a problem so far). Any discussion with school should happen during the summer so things can be planned. Here the mid school to HS private schools have 3 good choices, and when my son is ready for mid school, we are open to him picking a different school than his sister if that is a better fit. Are there private school choices where you are?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree, instead of home schooling, why not public school? I cannot see home schooling as anything but a negative in many ways, as the social aspect of school is at least as important as the rest (I was a nerd in school, and not at all popular, but the social stuff was still better than nothing).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T20:35:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook, if you are being bullied at school, tell it to your parent.
