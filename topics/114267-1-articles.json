You\u0027d need a parent willing (and capable) of pushing you harder than your private school, as well.\n\nA few observations, though a few have been made. \n\nOne, you need to involve your parents immediately, and not with a demand to home-school (which is a huge undertaking for the parents). Tell them you are not challenged/interested enough, and ask what the possible solutions might be within your current school setup. The options seem to be to fix school for you, go to public school, or the most radical is what you suggest. What is lacking at private school, exactly from an educational standpoint? Mid school is more constrained than high school, usually, so you might have to do your time before you can take more control over what classes you take.\n\nTwo, assuming the first thought is fixing school, I would talk to the school (or have your parents do so) about how challenging the classes are, and what you can do to keep it interesting. I say this because the opportunity cost of homeschooling is likely in fact more than the 2 tuitions, so why not let the infrastructure of a, you know, *school*, work in your favor, and get them to tailor a better education for you. For what *we* pay (my kids got to private schools), if my kids are not challenged, we would raise a little hell with the school, or look at another school (doesn\u0027t seem to be a problem so far). Any discussion with school should happen during the summer so things can be planned. Here the mid school to HS private schools have 3 good choices, and when my son is ready for mid school, we are open to him picking a different school than his sister if that is a better fit. Are there private school choices where you are?\n\nThree, instead of home schooling, why not public school? I cannot see home schooling as anything but a negative in many ways, as the social aspect of school is at least as important as the rest (I was a nerd in school, and not at all popular, but the social stuff was still better than nothing)."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T20:35:23Z","Content":"Look, if you are being bullied at school, tell it to your parent.

Homeschooling is only for those who simply cannot go to a school due to their conditions, because it cost a damn lot.\n\nThink about this: if you are going to be homeschooled, that means someone gotta teach you at home. Now, who will that be? Your parent is unlikely to be qualified as a teacher and more than certain not having enough time to spend with you to teach you. So they will hire someone, like a private tutor, who may charge anywhere from $45 to $135 per hour (depending on curriculum, it might pile up quick).
