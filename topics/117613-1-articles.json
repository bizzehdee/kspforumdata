Far less hassle than managing many launches.\n\nI keep the hub in an eccentric orbit with apoapsis quite a bit above LKO, that way rendezvous doesn\u0027t take excessively long and I can speed up time more for most of the orbit.\n\nYou don\u0027t need a car or landing precision, just recover the rescue vessel from anywhere on Kerbin - the only reason to aim for KSC is its recovery value."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T15:28:01Z","Content":"For me rescues are just side-missions that keep the books balanced.

Send up a ship with 30 parachutes, a claw, and a grand of dV or so, and just rendezvous, claw, KIS a parachute to the pod, slow down to atmo, disconnect the claw, and get the rescue ship back into orbit. The cost to put this up would not be that much more than the cost to launch once for each rescue, and you\u0027d very quickly just turn the whole thing into a \u0022Kerbals and cash\u0022 factory.\n\nToo bad you can\u0027t fire Kerbals and get a \u0022refund\u0022 of what you would have paid them. Rescue 30 Kerbals, fire the last one, and get a million credits. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
