Send up a ship with 30 parachutes, a claw, and a grand of dV or so, and just rendezvous, claw, KIS a parachute to the pod, slow down to atmo, disconnect the claw, and get the rescue ship back into orbit. The cost to put this up would not be that much more than the cost to launch once for each rescue, and you\u0027d very quickly just turn the whole thing into a \u0022Kerbals and cash\u0022 factory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo bad you can\u0027t fire Kerbals and get a \u0022refund\u0022 of what you would have paid them.
