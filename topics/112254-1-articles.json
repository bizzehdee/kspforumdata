If you time your return from the mun, you can return close to KSC without going to LKO first. Kerbin rotates in 6 hours, so if KSC is 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 degrees behind your periapsis your vessel needs to hit it in x number of days (can be any number of days) plus 1h and 30m because kerbin rotates 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 in that time frame, which means you\u0027ll be flying over KSC at that periapsis altitude. If your reduce peri to 12km and stick it right above where KSC should be according to the time frame of Kerbin\u0027s rotation then you\u0027ll be landing very close to it.

Once out of moon orbit, you just lower your periapsis of the resulting Kerbin oribt so it intersects Kerbal or is in the atmosphere and, when you get there, pop off the capsule and reenter it.
