Or bring some more dv with me to help myself slow down?"},{"CreatedByName":"SanderB","CreatedById":83050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T19:52:43Z","Content":"you can aerobrake with any vessel, aerobrakes worthy of the name just allow you to radically increase how much drag your vessel experiences. If you time your return from the mun, you can return close to KSC without going to LKO first. Kerbin rotates in 6 hours, so if KSC is 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 degrees behind your periapsis your vessel needs to hit it in x number of days (can be any number of days) plus 1h and 30m because kerbin rotates 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 in that time frame, which means you\u0027ll be flying over KSC at that periapsis altitude. If your reduce peri to 12km and stick it right above where KSC should be according to the time frame of Kerbin\u0027s rotation then you\u0027ll be landing very close to it. You can increase or decrease the time it takes for you to reach kerbin without influencing your peri too much by burning directly toward or away from Kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"Arkalius","CreatedById":40968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T20:04:04Z","Content":"Don\u0027t confused the activity of \u0022aerobraking\u0022 and the part called \u0022airbrakes\u0022.

You won\u0027t be able to do it with that amount because you aren\u0027t infinitely fast. When I do a landing, my best is about 1.5x theoretical. My worst is about 3x. I often take 2x.\n\nOtherwise, you need about 3300 m/s to get to orbit. About 860 to get to the Mun. (Then you land as above). You need about 580 to get off the surface back to Mun orbit. You need about 310 to Leave Mun orbit. Once out of moon orbit, you just lower your periapsis of the resulting Kerbin oribt so it intersects Kerbal or is in the atmosphere and, when you get there, pop off the capsule and reenter it. (To limit rentry heating, I would have a periapsis that just grazed the surface).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks a lot for this explanation.
