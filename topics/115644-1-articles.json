Well, the title says most of it. Neither the visual affects, nor the actual heating are applied. The 32 bit executable, interestingly enough, works perfectly. Install is not clean, it was a heavily modded 1.0.3, now patched to 1.0.4 and with all the mods removed. The bug was observed from the very installation, prior to modding."},{"CreatedByName":"quietghost","CreatedById":117566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T23:49:14Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums Kornet! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWith a clean install of 1.0.4 on the exact same distro, all the effects are applied properly for me.\n\nI think the problem is because of the updates to the thermal system and because of the broken patcher.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 1.0.3, now patched to 1.0.4\n\nCurrently, the patcher is dysfunctional, so any updates to the thermal and AeroFX system likely went unpatched and/or are corrupted.\n\n(Edit: I also am pretty sure the patcher does not update linux 64bit anyway)\n\nWhat I recommend to fix the problem is:\n\nObtain a clean install of KSP 1.0.4 from the store (or steam)\n\nCheck to see if the aeroFX work there\n\nIf they do:\n\n- Move all your mods over, they should be completely compatable\n\nIf still no aeroFX:\n\n- There is likely an install-specific issue that requires more information about your system\n\nHope this helps,\n\nQuietghost"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T18:54:11Z","Content":"There\u0027s a [**way to fix**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92231-The-Linux-Thread!#linuxthread03) this ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kornet","CreatedById":118343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T23:20:17Z","Content":"Thank you.
