Well, the title says most of it. Neither the visual affects, nor the actual heating are applied. The 32 bit executable, interestingly enough, works perfectly. Install is not clean, it was a heavily modded 1.0.3, now patched to 1.0.4 and with all the mods removed. The bug was observed from the very installation, prior to modding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quietghost","CreatedById":117566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T23:49:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums Kornet! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a clean install of 1.0.4 on the exact same distro, all the effects are applied properly for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the problem is because of the updates to the thermal system and because of the broken patcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1.0.3, now patched to 1.0.4\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, the patcher is dysfunctional, so any updates to the thermal and AeroFX system likely went unpatched and/or are corrupted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Edit: I also am pretty sure the patcher does not update linux 64bit anyway)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I recommend to fix the problem is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObtain a \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eclean\u003C/span\u003E install of KSP 1.0.4 from the store (or steam)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck to see if the aeroFX work there\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Move all your mods over, they should be completely compatable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf still no aeroFX:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There is likely an install-specific issue that requires more information about your system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuietghost\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T18:54:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92231-The-Linux-Thread!#linuxthread03\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eway to fix\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kornet","CreatedById":118343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T23:20:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you.
