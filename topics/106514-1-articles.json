This is done for simplicity, game play and more or less computing power limitations. Having more detailed N body physics would be more interesting but is pretty much not going to happen for KSP.

It can be done, but the game currently has little in the way of time management systems. How would you keep track of when your spacecraft will re-enter and die in relation to other crafts? At what Rate, will you have time to help it if you launch at this time ETC.
