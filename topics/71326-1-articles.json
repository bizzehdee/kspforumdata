In my main career mode save, I have 2 satellites around Kerbin. I\u0027ve gotten a satellite around Mun, and 2 Kerbals into space, and that\u0027s it. I have several mods installed, and here is the list: FAR, Deadly Reentry, TAC Life Support, KW rocketry, and Proc. Fairings. I have a few other, but they are just for aesthetics. I need tips on how to get to the Mun with these mods.
