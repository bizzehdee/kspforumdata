(get rid of command pod flipping into the heat!)","CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:16:39Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:16:39Z","Content":"Note: Flowerchild was the first to find this, so he gets the credit. I just decided to make a thread so everyone could find it easier.\n\nGo to your KSP folder and follow this address: GameData/Squad/Parts/Aero/HeatShield\n\nHere you will find HeatShield1.cfg, HeatShield2.cfg, and Heatshield3.cfg. (don\u0027t mess with the .mu files)\n\nOpen up each CFG using notepad or whatever you use, and hit ctrl\u002BF to open the search function, and type \u0022physics\u0022 and hit enter. It will take you to a line that reads \u0022PhysicsSignificance = 1\u0022\n\nChange the 1 to a 0, for each heatshield cfg, and your heatshields will now add their mass to your craft the right way! Meaning that instead of just adding it\u0027s mass to the parent part, it will now add its mass right where it is, which means it will shift the CoM when you place it.\n\nWhich means a pod with a heatshield on it will now reenter without SAS or any fighting, it will naturally point retrograde now!\n\nHere is another way of fixing it, using ModuleManager.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyone who\u0027s already using Module Manager can also make a heatshield\\_fix.cfg that contains this:\n\u003E @PART[HeatShield\\*]\n\u003E \n\u003E {\n\u003E \n\u003E @PhysicsSignificance = 0\n\u003E \n\u003E }\n\nAgain, thanks to Flowerchild for finding this, and ignath for letting me know about the module manager patch. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Enjoy reentering!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T18:39:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 06:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Endersmens**"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:25:49Z","Content":"Good deal.
