The fuel gauges in the staging list on the left treat shared tanks as if each engine owns them completely. That is, if you have multiple engines mounted on independent tanks, *AND* they receive fuel from a shared center tank, you get a non-linear result. Let\u0027s say you have four engines, and 1000 units of your fuel is in the shared tank, and the other 4 separate tanks have 250 each, for 2000 units of total fuel. When you\u0027ve used up the center tank, you actually have 50% of your fuel remaining, but the fuel gauges show that you\u0027re down to 20%, because each engine thinks it has 1250 capacity available to it.

In 1.0.2, at least you could sometimes aerocapture at other planets (depending on ship design) and usually at least aerobrake enough to matter with 100% heat. In 1.0.4, however, just barely touching a substantial atmosphere at interplanetary speed makes your ship explode before the game fully transitions from space to atmospheric modes. So there will definitely have to another go at fixing this horrible mess.\n\nIn 1.0.2, I was pretty convinced the aerocapture problem was mainly the fault of the aero model in general, combined with arbitrarily set upper limits on atmospheres making them too dense too high. Those probably still play the main part in 1.0.4 but 1.0.4\u0027s totally new and buggy heat system is certainly pouring gasoline on the fire. Anyway, I doubt this can be fixed without yet again totally changing the aero model (the presumed root cause), which will again break saves. And I doubt this will get things right, either, so expect several more iterations. Thus, I\u0027m taking a vacation from doing anything of significance in KSP until things settle down into a playable form and stays there for more than a few days."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T02:37:25Z","Content":"I (finally) downloaded 1.0.4 and noticed on the Squad page that I bought the game on July 2nd 2013.
