The concept of \u0022hypocrisy\u0022 isn\u0027t even relevant here.  Because hypocrisy implies some sort of moral judgment, which isn\u0027t what we\u0027re doing.\n\nFirst of all, please do bear in mind that ***\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffff00;\u0022\u003Ewe moderators don\u0027t actually SEE most stuff\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E***, unless someone tells us about it (i.e. files a report).  We\u0027re just a small handful of part-time volunteers, and it\u0027s not even vaguely possible for us to read everything that gets written here.  That\u0027s why we rely on reports.  You folks have a whole lot more eyes and ears than we do.  When we act on \u0022problem posts\u0022, it\u0027s usually because someone reported it.\n\nSo, if you find yourself thinking \u0022well, this is dumb... the moderators came down hard on A, but why are they allowing B?\u0022 ... just because nothing got done on B doesn\u0027t necessarily mean that we \u0022allowed\u0022 it.  There\u0027s an excellent chance that we never *\u003Cu\u003Esaw\u003C/u\u003E* it because nobody reported it.  So... when in doubt, report.  We\u0027ll have a look.  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nBeyond that, though:\n\nBear in mind that the reasons for the forum rules are *\u003Cu\u003Epragmatic\u003C/u\u003E*, not idealistic.  For example, the reason why political content is strictly forbidden is that experience has shown that *\u003Cu\u003Eposting politics \u003Cstrong\u003EALWAYS\u003C/strong\u003E results in nasty flame wars\u003C/u\u003E*, which in turn derails threads, devolves into name-calling and personal abuse, and in general causes an unholy mess in which everyone loses.  And that is not okay.\n\nIf the general population were capable of discussing politics without losing their cool, then it wouldn\u0027t be a problem and we wouldn\u0027t have to put it off-limits.  But that\u0027s just one of those \u0022hot button\u0022 topics that can be relied on to *\u003Cu\u003Ealways\u003C/u\u003E* go off the rails, which is why it\u0027s not allowed here.\n\nMostly, moderators (and the forum rules) are reactive rather than proactive-- we wait until a problem actually *\u003Cu\u003Ehappens\u003C/u\u003E* before taking action.  After all, *\u003Cu\u003Eany\u003C/u\u003E* topic could *\u003Cu\u003Epotentially\u003C/u\u003E* result in a flame war... but most of them don\u0027t, most of the time.  It depends on who is participating in the discussion.  Most of the time, most people in the forums comport themselves as civil, mature adults, and can handle the discussion, so we generally act on the presumption that \u0022folks here are grown-ups, let them talk about whatever they like until and unless it gets nasty.\u0022  As much as possible, we want users to be able to discuss things freely as mature adults-- we\u0027re \u0022fire fighters\u0022 more than \u0022police\u0022-- so we have a strong \u0022bias for inaction\u0022 and prefer, where possible, not to act on anything unless there\u0027s a clear need to do so.\n\nPolitics, however-- like religion-- is proactively banned just because experience has shown that it will always blow up.  No point in waiting until after the firestorm to clean up the damage, there.\n\nIf there\u0027s some particular subject or post that you, personally, find offensive, then by all means *\u003Cu\u003Eplease report it\u003C/u\u003E* and we\u0027ll have a look to see whether we think it needs action.  (Don\u0027t automatically assume that just because something happened months ago means it gets a free pass.)  Maybe we\u0027ll agree with you, maybe we won\u0027t-- it\u0027s case by case.\n\nPlease do bear in mind, however, that the way we make our decision isn\u0027t \u0022could *\u003Cu\u003Eanyone\u003C/u\u003E* be offended by this\u0022, since pretty much *\u003Cu\u003Eeverything\u003C/u\u003E* is offensive to *\u003Cu\u003Esomebody\u003C/u\u003E*; if we did that, we\u0027d have to ban all discussion completely.  Rather, it\u0027s a practical decision of whether we believe the content is potentially harmful to children, and/or is it causing (or very likely to cause) flame wars and forum meltdowns."},{"CreatedByName":"The Minmus Derp","CreatedById":187595,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-11T19:41:13Z","Content":"That is very well written and makes a lot of sense.
