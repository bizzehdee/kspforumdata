Because when playing on enlarged Kerbin scale it became too painful to collect science after 10,000-100,000 km voyage...\n\nPersonally, I find going to waypoints on Kerbin painful on the normal scale. There\u0027s isn\u0027t much I can do in the contract pack itself, as the contracts with waypoints only have one waypoint (otherwise I would group them better). A few ideas:\n\n1. Install a mod that give multiple launch sites:  \n\n    1. \n    2. [Kerbin-Side](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82785-1-0-4-Kerbin-Side-%28v1-0-4%29-Supplements) - This one actually adds quite a bit (different structures, etc), so if you\u0027re near the memory cap it could be an issue.\n    3. [KSC Switcher](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117893-1-0-4-regex-s-Useful-Mod-Emporium) - The config file that it comes with is intended for RSS, but you can grab 5thHorseman\u0027s modified version [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54722-HMV-Plays-KSP%21-New-series-for-1-1-New-Horizons%21?p=2105036\u0026viewfull=1#post2105036) that removes the ones that end up in the ocean for Kerbin.\n    4. Chain the contracts with other stuff that you\u0027re doing in orbit, and then just land at/near the waypoint. Much easier than trying to fly there. This is really the way they were intended to be used, because flying long distances in stock is BORING.\n    5. Make big suborbital jumps to the waypoint.
