The question is why did KSP2 take so long and why was it in the state that it was in spring of 23\u0027. First: as I mentioned to PDCwolf big, complicated games often take 6-8 years to be released, and even then they are often buggy and missing features that get added later. KSP2 was more than just buggy at release, it was nigh unplayable. It\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E buggier than I would hope for or expect from an EA release. No matter how you slice it the game needed more time, probably another year to be released even with just base-game \u002B science and a playable level of performance and stability. So why did KSP2 end up on the longer end of the 6-8 year development time?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) KSP is actually a really complicated and very unique game that requires a huge number of novel solutions. Re-writing the code to allow for multiple subassemblies in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, acceleration under timewarp, interstellar, and multiplayer meant re-solving these problems from scratch. Starfield is also a big complicated game, but its still just a Role-Play FPS. There\u0027s a lot of content and some newish features but at its core it\u0027s still just a skin of FO4, which is a skin of Skyrim, which is a skin of Oblivion and so on. They aren\u0027t tasked with reinventing novel physics applications.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) The original studio collapsed and was rebuilt half-way through development. No matter what you personally think about the politics of that it was undoubtedly incredibly messy and disruptive to the process and probably set them back a year all by itself.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) Do people remember this all happened during COVID? Every business I deal with was set back at least a year cumulatively by the collective disruption that happened over the 2 years from 2020 to 2022.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEach of these was communicated to players. There are whole dev blogs and dev videos devoted to explaining the technical challenges. There was a whole dev video on how frustrating and disruptive COVID was for them and their process. Folks who have been following this for years or went back and watched those videos all know this history. We\u0027ve talked about it at length many, many times. Again my question was not \u003Cem\u003EWas KSP2\u0027s history relevant to its current state?\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eor\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EWhy are people allowed to bring up the past when talking about the state of the game?\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EIt was:\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EW\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003Ehat is the point of\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003Erehashing 6 years of dev development \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E20 times a month\u003C/strong\u003E?\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EWhy are we filling every other thread on this board with SAME.

Again, there\u0027s an epidemic of grossly overstating the complexity of rigidbody physics which if they were such, they wouldn\u0027t proliferate that hard on almost every indie engineering title. The complexity of the scaled-space planetarium method and integrating patched conics is also grossly overstated, as they\u0027re absolutely the easiest solutions to the problems presented by the concept of the game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSomehow KSP2 being almost the same game as KSP1 isn\u0027t measured by the same stick as Starfield being built up on its predecessors, even though so far those games have presented the bigger evolutions. Somehow for you, KSP2 had a bigger effort and evolution, whilst actually being so far a discernible devolution of its predecessor save for the \u003Cem\u003Eassumption\u003C/em\u003E that they had to rebuild everything. This assumption is also proven wrong when you see stuff like the PQS topic, where they straight up lifted systems from the previous game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe original studio is no more and was replaced, obviously, but they did announce a full product for 2020. The studio that replaced them also announced full products for 2021, 2022, 2023, and then 5 months before release switched to EA. This cannot be ignored at any stage and will remain a glaring issue until clarified. It is also obvious for anyone that such a full product might have never existed, but even then we\u0027d need explanations of why they chose lie to our faces 4 times. \u0022le greed xd\u0022 is not an explanation, much less when coming from a user.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCOVID lockdowns went on from late 2020 to early 2021. The lie that a full product was coming lasted from early 2019 to late 2023.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe videos explaining the disruption and such still promised a full product, and mentioned that progress was allowed to go on during those times, so the official statement is that they did manage to work on the game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFixing the game is not solving \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E problem. The state of the game is, for me, a completely disjointed issue from their frustrating and outright false -in some cases- PR statements, and how they both fail to acknowledge reality and continue trying to rope us in with lukewarm statements trying too hard at happy-go-lucky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, I think a lot of people who share your view forget one thing: Progress has been made. And no, I don\u0027t mean the game, I mean getting the upNates to be serious, getting the company to do a small statement about it, getting a public bugtracker, a bi-weekly bug update, and so on, and in those aspects, every bit of progress has ended discussion on those points.
