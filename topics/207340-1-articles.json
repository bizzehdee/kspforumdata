For traditional rocket capsules we basically only have 3 conical, 3 (identical) spherical and (that\u0027s a reach since it\u0027s designed for vacuum landers) one cylinder. What I would love to see is a large variety of crew parts, some steps in the right direction happened around the making history DLC, but KSP still had less diverse pod library than real life. No matter what rocket you built, it always had almost the same appearance at the end of the mission (unless it was an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E or something) once it finally landed. Having different cones of various heights, and small parts designed to be stuck directly onto the pods would make the game much more interesting, maybe parts for alternative landing types? In KSP 2 I feel like that will be an early game thing, but many KSP1 players relish in continually making their way from start to midgame just to repeat, so I assume that this part of the community would hugely appreciate being able to make their ships feel more unique in the closing minutes of missions when they are descending to the green, soft grass of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilar for engines, giving more non modern-US style propulsion would go a long way to making people compete for the most stylish Mun landing without needing to use nontraditional mission profiles.\u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Soyuz_TM-32.jpg/1200px-Soyuz_TM-32.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022The skirted Soyuz propulsion system is very stylish in my opinion\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.50\u0022 height=\u0022798\u0022 style=\u0022height:auto;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Soyuz_TM-32.jpg/1200px-Soyuz_TM-32.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003ESoyuz got me acting up tbh\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-20T18:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you want visual part variety? I think that is going to be a given, as we have seen several new size tiers with different shapes and different pods. Additionally, there will be a variety of new mission profiles to facilitate a diverse-looking cast of final stages. Lastly, visual variety for every mission is achievable with a bit of extra effort even in KSP 1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
