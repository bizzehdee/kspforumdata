The amber light is a signal of pending red (stop) light, and is allegedly timed for roadway posted speed and distance to intersection for normal breaking/stopping. Here where I live, for a while we had to deal with \u0027red light cameras\u0027, which would monitor and record drivers running through red lights and issue them a ticket/fine (they\u0027ve since been over-ruled, for now). Anyway, some of the roadways had been marked with a narrow reflective white line (perpendicular to the road) to indicate and inform drivers if they could \u0027safely\u0027 pass through the amber light. There wasn\u0027t much notice made about this, and I think it was in experimental stages. What it boiled down to is: If you\u0027re doing the posted speed limit and you\u0027ve crossed the line already when the light turns amber, you\u0027ll pass safely ... but if the light turns amber before you reach that line - you\u0027re not going to make it.
