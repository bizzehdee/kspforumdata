For KSP it could be fairly simple, since the code to recognize when objects are in frame, even very distant ones like moons or Kerbol is already in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possibility:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe each of the Kerbal admins wants photos for different reasons or will give you something different for them (not the recovery guy obviously)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinances = sell them for some extra cash\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPR = Use them to gain extra rep\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience = use them to get a small amount of science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr: maybe contracts could have \u0022take photo of x body\u0022 or \u0022Take a photo of a kerbal on the surface of x body\u0022, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome objects/factors which could factor into a photo\u0027s value:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the planets, moons or stars in frame (der)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Flags\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Vehicles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the setting (in space or \u0022under a different sky\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECameras as a part:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Probably placed radially or as a \u0022tiny\u0022 part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Would have a very minor pan/zoom ability, meaning you would actually have to point a ship in order to take a desired photo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Consume power on activation/taking a picture\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Maybe they can only store so many frames before needing to transmit them to the KSC (film or digital storage space)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome benefits I see to the system:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Adding some game play/objective variety\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A record of achievements for players\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A means of making back or padding the rep system (for when that becomes important)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Integrating into game play the idea of screenshots\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Adds a new reason to have transmitters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Means that a bit of value could still be salvaged from say: a rover who\u0027s wheels busted on landing and thus can\u0027t travel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts/Suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T21:07:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, cameras would be a great addition.
