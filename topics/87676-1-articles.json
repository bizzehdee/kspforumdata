It is considered safe because even if you point it directly at someone\u0027s eyes, it is impossible to do damage because the blink reflex is fast enough to block the beam in time. You could hurt someone with it if you shone it through magnifying optics though, like a telescope, but that\u0027s not really a realistic scenario and even then the damage would probably be limited and heal over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, the damage potential to the human eye specifically depends strongly on the color of the laser. The more the laser tends towards the infrared spectrum, the lower its potential to hurt the eye. Conversely, the more it tends towards the ultraviolet, the more dangerous it becomes. This is why office laser pointers are almost always red. A green laser pointer is more dangerous to the eye at same power; they\u0027re rare in comparison to red pointers. And a blue laser is the most dangerous to the human eye; you will \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E see anyone in an office presentation wave around a blue pointer.

If you pointed this at an aircraft, you\u0027re pretty much guaranteed to severely injure both pilots regardless of distance, because by the time this beam dissipates enough to stop being dangerous, you\u0027re no longer able to aim with it anyway.\u003Cp\u003EAnd you do not need a gun license or any special sort of training to be allowed to buy, own and operate this. \u0022It\u0027s just a laser pointer\u0022, right? Yeah right. Laser weapons are real and available cheaply and unregulated to the common person. And legislation is \u003Cem\u003Ewoefully\u003C/em\u003E unaware and behind the times.
