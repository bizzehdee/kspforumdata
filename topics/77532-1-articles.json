To that end, I decided to start by building a reusable crew vehicle, and an expendable, but simple, and (logically) cheap rocket family.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew vehicle is called the \u003Cstrong\u003EDiskovery Block IIC\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jHimI3n.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022jHimI3n.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vehicle is entirely reusable, the only part jettisoned is the heatshield, just before parachute deployment. The two solid KW motors on the sides are the LAS, they are fired together with the main retractable engines, which can be seen around the bottom. The landing legs remain in the fairings until just before touchdown, which usually is in the flatlands by KSC. The service module contains ~3 days worth of life support for three Kerbals, and the total DV is about 3km/s. The RCS and main engines both are powered by MMH and N2O4(realfuels). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Reentry:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p0JSaEN.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022p0JSaEN.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took a bit of work to get the shape right for it to survive reentry.
