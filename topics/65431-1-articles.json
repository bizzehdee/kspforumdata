You should be skimming sideways along the ground until the very last instant, where you pitch vertical right as your horizontal velocity goes to zero and settle ever-so-perfectly down on the ground with little to no hang-time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T10:00:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour other example, kill horizontal and freefall is pretty much the opposite end of the spectrum. Its about the least efficient descent profile. Having said that its also probably the easiest to execute as it gives you forever to think about what you are doing and shuffle the landing point to find flat ground. A major drawback of this tactic is that if you freefall from too high the planet/moon will rotate beneath you and your landing spot will drift during vertical descent\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe suicide burn is what you really want. You pick a low periaps (not quite ground-intercepting as you suggested) and follow the retrograde surface marker with the burn (rather than burning horizon until horizontal is 0 then canceling vertical as you would using the other method. Doing that with a suicide trajectory will probably mean a crash. You can plot a suicide burn to some degree by tweaking the retrograde node handle on the map until your trajectory after the burn appears to be straight down on the map toward the surface. Thats robbed both horizontal and vertical velocities, since you burn retrograde surface rather than horizon the vertical path shown after the burn is a freefall under local-g, its gonna be a dozen or so ms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practice you want a tiny mix of these 2, you do still want a short free-fall period to make any final adjustments (mainly to allow for surface slope, double-check gear deployment etc.), the true suicide all-or-nothing landing is best used when you know the ground you are coming down on, otherwise do the suicide with a view to ending 1000m or so up so that you have a chance to make those tweaks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-11T10:06:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2014 10:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T10:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor pinpoint landings (i.e. landing at certain selected spot) i recommend\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/38IYZUizX3E?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E.
