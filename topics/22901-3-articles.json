Space is the not the American Far West. Space is not a new continent. Spaceships aren\u0027t airplanes or sail ships. Colonizing the Moon or Mars is nothing like colonizing America or Australia. History doesn\u0027t repeat itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor one example of \u0022heavier than air flight\u0022, there are hundreds of examples of other technologies that ended up being dead ends because they simply weren\u0027t practical or they ended up being useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir travel is a bad example, because there were destinations, places where people wanted to go. There was a massive demand for people to travel before there was an economical offer. In space, there is no habitable place for the masses to go, no destination. At a stretch, you might one day be able to build a Moon base or an orbital hotel for a few hundred people, but a few hundred travellers a year is not going to bring the prices down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace flight will never be cheap, because the amount of energy that is required to accelerate a given mass from zero to orbital velocity will always be the same. There is no evidence that energy will ever be cheap. The price might go down, but even if it is divided by 10, it will still be too expensive for the masses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"B787_300","CreatedById":31055,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T12:52:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh but there are destinations that people will want to go to, the moon, mars, Other star systems eventually\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T12:55:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, because you can\u0027t live on the Moon or Mars.
