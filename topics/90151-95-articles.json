Other than a TPO2/TPH2-\u0026gt;LOX/LH2-\u0026gt;O2/H2 converter and regulator, I guess I should just make the rest of the core volume a realfuels service module?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-25T05:53:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2015 05:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yaivenov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
