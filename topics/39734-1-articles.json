I installed FAR, and decided to play with a bit of responsibility this time around. No more wild killing of my Kerbals. No colony ships packed to the gills on their trial run. No vessels without parachutes or fail-safes. And most importantly, no abandoning Kerbals. At this point, I didn\u0027t realize that the recovery function had been added. I launched a few mun missions to kick off my campaign. There were 3 attempted manned launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3zOChNc.png\u0022 alt=\u00223zOChNc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 1 was a failure- it had to be ditched in orbit.
