Secondly, this brings us to politics, most politicians have a prime objective and that is re-election. So why fund a project which is years into the future? And thirdly, what about priorities in the light of current geo-political events? IMHO some real progress will only happen under two circumstances: Either one of the major super-powers on this fair planet is going to challenge the US and Europe by taking supremacy in space (which may be likely) or suddenly worldwide peace is breaking out (rather unlikely), defering more funds to scientific research than right now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I (if I were decisionmaker for a nation\u0027s space program) had rather have the opportunity to perform long-term in-situ studies on a whole asteroid, checking out opportunities for mining rare elements, fuel, you name it, for power generation or whatever may be in those lumps of rock.
