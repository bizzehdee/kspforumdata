He was also kind enough to answer some of my questions about Jupiter. Here\u0027s a rough sketch of what you\u0027d see as you descended through the clouds; for more, definitely check out his book.\n\nI met Michael Carroll once or twice, and he actually signed my copy of \u0022Drifting on Alien Winds\u0022 and drew a little picture of the Jovian clouds on there. For those who don\u0027t know, he created paintings depicting various space missions before digital art was a thing. He wanted to make his paintings as accurate as possible, so he began researching planetary features and atmospheres. Now, he knows more than almost anyone else about the atmospheres of planets and moons. If you haven\u0027t heard of \u0022Drifting on Alien Winds,\u0022 *buy it*. It will make you feel very smart and it will support a fantastic artist who should be a household name...\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T18:49:49Z","Content":"Randall is always awesome."}]}
