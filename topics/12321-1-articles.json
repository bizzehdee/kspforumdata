The two other bodies that played out their celestial dance around it were rough slabs of granite by compare, ugly and dead. A shimmering constellation of satellites in every possible orbit passed them by, sometimes by a thousand yards or less. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah let his tool belt and his body float for a moment, not bothering to keep his hand on the railing as the flight director so often reprimanded him to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153You\u00E2\u20AC\u2122re a risk taker, Jeb,\u00E2\u20AC Kranz had said shortly before the last rocket of his career blasted off. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153-just don\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t take any stupid risks. That\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s all I ask.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile Jeb resented being told what to do, he also understood the directors words, somewhere in that dark part of his brain that still contained a molecule of reason. A molecule, but only that. There was a certain type of person who volunteered to be shot up on structurally dubious canisters of fuel, and the selection process to locate such a man did not favor those with a well developed sense of reason. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153KB-1, this is KB-2, ground wants an update on the EVA, over.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb caught himself.

This is KB-3, I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122ve got a really big splash in the pond. At least several kilometers in size.

It was a shame that he was spending his very last flight as a simple mechanic, but there was not much else to do. There were no more great heroes left. No more places to explore for the first time. No more champagne to drink, no more girls to woo, no more parties to crash when he returned. Space travel was old hat now, and the public had turned its thinly stretched attention to other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the last rivet on the solar panel ground its way into its socket, a shadow engulfed Jeb. He looked up immediately. His mind was well attuned to the dangers that inhabited this lonely stretch of space, where the atmosphere met the vacuum, and this interloper met none of the qualifications. The permanence of the shadow suggested it was far too large to be a wayward satellite, and neither was it an eclipse. The words of his trusty co-pilot echoed once more across his mind, mocking him. They said they did\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMiles below in the control bunker, Kranz spit coffee all over his monitor.
