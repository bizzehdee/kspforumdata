But also you might want to land somewhere and recover the craft, as to my knowledge, that\u0027s a part of some contracts and such to advance. I have a feeling it\u0027s not a bug and really just a means of refreshing the contracts once more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, it is helpful you included this picture, but I don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to get new contracts mid-flight unless you have already accepted them at KSC. But I\u0027m not exactly sure what all you have tried because it wasn\u0027t specified. But that\u0027s alright though. Sorry if I came off serious, I hope you can figure out the issue though. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Best wishes\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe distance and speed records, etc., are automatic, no acceptance of contracts required.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ainztein","CreatedById":144230,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T01:50:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HyperbolicKerbonaut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HyperbolicKerbonaut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe distance and speed records, etc., are automatic, no acceptance of contracts required.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, thats right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently after i restart a new career, i am able to get the 39km and 100km distance record to show up. Not sure what i did that cause the difference. I am suspecting that certain location on Kerbin might cause the next distance record not to activate.
