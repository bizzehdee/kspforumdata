But also you might want to land somewhere and recover the craft, as to my knowledge, that\u0027s a part of some contracts and such to advance.

Not sure what i did that cause the difference. I am suspecting that certain location on Kerbin might cause the next distance record not to activate. Thats just my guess, need to do more testing to verify this."}]}
