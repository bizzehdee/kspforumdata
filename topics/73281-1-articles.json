So on dedicated landers, which only use their engines for landing, it might be worth more to save weight, than to save fuel. The transferstage (for interplanetery) should offcourse have nuclear engines, but for small landers, the added weight might even drive the deltaV up instead of down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor landing on Mun sized things, the LV-909 is efficient enough, and also very light. The even smaller 48-7S is even better. Only .1 tons, compared to 2.25 from the Nuclear engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you still want to use the nuclear engine, you can raise the engines by mounting them radially, instead of directly under the main tank. Mount them high, and than put the lander legs on the main tank. This way the engines are higher than the legs. However this does give you a relativly higher center of mass, coupled with a smaller landing base, which makes it easier to fall over if you haven\u0027t cancled out your horizontal speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasicly: the NERVA is designed for interplanetery transfer stages, rather than for landing stages\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T18:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore imaginative ship design will do it.
