Thanks for this. It\u0027s going to make using the editor a much more pleasant experience in the future. I just gave it a quick try, and it didn\u0027t seem to help my landing much, though. I thought it might try lowering the plane\u0027s attitude on the ground, but that didn\u0027t help either. I\u0027ll need to give it another try later when I have time.\n\nDoes that also happen when taxiing on the ground at high speed? Throttle up on the runway, and accelerate beyond landing speed without taking off, possibly with landing flaps, and any spoilers you have activated during touchdown. If you lose control doing that, the problem is indeed the landing gear.\n\nIf that isn\u0027t the problem, use brakes. If they cause instability, strut the gear legs and/or reduce brake torque. Possibly pull on the elevator while below takeoff speed (I found that it usually helps a bit - I think it\u0027s because it reduces the load on the front gear leg(s)).\n\nIf neither causes problems, it\u0027s prob how you touch down.\n\nBrakes disabled as you touch down, little to no vertical velocity, no side slip, no roll angle. If you do that, a plane with properly working landing gear should land fine."},{"CreatedByName":"Doke","CreatedById":149975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T17:13:15Z","Content":"Thanks for the tips.

Best I can tell, it\u0027s involved with gear orientation, though stock landing gear is a bit stiff, and the front gear being so tall was not helping. No matter what I do, though, the plane seems to veer to the right on the runway, so that\u0027s interesting. Those fins you\u0027ve porcupined your plane with are actually doing a world of good and haven\u0027t managed to do better than what you\u0027ve got, but replacing the landing gear did actually improve your aerodynamics, though judging from the construction of your plane, I wouldn\u0027t expect you to use part mods, haha.
