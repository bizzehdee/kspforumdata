I\u0027ve got another probe on route to Jool and its moons, and a manned mission on it\u0027s way to Duna. I have more than enough science to get all the parts I need and then some, but the problem is I don\u0027t have much in the way of cash. The only contracts I get that help cover costs are \u0022explore [planet/moon x]\u0022, and even then, I don\u0027t get contracts for all of the places I want to go. For example, I\u0027ve visited Moho 3 times now (first time didn\u0027t have enough delta V to achieve orbit, second time was a successful one way trip, third time is a return journey), and I\u0027ve never received any contract to go there. So basically I\u0027m wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars to get there for no return. How can I generate a contract to go there? Is it completely random?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve picked strategies that help maximize profits but it doesn\u0027t seem to be enough.

I\u0027ll also admit that I \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E build the spacecraft I send to other planets in orbit above Kerbin, but I don\u0027t mainly due to laziness. For example, I sent a probe to Moho that consisted of lander and an orbiting module that had enough fuel for a return journey to Kerbin. I could\u0027ve launched the lander and the orbiting module separately and docked them above Kerbin, but instead I launched them in one go. The rocket to lift that into orbit above Kerbin cost me over $250,000. Prohibitively expensive :/.
