The orbital inclinations of such objects can and do vary widely, due to the circumstances of their formation, collisions in the aeons since, and not being as tightly bound to the primary as the regular planets in the inner system.\n\nSilicon - I disagree. One, Eagle\u0027s Landing (on the touchdown coordinates of *Eagle*, if I recall correctly) serves quite well, IMO, as a memorial to Armstrong (and someday to Aldrin as well) as well as a monument to the mission and craft that carried them there.
