I\u0027ve been a shuttle night launch as well and it is so bright it\u0027s like watching a sunrise, but it doesn\u0027t actually light up the shuttle itself the same way the game lights the spacecraft with point lights. The shuttle is pretty evenly lit because all of the light on it is coming from reflections off the ground and diffused light from the exhaust.\n\u003E [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/STS-88_launch.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/STS-88_launch.jpg)\n\nPerhaps we could cheat by having light fall off around the engine. IE having them act like a more diffuse spotlight so there is still some light behind it but not as bright as in front (\u0022front\u0022 being the where the rocket plume goes)."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T23:29:20Z","Content":"About your patch \n\n    @PART[*]:HAS[@MODULE[ModuleEngines]]:Final {\tMODULE\t{\t\tname = tjs_EngineLight\t\tlightPower = 1.0\t\tlightRange = 40.0\t}}@PART[*]:HAS[@MODULE[ModuleEnginesFX]]:Final {\tMODULE\t{\t\tname = tjs_EngineLightFX\t\tlightPower = 1.0\t\tlightRange = 40.0\t}}\n\n Why can\u0027t you just have ? \n\n    @PART[*]:HAS[@MODULE[ModuleEngines*]]:Final {\tMODULE\t{\t\tname = tjs_EngineLightFX\t\tlightPower = 1.0\t\tlightRange = 40.0\t}"},{"CreatedByName":"futrtrubl","CreatedById":77310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T23:51:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E About your patch.\n\u003E  Why can\u0027t you just have ? \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     @PART[*]:HAS[@MODULE[ModuleEngines*]]:Final {\tMODULE\t{\t\tname = tjs_EngineLightFX\t\tlightPower = 1.0\t\tlightRange = 40.0\t}\n\nI\u0027d think it\u0027s because someone may have created or might create a module that starts with ModuleEngines and this would cause issues and it\u0027s just one more MM patch.
