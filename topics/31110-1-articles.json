The first is a design checklist, all of the things I need to verify before I leave the VAB/SPH. Things like \u0022Add RCS jets and monoprop fuel\u0022, \u0022Add an ASAS or Avionics\u0022, \u0022Put an unmanned control node on it even if it has a cockpit\u0022 or \u0022Add an RTG or solar panels\u0022.

Normally, this would be specific to each design, but that\u0027d require way too much writing, so I keep my lists as consistent as possible. For instance, all of my spaceplanes use this list of toggles:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; Turbojets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Most of the intakes (to reduce drag at low altitudes or on descent)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; Primary rocket engines (usually an LV-N)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; Secondary rocket engines (my best designs add a few inefficient boosters for getting to orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5\u0026gt; All the sensors and other one-time activations.
