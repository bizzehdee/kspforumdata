Some things I notice:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s impossible to get anything to the Moon early on. An unguided last stage could conceivable get there (Able/Delta is too heavy for 40t lifters), but without maneuver nodes? The most important holdup is waiting for the facilities to be finished, and by that time, a lot of tech also has come online. Many things falling into place pretty much at the same time, that\u0027s one huge leap ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a shortage of small-scale command modules. The rangers can barely make an excentric orbit @somewhere, which is probably intended, but also means that you need to bring a power-hungry Able/Delta in order to circularise in GEO. With the best bipropellants, the surveyor can land on the Moon, but again needs an Able/Delta to circularize first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, AIES brings several \u0022Satellite Bus\u0022 modules that are in the same node as Agena, weigh less, need less power, and have no avionics limits. Want me to do something about it? Though personally, I\u0027d rather move them to higher techs because of the looks. The FASA Pioneer, on the other hand, seems quite suitable... I\u0027d like to adapt it for RO/RP-0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s too many diameters. Engines have the weirdest sizes (historically correct I presume) that don\u0027t match the command modules. Bringing the two together requires a lot of creativity I\u0027d rather spend elsewhere. Rather than tailoring the rocket to a given engine size I also often find myself building my own fairings, but these can become fiendishly heavy at times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T06:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaie: As far as I know, facilities upgrade with the build rate, so they can upgrade quite quickly. Are you playing with Fund Penalties set to 100%, or something higher? That said, you\u0027re right that you\u0027ll probably need about 60t of LV (just over the limit) to get something TLI unless you nail a direct ascent. I\u0027m not quite sure how to avoid the pitfall you\u0027re talking about regarding many things coming on at once--you can get a boatload of early science from sounding rockets and switching launch sites, and especially if you put a few points in R\u0026amp;D as well as build rate you can get a lot of nodes unlocked before the pad/TS/MC are all upgraded. That said, the nodes will unlock in succession so you can fly orbital (and even high-space) missions with starting buildings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, you might even be able to do a lunar flyby with just the TS/MC upgrades, and 40 tons, and no more than the first tier of tech nodes. If you have, say, 4x X-405s (for the Isp) as your first stage, and a stretched Able, you probably could orbit an Explorer and just enough Baby Sergeants to precisely equal a TLI burn (~3150m/s). I *think* that can be done just under 40 tons, but don\u0027t quote me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure why you\u0027d need to bring avionics with you to GEO, you launch your satellite \u002B apogee kick solid to GTO, create a maneuver node at apogee, orient towards it, then separate the upper stage. At apogee, fire the kick motor. Then on kick motor jettison, you can fine-tune with hydrazine. For a lunar orbit, you can just pack a couple Baby Sergeants, not even an Altair, and be fully under the 200kg limit of the Early Controllable Core even during LOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame deal with Surveyor: in real life it used a solid retro to kill most of its incoming velocity, then small liquid verniers to cover the last hundred m/s or so. This was a direct ascent flight, no lunar orbit first. Unless by circularize you mean circularize in LEO prior to TLI, in which case yes (but you should have the Agena by then).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that the AIES cores need to be moved. pjf placed them before avionics were a thing, IIRC, and also without much regard for their looks and modernity. :] I\u0027d love it if you would move and reconfigure them appropriately!

As it is, one has to put the base below, attach sides, then adjust the extra height to match the part on top. I\u0027ve tried the top-down approach, but then I have to toggle crossfeed and the auto-shape is all wrong.

I just got the Miniaturization tech unlocked so I have access to the Surveyor probe core and some small landing struts. What I can\u0027t seem to find is an engine that\u0027s similar to the vernier engines used on the actual Surveyor probe. First I thought something similar to the LR101 used on the Atlas but the only option in game uses KER/LOX which I\u0027m guessing wasn\u0027t on the Surveyor. Also, the LR101 is not throttleable and I\u0027m guessing any landing engine will need to be. So then I thought about the \u0022Vernor Engine\u0022 that\u0027s part of the RCS list. It can take different fuels but, again, it\u0027s not really throttleable.
