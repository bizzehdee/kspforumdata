Sadly I played a bit too much yesterday and today I didn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t hear the alarm clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with the newly added career mode and its science part I\u0027ve been thinking that it would have been a great help if I had started with this version of the game. This point might not be true for the majority but I found myself a bit overwhelmed by the number of parts I could use the first time. So my first flights were something like: \u0022I take the orange tank, the big engine and will try it ... no wait, 4 orange tanks in addition to 4 big engines might be better!\u0022 It was funny indeed, but I had no clue what I had to do (I was not very interested into space). The result? I didn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t knew what an orbit was so I was directly doing head-ons on the moon for getting there. After watching some videos online I realized how kerbal - arm- stupid I was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow back to the topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the scenario of a completely new player experiencing KSP:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be a good idea to combine the career mode with a few ingame tutorials, maybe connected to your state of science. So everytime you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4re researching something new (well, not everytime, but just for the main parts), a small textbox/kerbal with voice will explain you briefly what you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ve just unlocked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m not suggesting a focus of manpower on this for the new versions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to share an idea/vision about a career mode with a newcomer friendly access.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
