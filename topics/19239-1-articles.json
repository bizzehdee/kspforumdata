I can\u0027t remember how the comm stat mod works, but assuming you can use a ship a the control point (maybe the mod can be modified for this in light of distant planets and the need for a more nearby control source), it would be neat to send a ship that could seed a planet and its moons with rovers. Since it will not really be practical to try and bring the kerbals home, having them stay in orbit and sending down remote rovers would be the next best thing. Of course, a ship like this would probably need to be built in orbit since multiple rovers would make for a lot of dead weight to handle, so it wont become practical until we get orbital construction as well in all likely hood.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master","CreatedById":1569,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T21:36:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you just start a new thread every time it gets locked what is the point of locking it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T21:39:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Master\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Master\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you just start a new thread every time it gets locked what is the point of locking it?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt allows for a clean slate, plus, I find this interesting:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Multiple Player Saves: You can now have multiple ongoing game sessions, as each save is kept in its own folder (instead of all using the saves/default one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssigned to: HarvesteR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatus: Complete\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Ships saved by one player are private to that player.
