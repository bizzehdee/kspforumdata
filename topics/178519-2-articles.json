It really can\u0027t do meaningful damage to anything past 400 meters or so but it will fire away what should be a rather massive amount of ammunition (900 rounds per gun) in about 8 minutes of flying. WRT 7000 HP, that was an accident lol. The ground attack plane just happened to have tons of stuff bolted on to an ordinary Mk1 cockpit.\u00A0Even the dummy though has some parts with pretty crazy levels of HP, including the cockpit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe planes I\u0027ve built that are actually competition-worthy have most parts at HP 500-1500, but some wing spars and base plates for the cockpit and wings\u00A0and such exceed this. The spars on my Shadowbird Mk IV have about 2000-3000 HP each but are rather small targets in addition to being tough. My other plane had spars and its spine\u00A0up to 4500 HP.\u00A0That being said, these parts are heavy. You could not just go around building an entire plane out of super narrow mass/strength\u00A02.5 wings 5\u00A0meters long with more wings attached and still expect it to fly well, and even then, someone will eventually engine-snipe you I should think.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you want an example of super crazy parts, some of the plates on my 27-tonne flying tank plane spawn with up to 13000 HP.

That was a joke, not a finished airframe. The idea was to test the basic geometry and then put more stuff on top. What is with the flexing though? It\u0027s not visible in that picture, but at the moment\u00A0I do any maneuvers the wings and structural parts bend way more than stock parts would, even with autostruts on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-12T21:52:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFair enough. Flexing generally occurs when something heavy is attached to something light, and in the pic it looks like you have lightweight wing spars connected to lightweight fuselage elements, with decently large wings attached to the spars. Any sort of maneuver is going to put the kiloNewtons of force generated by lift and drag of those wings on that relatively lightweight joint and cause it to flex. Best answer I can give from here is bulk up the strength of major joints (bigger mass of structural elements/struts), or reengineer where those joints are (moving the fueltanks inwards to the center and using their relatively greater mass to root the wing spars, for instance) to reduce joint flexibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-12T23:53:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA note on Constructed Cockpits, and what I\u0027m looking for:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fneen5R.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022700\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fneen5R.png\u0022 width=\u0022700\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1: No. No windscreen, no protection, kerbal cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered \u0022in a cockpit\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2: Modest improvement, but no.
