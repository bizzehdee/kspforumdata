I got a heck of a lot done over the last 4 days, and Im entering the end straight, so the next time i post i should have a video or two to show it and its customization options off in greater depth, AND possibly a test release for you all to try and break and find bugs.

Granting the fact that it won\u0027t fix the lack of immersion, for the sake of actually having a way of bringing your kerbals outside the craft after launch, you could model a customization module to house a secondary hatch. \u003Cem\u003EHowever\u003C/em\u003E, I had an interesting idea while writing that last comment. A while back there was a mod created which allowed you to give the command seat an internal kerbal assignment slot in the VAB, which would then eject the kerbal and automatically strap him into the seat upon loading the craft into the simulation (aka. launch craft button).

You can now eject the kerbal from the \u0022command seat\u0022 and he/she will pop back into controllable existence just a few feet away from the chair with only some minor issues with possibly getting his helmet fused with the side of the docking bay and having contortionist-styled seizures before ripping a hole in space-time and ending our suffering once and for all.
