It has both horizontal and vertical probecores. The vertical was for launch, obviously, but I made it part of the rover for balance. The horizontal then becomes the control point for landing, take off, and return to Kerbin; at which point the engines and tanks are dumped. You can see the heatshield on the opposite end of the Klaw.

It actually worked really well. You have to jostle the module a bit to get a good surface connection, but it wasn\u0027t too difficult. To keep it from dragging the ground I just drove toward and slammed on the brakes to make the weight dive forward. This way you grab it low, and then it lifts up when the rover rocks back to normal. Then you just take off.

needed a careful balance of thrust and mass due to the unavoidable asymmetry.\u00A0 Thus, we employed a Mammoth and a Mainsail, side-by-side, with four Kickbacks and a couple of drop tanks.\u00A0 I found that during ascent, the shifting flow of fuel would make control more difficult, unless I progressively reduced the thrust output of the Mammoth to the point that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E could compensate for it.\u00A0 Fortunately this was not too difficult as I could generally make the adjustments between

recover, I figured it was a nice place to stick a drop tank we could burn off to make our Munar transfer.\u00A0 Once we were on an impact course for the Mun, the empty tank was dropped, then the engines made a fine adjustment to put us into low Munar orbit, while the tank sailed on to be safely disposed of by high velocity impact with the regolith.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224C9Mbln.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022604\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4C9Mbln.jpg\u0022

batteries were nearly drained.\u00A0 It turned out that because I had adjusted the placement of the solar panels so they would fit more flush with the surface of the bay, their center of mass was technically inside the bay walls, and thus the panels were inoperable while the bay was closed.\u00A0 Thus, the bay spent most of its time open.\u00A0 In the picture above, the craft has been met at the Mun by a refueling drone because while I had planned for enough delta-v to get to the Mun and back again, I forgot to account for the fact that the place I needed to land had a big inclination adjustment and was getting nervous about fuel levels.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forgot to get a picture of the lander coming into land, but it has a set of four Twitch engines on each outboard pylon.\u00A0 Not much thrust for this amount of mass, but good enough for the final descent into a belly landing.\u00A0 The landing was successful, a few hundred meters from the target, and it was revealed that Lizke Kerman was there with her Hitchhiker Storage Container.\u00A0 She planted a flag to mark the occasion of her rescue, and the rover undocked from the cargo bay and headed out to meet her.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NSV59vs.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NSV59vs.jpg\u0022

refueling.\u00A0 The engineering team at Kerbal Space Center flew into action, and slapped together a probe on wheels which could land itself, drive up to the lander, and refuel it from below.\u00A0

its descent on a quad of Puff monopropellant engines.\u00A0 I have no idea how two of the tires got blown up while in flight (I certainly made sure they were intact at launch) but fortunately it was built with redundant tires in mind for just such a situation.\u00A0 The two small ore tanks on top of it are simply ballast, intended to adjust the center of mass both for the sake of the launch vehicle and to make the landing controllable.\u00A0 They can have their content\u00A0jettisoned once it reaches the surface, but the extra weight helps add friction to the

lander are now grumbling about shoddy government work and lack of standardization, wondering what they are expected to do with a set of badly needed fuel they cannot actually connect to.\u00A0 Then one of them gets an idea: the rover they brought along is designed to dock with literally anything because they did not know exactly what they would have to recover.\u00A0 The rover itself has no rocket fuel tanks, but it is designed to connect to the lander\u00A0with\u00A0an arbitrary object docked\u00A0to its other end.\u00A0 They spring into action!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

to let the AGU freely pivot so it could handle the change in incline of the ramp, but it made it in.\u00A0 It hung out the back, but the rover was able to dock without losing its connection to the drone.\u00A0 From there, it was just a matter of manually transferring the fuel into the lander.\u00A0 Once the drone had fulfilled its mission, it was rolled back out, its brakes engaged, and its type changed to \u0022debris\u0022 though I expect it to still remain technically \u0022active\u0022 so long as it gets sunlight.\u00A0 The rover connected back up to the Hitchhiker Storage Container

So, once it reaches orbit, the following \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E equipped miner comes in:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gnahIxH.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/gnahIxH.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022960\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe miner isn\u0027t there for surface recoveries. It\u0027s typically used to complete mining contracts and supply an orbital refinery with ore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, once fueled up, the lander gets back to Kerbin, where the following type of spaceplane is waiting, shown below in station assembly configuration:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nHUelif.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/nHUelif.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022960\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn debris recovery configuration, it has a grabbing unit attached inside the cargo bay.
