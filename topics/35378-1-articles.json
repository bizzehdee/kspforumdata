Anyway, this thread is about my before mentioned curiosity, what have you done to get your ship safely down on your target, or to simply get there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Story:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe interplanetary transfer was as normal, getting to Jool etc, but what happened in the Joolian system was more exiting, i had ran out of fuel on my exterior nuclear engines, these were supposed to be used for inclination changes and innitial capture, I only had my landing stage engine left. I had to be really fuel efficient so I did some calculations took my time and managed to get an aero-capture followed by an encounter with Vall, I then lowered my orbit to meet up with Laythe and set up an unintentional direct crash with laythe, luckily I packed parachutes, unluckily I didn\u0027t pack a decoupler to detach my decent stage \u0027Just in case\u0027 I had an absolutely minuscule amount of fuel to set up a trajectory that would hit land and to slow me down, My kerbals landed safely, but to this day await a rescue ship. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ymv3kQd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ymv3kQd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m interested to see your feats of ingenuity below!
