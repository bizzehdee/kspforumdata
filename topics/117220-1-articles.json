When I try to put boosters on the side with radial de-couplers, for some reason, the de-coupler goes right through the side of the boosters. This is very annoying, because when it comes time for the boosters to fall away, they can\u0027t, which creates drag, and more often than not, in my experience, leads to parts overheating and exploding.Has anyone else had this issue? Take note that these de-couplers I\u0027m using are the ones that stick out from the side of the core, and are stock."},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T11:55:40Z","Content":"Sounds like you\u0027re not attaching the boosters to the decouplers correctly. Make sure the cursor is actually on the decoupler when you\u0027re attaching the booster."},{"CreatedByName":"TWazzi84","CreatedById":149046,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T20:05:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sounds like you\u0027re not attaching the boosters to the decouplers correctly.

Then just move the mouse pointer so its directly over the decoupler. \n\nIf you need to move it up/down once its attached use the offset button."},{"CreatedByName":"TWazzi84","CreatedById":149046,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T00:39:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They take a bit of getting used too, line your view up to look straight onto at the decoupler then select the booster/tank you want to attach.
