When I try to put boosters on the side with radial de-couplers, for some reason, the de-coupler goes right through the side of the boosters. This is very annoying, because when it comes time for the boosters to fall away, they can\u0027t, which creates drag, and more often than not, in my experience, leads to parts overheating and exploding.Has anyone else had this issue? Take note that these de-couplers I\u0027m using are the ones that stick out from the side of the core, and are stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T11:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you\u0027re not attaching the boosters to the decouplers correctly.
