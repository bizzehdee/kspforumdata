Thanks.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit 3: Title is misleading. I\u0026#39;ve come to realize that it\u0026#39;s not \u0022impossible\u0022 to land on Eve. I just had to lower my periapsis upon decent which would give my ship a smaller velocity going through the atmosphere. I should also have placed my heatshields on the opposite side of my ship to prevent it from flipping as it did.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHey guys I\u0026#39;ve been trying to land and return from Eve now since May this year. I\u0026#39;ve tried a few designs but none of them worked. The biggest issue with my missions to Eve were not the ascent, but rather the descent to Eve\u0026#39;s surface simply due to overheating. I\u0026#39;ve had to give up (or at least stall) my mission now since I figured it\u0026#39;s just not possible to get a suitable lander to the surface without it literally exploding. (atleast in the current update)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote: I play with Re-entry heating at 100%\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote: I play stock KSP (no mods)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote: How do I spoiler-tag images?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0026#39;s an example which occured today.

I copied it from another thread I found somewhere in the forums. It\u0026#39;s said to be able to ascent from Eve, but I haven\u0026#39;t tried yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[spoiler=Click to view][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/BeP01Cn.png[/IMG][/spoiler]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe lander in the picture weighs 138 tonnes with landing gear, parachutes and heatshields.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt also has some airbrakes for better braking through the atmosphere:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[spoiler=Click to view][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/4WnwPfF.png[/IMG][/spoiler]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is the transfer stage I used to get from Kerbin to Eve.

More than enough from Kerbin to Eve and get a circular orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe mission went fine so far and I managed to get a good orbit around Eve. I lowered my apoapsis to 95 km and lowered my periapsis to 60 km. \u003Cbr\u003E\nThus began my descent. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0026#39;s a picture at an altitude of 74 km:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[spoiler=Click to view][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/9oYPzHB.png[/IMG][/spoiler]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy ship is already burning hot and it has also tilted a little bit to the side, but I tried preventing that by using SAS to keep my ship pointing away from the heat, without success.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0026#39;s a picture of the ship at an altitude of 71.4 km\u003Cbr\u003E\n[spoiler=Click to view][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/UYSS2Kb.png[/IMG][/spoiler]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this point my Airbrakes have somehow exploded due to overheating even though their job was to prevent it...\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso why doesn\u0026#39;t my heatshields work. Like seriously...\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd notice to the left how my 4 main engines are overheating? They are placed directly behind the heatshields... there should be no way for them to overheat this way?!?!

My ship didn\u0026#39;t even get below 70 km. I just don\u0026#39;t know what I\u0026#39;m doing wrong. I though Squad fixed this with their recent \u0022Thermal Improvement\u0022 update. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd yes I know I could just reduce the heating upon re-entry but I consider that cheating.. Might aswell remove it entirely then. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSeriously though, this has been the most frustrating problem since I started this mission.

I\u0026#39;m not sure what exactly you need to do. It might be a mass distribution problem. It might also be that you need to add some wings to the lower portion for stability. I\u0026#39;m also curious whether the tilting problem happens before or after you activate the airbrakes. I seem to remember having an issue with airbrakes flipping my craft because I had them positioned too low. If you look at how the Space-X rocket handles re-entry, it has the airbrakes way at the top of the craft ([img]http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAxLzI5LzIxL3NwY3g5ODcwZGZkLjhjNTBjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/12b8c401/0da/spcx9870dfd.jpg[/img], but yours are in the middle.

I circularised at 93-95 AP - Periapse then did a burn down to 88km. Round and round and round we went, nothing happenning. Then at 77KM all hell breaks loose. Ship blows up less than 10 seconds after the heat bars appear. My best attempt was by burning radial at 82km till , at 2800m/s, i no longer had the thrust:weight ratio in my 3 LV-N to resist Eve\u0026#39;s gravity. I shut two and three off and kept the left going full bore to put me in a flat spin. That delayed blowup to 72km. Eventually I hit Alt F12 and ticked the \u0022ignore overheat\u0022 box. The atmosphere thickens so dramatically between 80 and 70km. At 71km it is thick enough for me to stop my descent with only 10 degrees AoA (was doing 2950m/sec at the time). \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis plane has no problems with Kerbin , it can also re-enter and land on Duna. It has lots of wing area (stall speed under 30m/s on Kerbin) and normally is able to skim the top of the atmosphere and avoid the worst of the heating.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut on Eve it\u0026#39;s nowhere close to surviving. I can\u0026#39;t see a few radiators in cargo bays making a difference, anyone planning to add more , needs to consider the small matter of acheiving orbit again ! And ablators aren\u0026#39;t available for aircraft , unfortunately.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tourist","CreatedById":143403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T22:36:58Z","Content":"\nI have noticed a bit of an issue getting a plane to deorbit on Eve. Ultimately though, Squad can\u0026#39;t win. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt initially creates the soup-o-sphere that makes it easy to get rockets into space, and the spaceplane builders complain the aerodynamics is borked. They tweak the aerodynamics to make spaceplanes fly more realistically, and the rocket builders complain that the game is unplayable and you can\u0026#39;t aerobrake on Jool anymore. Squad tweaks again in compromise and the spaceplane builders complain the soup-o-sphere is back and the rocket builders still complain the of flipping rockets and you still can\u0026#39;t aerobrake around Jool. It tweaks again to bring back peoples beloved Jool Aerobraking, and people complain its too deadly to de-orbit to Eve. Not to mention the constant tug of war between, more deadly re-entry please vs HELP re-entry is too deadly crowds.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would not want to be in their shoes. Its lucky they don\u0026#39;t pay too much attention to the forums, otherwise they\u0026#39;d be tearing there hair out, screaming \u0022what do these people want!!!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy answer to this is to take a philosophical approach. A change which makes something more difficult that was easier before is just a design challenge to overcome. When you couldn\u0026#39;t aerobrake around Jool anymore, the challenge was to design a craft with enough delta-V to slowdown. I landed a plane on Eve immediately after the change.... it meant I had to burn retrograde to slow down and subsequently lost control of the plane because I needed the fuel to balance the plane. This just means I need to overcome this problem. My plan (untested) involves a deorbit/slowdow stage, ablators, and a parachute on the back to flip it around the right way.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T22:50:48Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 10:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tourist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Epost-editing, making word work gooder.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
