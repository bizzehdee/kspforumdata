One jumbo in orbit isn\u0027t enough. You want two. Then three. Then six.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point you simply can\u0027t fit enough thrust directly below your payload anymore, so you start building radial stages that aren\u0027t directly under the payload (introducing shear stresses).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you go even bigger, and even the radial stages need mainsails. And herein lies the problem. The column feeding your radially attached mainsail stack starts to get low on fuel, and therefore very light. Meanwhile there\u0027s still a mainsail below it putting out just as much thrust as it did when the column was full. The rest of your payload is still struggling into the sky, but the radial mainsail stack has crazy thrust to weight at this point. The shear forces become too great and your mainsail stack rips off its decoupler. At best, your base of thrust is now asymmetrical and you go spiralling back to Kerbin. At worst, the stack slams into the rest of your rocket and creates a huge chain of explosions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait... maybe the second one was best...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, there is a solution!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStructural I-beams and structural plates are very, very strong. They don\u0027t tear apart easily. You can use them to create a \u0022thrust plate\u0022. A web of beams and panels that form a nigh-indestructible platform sitting between your payload and the stacks below it, with a big enough diameter to accomodate all of your giant asparagus stages. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttach your stacks to the bottom of the plate instead of attaching them radially to neighbouring stacks. Now they will never tear off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: this rocket lifts 750 tons (20 orange tanks) into LKO. You can see the web of girders and plates most clearly once it reaches orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gu-yH3dmGQI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pebble_garden","CreatedById":30150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T21:05:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery impressive!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CodatheSpaceFox","CreatedById":73847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T21:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuite a feat of ingenuity, I have always been impressed with structural pieces ability to take a lot of stress, but I usually avoided them for their weight.
