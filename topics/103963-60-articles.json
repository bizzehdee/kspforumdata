I also use Reshade for some slight color and contrast enhancement, as well as providing SMAA (its basically performance free, [www.reshade.me](http://www.reshade.me))."},{"CreatedByName":"Rosenthal","CreatedById":74166,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T01:08:59Z","Content":"Does anyone know the mod of the double prop motor used in OP\u0027s screens?"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T08:06:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Does anyone know the mod of the double prop motor used in OP\u0027s screens?\n\nMost likely the Retro Future pack that can be found in this thread: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84054-v0-90-v-25-Transparent-Pods-v1-2-2-for-KSP-v0-90](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84054-v0-90-v-25-Transparent-Pods-v1-2-2-for-KSP-v0-90)"},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T13:06:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks!

Or include other mods we use like EVE, AVP or Lens flares? Just so long as we include a list of what we have installed?
