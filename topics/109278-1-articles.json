I have to say, having just unlocked the entirety of the level 2 R\u0026D science nodes, I\u0027m liking it a lot better than before. I think the fundamental coherence problems are still there, and I\u0027m not going to rehash them, but overall it\u0027s a much better experience.\n\n**1.** Reentry heating needs a buff, although I will consistently lose small outside parts with little in the way of thermal mass (which is good).\n\n**2.** I was originally against the Kerbal hiring cost scheme but it works out pretty well as a limiter. Sure, you can always rescue a few of them and get paid doing it, but in practice it tends to limit the crews I have available. The same goes for Kerbal classes; dumb as they seem on the surface, you tend to need more Kerbals, especially with multiple Mobile Labs running. Bonus there. I rescued seven Kerbals early on and buy a few more as needed now.\n\n**3.** The World\u0027s First contracts are awesome and make the game feel much less grindy. With the building paywalls brought down to reasonable levels and the player able to get money and rep by simply doing things, contracts become much more meaningful because you can pick and choose them. Granted, the idiocy of rejecting a ton of contracts is still there, and contracts should really be organized and generated per-body, *and* the generation scheme still leaves much to be desired (Explore Dres before Explore Duna? KSP plz...), but overall things are much better.\n\n**4.** Let\u0027s not get into what might be better for science, the current tech tree is better and makes at least a bit of sense now; the progression seems more natural.\n\n**5.** The parts rebalance has been awesome in general. Quite happy with the stock layout.\n\n**5a.** We need more LF tanks, or that tweakable Porkjet just put out. Seriously, why the hell can\u0027t I choose the type of tank I have? All my nuclear tugs need to be made from Mk3 parts? ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**5b.** The new Mobile Lab owns, and it\u0027s pretty cheaty as well. Basically the best way I can advise using this is to send out two or three as soon as you can *loaded up with the exact same science the others have*. I have returned tons of science to KSC from researching the exact same solar orbit reports in multiple labs. The trick is to never send the reports back to KSC, just research them and ignore the fact that you have them.\n\n**5c.** The materials bay is still stupid. Seriously, this is pretty much the one thing left in KSP that can make me incredibly angry for no reason. I\u0027ve worked my way through and inured myself to tons of little bugs but that one part is just the wrong shape and size for literally every craft I build. It\u0027s completely unwieldy and stupid.\n\nSo ... yeah. Much better than 0.90 for being what it is.\n\n(The game I\u0027m playing right now has some mods, mainly informational or to make things less stupid, and I\u0027d be playing Sandbox with most of them too (c\u0027mon, I\u0027m a modder):\n\nA mod I wrote to display the node ejection angle next to the node, Enhanced Navball (\u003C3 this), Porkjet\u0027s FSFuelSwitch (includes Firespitter), For Science, Kerbal Engineer, Kerbal Renamer, Science Alert, TAC Fuel Balancer, Tank Lock, Texture Replacer, Thermal Helper, and Kerbal Alarm Clock.)"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T22:41:56Z","Content":"A few of my thoughts (mostly the complaints), playing on a modified hard setting\n\n1. Having building costs increased by the PENALTIES slider seems wrong, and is a big source of the grindiness of hard mode. The costs to unlock parts or build rockets don\u0027t increase, so why should the cost of buildings?\n\n2. The Kerbin survey missions need more target areas that are actually within reach of the basic jet engine, at least early on. They\u0027re all around 18km-20km altitude, which it can\u0027t do without rockets.\n\n3. I like the new smaller size of the goo experiment, but I agree with regex that the materials experiment is awkward and annoying to use. If it was just half of its current height, it would be much better. Maybe if it was scaled down to probe size (like an octo or hex) that would be even better.\n\n4. Tourist contracts have never looked appealing. The ones in the Kerbin area pay peanuts, and the more lucrative ones start asking for too many requirements. Also, they tend to involve too many Kerbals. Also, early on we lack any good way of bringing them that doesn\u0027t just look ridiculous.\n\n5. The tech tree has felt mostly good, but there are a few things that seem out of place. The rockomax decoupler is in an earlier tier than any of the other 2.5m parts. Similarly the parachutes and heat shield that you would use on a 2.5m capsule are in an earlier tier than those capsules. The basic ladder rungs should really be in an early tier, probably in with the first lander legs or airplane landing gear (it\u0027s mostly needed for getting back into airplanes on survey missions).\n\n6. I like the way the Kerbal professions have turned out. It\u0027s cool to actually have reasons to bring 3\u002B of them on a mission."},{"CreatedByName":"BDelacroix","CreatedById":121050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T22:46:14Z","Content":"I stick the mat bay inside the service bay.

You might pay for the first handful of helpers, but the work of fetching them from wherever they are stranded starts looking worth the trouble, as hiring costs increase. Stuff getting more expensive, and other kinds of resource scarcity leads to (hopefully interesting) choices. I wrote in one of the long \u0027overhaul everything\u0027 threads, about XCOM: Enemy Unknown gameplay choices: you would like to do three different things on any given turn, but, you only have enough resources to do two... or one. If you can\u0027t \u0027have it all,\u0027 you need to think, plan and choose what\u0027s important. \n\nDittos underlining \u0022World\u0027s First\u0022 contracts. It\u0027s neat to get out there and do stuff, and be rewarded for these discoveries or achievements, without \u0027waiting for instructions.\u0027 I don\u0027t think it can be extended to repetitive contract types, however, without some additional thought about exploits: One could simply spam satellites around the highest-paying planet or moon, to print funds. I think repeatable contracts need to be randomly assigned... while the current contract scheme is in place.\n\nSpeaking of exploits... 5b about multiple mobile labs. You could rationalize this as a \u0027space program manager,\u0027 putting your scientists in competition with each other on the same samples, I suppose, and they came up with new discoveries independently. But, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s good to leave it that way, given what I just wrote about resource scarcity pushing (hopefully) interesting gameplay choices on the player. I will try to un-read that, lol.\n\nTech tree is much better, but still needs balance work. Thanks to the code overhaul, it\u0027s easier to move stuff around. But gallons of virtual ink are and will be spilled, probably forever, agonizing over how the stock parts could be organized. \n\nAction groups: A new player wouldn\u0027t know what they were missing out on, if they started out in career mode. I think giving access to 2 to start with would be helpful both as a sample of a game feature and its utility. (That logic could be extended to any other game feature that is completely un-available to the starting tier... I don\u0027t think it applies equally to everything, needs thought on a case-by-case basis.)\n\nI think the service bays are neat. Just the right size for snack storage.

I\u0027ve been playing science mode almost exclusively since science was introduced since I wasn\u0027t a fan of career mode at first.\n\nI was able to unlock the whole tech tree only leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI three times: once for an initial Duna survey that left a science lab in Duna orbit and 2 landers to grab science and return, again for cheap probe to land on Gilly for a contact, and finally another mission to Duna to drop a science lab base on the poles. The last two tiers were mostly obtained by grinding science from those two labs and another one in Munar orbit.\n\nI never really touched the tourism missions or the ones that ask you to perform science/evas on different locations, the payout is just too low. Satellite missions are a great way to grab cash though: a 7,000 credit rocket can easily get you any contract in Kerbin\u0027s SOI. \u0022Build a space station\u0022 or \u0022build a base\u0022 contracts have huge payouts and you can slap a science lab on those to grind science later in the game.\n\nCash really never seemed to be an issue early on, because when you\u0027re in Kerbin\u0027s SOI you rarely spend more than 30K on a rocket. Once you start using Mainsails the cost increases, and once you\u0027re using SLS parts you\u0027re easily pushing 100k per rocket, which means you have to pile on contracts to make a profit. I only had to really grind for cash a few times for expensive building upgrades (like over two million to upgrade the R\u0026D building.\n\nOne cool thing was that I often found myself sending 3 Kerbals on missions at a time, something there was never really incentive to do before. Now, it helps to have Pilots and Scientists on most missions, although Engineers seem less useful. I mainly tossed scientists onto as many missions as possible to level them up for science grinding later in the game.\n\nOverall, I\u0027m glad I forced myself to play through career, but I don\u0027t see myself doing it again soon. I\u0027m glad there\u0027s finally a use for the science lab and incentive to build bases and space stations in stock. But since it\u0027s so easy to just grind science to grab the super expensive tech nodes, there\u0027s really no reason to go anywhere beyond Duna in career.

The 0.90 hard career was superior to the 1.0.x career in many ways.\n\nThe rescue kerbal contracts, once fun, are now spam and annoying. Am I to believe I need to research battery tech when other Kerbal space agencies have already apparently explored the Kerbol system? And I have no choice but to \u0022kidnap\u0022 these Kerbals because a new hire cost a ridiculous amount.\n\nMy biggest problem is the cost of Kerbals.

This isn\u0027t congruent AT ALL with any other cost in the game.\n\nFrom another thread:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E All I can say is that the price of a Kerbal does not correlate with the price of spacecraft hardware.

If I need quick cash I plant a flag or two on the Mun or Minmus, which also gets my Kerbals experience. Meanwhile, the big outside-of-Kerbin-SOI contracts fund the long-term stuff.\nSo basically, for me, it boiled down to setting some goals (get some Duna infrastructure going, which will fund Dres and Jool infrastructure) and getting out of Kerbin SOI where the pay is much better.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Overall, I\u0027m glad I forced myself to play through career, but I don\u0027t see myself doing it again soon.

With the building paywalls brought down to reasonable levels and the player able to get money and rep by simply doing things, contracts become much more meaningful because you can pick and choose them. Granted, the idiocy of rejecting a ton of contracts is still there, and contracts should really be organized and generated per-body, *and* the generation scheme still leaves much to be desired (Explore Dres before Explore Duna? KSP plz...), but overall things are much better.\n\nI would like to add something here.\n\nHow about instead of getting contracted to build I.E. a Spacestation around Kerbin over and over again, to expand id. First, get a contract to build a hub with a couple of Docking ports, then send a Solar-Array up, then the Lab and so on. Same goes for Bases...
