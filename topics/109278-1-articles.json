It\u0027s as if you can only do 1 thing, and follow 1 path. I tried to deviate from that path, and it was only a matter of time before I got short on cash or science.

Once you start using Mainsails the cost increases, and once you\u0027re using SLS parts you\u0027re easily pushing 100k per rocket, which means you have to pile on contracts to make a profit. I only had to really grind for cash a few times for expensive building upgrades (like over two million to upgrade the R\u0026amp;D building.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EPretty much every one of my launches now (level 2 R\u0026amp;D building) involves a Mainsail, lol. The way I see it, you need to get out there and pile on a bunch of related contracts while you\u0027re at it. My current Duna mission involves a station (which I wanted to put there anyway, got a contract for it so I got ~paid~), an Ike lander (explore contract \u002B another Ike contract), a Duna lander (four contracts), and two tugs able to push payload out there on a rotating schedule. If I need quick cash I plant a flag or two on the Mun or Minmus, which also gets my Kerbals experience. Meanwhile, the big outside-of-Kerbin-SOI contracts fund the long-term stuff.\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, for me, it boiled down to setting some goals (get some Duna infrastructure going, which will fund Dres and Jool infrastructure) and getting out of Kerbin SOI where the pay is much better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jonboy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jonboy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOverall, I\u0027m glad I forced myself to play through career, but I don\u0027t see myself doing it again soon. I\u0027m glad there\u0027s finally a use for the science lab and incentive to build bases and space stations in stock. But since it\u0027s so easy to just grind science to grab the super expensive tech nodes, there\u0027s really no reason to go anywhere beyond Duna in career. I feel like without the labs, I would definitely have been forced to do Jool grand tour to unlock the last two tiers, which would have been cool.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EAfter a certain point it\u0027s just sandbox mode.
