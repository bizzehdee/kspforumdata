SSTU simply uses these mission flags, the same as the stock parts.\n\nIf you are looking to add flags to parts that don\u0027t normally have them -- no, that is not something SSTU can do, but there are other mods that offer such functionality (sorry, don\u0027t know any on the top of my head)."},{"CreatedByName":"RaiderMan","CreatedById":180001,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-17T22:17:09Z","Content":"how do I add flags to the stock game?"},{"CreatedByName":"DriftedCougar","CreatedById":197372,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-18T09:37:52Z","Content":"go to the flags folder in the squad folder in gamedata, thre you can copy flags in.

I have installed SSTU part mod, and it all looks well....until...i turn on the lights and / or extend some (not all) solar panels. The moment i hit the lights, i see the graphics flicker twice, my sunflare dissapears and i get 2 error messages in console. It needs to be noted that switching to tracking station and then loading the ship again does seem to reset the problem and my flare is back.  It happens with all the command modules, it also happens when i decouple a command pod from its service bay and when extending some (not all) solar panels.  Granted my main save is 149 mod save, so i tried recreating it in a clean 1.6.1 install with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, RSSVE and the usual visuals and it happened there too.

Or just flip the entire part around, and use the \u0027invert engines\u0027 button in the right-click menu.  Either should work ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nEdit:  Yes -- that sounds correct.  Originally the part was intended like the IC on the Saturn rockets, where it stayed attached to the \u0027upper\u0027 stage and was used as ullage, and then was discarded before/as engines were lit.  So you would want the opposite staging setup to make the ISDC stick to the \u0027lower\u0027 stage.  Can still use the \u0027invert engines\u0027 option if you would like, so that the separation motors push the lower stage away from the upper.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-18T22:18:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2019 10:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"RaiderMan","CreatedById":180001,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-18T22:18:19Z","Content":"sure, I see how it is now..if that dont work..\u0027wait..I\u0027m upside down!\u0027 -insert empire strikes back c3po rants at chewbacca here- lol!"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-18T22:39:25Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)\n\nI had a report that EngineLight is acting oddly with the SSTU SRBs.
