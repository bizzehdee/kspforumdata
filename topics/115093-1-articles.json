I\u0027m at the point where completing these is a no Brainer but I\u0027m looking to be a little more precise and effecient, specifically launching at KSC at the correct time when the AN is 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I\u0027m waiting for the contract satellite orbit to be directly over KSC by eyeballing it to limit the amount of correction burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m looking for is the math equation or data variable I can use to know what time to launch instead of eyeballing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have mechjeb and KER installed so plenty of data just not sure which ones I need to use to make the most efficient launch possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESample satellite orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApoapsis: 20.144km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeriapsis: 12.349km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInclination: 28.7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELongitude of ascending node: 248.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArgument of Periapsis: 53.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T07:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith KER, I\u0027d suggest in the KER settings to enable the Longitude of AN in the orbital display, it will change while your vessel is in prelaunch as the KSC sidereal direction. Of course we need to launch when that value matches the assigned LAN (or the reverse for a opposite inclination).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bball617","CreatedById":147485,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T18:37:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Diomedea thx for the reply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately waiting to launch when the LAN value from KER at the launchpad matches the LAN of the contract satellite orbit(248.8) does not result in launching with the same orbit as the contract. KSC is actually far from underneath the orbit when the LAN at launch is = 248.8 and the orbit ends up with a very high AN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on me eyeballing it. In order to launch with the correct orbit and a close to 0 AN I need to launch when these values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELAN = 158/338\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAngle of Prograde = 344/164 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly there is some math equation that I\u0027m needing in order to figure it out why the values directly above result in a launch that matches the contract orbit from my OP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T19:13:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo look up KSPTOT, its mission planner includes a launch window calculator that defaults to KSC\u0027s location (configurable) and you just plug in the orbit you want to launch into and it\u0027ll give you a list of launch times and azimuth for a given time range\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bball617","CreatedById":147485,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T05:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI took a look at KSPTOT. Thats a little more complicated than I think I want to get.
