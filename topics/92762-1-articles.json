It appears only in a specific coordinate system. You can think of it as being there to make physics consistent between different coordinate systems. Funamentally, gravity works the same way, but that\u0027s a much deeper topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECentrifugal force is always there if your coordinate system rotates. For example, if you track position of the orbiting ship relative to Earth, which rotates, you\u0027ll have to add centrifugal force in. Similarly, you can compute physics of the orbiting ship in polar coordinates. That will also require you to add centrifugal force to the ship. I seem to recall KSP taking centrifugal into account, but I don\u0027t remember why. It\u0027s been a while since I looked at the game\u0027s code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if you look at an orbiting ship from perspective of an inertial coordinate system, in which Earth appears to spin at its own speed, and orbital ship at its speed, you\u0027ll note that no forces other than gravity are acting on the ship. As a result the space ship constantly accelerates towards the center of the planet. It just keeps missing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T18:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf by centrifugal force you mean the force of acceleration due to rotation...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, orbits only exist because of that.
