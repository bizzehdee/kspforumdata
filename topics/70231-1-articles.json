For non-super user installation, uncompress the file in ~, for super user installation (not that that would generally happen being a steam distributed app) uncompress the file in /usr. I think this might be a nice thing to include in the package, perhaps with an itty-bitty script to put them in place. This might work better as a shar archive, so that a user could just run it from the install dir and have the files copied out to the real world. I don\u0027t know where the icon came from, but the text files are my original work and they are free to use for any purpose with no licensing or restrictions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byg6q2iWac-iVTVXR3pucFc3bFE/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETHE FILE\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
