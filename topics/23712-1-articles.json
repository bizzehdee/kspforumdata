However I have noticed something on MechJeb 2.0 stats. The mechjeb stats tab says I took 7000 delta-v to get to orbit. I only had 1200 delta-v in the rocket stage though. Is this normal? Or do I need to seriously rethink how I design space planes? Basically what happened is I burned a lot of regular fuel and kicked in the rockets for only the last 1200 or so. So maybe the jeb readout is high because it assumed I used oxidizer with that fuel? I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the plane in question. It has the Kerbal Crew tank designed by someone (I forget at the moment) that seats 6 kerbals.

Because I read somewhere on these forums that the advantage of space planes is that they use relatively less fuel and are entirely reusable. I get the reusable part but as far as I can tell they consume TONS of delta v. (how did you make the real delta?

Yes, you required a lot of delta-v, but the engines delivering that delta-v were extremely fuel-efficient jet engines.

So, if you\u0027re aimed right at it and your heading is 090 or 270, you\u0027re in position and on-heading. To help you get lined up, make some little rovers with unmanned pods and park them just off each end of the runway, and drive another one or two a few km west of the runway, staying in line with it. Their location markers on the screen gives you a great visual reference for getting lined up even before you can see the pavement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scottiths","CreatedById":57116,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T19:51:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the rover Idea...
