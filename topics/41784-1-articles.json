All individual parts work (the miner, the transporter, the shuttle, the refueling station), for one small thing: I cannot dock them together... First I tried the KAS (Kerbal Atachment System) mod to do it with the winch cables, this worked fine until with the third run the game decided that when the winch cable is connected with the shuttle, the base with the winch on it will start doing cartwheels. I have been looking for three days for solutions, can\u0027t find any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I thought of a robotic arm with a docking port. But the Robotics pack hasn\u0027t been updated after version 0.19. I did find the MagicSmokeIndustries adjustable sliding plate. But whenever I line thatone up with a docking port the sliding plates become some sort of exploding spring, demolishing everything attached to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I use only stock parts everything is rigid, so the heights have to be exact, on Kerbin this is not that hard to do: I\u0027m not changing any weights in the vehicles and the ground is level. But on the moon it is a lot harder because of the different gravity, the transporter truck being empty/full (36t weight difference), and I don\u0027t like spending another week moving a dockingport a couple of millimeters, send the entire truck to the moon, find out it doesn\u0027t fit, start over again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is: Is it possible to make a docking system for land based vehicles that is adjustable? and: How do the people who use the Kethane mod normally connect their different part to transfer fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalled mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane mining\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagicSmokeIndustries (rotating plate and sliding rail)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERomfarer Lazors\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETacFuelBalancer\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrKicker","CreatedById":77424,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T18:50:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would do is use kas cables, put a winch on your ship, then on the other end put your docking port. When you get close enuf for there to be magnetic pull.

When you 1st connect the cable, do it in undocked mode. Then create some slack in the cable through some combination of extending, releasing, or moving the vehicles closer together. Then reconnect in docked mode. Also, F5 beforehand in case anything goes haywire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to docking vehicles, the KAS trick MrKIcker described is great, provided you remember to use UNDOCKED mode to avoid the cartwheel issue and the angle of pull isn\u0027t such that your vehicles will break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother trick is to use the Damned Robotics hydraulic cylinders or similar parts. That lets you raise and lower a vehicle however much you want, instead of all or nothing like landing gear legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet another trick I\u0027ve seen used (but have never done myself) is use top-mounted docking ports. The docking port on 1 vehicle is on top of the body facing up while the port of the other is on a long wobbly boom facing down. The idea here is that if the height difference isn\u0027t too much, the magnetic attraction will pull the port on the boom down to meet that on the other vehicle. You could also have the boom attached via a Damned Robotics hinge to make sure it\u0027s at the right height relative to the other vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy own personal preference, however, is to NOT dock anything on the surface. Instead, my Kethane refinery is in orbit. Ships land, drill, and fill up their Kethane tanks, then fly up to the refinery where the docking takes place. Refining to LFO is more efficient in orbit, although having to lift the drills each time detracts from that. But that\u0027s part of the reason why I only exploit Kethane on low-gravity moons. So, Gilly, Minmus, Ike, and Bop are the places to drill.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tabu_niw","CreatedById":68979,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T11:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/robotic-arms-pack/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERobotic Arms pack\u003C/a\u003E.
