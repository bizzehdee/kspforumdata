Have the hub models be blank hubs with flat spots for the ports, and use standard stand-alone docking port models.\u00A0 Have -separate- additional models that are nothing but a set of docking-port transforms (a control transform and a node transform, they have to be oriented differently), one for each docking port number (e.g. DockTransform1 in one model, DockTransform2 in another model).\u00A0 Use the new SUBMODEL capability in the SSTU_MODEL setup to add the docking ports, docking-transforms, and station module part into a single welded model.\u00A0 This makes the modeling end of things easier and allows for compatibility with swapping in new docking port models, but greatly increases the complexity of the config/model-definition setup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor #1 there is no port swapping.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo swap models for #2 you would edit the SUBMODEL nodes to swap in your docking port of choice and reposition the docking transform models according to the new docking ports setup.\u00A0 The only limitation to the ports used would be that of the flat spots on the hub; so for your 0.9375 you would still have to use the flat for 1.25m (or create and add an adapter through another SUBMODEL).\u00A0 This option also makes it easier to integrate into the module-switch setup as you could re-use many of the same docking port module definitions for the different hubs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll probably go with #2 as it will just be more configurable in the long run, and makes dealing with the modeling end of things easier (good for me, I would rather have complex configs and easier modeling).\u00A0 Who knows, maybe I\u0027ll even redo my docking ports at some point and want to be able to swap them in without redoing the whole model \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T00:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have a thrust curve to share for the SRBs?

its like building a house out of already rotten timber... just a bad idea and only going to cause more problems later when you have to rip it all out and rebuild it from the ground up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts really looking like I\u0027m going to have to ditch the ModuleSwitch functionality entirely.\u00A0 It won\u0027t work with my current modules setup and will likely have other as-yet-unforeseen/untested compatibility issues with other mods\u0027 modules.\u00A0 Sadly this leaves the modular station parts as being... well... not very modular.\u00A0 Each \u0027core\u0027 variant would have to be its own distinct part (to enable the different core module functions; e.g. lab vs. hab; or at least two variants for the module setup while still allowing swapping of the \u0027CORE\u0027 model).\u00A0 Also could not be any optional docking ports; it can either have ports on all variants or not at all, the only possibility would be to allow for switching the models around with custom transform repositioning.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWould also mean that docking hubs could not have optional ports on them; they would come with a preset number of ports and your only option would be to change the models (so no option of blank nodes and thus no ability to use welding docking ports with the hubs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUghh... perhaps I should just give up in my crusade to lower part-count.\u00A0 I\u0027m quite sick of fighting with the stock code (and lack of available source) and the stock mentality of \u0027just add more parts!\u0027; at this point it is only making me bitter and resentful, which is not at all conductive to me being productive.\u00A0 Its hard to get motivated about doing something when you know it will be a long, drawn out, painful battle the entire way with little to show for it in the end.\u00A0 This isn\u0027t even touching on the fact that there still isn\u0027t a working wheel solution available even months after the 1.1 release, but if I\u0027m not doing integrated/modular parts I suppose that is a bit of a moot point anyway (though it will still prevent me from doing any sort of wheel/landing legs; I refuse to touch the pile of @#$^ that is the current Unity wheel system).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly that doesn\u0027t leave me much in the way of things to actually do for modding; most of the part concepts that I have, at a single-part-setup level, have already been done in other mods, and I don\u0027t really feel like doing a bunch of models and textures just to have them in \u0027my style\u0027.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSorry if that sounded like a bit of a whine; merely trying to express a bit of my frustration before it forces me to just walk away.\u00A0 Its not what I want to do, but obviously I have some re-evaluation to do concerning my goals for the mod and plans for future parts/modules if I\u0027m going to continue working on it -- I cannot simply keep marching along and putting up with the stock incompatibilities and assumptions they make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m going to take the next few days to rethink the mod a bit, re-evaluate the goals and intent, and try to think of a better way to to handle things moving forward.\u00A0 If I don\u0027t like what I come up with I\u0027ll likely just take a break until 1.2 is ready and see if the stock code situation has improved at all (they are finally taking optimization seriously, so there might be some hope for better performance in the future; though by the nature of the system the best they can hope for is O(n)... which is still far better than the O(n^2) to O(n^n) that it currently operates as).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222686068\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022117090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469134603\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264903\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Domfluff\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, Domfluff said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome bug reports (none of these are show-stopping):\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Enable parachute staging\u0022 works fine, but doesn\u0027t appear on the staging track.
