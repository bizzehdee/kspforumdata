So, i first downloaded Interstellar extended, to see it\u0027s many massive radiators, receivers and other things i propably wont use. I was interested in the Warp Drive. I also have Roverdude\u0027s warp drive mod. Still, i\u0027d love to see more warp drive mods, as i plan on making big colonising crafts to conquer those new systems.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQueue next issue: kerbal transport. As much as i love designing big ships, i realised that transporting kerbals to my ever-growing colonies is not an option all of the time. Money and logistics of such operations can be too much. So, if anyone could point me towards a mod that would allow my kerbal to multiply in numbers in their bases, (preferably compatible with CTT\u0027s \u0022colonization\u0022 node in 1.2.2) i\u0027d be greatful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\no7\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalBuzzsaw","CreatedById":158329,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-22T10:51:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCivilan Population, tho I dont know if it\u0027s 1.2 ready\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
