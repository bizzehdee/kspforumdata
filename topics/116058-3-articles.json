One problem I experienced KerbalGalaxy is that the Delta V for reaching planets on the opposite site of the galaxy becomes extremely high as long. This should be less of a problem with galaxtic neighbourhoud as the start are more or less going in the same direction, which means you need less Delta V and time to travel to them.\n\n**Edited

To give specifics for some planets packs\n\nI will contact the developers of each mod I want to add,\n\nthey will have a limited freedom of choice between:\n\n- having stock clones or not\n\n- which type of star\n\nI will not mix different mods in the same system unless they were explicitly designed to be used together\n\nalso\n\nI will not make any changes to the stock system itself, any change will be loaded onto a different system\n\nthese are core features of this mod, so the standard download will follow these rules. but it will be possible to adjust it to everyone\u0027s taste with few custom MM patches\n\n\u003E Outer Planets Mod and Trans-Keptunian - I would pair these together around their own star. Said system would have a scarcity of inner planets, but that itself adds some interest.\n\nI\u0027ve already got the blessing from Capt on the version of the system with the stock clones, so I\u0027ll go with that.\n\nThat said, the configs will be written in a way that will allow the user to customize their install pretty easily:\n\nyou don\u0027t want stock clones? you can just go into GameData/GalacticNeighborhood/PlanetSystems/OPMSystem/Configs\n\nand delete \u0022OPM\\_StockClones.cfg\u0022\n\nmerging two systems will be very easy as well:\n\njust use a mm config like this\n\n\u003E \n\u003E @Kopernicus:FINAL  \n\u003E {  \n\u003E  @Body,\\*  \n\u003E  {  \n\u003E  @Orbit:HAS[#referenceBody[[B][COLOR=#ff0000]old\\_STAR[/COLOR][/B]]]  \n\u003E  {  \n\u003E  @referenceBody = [B][COLOR=#008000]new\\_STAR[/COLOR][/B]  \n\u003E  }  \n\u003E  }  \n\u003E }\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nso there will be a lot of room for everyone\u0027s taste ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E Real Solar System - Including the real Sun and planets as another star the player can visit would be cool. Something like Venus or even Earth would make a serious end-game challenge for the Kerbals. The needed solar SOI may be tricky though.\n\nRSS cfgs sadly are not written in a way that allow easy integration but I could probably work around that.\n\nthe biggest problem is that RSS would require different parts (engines, tanks etc) so it would either be too easy on the stock-alike planets or too difficult on the Real size ones.\n\nthat said, I have half an idea of recreating a system that looks like RSS but with KSP sizes. and that will fit in nicely with the other systems, it will get it\u0027s star called \u0022Sol\u0022, the 8 planets plus some well known rock here and there\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T15:51:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 03:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sigma88**"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T18:09:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s a really nice approach, having all the stars close together in wide orbits around a galactic centre. Presumably by ensuring the orbital periods are similar the stars will stay close together over relevant timescales. I\u0027ll probably look into it a bit more myself and see how the travel times would compare with my own concept for a similar goal.\n\u003E As for how to handle different planet packs, I\u0027m not sure cloning the stock planets is ideal, it would feel a bit odd for me. Many planet packs will stand quite well on their own, others could be grouped together, and still others might remain in the stock system.

Said system would have a scarcity of inner planets, but that itself adds some interest.\n\u003E \n\u003E New Horizons - I think this would stand rather well by itself, minus the stock planets, since it has a lot of additional planets and moons of its own. A few moons would be left parentless, they could be either promoted to planets or relocated.\n\u003E \n\u003E Alternis Kerbol Reloaded - I would leave this to rearrange the Kerbol system, since it focusses on rearranging it and doesn\u0027t add many new bodies like New Horizons does. It does overhaul some of the stock bodies, so perhaps their original stock versions could be relocated to another system such as the OPM\u002BTrans Kep one.\n\u003E \n\u003E Asclepius - Keep it as an addition in the Kerbol system.\n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbol Plus - Could be tricky, since it has a lot of extra moons for stock planets. If it stays in the Kerbol system you\u0027ll want a custom config to combine it with Alternis when both are installed. If it\u0027s made its own system you need to decide what to do with the planetless moons.\n\u003E \n\u003E Any planet pack that includes stars - Simple enough, give the stars new positions complete with their retinues of planets.\n\u003E \n\u003E Real Solar System - Including the real Sun and planets as another star the player can visit would be cool. Something like Venus or even Earth would make a serious end-game challenge for the Kerbals.
