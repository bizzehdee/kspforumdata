After that, your next best step would probably be to get into orbit and get orbital data. You can get EVA science over each biome from orbit. Once you get that science, you can try flying small rockets to the shores, grasslands, and highlands that are immediately to the west of the KSC (and don\u0027t forget the water!). You can also drop a pod from orbit onto the desert, which is a pretty large target as well. If you\u0027re up for it, you can do the same for either of the two polar regions as well.
