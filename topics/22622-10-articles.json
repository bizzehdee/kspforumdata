Not terribly sure what the stats for this will end up being, possibly double stock Ion thrust at the cost of double the power requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe replacement Resistojet model is underway, and its a lot longer than the existing one, mainly due to a more accurate nozzle shape. Not that any of these are terribly realistic purely down to how big they are, if any realistic configs were made for these I\u0027d argue for shrinking them to at least 50% of their current size.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T08:09:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDamn ur amazing with modeling/texturing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hoojiwana","CreatedById":57079,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T20:39:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StainX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022StainX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDamn ur amazing with modeling/texturing!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!

Actually, NASA planned to use a linear aerospike for an SSTO, and (especially IRL) you\u0027ll need a high Isp to do that. So my suggestion is to change the Isp of the Cutter to about the same as the toroidal aerospike, but weighing more and with more thrust. You could actually balance it off of the LV-T30 - just add weight and Isp, and maybe reduce thrust a little. 340 vac Isp is unrealistic for an aerospike.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T14:15:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMan, this IS the next KSPX.
