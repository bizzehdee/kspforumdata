I will grab a log output if you think it might be useful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems that the horizontal ailerons don\u0027t seem to work right. They seem to work ok when placed vertical as a rudder. By not working right, i mean I can barely detect any visual movement in them, and can get almost no vertical control form them. I have been forced to use canards to have any vertical control at all. It is odd since when used as a rudder they seem to work ok. Oh and I have used NEAR in the past and the only time I have experienced something like this with it is with surface controls from a mod. Which never really bothered me since I always had the stock ones to fall back on. But now it would seem the stock one doesn\u0027t work. I guess what I am wondering did the incorporation of the Spaceplane Plus mod break some references in the NEAR code?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBY the way I am referring to these parts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oBlb0KF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oBlb0KF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xenro66\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xenro66\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EReporting a problem. NEAR is disabling the SP\u002B control surfaces completely. They\u0027re just inert and won\u0027t move.
