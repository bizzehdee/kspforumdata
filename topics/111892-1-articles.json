Something that I\u0027ve noticed is that people are more likely to download and try a mod if it\u0027s fairly specific in what it tries to do, rather than being a huge parts pack that fills every tab in the VAB with loads of new parts. So with that in mind, I thought I\u0027d mention here what this pack will try to do, and why it doesn\u0027t belong in my other existing mods. \n\nI don\u0027t get as much time to work on modding as I did back in the fall/winter, however the speed at which I was making things back then was partly driven by a desire to get as much as I could done, before having more demands on my time. So this probably will develop a bit more slowly. \n\nTentatively: **Kerbal Exploration Technologies**\n\nI\u0027m still looking around to make sure the name isn\u0027t overlapping too badly with anything else out there. It looks like the \u0022USI Exploration Pack\u0022 may have been called the \u0022Kerbal Exploration Pack\u0022 once upon a time, but it\u0027s different enough now that this might be OK. Nothing else really came up on a quick google search though.\n\n**Intended Purpose**\n\nI have kept a list of a lot of the requests for parts that were made on my other mod threads. A lot of them are great ideas, and I realized that some of them would fit better in a new pack. Specifically:\n\n- Alternate sizes, and intermediate configurations of command pods (lander cans, and capsules).\n- Long ladders (both fixed, and deployable)\n- Larger service bays\n- Additional sizes of lander legs (maybe?) \\*\n- (and possibly others)\n\n\\* Not happening before Unity 5 KSP is out, if at all, since that will likely break all types of landing gear\n\nOriginally I started thinking about a pod-only pack, but realized that service bays and ladders work well with the idea of Munar transportation, and landers. \n\n**How it fits in**\n\nSo, here\u0027s a quick run-down of the focus of my other mods, and where this fits in:\n\n- [SpaceY Heavy Lifters](https://goo.gl/R0ZETO) (Large 5m parts, associated accessories, and a spread of SRBs. Stuff to get you to space.)\n- [Modular Rocket Systems](https://goo.gl/qmZQ0W) (Mostly stock-alike parts filling in gaps in stock line-up, and providing a few alternatives to stock items.)\n- [Color Coded Canisters](https://goo.gl/uxZHPx) (Visual replacement for stock rocket fuel tanks, color coding the end-caps based on diameter, while prettying them up a little.)\n- [Fuel Tanks Plus](https://goo.gl/Xlljrw) (Additional sizes and visual styles of fuel tanks, extending the style established in CCC.)\n- [0-Point Inline Fairings](https://goo.gl/mCJQZ9) (fairings only, and doesn\u0027t currently shield anything in new stock aerodynamics.)\n\nThe idea is basically that SpaceY is focused on adding 5m parts and enough accessories to make 5m useful, and back-fill those parts that are missing in 3.75m. MRS is already pretty huge and is an eclectic mix of things, usually individual unique ideas that fill specific niches. \n\nSince pods can be a big task on their own, and ladders and service bays can be logically associated with them, this seemed like a nice grouping that will work nicely alongside the other mods, and also be a manageable size. And some people might want what this offers while having no interest in my other packs, and that\u0027s fine too.\n\n**Getting started**\n\nSo here\u0027s what I\u0027m thinking so far, at least to start:\n\n- 2.5m 3-man lander can, octagonal, similar in concept to Mk1 Lander Can.\n- 1.25m 2-man capsule. Gemini-like capsules already exist in other mods, so I was thinking maybe something with the Kerbals seated front-and-rear, but I\u0027m not married to this idea. Still debating it. But it would be nice to have an option between the Mk1 and Mk1-2 capsules in stock.\n- Fixed ladders, probably 2 or 3 lengths. Maybe 1m, 2m, and 4m.\n- A very long deployable ladder, maybe 1.5x or 2x the length of the longer stock ladder.\n- Longer service bays, possibly 1.5x to 1.75x the length of the stock models.\n- 3.75m service bay.\n\nI\u0027m certainly interested in collecting more ideas, but I don\u0027t want the parts list to explode out of control. At least not while I still haven\u0027t made the above yet. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n![NgMBaTm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NgMBaTm.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T23:00:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 11:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NecroBones**"},{"CreatedByName":"MarcAlain","CreatedById":141219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T23:10:36Z","Content":"I wouldn\u0027t waste time with a 2 person pod.

That or whatever might actually work without have huge, top heavy landers (I\u0027ll admit I\u0027m thinking of scaled up kerbol system mods with stock parts, so not hyper-critical).\n\nTwo, It would be cool, perhaps for a 3.75m service bay to think of it beneath a lander/hab of some kind, perhaps with rover garage functionality.

Kind of like the Multispectral Scanner from DMagic\u0027s parts? Or maybe one that attaches radially?

It\u0027s definitely giving me things to think about. A few notes though:\n\nFor 3.75m pods, there are two main options I\u0027m aware of already: [Near Future Spacecraft](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-1-02-Near-Future-Technologies-%28NFSolar-NFSpacecraft-NFConstruction-hotfixed%29), and [Taurus HCV](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75074-1-0-Taurus-HCV-3-75-m-CSM-System-v1-5-1-May-25-2014). Both look pretty robust, so I\u0027d have to think about what I could do differently here.\n\nI\u0027ll keep going on the 3-man octagonal lander pod, since I think that\u0027s a useful niche with three available professions for Kerbals. I\u0027ll base the mass ratio on the existing lander cans. \n\nI do want to be careful about overly obsoleting stock parts. Extending, without replacing. So with that in mind, there are probably still some combinations we can come up with. I mainly want to get a good feel for where I should put the development time before getting too deeply into it. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThat \u0022Big G\u0022-Gemini thing does look pretty cool. I could see maybe doing a capsule with an unusual base diameter, with a few interchangeable \u0022adapter\u0022 sections that bring it up to 2.5m or 3.75m (not sure which is better here), that could include a crew transport or a service bay, etc. At 3.75m for the back end, it would overlap with the Taurus though. I\u0027m still open to ideas here of course.\n\nHere\u0027s what I wrote down as \u0022wishlist items\u0022 that people suggested in other threads (not necessarily as a \u0022to-do list\u0022):\n\n- 1.25m 1-man lander can (slim cylinder, as opposed to stock bulky octagon)\n- 1.25m 2-man lander and/or capsule\n- 2.5m 4-man capsule (tall, wide necked \u0022wine bottle\u0022)\n- 2.5m 3-man lander can (bulky octagon)\n- 3.75m 5-man capsule (possible collision with Taurus and Near Future)\n\nUnfortunately procedural parts are something I can\u0027t do. I still want to aim for very few (if any) dependencies on other mods, and maintain a stock-like functionality as much as I can. I wouldn\u0027t even know where to start on self-balancing (or in-situ adjustable) landing legs. \n\nFor the service bays, I\u0027m thinking something similar to the stock bays, but with sliding doors. (As an aside, I\u0027m probably going to completely rework the MRS cargo bay doors too, so they don\u0027t get in the way as much).\n\nEDIT: Would it be worth splitting the ladders out to a separate pack after all?"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T16:33:58Z","Content":"For 3.75m, there have been a few \u0022Duna Direct\u0022 mods started that have what I tend to think of when I think of needed lander parts at large size that don\u0027t exist.\n\nKerbal landers tend to either get tall, or they are wide contraptions that are hard to launch with rockets that look like rockets.

I was thinking that would be better saved for an aircraft/spaceplane pack though. I\u0027m still open to more ideas of course. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Why not have the rover bay deploy its ramp horizontally, just le it sit down on the surface...or you give it its own landing struts, with the given length you can determine what angle the ramp needs.
