I tried adding a CFG with additional tech nodes, using the \u003Cem\u003E\u0022TechTree { RDNode { \u0026lt;blah\u0026gt; } }\u0022\u003C/em\u003E sort of syntax, to no avail. The log shows that KSP loads the file, but the tech node never appears, which would seem to indicate that KSP overwrites anything you do with the standard, stock tree.
