I tried adding a CFG with additional tech nodes, using the *\u0022TechTree { RDNode { \u003Cblah\u003E } }\u0022\u003C/blah\u003E* sort of syntax, to no avail. The log shows that KSP loads the file, but the tech node never appears, which would seem to indicate that KSP overwrites anything you do with the standard, stock tree. For example:\n\nTechTree.cfg\n\n    TechTree{\tRDNode\t{\t\tid = experimentalRocketry\t\ttitle = Experimental Rocketry\t\tdescription = Significantly larger rockets are sometimes needed. For those times, we have these.\t\tcost = 1000\t\thideEmpty = False\t\tnodeName = node8_experimentalRocketry\t\tanyToUnlock = True\t\ticon = RDicon_rocketry-veryHeavy\t\tpos = -952,1635,-1\t\tscale = 0.6\t\tParent\t\t{\t\t\tparentID = veryHeavyRocketry\t\t\tlineFrom = RIGHT\t\t\tlineTo = LEFT\t\t}\t}}\n\nThis has no effect whatsoever. Any ideas?"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:23:54Z","Content":"Something that\u0027s driving me crazy about this, is that while \u0022experimentalRocketry\u0022 was discarded, another one from that tier, \u0022nanolathing\u0022 was kept with nothing in it and \u0022hideEmpty = True\u0022, and reduced to the 550-point tier. WHY didn\u0027t they do that with all of the 1000-point nodes from 0.90 and earlier?\n\nNow I\u0027m really stuck. I either need to wait for a work-around to become available (via MM, for instance), find some other way to add the tech node I need, or just move all of my parts to earlier nodes, even though that doesn\u0027t really make much sense in the case of something like SpaceY, where everything is bigger than the stock equivalents."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T02:26:22Z","Content":"The new tech tree is supposed to be in a config file.
