So far I have only used reputation as a conversion currency for science and funds. How does it affect your career? Does having a high reputation affect the missions you are offered? I haven\u0027t noticed a difference here. Is it possible I am not seeing the payouts for individual missions change based on Rep?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust curious. It feels like this system would be well rounded out with an additional use for this resource. It would be super sweet if KSC got upgraded the higher rep you earn. You would have a real feeling of progression if statues and monuments started appearing around the flagpole as you complete missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T16:06:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReputation seems to affect the prices/costs/rewards of other things. It definitely affects the terms of contracts. The higher your reputation, the greater the reward of a contract will be in cash and science. It MIGHT also affect the purchase price of rocket parts, although I\u0027m not certain. In general, therefore, it\u0027s main purpose is to be converted into science and/or cash via strategies. However, you don\u0027t want to do too much of this because you need some rep to make the contracts worth doing in the 1st place, regardless of strategies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tall_guy","CreatedById":123847,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T17:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I think SQUAD might have included it to discourage us from killing/exploding too many kerbals.

If you have good reputation, you\u0027ll get the nice three-star ones that have good rewards for more challenging requirements. If you get bad reputation, you\u0027ll dig yourself into a hole that you have to climb out of, doing less prestigious contracts until you get back to the point that the game will generate better contracts for you.

Thoughts?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, at the start of my latest career run I loaded up the rep-\u0026gt;cash policy to 25%. When I got the funds, I upgraded the building to the next level and took the rep-\u0026gt;science policy at around 50%. I found this to be kind of nice, as it slowed the curve for harder missions, and gave me enough science to rapidly progress in tech. I chose to stay on Kerbin for a while during tech-up, doing suborbital tourist runs and parts testing primarily. Survey missions didn\u0027t yield much of anything for the time invested, other than whatever science I could scrape out of it with experiments. By the time I entered orbit for the first time, I had accumulated all of the 90 science level techs (and it didn\u0027t take all that much time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile my reputation was fairly low, it wasn\u0027t an issue really. As soon as I got into orbit the first time, I got missions to go to Mun - then Duna, Minmus. Same as usual. To be honest, I think better missions more commonly come with opening up new technologies and completing building upgrades. For example, as soon as I capped the tracking station at L3, I got 3 star missions to capture asteroids and recover parts from the orbit of the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T21:03:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting - I haven\u0027t seen those sort of contracts yet and I\u0027m only a couple of upgrades (VAB, SPH and uh the Strategy building) from a maxed out space centre.
