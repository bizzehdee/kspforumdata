In fact, most Kerbal biologists agree that it\u0027s much easier to list the non-deadly species of Kaustralia, which generally boils down to \u0022some of the sheep. The Kaustralian space program has recently been banned from the Kerbalnational Space Station after an incident where a spider stowed away on one of its vessels, resulting in the entire station\u0027s crew being killed, one from a spider bite and sixteen from venting the explosion which resulted from the attempts to kill the creature. Kerbonauts investigating the wreckage report that the spider was alive and well, having sealed off one of the emergency suit helmets with its web. KSC administrators have been pondering a nuclear strike in order to clear the orbit, but Kaustralian officials have warned that such actions would probably only anger the spider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as a suggestion, have you considered working with the KerbinSide guys to put these flags in the game?
