I\u0027ll be honest, it was exhausting. It \u003Cem\u003Eshouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E have been, for the most part it was straightforward, and yet I ended up with sweat dripping from my brow. I think it was just down to being tense and nervous - it\u0027s several hundred pounds of equipment that I really didn\u0027t want to break after all. I assembled the motherboard, CPU, cooler, RAM, and PSU on the bench and did a test before installing them in the case. Running prime95 the CPU temperature hit around 50 C and the system was stable. The only actual difficulty I had was getting the motherboard into the case. The fit between the top-right corner of the motherboard and the optical drive cage is really tight, I had to put the motherboard in IO-ports first and squeeze them against the IO shield and it \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E fit. In my view Fractal Design should have taken maybe 5 mm off the drive cage where it\u0027s against the motherboard, it would have made a world of difference. I also noticed the CPU cooler isn\u0027t rock-tight, I can twist it a few degrees quite easily (and did inadvertently while handling the motherboard). I\u0027m hoping that\u0027s not a problem, it seems to just be a consequence of how it\u0027s mounted. The next day I picked up a cable management kit, just some sticky things that you can thread twist or zip ties too, and tidied things up OK. Fiddly work, cable management in a small case is never going to be easy, but I think I got a decent result. I also put a dust filter over the intake fan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was the hardware, largely straightforward. The software, on the other hand...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll spare you the dead ends I got sent round and cut to the chase. Windows 7 has problems installing from a USB DVD drive or USB memory stick on Skylake systems, because Windows 7 doesn\u0027t have USB 3 drivers and Skylake dropped some USB 2 stuff. Even ports on the motherboard that are supposedly USB 2 are affected by this. So much for backward compatibility. Anyway the solution most motherboard manufacturers have provided is a tool that modifies the Windows 7 installation media to have the needed drivers. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gigabyte.com/support-downloads/Utility.aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGigabyte\u0027s one can be had here\u003C/a\u003E. The page about the specific motherboard doesn\u0027t mention that at all, thanks a lot Gigabyte.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat will suffice to get a BIOS/MBR installation of Windows 7 done, but if you want to be picky and use UEFI/GPT - and you might need to if you have a single large hard drive - there\u0027s more fiddling required. Firstly I needed to make sure the USB drive was FAT32 formatted, which required copying all the files the Gigabyte tool had made off it, reformatting, then copying them back on. Then \u003Ca href=\u0022http://forums.bit-tech.net/showthread.php?t=209045\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis thread on another forum\u003C/a\u003E describes a few tweaks that need making. I\u0027ll add that you can get the \u003Cem\u003Ebootmgfw.efi\u003C/em\u003E file by opening \u003Cem\u003Einstall.wim\u003C/em\u003E on the Windows DVD/USB stick in 7-zip, and then look in the same place in that .wim file. It can also be worth deleting the \u003Cem\u003Ebootmgr\u003C/em\u003E file to prevent it booting in BIOS mode by mistake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually I got Windows 7 installed and let it do the mountain of updates. All for an OS I probably won\u0027t touch for months. One other thing: I disconnected the hard drive throughout the process, leaving only the SSD. I\u0027ve known at least some versions of Windows to insist on putting stuff on the wrong drive otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Debian installation was straightforward by comparison, but then I\u0027m very familiar with Linux in general and Debian\u0027s installer is basically the same as Ubuntu\u0027s \u0022alternate installer\u0022. The only hitch I had was sound. I updated the linux kernel, the nvidia drivers, and related packages (basically anything with \u0022linux\u0022 or \u0022nvidia\u0022 in the package name) to the latest versions in jessie-backports, and that did the trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully that will be interesting and/or useful to others.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
