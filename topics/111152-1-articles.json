KSP is an amazing an fun games, but it can be pretty frustrating for me when it lags.. It doesn\u0027t come in lag spikes, more like general lag and mouse lag. I run at medium graphics and have provided my computer specs, is this good or not for KSP? Is it just my PC? And are there some settings that don\u0027t change that much that I can turn off? Thank you. (I also have a lot of background processes while doing KSP, will it help if I shut some down?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecs: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntel Core i7 CPU Q740 1.73 GHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8 GB RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 7 Home Premium 64-bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENVIDIA GeForce GTX 460M\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xyifer12","CreatedById":116119,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T16:17:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the engine it runs on, KSP only uses a single CPU core for physics, meaning that your extra cores are near useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith an extremely low speed of 1.7Ghz, I doubt KSP will run without lag for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want good performance, you have 2 options: Get a good CPU, or wait for KSP to have multicore physics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T16:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, Xyifer.

Its base clock is indeed 1.73GHz but it has turbo to 2.93GHz, heat permitting. That isn\u0027t actually too bad, especially since Kerbal is largely single-core. The graphics card is also a mobile GPU but is fair for its generation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust wanted to pop in to say that my i5 runs KSP excellently.

It will allow you to stop many of those background processes that auto-start when you boot windows. Leave any of the Microsoft processes enabled, but many of the other things can be turned off. Just make sure you read up on how to use it and how to enable/disable things before changing things at random. It\u0027s not particularly dangerous, but can take a bit of fiddling with to clean up some of that stuff that accumulates over time. After you do all that, reboot your computer and much of that background stuff will (hopefully) be gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I did that, my old Vista machine was able to handle KSP...and that computer is 7 or 8 years old.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next version of KSP will be on Unity 5, which will (hopefully) properly support multiple cores. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T16:08:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone, I will read it and perhaps use it, I will see.
