I\u0027ve made it to orbit a few times if I\u0027m lucky, but anything past that is nearly impossible. I set up my fuels, keep in mind the engines and the ISP\u0027s and everything like that.

Some things that I found helpful:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Put RCS on everything. Everything. Useful for ullage and fine-tuning orbits, plus reaction wheels are nearly useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Use lower thrust engines for orbital maneuvers than you would in stock KSP. Since you can barely throttle a lower TWR lets you be more precise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Learn the best fuels for different jobs. Kerolox for lower stages, LH2/LOX for upper stages, then hypergolics for long duration missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Learn to launch into the desired inclination for your next maneuver. Plane changes are murderously expensive in LEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Don\u0027t try to SSTO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Use Procedural Parts for making tanks. Lowers part count and allows you to finely tune stage size/duration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbove all: Don\u0027t get discouraged. It is just another learning curve, you\u0027ll figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T19:10:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStart your tilt at 100m/s, depending on TWR (higher than 1.5 you can tilt a bit early), follow the prograde marker. Depending on upper stage TWR you may want to use the first stage to \u0022pop-up\u0022 the second so you have time to circularize as you fall. Pack around 10km/s of vacuum delta-V while using the appropriate lower and upper stage engines; you\u0027ll get to orbit pretty much every time. Remember that most engines have only one ignition and aren\u0027t throttle-able so your launch will be a full-blast affair; learn your rocket and what trajectory it likes, and know when to stage to prevent ullage problems (or use pre-ignition of a stage like the Soyuz). Bring RCS along for ullage and maneuvering because magical torque wheels don\u0027t exist. Pack extra fuel, like NASA does, to make sure you cover all eventualities. Use the proper tank for your fuel. If you\u0027re at all concerned about boil-off bring hypergolics and reduce the payload. Launches are longer but you have much more time to fine-tune your trajectory and recover from mistakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETips for interplanetary flight (others probably have better advice):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130234-Need-Tutorial-and-Tips-for-RSS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130234-Need-Tutorial-and-Tips-for-RSS\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything else you need to know? MechJeb isn\u0027t required, contrary to popular belief (I certainly don\u0027t use it), but delta-V readouts are pretty much crucial so either that or Engineer are a must.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealism Overhaul is a learning experience, just like stock KSP, it just seems more daunting because stock KSP babies you when it comes to spaceflight.

I admit I tried using mechjeb and some of the tools it comes with like SmartASS and the Ascent Guidance, but that just seemed to make it worse than manually flying my rockets. Maybe I\u0027ll give it another go. I\u0027m constantly wanting to play with RO, but I always end up installing it and all the other mods with it, and deleting within an hour or two. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys.
