The infrastructure for oil retrieving, shipping, refining and distribution need to be intact. It\u0027s highly unlikely to be intact in a post apocalyptic world. They could of course run on methanol or alcohol, but that still takes a lot of work in a world where there are no rules.\n\n2. Combustion engines need maintenance, you can\u0027t expect it to run for without breaking down in a hostile environment let alone last for 50-100 years. Spare parts will be scares or non-existent. \n\n3. Look at 2. For example: rubber hoses aren\u0027t easy to make, or at all, without a machine let alone in a dusty environment.\n\n4.
