I\u0027m not going to go through the overhead of deorbiting all the junk but I will occasionally launch a bank of tugs and then immediately terminate that mission. At that point I have spent enough resource to warrant going into the tracking station and terminating 8\u00A0pieces of junk of junk that it could reach. Eight because that simulates a failed capture leaving both the original piece of junk and a tug in orbit. That now adds to my simulation a resource cost in leaving junk in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-15T00:15:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeat!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the way it looks, I often do missions like this as well just for funsies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-15T00:16:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2019 12:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Rocket In My Pocket\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
