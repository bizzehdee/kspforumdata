ideas are tied to little rockets. \u00A0This was true in human history and it\u0027s true regarding Kerbal Space Program. \u00A0Compared to other games, like Elite: Dangerous, KSP is light hearted and fun. \u00A0Ironically, we are more invested in the fates of our Kerbals, their lives, their fiery deaths and their combined efforts to fly than we ever are in games like Elite: Dangerous. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nIt\u0027s true that\u00A0in those games we can warp around with our frame shift drives (Albecurrie drives for those who haven\u0027t played the game) hauling slaves, blasting innocent merchants to smithereens around Barnard\u0027s Star.\u00A0 Those games are fun, but fundamentally they don\u0027t involve the emotional connection that one gets with plucky, little green astronauts\u00A0desperately trying to rocket themselves into cosmos. \u00A0A ten year old version of myself or my daughter\u00A0could dryly check the commodity prices of Imperial\u00A0slaves in one game, but would be deeply frustrated when Valentina burns to a crisp with a poorly planned re-entry.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nThis is why KSP is a great vehicle to introduce kids and adults to ethics of\u00A0technology. \u00A0Compared to other games, the thought involved by the player to get their craft flying along\u00A0with the characters of the Kerbals leads to an investment that simply doesn\u0027t exist in other games.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

styrofoam glider and see what happened. \u00A0Luckily, the thought of killing my pet compelled me to place hamster-like rocks in the plastic bottle and engage in a styrofoam glider test program. \u00A0I could never get myself to put my hamster on\u00A0my rockets, radio control planes, etc. \u00A0The desire not to murder my pet combined with the desire to fly those same creatures\u00A0got me into learning about aerodynamics, force coupling, aviation and space history, math, engineering, etc. \u00A0I was going to fly my pets, but I was going to do it right.\u00A0That experience\u00A0was just from\u00A0masking tape, Estes rockets and foam. \u00A0Eventually, I wound up doing the flying myself\u00A0and getting degrees in a bunch of unimportant fields.\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

especially early in the game. \u00A0A cute, fluffy Kerbunny Kapsule could be mounted on rockets allowing players to choose whether they want to blast their lovable Kerbunnies into suborbital trajectories for science or try to preserve the cute\u00A0bunnies and simply air drop\u00A0from them from planes into ocean for science. \u00A0More science could be gained\u00A0by recovering Kerbunnies alive.\u00A0\u00A0Having a live creature that is somewhat more disposable than a Kerbonaut, requires less mass to fly but is several times more cute opens up a whole range of new experiences and decisions\u00A0to players. \u00A0This also allows for much more variety in how you progress through\u00A0career mode, especially early in the game. \u00A0It\u0027s also a nod to the early years of the Space Race.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv
