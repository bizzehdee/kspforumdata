It also happens with stock clamps as well but only on certain craft. My gut tells me it may have something to do with the physics significance flag or something on a part its attached to but who knows.\n\nThe work around is to quick save and then reload. The clamps disappear after you reload.\n\n![mPbk5wq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mPbk5wq.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T22:08:06Z","Content":"Another way around the problem, as I pointed out in the FASA thread, is to keep them on your outermost boosters (IE, as far away from the bulk of the rocket as you possibly can) and/or under your rocket, and to use as little as possible as an extra redundancy. They won\u0027t collide with your rocket in doing so."},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T22:49:07Z","Content":"Well, I guess the \u0022Test Launch Clamps in Low Orbit around the Sun\u0022 contracts are possible, now."}]}
