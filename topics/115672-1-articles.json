It also happens with stock clamps as well but only on certain craft. My gut tells me it may have something to do with the physics significance flag or something on a part its attached to but who knows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe work around is to quick save and then reload.

They won\u0027t collide with your rocket in doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T22:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I guess the \u0022Test Launch Clamps in Low Orbit around the Sun\u0022 contracts are possible, now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
