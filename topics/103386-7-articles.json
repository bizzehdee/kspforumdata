I\u0027m currently in the process of working on dimensions, how it will all fit together, and trying to figure out how to make it work in KSP. They are based off many different recent lander designs, but nothing specific. Probably none of the existing meshes will be used, its all just there for checking fit and layout; existing coloring is just flat material shading and in no way any representation of final coloring. And, as stated, this is all concept stuff; it may never go much further than this, I\u0027m just working through ideas.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m going for a stock-like part-based approach with these, but you should be able to construct any number of the recent lander designs floating around. The Altair multi-stage/disposable design, the partially re-useable design, and the fully re-useable lander design (names?) should be achievable with these parts, with some margins. As it is all part based, -many- different lander designs should be possible that are not (easily/cleanly) doable with stock parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E There is essentially two series of complementing parts; a ~2.4m set (fits in 2.5m fairing), and a ~3.65m set (fits in 3.75m fairing). Each set is hollow, with the 2m stuff fitting inside the 3m stuff (cutout in the 3m parts not shown); so inset designs are possible and fully intended (where the ascent stage is fully surrounded by the descent stage, and its engine(s) can potententially contribute). The 2m series also contains cutouts/hollow middle section for the addition of inset engines or to accomodate the 2m pod ascent hardware set; which should allow for fair simulations of even the Apollo era LM\n\u003E \n\u003E 2.4m parts (in example two-stage design)(pod will sit flush against descent stage when docked, with ascent engine protruding through the bottom of descent stage):\n\u003E \n\u003E 0.625m docking port shown in render, but will likely have a 1.25m top-attach node/docking port for greater compatibility and stronger connections\n\u003E \n\u003E 2.4m lander pod w/ascent hardware (fuel tanks), crew capacity probably 2 or 3 (TBD) (pod is \u003C2.4m in length/width, unsure/undecided on cylinder diameter)\n\u003E \n\u003E 2.4m lander pod ascent engine ~(0.8 engine; may well go with 0.625m for those parts)(possibly used on decent as well (or descent only), depending upon configuration)\n\u003E \n\u003E 2.4m fuel core x2 (0.75m tall each) (descent stage)\n\u003E \n\u003E 2.4m engine quad (descent stage)\n\u003E \n\u003E 2.4m leg set (all 4 legs in a single part, hopefully...)\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPMods/raw/master/wiki/SC-B-render-LC2-dev1.png](https://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPMods/raw/master/wiki/SC-B-render-LC2-dev1.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E 3.65m parts (2-stage design shown; hollow center in 3m parts now shown; lander pod will sit flush against the top of the 3m parts when in descent configuration, with the ascent engines also available for use during descent)\n\u003E \n\u003E 3.65m lander pod; higher crew capacity than the 2m, whatever it ends up being\n\u003E \n\u003E 2.4m fuel core X 2 (ascent stage)\n\u003E \n\u003E 2.4m engine quad (ascent stage)(also used on descent for additional thrust)\n\u003E \n\u003E 3.65m fuel core X 2 (descent stage)\n\u003E \n\u003E 3.65m engine quad (descent stage)\n\u003E \n\u003E 3.65m leg set (all 4 legs in a single part, hopefully...)\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPMods/raw/master/wiki/SC-B-render-LC3-dev1.png](https://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPMods/raw/master/wiki/SC-B-render-LC3-dev1.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E And the full set of example parts, as they currently exist \n\u003E \n\u003E [https://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPMods/raw/master/wiki/SC-B-render-LCFull-dev1.png](https://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPMods/raw/master/wiki/SC-B-render-LCFull-dev1.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Any thoughts or interest in this stuff? \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m really disappointed with the options available for landers in stock (and even with most of the mods I use), and have been wanting to put together something like this for awhile. I also don\u0027t believe that the single-purpose-designed landers (such as if I did a direct Altair modeling) really have a place in KSP; and I say this after having used a single-purpose-designed in my 1.0 career game for awhile (my Series-A lander design) -- it takes a lot of the fun out of actually designing things, removes alot of aspects of mission planning, and due to being uncustomizable generally ends up being overweight (and overpowered) for the majority of uses (and not powerful enough for the rest!). The one upside to the single-purpose-designs is the very-low part count that can be achieved; but the difference between a 2 part lander and a 7 part lander is negligible... neither will lag your game. -- Anyway, that is my rationale behind designing these as a modular set of parts rather than modeling any single lander (or even multiple landers).\n\n Altair, Cargo Altair, and Morpheus are on my list currently. \nFor Altair, do the 2.4 meter parts but scale them up to use a 1.25m docking port."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T23:45:43Z","Content":"Well we have SLS and the Ares but haven\u0027t seen a Jupiter so you know where my vote went."},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T23:48:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well we have SLS and the Ares but haven\u0027t seen a Jupiter so you know where my vote went.\n\n TiberDyne has one ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"cipherpunks","CreatedById":114858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T12:36:06Z","Content":"can You please remove a photo of bacon from ESV?

It does -NOT- need a heat shield for a direct-from-Minmus-return trajectory (3600\u002B m/s @40k alt on return), even at 120% heating (seriously, try it with the ablator removed/module removed from the .cfg). It is big and wide and has lots of drag and slows down quite quickly. Any issues from ablator/heat shield, please take them up with \\_Augustus\\_. (Honestly, it just needs to be removed, as it is \\_NOT\\_ supposed to be there).\n\nB: Solar panels -- stock bugs. Nothing can be done about them for now (neither the breaking on fairing jettison, nor the animation problems, nor the action group probems). Seriously, stock was never meant to handle this complex of a part. The problems stem from: Multiple simultaneous animations (stock does not allow for animation layering/separation); mutliple same-named action group keys (because it is using stock solar panel modules, and those do not allow custom group names); and the breaking is caused by stock not respecting the \u0027breakable=false\u0027 flag in regards to collisions (and it also for some reason adds physical colliders to supposedly non-physical fairing debris).\n\nIn my personal games I have written a custom plugin (and solar panel module) that handles the solar panels much better (animation, persistence, non-breaking, action groups.... pretty much fixes all the bugs); but it will likely be a few weeks/months before I am willing to release it (if ever)(was a huge PITA to write, and may or may not have some licensing problems preventing it from being released... will need to speak to some others for more info). Lots of testing will need to be done, and probably quite a bit of code cleanup and refactor (still learning the KSP API), but it didn\u0027t make my game explode even once last night, so it is off to a good start.\n\nC: Stack nodes -- feel free to add them yourself. Quite simple to do via MM patch or even direct config editing. I will -not- be adding them to the base model as it is meant to be used exclusively with the SCA and MSA adapters at the bottom (which allow it to fit on a 3.75m stack seamlessly).\n\nD: ICPS Stats -- yes they are greatly nerfed compared to real-life. Beacause if I went with the real-life dV stats, you would never need any other upper stage. In reality the ICPS is -just- enough to do a moonshot (and orbital insertion? I think the SM engine actually does that part...); so the ~1200 dV I gave it is still 50-100% more than it should/would have (relatively scaled). It is called an \u0027Interim\u0027 propulsion stage, as it is meant to be replaced by (or combined with) larger and more capable upper stages for missions to more distant destinations (and I believe the ICPS is really only scheduled for one mission before they start using larger upper stages?). So, in those regards, the upper CSM stack is extremely overpowered; it should probably only have 400-600 dV when scaled down to KSP system, but it was the portion that I would prefer be overpowered if given a choice.\n\nBut to each his own; if you feel it needs more performance, there is nothing to stop you from doing a patch like you have. That is one of the great things about KSP/modding/mods (I love the fact that I can alter so much about the game with just a text-editor).\n\nIn the mean-time; some preview of a very early WIP IVA for the CM (and some other misc stuff) -- \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
