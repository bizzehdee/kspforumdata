I have a Su-27 replica wich i downloaded from KerbalX, and now i have outfitted it with TK-38 Radial Decouplers with stock made \u0022bombs\u0022 attached. The bombs consist of Mk0\u00A0 Liquid Fuel Fuselages and FL-T400 Fuel Tanks and a couple of fins if that info matters in solving this. So, the issue here is when i press Space button to decouple, these bombs disappear into thin air without any explosion or anything which could explain their disappearance. They don\u0027t even seem to detach, they just disappear in a blink of an eye when i press Space. The speed i\u0027m flying doesn\u0027t matter, whether it be 70m/s or 350m/s, they still disappear. Btw i\u0027m always flying straight a level (if that\u0027s the correct term) when i try to drop the things (i guess that\u0027s the proper way to fly when you\u0027re bombing stuff).\u00A0Anyone have an idea what could be causing this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-06T12:36:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOdd, I do this sort of thing all the time, never had an issue like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you have max debris set to 0 and it\u0027s deleting them immediately due to lack of control?
