What I meant was, you were probably right, we should have more restrictive licenses if we\u0027re going with something like that, and that (based on what most authors seem to expect) we should probably just go All Rights Reserved to cover everything.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, breakdown in communication~ Happens all the time man! =) - I agree, if what the authors want is more of their rights reserved, then they should be using more restrictive licenses. A small side note to that though, KSP\u0027s modding community thrives off learning and utilizing parts of code from other mods. Mod authors would hopefully recognize this and pick/write licenses that allow for the use of their code(with some form of request/attribution/permission if they wish) so that current and future mod authors can continue to grow and learn from each-other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESure. But there would be less confusion. Granted, everything would appear a lot less open and permissive than it currently is, and there would be almost no change in how things go, but the clarity and lack of ambiguity and lack of doubt that it would cause for most forkers / mod packers would likely outweigh the general reduction in the, \u0022you can do this,\u0022 atmosphere. After all, you\u0027ve been the one arguing for clarity here, and that will have inevitable consequences in how open the modding community is perceived to be, regardless of how it is in actuality.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that what you said here is quite near perfect.

The KSP modding community is built around modders helping each other, sharing code, and using existing codebases to show new modders how it\u0027s done. This is required because of the lack of KSP API docs and the large amount of outdated information. As a result of this, most modders are more than willing to make their mods very open source, to allay any licence issues and provide a good, open resource. When issues arise due to inconsiderate abuse of these licences, modders are forced to either ignore it and do nothing, or lock the licence down so that nobody can access it, which turns it into a legal swordfight and makes everything become more hostile, which in the end hurts the community. None of us want to have a closed licence and a team of lawyers on speed-dial to protect us from people who refuse to abide by community standards.\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr - modders should not be forced to use highly restrictive licencing just to ensure security because it only causes problems and hurts the community\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few things about this post-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

As I stated above, and have yet to be answered/refuted on, there is no such thing as \u0022license abuse\u0022 (in my opinion, which I \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ethink\u003C/span\u003E is in line with objective fact.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The mod authors also have the option of using a license that simply requires written permission from said author for any derivative work. This would quell any legal swordfight that potentially would arise due to the awesome community of authors ability/want to help each-other. No hostility needed, so long as the author\u0027s license is not infringed upon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. If that last sentence before the tl;dr is true, then why are modpack ideas constantly shut down on this forum?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, #5. No one is forcing the mod authors to use any specific license, but the rules do dictate that they must include one with their mod.

Since TAC LS has updated from Kerbal/day units to liters, it still doesn\u0027t have any way to recycle food (or rather solid waste) again, CELSS Greenhouses wasn\u0027t completely updated yet the last time I looked and conversation errors seem to have been everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I would\u0027ve felt a modpack would make better in that regard, is that it would keep the \u0022experience together\u0022 until the compatibility of the all included mods can be guaranteed by the pack-supporter in some way.
