The reason being is that the real StarShip will have header tanks in the nose, mainly so they can be insulated and they will also act as ballast during the \u0027belly flop\u0027 manoeuvre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have managed to add fuel tanks and they provide just the balance I\u0027m looking for, however, when the engines fire, they are drained at the same time as the main tanks in the lower section. The lower section has a handy \u0027disable crossfeed\u0027 button which locks its fuel tanks, however, the crew cabin has no such button\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know what I need to add to the Part section in my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E cfg file in order to enable this button in the GUI?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany thanks \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-20T18:58:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust turn off the fuel feed in that tank?
