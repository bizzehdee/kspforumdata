If you\u0027re giving them names like \u0022Phoenix\u0022 then you might consider renaming them (or at least adding a suffix; \u0022Phoenix: resupply Mun\u0022). I run a lot of missions at once and do forget what\u0027s going on, but it\u0027s usually obvious when I see the ship what it\u0027s supposed to be doing.

It also keeps a designation for their experience level. -1, -2 for leveled-up people, -min for people that have been to the Mun but not Minmus yet, or -mun for vice-versa, -r for people that need to return. No suffix for noobs. With conditional formatting, the spreadsheet can automatically color the Kerbals according to their job and experience, which makes it real easy to see who\u0027s supposed to be going to the Mun and who\u0027s supposed to be going back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that simply landing on Mun/Minmus is enough for full points. On other planets you have to plant a flag, but for Mun/Minmus I have a 19-Kerbal ship (\u0022The Experiencer\u0022) that just lands, sits around for 10 seconds to be sure I got credit, then takes off and goes to the other moon. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that there are mods that will let you level up Kerbals in the field, if that\u0027s what you want.
