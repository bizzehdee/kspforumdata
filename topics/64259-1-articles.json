The planet between the two Jools sits carefully perched at the very top of a potential energy curve between the two large bodies... one tiny perturbation to either side (like a Kerbal farting) would send kerbal sliding down the curve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it as similar to a pencil balanced on its tip. It is technically considered equilibrium, but is extremely unstable due to energetics favoring the pencil falling down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T21:21:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn perfect models stability is not an issue, in reality it is a major factor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Everten P.","CreatedById":103089,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T21:42:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELets get one thing strait that I think you are ignoring KERBIN HAS MOUNTAINS! And not only the bit of gravity the mountains would create but if they where orbiting at about 1000Mm (which is small when you think of Jool) the water from Kerbin and its atmosphere would be SUCKED toward the Jools considering that all the planets rotate the amount of atmosphere and water would be split amongst the two. The as their mass increased the mountains would come into effect releasing more gravitational force towards one after this Kerbin would be near enough to a particular Jool just long enough for Jool\u0027s atmosphere to burn it to gas due to friction with the atmosphereless Kerbin to become gas. After that one Jool would have an edge over the other and when the merge that\u0027s how a star is born because Jupiter and Jool are both technically \u0022failed\u0022 stars so when two of them collide that would create a small star a bit smaller than Kerbol.

It is enough to go into a rotating frame of reference to see that the effective potential has a local maximum at the center. That means that the Kerbin\u0027s location in this system is an equilibrium, but it is not a stable one. It will start falling towards one of the Jools, and either end up its moon or get knocked out of the system. The too Jools will continue orbiting each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you put a ship in the center, instead of the planet. It can remain there by using very small amounts of fuel for station-keeping. Because as I\u0027ve mentioned above, while it\u0027s not stable, it is an equilibrium, so you don\u0027t need a lot of force to keep something there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
