Stock fairings have 2, 3, or 4 (I think. I know it goes up) sides based on the size of the base.

You could tweak from 1 to 8 shells around. 1 is a bit goofy because you can\u0027t apply any decoupler force (or it shoots off sideways), but allows you to back out slowly if you want (Apollo style). I figured 8 max, since that\u0027s the stock symmetry count.\n\nI\u0027ll see if I can get this up tonight.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T03:31:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, that\u0027s exactly what my add-on did.
