They kind of recovered by making a line of female scientists. It\u0027s weird that something that simple should matter, but it does.

Who cares if we\u0027re still far from reaching equality, despite the fact that the laws of the civilized world make it mandatory? Who cares if girls have issues with their self image because media treats their bodies as products?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMatters of representation are really important. REALLY. I can\u0027t stress this enough. LEGO had a real setback when it started making a line of toys \u0022for girls\u0022 that was mostly pink and had little anorexic figurines. They kind of recovered by making a line of female scientists. It\u0027s weird that something that simple should matter, but it does. Boys have toys that teach them that they can be soldiers, super-heroes, scientists and astronauts. Girls have toys that teach them to be moms or supermodels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging this perception isn\u0027t something easy, so any small step in the right direction should be appreciated. Even if it\u0027s just the addition of a new bunch of polygons to a video game. It\u0027s important. It will make news. People areound the world will care. Sure, if you want to be jaded, you can say it\u0027s a marketing coup, that Squad only wants the media attention, that they don\u0027t care about adding real value to the gameplay. I\u0027d argue against that at least partially, since they\u0027re also giving the community the aerodynamics they so hard cried about, but I digress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point here is that, while it might not add value to the game as you perceive it, the value that it adds to the game from a girl\u0027s perspective might be immesurable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, this means a lot. Because despite the fact that I\u0027m a 32 year old man from Brazil, I do like women and I\u0027m rooting for them. There are many women that I love, and I like to see the world become a better place for them, and I truly believe this might help a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh God forbid I mean any harm to women, and their past. I don\u0027t want to have inequality in the world, to the point where I would kill oppressors to get people better lives. But I think that MAKING PEOPLE GUESS WHAT IT IS, instead of announcing it is the issue. The way they market it makes it seem like there will be nothing else. Personally, I would like to have the developers talk openly about features like this, and put pictures up for people to critique. I would rather open development rather than closed, \u0022hype\u0022 inducing guessing games.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T00:30:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a really damn stupid idea.
