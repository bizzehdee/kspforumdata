A central spine runs along the middle of the ship with fuel tanks place on that. A girder is also placed on the spine and from that the armour forms a layer over the tanks. The key is to have no structural and fuel parts touching each other.

Its basically impossible to make omnidirectional effective armor below 400 parts thatll stop one of the high end missiles that seem to be deployed by everyone these days. Thats at a minimum 500 parts total for 1 ship, since well, 100 parts for weapons/weapon mounts is already lowish on firepower when a single high end missile is at least 15-20 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough ive always enjoyed the competitive armor building, its gotten to the point that in order to get truly competitive i need to go above 400 parts, and i really prefer all my ships to be 300 at a absolute maximum with weapons, its not a hard limit, but i just cant have much more then 2 500 part ships loaded at once before game becomes more annoying then fun. with a 300 part ship, i can have ~3 loaded at once, or 2 or so with fighters/support ships that are lowish part count. Always enjoyed interaction over pure 1 vs 1, but if U5 allows it, i will come back into competitive loadouts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, srry i havent started our battle yet, im working on a new ship that i really want to deploy (after my SK-CRV-I prototype failed miserably due to being prone to the resonance kraken of doom). Once i get a actual 50-60t warship up ill set up the battle, we dont want to fight my fighter\u002Bbomber with no capital ship vs your stuff. I could always use a SK-CRV-III, but i dont like that idea as its a highly competitive ship which would most likely be an issue for you to actually do anything to it, and itll eat your ships alive since its weapons are anti-drek 12P proven.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as i finish my newly designed SK-CRV-I C, we will fight though, but a for fun game, im not bringing anti-drek weaponry to this one lawl, sticking to my newly developed 0.62m warheads that can actually do some damage but need to be used accurately and in large numbers to be effective vs capitals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, as for my part count efficient armor, go to my companyt page and download teh SK-CRV-IIIg3. Its my old competitive ship (my new ones that are updated for 1.04 are harder to destroy and even less parts), but it shows how i made teh core for it. Its not the best, but its bloody good for the fact that the hull is ~200 parts not counting missiles.

Then again, i can have 3 of them for one drek\u0027s parts, so thats perfectly good.\u003Cp\u003EReally recently ive started developing alot more fun vessels, im done with competitive ships until U5, and ofc that assumes U5 has anything but a very minor improvement to high part count lag. Its basically impossible to make omnidirectional effective armor below 400 parts thatll stop one of the high end missiles that seem to be deployed by everyone these days. Thats at a minimum 500 parts total for 1 ship, since well, 100 parts for weapons/weapon mounts is already lowish on firepower when a single high end missile is at least 15-20 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough ive always enjoyed the competitive armor building, its gotten to the point that in order to get truly competitive i need to go above 400 parts, and i really prefer all my ships to be 300 at a absolute maximum with weapons, its not a hard limit, but i just cant have much more then 2 500 part ships loaded at once before game becomes more annoying then fun. with a 300 part ship, i can have ~3 loaded at once, or 2 or so with fighters/support ships that are lowish part count.

A central spine runs along the middle of the ship with fuel tanks place on that. A girder is also placed on the spine and from that the armour forms a layer over the tanks. The key is to have no structural and fuel parts touching each other.

Spacers have been added between the fuel tanks and the central spine. An additional layer of wing armour has been places on top of the main armour. This is light and can deflect smaller shots by itself. Only use this method if you have a beefy PC (I don\u0027t) as its extremely part count intensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LTbwCge.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/LTbwCge.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that none of the layers touch.
