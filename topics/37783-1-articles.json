I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027m doing wrong.. I understand the basic principle, attach radial engines in pairs around the main engine and connect them together with the last engine in the chain being connected to the center engine and then break them off working outside in. What I don\u0027t understand, however, is why it seems to work upon liftoff (all engines fire and all tanks stay full aside from the furthest ones along the chain), and then after I detach those, the center engine burns out completely and then stops while the outer engines, which are attached via fuel line, keep burning. As a result, the center isn\u0027t lifting while the sides are. I\u0027m obviously doing something wrong, but I can\u0027t figure it out. I\u0027ve also had similar situations where everything works perfectly until the first pair are ejected and then the center engine AND the last outer pair begin burning fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I doing wrong!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn regard to my second question, I\u0027ve gotten to the Mun/Minmus back and forth and earlier today completed my landing (manned) on Duna using a one-manned capsule and an interplanetary nuclear tug (with 1 NERVA). Obviously, the burn took forever and while I eventually got there, I\u0027ve used up a lot of fuel and probably won\u0027t have enough to get back (assuming I need roughly the same amount, which may or may not be accurate). My question is: what is the most efficient engine configuration for interplanetary NERVA tugs? Is one NERVA really the way to go or are two or three? For the record, I\u0027m not using any mods, so I\u0027m sure that plays into things a bit in terms of accuracy/wasting fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zanzibar196","CreatedById":67228,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T00:34:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you got a fuel line or lines in there going backwards... pulling from the center tank to the outside ones... pay attention to which way the arrows on your fuel lines are going...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T00:40:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the fuel lines, there\u0027s two things: One, you might\u0027ve, indeed, routed fuel in the wrong way.

I think the previous posts where correct, if your center stage is running out before the \u0022asparagus\u0022 bits, then you probably have a fuel line running from the center to the last stage in your asparagus, as opposed to from the last stage TO the center. Anywho, to help that, here is how I do it. Lets say I want a center large fuel tank with 6 radial large fuel tanks. For the first radial tank, I add the decoupler, tank, engine, and struts with 2x symmetry. I don\u0027t add fuel lines as they have to run from the tank you just placed (with 2x symmetry) to the tank you are ABOUT to place, which doesn\u0027t exist yet! I then dupe the first tank at the decoupler and place it next to the first tank. This gets the decoupler, tank, engine, and any struts I placed. I do this a third time to get all six radial tanks. To place the fuel lines, since you used 2x symmetry vice say 4 or 6x, when you connect the first placed tand to the second, 2x symmetry will automatically be applied. Do the same for tank 2. For tank 3, which is where I think you went afoul, make sure the line runs from the third tank, to the center tank, and all should be welll An added benefit to this method is that your staging should reflect your 2x symmetry, ie, you should be able to move the respective decouplers in short order to the correct staging location. hope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheebsta","CreatedById":74167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T07:54:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EView from inside main tank, fuel line is there, but obscured by the lines built onto the tank coming down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c327/Cheebsta/KSP/screenshot11_zps2f221f67.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot11_zps2f221f67.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConnecting to main tank:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c327/Cheebsta/KSP/screenshot12_zps13aedfd8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot12_zps13aedfd8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESymmetry added, everything from here is just duping (except the cone and control bits):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c327/Cheebsta/KSP/screenshot14_zpse4088bc3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot14_zpse4088bc3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReady for launch, whopping total of 12 struts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c327/Cheebsta/KSP/screenshot26_zps493da3be.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot26_zps493da3be.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~7000m, and I still haven\u0027t pushed a button besides spacebar:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c327/Cheebsta/KSP/screenshot31_zps6104a5e5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot31_zps6104a5e5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally here it starts to wobble, but again, not a single input from me other than spacebar.
