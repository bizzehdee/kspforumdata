Although I can get the textures to work relatively easily from my last attempt a few weeks ago. You have to use the UV unwrap features in Blender. Check out youtube, Andrew Price has some good tutorials if you need them. Of course there is a certain art involved when it comes to figuring out exactly how a mesh needs to be unwrapped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I commented on another thread somewhere but can\u0027t find it ATM (maybe i should check my profile/recent posts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I\u0027m having now is I finally got my connector nodes setup via the config file, and they\u0027re not magically floating in the air. The problem I\u0027m having is only one of the nodes seems to connect, usually the top of bottom depending on which one i list first. Part of the problem I\u0027m thinking is part rotation. It\u0027s oriented in blender to where z is up, if I leave it like that, it ends up on its side in Unity and KSP (even if I rotate the game object and/or the model its self (have done both). Rotating it 90 degrees on X puts it the right way around in Unity though and KSP though. Although no matter what only one node connects. Using the mesh collider component btw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough, maybe it\u0027s because im starting with a nurbs curve in Blender, then converting to a mesh and using spin to make it round. Although I\u0027ve set origin to center of mass and zeroed everything out and applied scale, rotation and location (maybe thats part of the problem).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink I\u0027ll try again with just a simple cylinder and see if that makes a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...fun times \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate:\u003C/strong\u003E I don\u0027t know what I did but I got it working now, even with the original model I was trying.

I know...so helpful haha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the scaling issue is still there, even though scale was 1 in Blender, and diameter (well x and y) were 1 meter, and all the scaling in unity is 1, the part still comes out between 0.625 and 1.25 in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave tried setting both scale and rescalefactor at 1, and tried them both separately, in the config.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-09T17:14:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2014 05:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
