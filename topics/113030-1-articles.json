The design was overweight and after the Challenger disaster they added an ejection capsule which made it completely unmanageable. It could only carry 3 astronauts, no payload, and most of its systems were jettisoned in an expendable equipment module. In the end, the design was so compromised that it was clear that it wasn\u0027t going anywhere. \n\nAriane 5 was initiated in 1987, but the early stages were high-level concepts with vague target goals. As noted, by the time the pad complex at Kourou was being built or the systems were being designed, any requirement for manned launches had been thrown out the window.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T15:24:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 03:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"}]}
