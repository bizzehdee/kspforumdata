The design was overweight and after the Challenger disaster they added an ejection capsule which made it completely unmanageable. It could only carry 3 astronauts, no payload, and most of its systems were jettisoned in an expendable equipment module. In the end, the design was so compromised that it was clear that it wasn\u0027t going anywhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAriane 5 was initiated in 1987, but the early stages were high-level concepts with vague target goals.
