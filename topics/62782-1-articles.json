Honestly, part of the reason is because I regularly rely on ridiculous aerobraking but I know this is a lousy reason to argue for or against a feature. A better reason to leave out re-entry heat is because crazy and creative ships are core to the spirit of KSP, and so is doing crazy orbital stunts. If you had to use heat shields you would curtail some of that zaniness. My guess is the zaniness is more fun than the increase in realism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf all the features I personally oppose, I think reentry heat has the best chance of being implemented. In a sense it would be a shame to leave the reentry flames as a visual effect only. They are fun as just visuals but it\u0027s always a bit of a letdown when you have to say \u0022yeah, those flames are just for looks\u0022. Also, the need for heat shields will induce some creativity in their placement and use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of heat shields, maybe they will be dynamic and flexible enough to be more of a tax on ships than strict design constraint. On one end of the spectrum if the biggest heat shield looks like a \u0022Rockomax Brand Adapter\u0022 and anything that isn\u0027t absolutely covered is ripped off, then aerobraking ships will be constrained to cylinders and you\u0027ll have to stage the heat shield when you\u0027re ready to use engines again. (I know this is limited by my imagination, there might be convoluted workarounds). If, however, you had heat shields that could be deployed over rocket engines (or rocket engines themselves were robust to aerobraking) and little chinks in heat shield overlap didn\u0027t equal destruction then it would be much more doable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoral of the story is, reentry heat will constrain ships. If the constraint is really draconian then the realism is not worth the trouble (net loss of fun). I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a balance where the constraint is worth worrying about (unlike the visual effects we currently have) but still allows for the full spectrum of Kerbalish designs.

I am a bit frisky around Re-Entry heating myself, and it all depends on how it is done. I think it shouldn\u0027t be \u0022Deadly Re-Entry\u0022 as such, and would be more suitable as \u0022Damaging Re-Entry\u0022. Parts and your craft oculd still be damaged, even destroyed, but it would be less severe than what we have to deal with IRL. I think this would be better for the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am all for more realism, but we need to draw the line between a \u0022Simulator\u0022 and a \u0022Game\u0022 at some point, and I think this is one pint where a compromise has to be made. For instance: A Mk-1 command pod would only be able to reenter from LKO-MKO, and possibly up to, or near, the mun safely, any higher and it would require multiple passes to bleed off the speed in order to reenter safely, or a heavier heatshield on the bottom of the pod. (That would be a seperate part.) The Mk1-2 pod would be able to safely reenter from Mun and minmus and interplanetary velocities would be the same as above. The lander cans would have to reenter at much lower speeds due to not having the required heatshielding, or stay in the upper atmo for longer in order to blled off enough speed to be safe. The way I see it, this would give more of an inclination to use the larger and hevier pods over the Mk-1 lander can (The lightest pod per kerbal in the game), as it would quickly lose out during reentry to other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think (And this is more of a personal preferance.) Re-entry should only begin to damage things as the mach or heating efects appear, so even reentering at interplanetary velocities in thin atmo (Such as duna) should be survivable for all but the puniest of parts. I think people could get very confused as to why stuff is blowing up from re-enter heat, even though there isnt any flames.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-10T20:44:36Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2014 08:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Deathsoul097\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T21:41:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that some people may be underestimating what the average beginner understands. If you are interested in playing a game like KSP, you most likely have some interest in real-world spaceflight as well. You probably already know that atmospheric re-entry is a dangerous thing and that you should come in with the blunt end forward, using a heat shield. You are also likely to have seen what happened to the Columbia because of some minor damage. So when you start playing KSP, you tend to assume that returning safely from orbit is going to be almost as hard as reaching the orbit in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least that was what I did. I was very careful with re-entry angles and pod orientation during my early missions. It took a while to realize that nothing ever happened, no matter how impressive flames I got or how ridiculous g-forces the pod had to endure. That was a bit disappointing, but I understood that such things should be expected when playing an unfinished game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps realistic re-entry would be more problematic to the people on this forum than to the beginners.
