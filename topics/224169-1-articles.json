It does seem strange to me, despite the excellent work the team have done so far, you could see more information more clearly in KSP1 than in KSP2 (in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cu\u003Efor each stage\u003C/u\u003E you could see DeltaV, thrust, Isp, start weight, end weight,\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and burn time. I have made a separate topic about that. The font though, especially numbers were clear enough in KSP1 to see at a glance, which I think is an important gameplay feature when things are happening quickly. You could also see the remaining deltaV of a burn, not just the total amount. This remaining deltaV figure would change very rapidly during a burn, but I could always see it very clearly, and just by looking at the number rapidly decreasing I can end a burn within 0.5m/s in most cases.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-03-20T09:39:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2024 09:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Mar 20\u0022\u003EMarch 20\u003C/time\u003E by allanp11\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
