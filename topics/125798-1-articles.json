Only after accepting it, did I learn that the he was in a [B]retrograde[/B] orbit around Kerbol.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAre there any \u0022smart\u0022 options to rescue him without needing crazy amounts of delta-v? Rescuing him near the periapsis would need 14-16km/s of delta-v just to reverse the orbit direction, pick him up and reverse the orbit direction again. I understand I can pull this off by strapping an external command seat to an ion drive, but are there any tricks with orbital mechanics that would let me accomplish the mission with chemical rockets?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI hate the ion drive, because it is so slow, even with the 4x physics warp I would have to wait for almost an hour to get the desired delta v.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T07:58:48Z","Content":"\nMultistage deep space nuclear rocket and/or [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-elliptic_transfer]bi-elliptic transfer[/url] might get you the necessary delta-v.
