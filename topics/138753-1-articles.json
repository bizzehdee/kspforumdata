About half way from the end of the Hohmann transfer between essentially a Kerbin orbit and Jool orbit things started to get real choppy. Then after finally arriving into Jool orbit....the craft is gone. Just gone... You can go back to the space center and it can\u0027t be found in the tracking center. You can quit game and come back and it is still gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fairness, I was using mechjeb for the Hohmann transfer so that may have been the problem IDK. But after the transfer I killed autopilot and was flying manually at that point. Anyway, when I saw it start getting choppy I hit f5. After realizing no matter what I did the craft wasn\u0027t coming back I held down f9. There\u0027s the craft right where I left it but its still choppy as hell and headed for the same disappearing act as before. So instead of going straight into warp since I was on a path to Jool I decided to hit the \u0022Z\u0022 key to max throttle the engine. As soon as I did that, choppy gone and all was right with the world again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you see this choppy happen...get all over f5 just in case and try to hit \u0022Z\u0022\u00A0to break the chop. Otherwise you could well be out a 1\u00A0million dollar craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-02T14:12:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2016 02:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Brian444444\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qromodynmc","CreatedById":87139,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T14:21:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you discovered teleportation, just dont know where to land yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T14:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhave you got other mods installed? or just mechjeb?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nmight be interesting to see, if after\u00A0a bit of savefile editing to remove mechjeb from the craft, if the same thing happens without MJ present.
