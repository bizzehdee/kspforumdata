I ended up making a vtol to transport kerbals. It has a number of LLL turbo jets on the sides pointing down. Most of the hull is made using the 2x1 lowering cargo bay (I\u0027m a huge fan of this particular part) and for landing gear, it has some skids. I love the parts from the Lack Luster Labs mod. They are very well designed and help me make ships I have wanted to make for a long time but have never had the parts to do so. I will try to post an image of it soon.
