Round off Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s gravity to 10m/s^2. Thus, if your gravity is half of that on Kerbin (5m/s^2), your TWR will be twice as high, and vice versa. The math is easy to do in your head in just a second or two when you start from 10m/s^2 because 10 is a nice round number. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-On interplanetary ships, if you attach your LV-Ns radially on decouplers, as you burn through your fuel you can drop them in pairs to increase your delta-v.
