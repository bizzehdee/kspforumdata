I take a connector from her inventory, move the mouse to where I want the connector to be, and press H to affix it. I left-click, and the connector falls to the ground. I hit G to pick it back up and place it in inventory and then repeat that cycle until I pull my hair out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe connector shows green where I attempt to place it, and I get no \u0022out of range\u0022 message. I have managed to do this successfully before, so I\u0027m thinking I\u0027m hitting a wrong key or doing something out of sequence... but what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) With already-existing connectors, I right click on one to enable Link mode, EVA to the other vessel, and right-click on that connector. No right-click menu appears. I am still within range-- the pipe \u0022carried\u0022 by Hellena is still green, and the connector is not out of reach. Repeated right clicks do not bring up a right-click menu to complete the connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is happening, and what am I doing wrong? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-15T16:37:27Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2015 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MaxwellsDemon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T16:04:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith regard to attaching/detaching things: If you have something in your inventory, drag it out, then hold the X key.
