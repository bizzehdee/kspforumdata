It\u0027s not *quite* mechjeb, but it\u0027s a foundation!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERULES:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. No mods that directly affect gameplay aside from kOS itself. Alternatively, say which gameplay-affecting mods you used, and that\u0027ll be fine too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1a. You\u0027re gonna want to have kOS, obviously (get it \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47399-kOS-Scriptable-Autopilot-System-0-9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E), and another pretty-much-required mod for this is Kerbal Engineer, as you need to know your (vacuum) delta-v before you launch, and after you\u0027re in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. No user input! The only thing you can do is at the beginning of the launch, when you open up the command line, copy the program to the ship, and run it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Your final orbit must have an apoapsis and a periapsis around Kerbin, and both must be outside Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere (that is, 69,078 metres above sea level).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You must have screenshots that show your delta-v from inside the hangar (Engineer shows your in-atmosphere delta-v when in flight mode), and your delta-v after achieving orbit, as well as proof that at least your periapsis is outside the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from that I can\u0027t think of any other restrictions. Your ship can be as large as you like, as complex or simple as you like, and can operate whichever way you like. I\u0027d be impressed to see a robotic spaceplane, myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour score is the difference between your hangar delta-v and your orbital delta-v at the end, so obviously the lower the better. Also while this isn\u0027t required, it\u0027d be super nice for you to post your code alongside your screenshots, help other people figure out the basics of the language. Maybe I can learn a thing or two as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it wouldn\u0027t be a challenge if I didn\u0027t get in on it myself first, now would it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/idQeiLG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022idQeiLG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting delta-v: 4,855 m/s (I play it safe alright)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VKBGtN6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VKBGtN6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GUCuw6M.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GUCuw6M.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GhxPkNG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GhxPkNG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SjTT7TX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SjTT7TX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jR2S77f.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jR2S77f.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal delta-v: 282 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have a score of 4,573 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, here\u0027s my code.
