I have a feeling that the weight of the fuel is too much for the pontoons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\\\u0027s the case, landing anything on it won\\\u0027t be a good idea. I couldn\\\u0027t even manage to cheat it in by driving it from the runway off the beach, which works for most things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other problem is that it\\\u0027s horrible unwieldy and generally does not fly very well. I know it\\\u0027s a VTOL, but it might still need some control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo try making it lighter and giving it more lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best attempt I tried took me around 10 minutes, I dropped from as little as 150m, teasing the throttle, managed to get rid of the backwards momentum by reactivating the engine at the back. Unfortunately there is also sideways momentum that I can\\\u0027t do anything about. If I turn RCS on, I can\\\u0027t control it because I need the avionics on for the thing to be at all flyable. Anyway I managed a landing, downwards velocity around 1m/s with some sideways velocity of around 5m/s. The only thing that survived was the cockpit. Hmm. Wait I have an idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAha, got it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, as above. Go as slowly as possible, had no more than 5m/s total momentum, at last second (8 - 10 metres) deploy the parachutes. This will get rid of all that sideways momentum. Unfortunately, I can\\\u0027t youtube it since the game lags too much with your craft when I try to record, and since precise throttle control is needed, well... yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is another problem though, as attached. There is indeed a weight problem. Those pontoons are rather underwater there.
