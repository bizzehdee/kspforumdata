From launching to Kerbin to all the maneuver nodes, getting into/out of orbit of the moons, the landers getting back to the main ship, Kerbals getting back to the main ship after landing, and that you sent five different Kerbal to the different moons, etc... because from these few pictures I can\u0027t check a lot of things!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, how did you get your Laythe lander on Laythe? How much fuel did you use from the lander before landing? And where did you rendezvous with the main ship then?

To answer your questions, I aerobraked around Laythe in about a 75km orbit, and used probably little more than 50dV, to hit my landing spot. The main ship and all the other transfer ships rendezvoused at Laythe for departure to Kerbin in the main ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose I can re-enact the first part of the mission, and take screen shots\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stanz25","CreatedById":125848,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T02:31:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recreated my Tylo lander and packed it with 6158 dV.

I started my Jool-5/Grand tour mission. Right now i am visiting the other planets but my Jool-5 ship/landers are at Kerbin orbit. The bad thing is that i noticed a major design flaw at my Laythe lander and a tug that i have that will make completion of the mission impossible (forgot a ladder). Can i change the lander and tug with a new one? I will have fixed the design flaw and the design of these 2 units will be almost the same. The balance of this change is that it will make the drive unit and trip to Jool more unstable since the replacement will remove some struts that i have placed for stability\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
