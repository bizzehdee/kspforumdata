Despite not giving a specific date, you\u2019re all way too smart and had a correct hunch for the day we had in mind. Your levels of hype practically matched all of ours within the company for wanting to bring the update to you yesterday. Unfortunately, the devs ended up hitting a snag that stemmed from a Unity update.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;The issue itself is minor, but bothersome enough to your experience to make sure it gets squashed before sending an update out into the world. We\u2019re as disappointed as you are that expectations weren\u2019t met, but the good news is that you won\u2019t be in for as long of a wait this time. As we speak, the devs are on the cusp of smoothing out the issue. From there, that means one last experimental build to test.
