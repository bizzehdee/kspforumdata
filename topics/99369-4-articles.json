Basic economics tells you that you must \u003Cem\u003Eproduce\u003C/em\u003E to keep the economy going ... you cannot all just \u003Cem\u003Econsume. \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means: Industry... and not outsourced industry either. If you have no industry, you produce nothing... there will be no gain, just slow eventual loss. Services and Beyonce\u0027 as a part of your GDP are not a substitute for industry, try as you might. Industry is the cornerstone of a successful economic system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProduction for keeping the economy up - it was 20th century\u0027s rule. Demand called for supply. Now, when we overproducing, supply calles for demand. In 21th century you need consumption, not production to keep the economy afloat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, you go to work (do business) to produce stuff (goods or services) which are sold to others. From the revenue from this you get your share (salary or profit). If no one consumes your stuff, you get no money and cannot consume yourself which in turn leads to someone else\u0027s loss, thus, he consumes less too, and it snowballs. Now, imagine you make smartphones. You make tens of millions of them every year. So, you have to force your customers into buying a new model every year or you would go bankrupt and your workers would lose their jobs. They stop consuming making more manufacturers go bankrupt and this is called economic recession. The problem of the modern civilization is overproduction. Overproduction forces manufacturing companies to go out of their ways to \u0027add value\u0027 - do fancy designs, hire marketologists, ram advertisements everywhere to make you buy and consume the excess production. To help that there is inflation which reduces the value of money to force you spend more. And we cannot quit - it would mean the total collapse of the world economy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LordFerret\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LordFerret\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd, people ARE interested in reliability and prolonged operation ... \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, actually we don\u0027t, we just don\u0027t understand it.

I discuss it with a lot of people I know, from all walks of life. My general impression is that people live with a jaded view, that they\u0027re only bothered with such when it affects them personally.

New generations will live their lives exposed online and they don\u0027t know how it is to be otherwise. If you ever looked at the internet posts of young people you would agree that one stupid post follows by an even more stupid one. They do not care about it, but this stuff will be there forever.

Part of their business model with built-in apps is to provide a basic set of features, that leaves room for third party apps to beat.\u003Cp\u003E Windows Movie Maker, for example, *could* have done so much more than it does/did - intentionally. For the longest time, antivirus was left to third parties. But complaints about attacks always refer to \u0022Microsoft\u0022 having the problem. Eventually they bought another company, and incorporated its tech into Windows Defender, so they could knock out the most common attack vectors that plague computers that had - nothing at all. Antivirus vendors, probably looking at the ruins of Novell and Netscape - were petrified that M$FT would put them out of business with that move, but MSFT left plenty of room for the competition. Windows Defender doesn\u0027t score high in reviews in roundups of antivirus packages, but it is easy, unobtrusive, and much better than nothing - just what they set out to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Around Windows, they built a support system of many different layers, that you have to go through to figure out a problem or get a bug fixed. Online help systems with a press of F1, on up to Technet and MSDN. But the system actually works for a majority of people, or they would not have achieved the level of success that they did.

Can you come back?\u0022 After they left, Bill went to a little local company, Seattle Computer Systems, who recently showed off their 8086 OS, a CP/M lookalike called QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), at a Seattle Computer Club meeting Bill had attended.
