Orbiting by itself the station was fine, but after docking other ships to it and especially transferring fuel, LoX, etc., it\u00A0sometimes starts to wobble, which seems to have connection points as the\u00A0\u0022weak\u0022 areas.\u00A0This will get progressively worse until parts start\u00A0flying off (tanks, large antennas) or it simply explodes.

Autostruts are also the key to a station which violently tears itself apart. So getting a wobble free station involves mastering the arcane arts of autostrut mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen a whole lot of autostruts converge on one part, this creates a concentration of forces which results in the wobble of doom. This will be what tends to happen with root part, and usually heaviest part and in some cases grandparent part, but not in all cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trick is how autostrut combines with symmetry placement. When autostrut\u00A0targets a part with \u0022symmetry siblings\u0022, a strut is created to ALL the symmetry siblings, who knows why, it is just how it works, this works whether the target is \u0022acquired\u0022 via grandparent part or heaviest part (and with heaviest part, it doesn\u0027t matter if some of the syemmtry siblings are less heavy, \u00A0the game first finds the heaviest part,\u00A0which might be a full fuel tank, and then creates autostruts to it and all it\u0027s symmetry siblings, some of which might be empty). This creates a star-like pattern of autostruts which is very strong and wobble resistant. The basic idea then is to make the core of your station a symmetry structure, for example a cross. This can be braced with symmetry autostruts, and whats more when something docks to a symmetry docking port, you can use \u0022grandparent part\u0022 on the docked vessel to connect to all the symmetry siblings of the core:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A8nkoeb.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/A8nkoeb.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022916\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorks well with Heaviest part too:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vxIyArS.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/vxIyArS.png\u0022 width=\u0022813\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnderstand and abuse this game mechanic and you can have rock solid stations which are pretty resistant to wobble of doom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: In general I would advise bracing the \u0022symmetrical core\u0022 with conventional struts.
