Specifically, experience in judging mid-flight if your current flight profile, heading, etc. is what you actually want/need. And experience in building your rocket. You are correct when you say that the flight profile depends a lot on the rocket, but the lessons from the tutorial are still useful. They represent a fairly average rocket. Typical player-built rockets will cluster around it, assuming they are built halfway decently. And thus, a halfway decently built player rocket will actually not fly all that different from the tutorial rocket.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESo, two areas to address: construction, and manual piloting. Let\u0027s start with construction.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIn the editor, did you know that you can click on each stage in the staging list to expand the view a bit? You can even expand the whole staging list at once, and you can customize what info is shown there via the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E tool in the \u003C/span\u003Etoolbar at the bottom. That tool also allows you to switch between sea level and vacuum views, which are important for judging the capabilities of the rocket you are building. One of the figures shown in the expanded staging list is the thrust-weight ratio, or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for short. It\u0027s how fast your rocket accellerates. And this is a very important number for launching, because (all other factors being the same) a rocket that accelerates really hard will tend to fly straight as an arrow, while a rocket that can barely fight against gravity will tend to tip over sideways quite quickly. (There\u0027s even more nuance here in your engine choice, but that\u0027s not really relevant from a newcomer\u0027s perspective.) Try and aim for a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of between 1.4 and 1.5 in the sea level view. When all your rockets have their acceleration in this range, they will all fly very similarly during the first minute of your launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry for a \u0022two stages to orbit\u0022 launch vehicle. Some very simple early-game rockets might be able to fly single-stage, and many later-game rockets may take their second stage well beyond just orbit insertion. But for now, just try to build two stages. You launch stage should contain about 2000 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E (in vacuum view). Don\u0027t sweat if hitting your 1.4-1.5 sea level \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E figure results in a little less or a little more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E than this number, it\u0027s just a very rough guideline. Your second stage should start with a vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of about 1.0, and it will need another 1500-ish m/s of vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to insert into orbit. Any extra \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E it provides beyond that is your budget for flying around and doing your mission. These numbers remain true in all stages of the game, even if you start carrying third and fourth stages and other such tomfoolery. Once in orbit, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E becomes largely irrelevant (beyond your own level of patience).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, manual piloting. To start with, you need to be aware of your sources of information. The altitude in the top middle is obviously quite important, as is the heading display at the bottom of the navball. Next, in the lower left corner, by the pitch/yaw/roll indicators, there\u0027s a column of four buttons. The bottom-most one is purple and named \u0022maneuver mode\u0022. Not \u003Cstrong\u003En\u003C/strong\u003Eode, but \u003Cstrong\u003Em\u003C/strong\u003Eode. Here you see your current apoapsis and periapsis, and the remaining time towards reaching each of them. Additionally, there are tabs at the top, and the second tab will show you your current inclination. Use this second tab to ensure that your inclination is either as close to 0\u00B0 as possible (for equatorial launches) or approaches your desired value (for launches into inclined orbits). If you have a contract that gives you very detailed orbital parameters, you can also find them here and later try to hit them while you are aiming to match the contract orbit. Finally, you can even expand the staging list items again, to receive a constantly updating view of how hard you are accelerating and other such info, though that is not nearly as important as altitude and maneuver mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that in order to make full use of maneuver mode, you may have to upgrade some buildings, if you\u0027re playing career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou activate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, you throttle up to full, and then you launch. Give it a few seconds, and then ever so slightly tip over towards the east (90\u00B0 heading on the navball). You have just performed the \u0022pitchover\u0022 maneuver to initiate the \u0022gravity turn\u0022. A gravity turn is simply the process of your rocket falling over sideways, as pulled by gravity. But if you have the right amount of acceleration to counterbalance this falling over sideways, then you\u0027ll end up with a smoothly curved trajectory that is steep at the start to get some altitude, and very flat towards the end to build up the sideways speed required to get into orbit. Or you would, if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E wasn\u0027t actively fighting to keep your rocket straight. Instead, look at the navball, and the green prograde marker\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:prograde:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/prograde3.png\u0022 title=\u0022:prograde:\u0022\u003E on it. That is where your rocket would be pointing at if it was allowed to follow its natural gravity turn. You should follow this marker with your steering. Ideally, keep your actual heading within the green circle at all times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour goal is to learn to pitch over the right amount at the right moment to match your typical 1.4 to 1.5 sea level \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of your typical rocket. This takes practice, especially since keyboard controls aren\u0027t exactly precise. But there are rules of the thumb you can use to judge if your pitchover was successful. For example, by the time your rocket has tipped over halfway (45 degrees), you should be flying between 10km and 12km of altitude. If it\u0027s a bit above that, don\u0027t sweat it, just throttle down a bit. If it\u0027s below that, you might be in trouble. Either way, if you are unsatisfied with your trajectory, revert to launch and try again. Don\u0027t be ashamed of reverting frequently. As mentioned, the controls aren\u0027t overly precise, and each new rocket will still be a little different. I typically still need 3-4 tries before I can consistently fly a new rocket well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are satisfied with your trajectory, turn your eyes towards the maneuver mode display. Your apoapsis and the time to reach it now becomes important. You want the time to be between 45 and 60 seconds, and you want your final apoapsis to be between 75 and 80 kilometers. If the time to apoapsis is running away from you, throttle down. If your altitude isn\u0027t increasing quickly enough for your liking, throttle up. Orbit insertion happens when your periapsis turns positive and exceeds 70 kilometers. But it\u0027s very unlikely that this will happen in a single burn. Typically, you instead turn of your engines once your apoapsis is at the right height, then coast to it, and then perform an orbit insertion burn to raise the periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut even if you follow all this advice, you might find that it isn\u0027t nearly as easy as I make it sound. Because, for example, your rocket is passively unstable and doesn\u0027t want to follow the prograde marker. Or it flexes and wobbles and randomly rolls around. In that case, you should probably redesign your rocket with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/194996-rocket-starts-rolling-and-pitching-right-after-i-start-turning-east/#comment-3808480\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ecommon best practices\u003C/a\u003E in mind. Well-built rockets can follow the prograde marker on their own, with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E turned off, but this is not always viable depending on your payload. But you can certainly make your rocket very benign and easy to steer with very little effort, once you know how.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, learn to love \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Hold Prograde.

In that case, you can probably get away with as flat a trajectory as you have engine thrust for. The only reason to ever fly straight up is to clear the terrain and avoid too much atmospheric drag. But Duna\u0027s atmosphere is thin, and the actual \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E loss from aerodynamic drag is a minor factor even on Kerbin, with rocket stability being a much larger reason for good aerodynamics. On a gut feeling, I\u0027d probably quicksave, then turn over 45 degrees immediately after taking off, and then see if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Hold Prograde will do the job. Keep an eye on apoapsis altitude. The atmosphere ends at 50 km, so you\u0027d aim for 55-60 km. Throttle down and flatten out as you approach that number, until you have only a small orbit insertion burn left. You\u0027ll probably need around 2.5 to 3.0 Duna-local \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E from the get-go to make this trajectory work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for on-orbit rendezvous? That\u0027s an entire chapter in and of itself, but your launch can definitely make it easier later-on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor starters, you want to launch into the orbit of your target spacecraft. If that spacecraft is in an equatorial orbit, and you have landed on the equator? Well then, the problem just solved itself. Just launch directly eastward as you would on Kerbin. But if either or both of those conditions are not true, then it gets more complicated, unless you have a large amount of spare \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to spend on plane changes in orbit. First, go to the vessel you want to rendezvous with, and look at the maneuver mode readout for the inclination. Then return to your landed vessel. To launch into an inclined orbit, turn your camera in map view so that the target orbit directly crosses over Duna\u0027s center. Then, time warp until your landed vessel is almost directly under the target orbit. Now add or subtract the target\u0027s inclination to/from your typical eastward launch heading. For example, if your target spacecraft is in a 10\u00B0 inclined orbit, and it passes from north to south over your landed craft, then your heading should be 100\u00B0 (90\u002B10, since 0\u00B0 is north and 180\u00B0 is south). Launch, and use the maneuver mode readout to monitor your inclination as you make your way to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoing this minimizes the on-orbit plane change you need to make later. There are cases though where this doesn\u0027t work, for example if you landed away from the equator but your target spacecraft is in an equatorial orbit. Then your lander will never be \u0022under\u0022 the target\u0027s trajectory. If this happens, just launch directly eastward when you are as close as possible to your target orbit. You will automatically drift into an inclined orbit, which you will have to fix later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRendezvous are also made quicker and easier if your two spacecraft are close together from the start. So you want to launch when your target spacecraft is just a few degrees short of passing directly overhead. Try for a 10\u00B0 angle for starters. But, you might notice that this conflicts with the previous advice. If you must launch when directly under your target\u0027s orbit, then you may not be able to wait until the target is close by. In that case, prioritize hitting the orbit. Having a very similar orbit but being far apart is easier (and cheaper) to fix than being close together but on wildly divergent orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to how to perform the rendezvous itself, there are many well-illustrated guides on the forum, with pictures and sometimes even video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022

In that case, you can probably get away with as flat a trajectory as you have engine thrust for. The only reason to ever fly straight up is to clear the terrain and avoid too much atmospheric drag. But Duna\u0027s atmosphere is thin, and the actual \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E loss from aerodynamic drag is a minor factor even on Kerbin, with rocket stability being a much larger reason for good aerodynamics. On a gut feeling, I\u0027d probably quicksave, then turn over 45 degrees immediately after taking off, and then see if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Hold Prograde will do the job. Keep an eye on apoapsis altitude. The atmosphere ends at 50 km, so you\u0027d aim for 55-60 km. Throttle down and flatten out as you approach that number, until you have only a small orbit insertion burn left. You\u0027ll probably need around 2.5 to 3.0 Duna-local \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E from the get-go to make this trajectory work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for on-orbit rendezvous? That\u0027s an entire chapter in and of itself, but your launch can definitely make it easier later-on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor starters, you want to launch into the orbit of your target spacecraft. If that spacecraft is in an equatorial orbit, and you have landed on the equator? Well then, the problem just solved itself. Just launch directly eastward as you would on Kerbin. But if either or both of those conditions are not true, then it gets more complicated, unless you have a large amount of spare \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to spend on plane changes in orbit. First, go to the vessel you want to rendezvous with, and look at the maneuver mode readout for the inclination. Then return to your landed vessel. To launch into an inclined orbit, turn your camera in map view so that the target orbit directly crosses over Duna\u0027s center. Then, time warp until your landed vessel is almost directly under the target orbit. Now add or subtract the target\u0027s inclination to/from your typical eastward launch heading. For example, if your target spacecraft is in a 10\u00B0 inclined orbit, and it passes from north to south over your landed craft, then your heading should be 100\u00B0 (90\u002B10, since 0\u00B0 is north and 180\u00B0 is south). Launch, and use the maneuver mode readout to monitor your inclination as you make your way to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoing this minimizes the on-orbit plane change you need to make later. There are cases though where this doesn\u0027t work, for example if you landed away from the equator but your target spacecraft is in an equatorial orbit. Then your lander will never be \u0022under\u0022 the target\u0027s trajectory. If this happens, just launch directly eastward when you are as close as possible to your target orbit. You will automatically drift into an inclined orbit, which you will have to fix later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRendezvous are also made quicker and easier if your two spacecraft are close together from the start. So you want to launch when your target spacecraft is just a few degrees short of passing directly overhead. Try for a 10\u00B0 angle for starters. But, you might notice that this conflicts with the previous advice. If you must launch when directly under your target\u0027s orbit, then you may not be able to wait until the target is close by. In that case, prioritize hitting the orbit. Having a very similar orbit but being far apart is easier (and cheaper) to fix than being close together but on wildly divergent orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to how to perform the rendezvous itself, there are many well-illustrated guides on the forum, with pictures and sometimes even video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you\u00A0 for your detailed reply \u003Cspan\u003E:-)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe problem is that to win the scenario, you are using a ship with very little \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E so you have to be efficient. \u003Cspan\u003E:-(\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-05T04:30:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223814876\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195317\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593882474\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyes, because you are a better engineer than i am *\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut i\u0027ve totaled enough hours and built enough crafts that i can\u0027t really be called a beginner anymore (except for some specialized parts of this game, like building and flying plane, that i didn\u0027t spend much time on). hence, if i cannot make a fire and forget rocket, it means it\u0027s difficult. hence, i would not suggest it to one who has problems with the basics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlet him learn to make passable rockets before he can make excellent rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat?!
