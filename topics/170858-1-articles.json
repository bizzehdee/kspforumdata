It looks great and all was going well until the testing phase. Something on the inside is flopping around and causing explosions. However that\u0027s not the reason for my post. It\u0027s that normally mirror mode allows me to place landing gear on the bottom side of the right wing and mirror it to the exact same spot on the bottom side of the left wing. Unfortunately it\u0027s currently mirroring things in a really painful way on the craft. Using the previous example the landing gear is mirroring to the top side of the left wing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid I hit the wrong red button to cause it to function this way? I\u0027d really appreciate it if you could tell me how to change it back to normal. I\u0027ve been taking apart and putting this craft back togetheragain for the last 3 hours trying to figure out what\u0027s not connected right on the inside and placing everything individually on each side and trying to eyeball it to make sure it matches is probably going to cause all new problems by the time I figure out what currently wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the help. =)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-13T13:16:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003EMoved from KSP Discussion\u003C/span\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the problem is the wing has some how gotten the idea, that it is in Radial symmetry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll probably have to pull the wing off and reattach it in Mirror symmetry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-13T16:55:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup, or attach the wheels one at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
