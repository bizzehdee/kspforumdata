There\\\u0027s the Kitan 3, which is a simple crew ferry, there\\\u0027s the Kitan 1, which is a simple midsize cargo ferry, and then there\\\u0027s the Kitan 2, the heavy lifter. For the first 200,000 m of altitude, everything works perfectly. However, once I fire up the second stage, no matter what I do, the nose invariably creeps up. I\\\u0027ve tried everything. IT just doesn\\\u0027t go down. I\\\u0027m well out of the atmosphere, so it can\\\u0027t be that CoG/CoP stuff- what is going on?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tofof","CreatedById":8948,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-30T07:38:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think what you\\\u0027re not realizing is that as you push away from the earth (orthogonally to a radius to it) the horizon gets lower and lower, resulting in the appearance of the nose creeping up but what\\\u0027s actually happening is that the horizon is falling down. The normal SAS modules will do this to you (throw SAS on and sit back for an orbit and watch your attitude relative to the earth go through the entire 360, since it\\\u0027s holding your attitude fixed relative to an infinitely distant point).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ivan Ivanovich","CreatedById":8977,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-30T10:46:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed the same effect on very long rockets, and I can reassure you it\\\u0027s not SAS trying to point somewhere. Either that or SAS chooses a lot of points during this procedure, since the rocket does spin a full circle... and not just one. Actually, the issue is a more intriguing one. I try to align my rocket with a certain plane so it only spins left/right or up/down, and I try to correct it, with no success whatsoever. Turning SAS on actually remedies the problem eventually... but only as long as I keep SAS on, else the rocket resumes its spinning. For no good reason, I might add, since I have long left the atmosphere and every kind of propulsion is turned off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shadowfax","CreatedById":3742,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-30T14:32:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause stopping all spin means that you will spin relative to the planet, whereas SAS tries (I think) to keep your orientation constant relative to the planet. Say you\\\u0027re in a polar orbit, and you start at the equator at an exact tangent to the planet. As your orbit carries you over the pole, if your rocket isn\\\u0027t spinning, you\\\u0027ll still be oriented the same direction you were when you were at the equatorial tangent, but because you\\\u0027re over the pole, your rocket is now facing either directly toward or directly away from the planet. You appear to have spun 90 degrees, but you really didn\\\u0027t. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AtomicRocketBooster","CreatedById":2680,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-30T14:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee, I recognize it when that happens. But this is far more extreme than that. If I take SAS off, often times I\\\u0027ll just start tumbling and end up pointing back towards the planet. The velocity vector is what creeps up when I shoot off into deep space, the nose should be more or less in line with that. But it doesn\\\u0027t work that way, and it\\\u0027s only my really big, long rockets that do this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shadowfax","CreatedById":3742,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-30T14:42:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if it\\\u0027s a timing issue. If you disengage SAS when it\\\u0027s applying a force, then it can\\\u0027t apply an opposing force to compensate for the fact that the force it was applying when you disengaged it was too high. Put in terrestrial terms, if you swerve your car violently to the left, and then take your hands off the wheel, you won\\\u0027t end up going the direction you wanted to go because you stopped applying inputs before the necessary counter-steer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
