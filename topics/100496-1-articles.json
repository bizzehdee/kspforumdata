(more info might help too, like what parts you\u0027re trying to decouple from what parts, etc)"},{"CreatedByName":"lextacy","CreatedById":107955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T07:25:48Z","Content":"there are 3 Slydias in a stack sort of acting as a vertical truss at the same time being decouplers.

Mod makers really need to watch their collision meshes so they are relaxed a bit to allow flexible placement with other parts.\n\n Ona side-note that answers this threads OP..... using the mod called Kaboom rectifies the situations if they do come up in the future. All things well!"}]}
