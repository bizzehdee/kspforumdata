I\u0027m not sure where you live, but over here you can get a Radeon R7 240 with 1GB DDR3 for \u20AC50. With that kind of dedicated GPU, you can expect a performance improvement of... well... about 30%. If you want to double your graphics power, you\u0027ll need to look at a R7 250 or a Geforce GT 740... with GDDR5, in both cases. That\u0027ll be \u20AC75. Honestly a better deal in every respect, but also a larger absolute sum. You\u0027ll see that repeated as you go up the card class ladder; the price-performance-sweetspot isn\u0027t until around \u20AC125.
