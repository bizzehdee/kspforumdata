The command pod separates from the main ship and performs the skip entry maneuver; after which the capsule leaves the atmosphere again, now having a ballistic trajectory that leads to the KSC, with an apoapsis of 100-200 kilometers. Finally, the craft enters the atmosphere again, north of KSC and coasts southwards until finally landing in the sea near the KSC to easily be retrieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life, it was planned to be used on the soviet LK return capsule which also braked over the south pole of earth to land in Kazakhstan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently i have no pics because i currently don\u0027t have access to KSP but as soon as i will be able to play the game again i will post a mission report involving this technique in the fan works section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts, opinions and field trial reports welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T18:35:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis question about gameplay moved to the gameplay questions sub-forum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while I\u0027m here, are you suggesting an aerobrake maneuver which results in the ship making a hop to a higher altitude and then falling again for a final descent on the same orbital pass? Because I\u0027m pretty sure that won\u0027t work. In KSP, the capsule will not be redirecated upward. But perhaps I\u0027m misunderstanding what you\u0027re suggesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedwedianPresident","CreatedById":12212,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T19:01:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI mean similar to aerobraking, yes, the only thing is that the initial velocity is less and that the periapsis is approximately 30 kilometres above the surface south of KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T19:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not similar to aerobraking, it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E aerobraking.

That results in a gentle slowdown from the high return speed to the final landing. Apollo did the same as the capsule didn\u0027t contain the resources for a skip return while too steep a reentry would destroy the capsule with high g forces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
