With the old method some overpowered engines were just really cheap. With the current method the addon developers don\u0027t need to balance their parts in that regard, because I use a formular to calculate that for them. The downside of the current approach is, that it is not possible to create a part that is expensive because of technology / whatever used in that part. I could fix this by creating a separate list that defines the costs for some parts.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/er448ur6x07ogy6/missioncontroller.v0.10.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EDOWNLOAD FROM MEDIAFIRE\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download\u0026amp;id=0BzavO3XchdO1WXVjLUhiWk5wT1U\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EDOWNLOAD FROM GOOGLE DRIVE\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EInstallation and usage:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EExtract the archive into the GameData directory\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPress on the \u0022MC\u0022 icon on the bottom\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESelect the mission package\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPreview the missions and select a mission\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFinish the mission\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EMission packages:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/nt-space-program-mission-controll-mission-pack/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENT Space Program from NoJeb\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour mission package missing?

I was actually about to suggest a feature to be able to \u0022accept\u0022 several missions at the same time (maybe additional \u0022active missions\u0022 screen), so you won\u0027t have to select them back and forth all the time. The main idea for this is that players can *try* to achieve more that one missions at the same time, if they think they can make it. It\u0027s a good option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, have you played \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrins_Race_Into_Space\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBARIS\u003C/a\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe menu and mission menus need to be accessible from within the Space Center.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s obvious that this feature is planned, and is currently absent cuz this is only an alpha version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would suggest focusing on the functionality of the plugin, then branching out into more difficult missions, etc.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think lots of people will suggest their help with making new missions for this mod.
