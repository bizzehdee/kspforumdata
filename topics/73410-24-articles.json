Since it\u0027s using corrected TWR, it feels overpowered (generally) compared to stock, with the exception of the NTR engines. Those now feel massively underpowered thanks to their mass. But this is more accurate. NTRs (especially low TL ones) can only be used as orbital engines. And they\u0027ll cost you a lot to get them into orbit. Once you get to TL 7 and 8, though, the mass comes way down. The TWR is around 8 times higher compared to TL3, and most of that is mass savings (IIRC).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t like that balance, set the useRealisticMass back to true, and use Kerbal Isp Difficulty Scaler (KIDS) to adjust the Isp down to something that feels right for your preferred game.

Since stock parts are about 64% the size of their real counter parts, and Kerbin is about 1/10th the size of Earth, you end up with a great fit.

As I said, RF _is_ backwards compatible with EngineIgnitor configurations done inside ModuleEngineConfig CONFIG nodes. Which RF Stockalike \u003Cem\u003Edoes do.\u003C/em\u003E It just has a persistent typo which means they\u0027ve never worked as such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo no, RF Stockalike does not require an overhaul to make its ignitions and ullage compatible with RF 10.4\u002B; it merely needs the typo corrected, and that typo has nothing to do with changes in RF.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESvm420: Generally speaking, by role/era:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Early engines have one ignition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Lifter engines have one ignition, unless they\u0027re meant to land returning stages (there\u0027s no technical reason these days they can\u0027t have multiple ignitions, it\u0027s cost/mass saying only one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Upper stage engines used as second stages (not for final orbital insertion or BLEO operations) have one igniton. C.f. Titan LR91 or Proton\u0027s second stage. But see 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Upper stage engines used for orbital insertion \u003Cem\u003Ethese days\u003C/em\u003E have multiple ignitions. Merlin 1D Vac is an example, as is RL10 or the RD-58 on Blok D. This is because it\u0027s often more efficient to make multiple burns to orbit. These engines often also serve for BLEO orbital injection (GTO, trans-lunar, escape) where you want to have a parking orbit first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Orbital maneuvering engines generally have lots of ignitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy propellant type and cycle:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines with hypergolic propellants don\u0027t have to worry about igniting their propellants in the combustion chamber. Pressure-fed engines don\u0027t have to worry about spinning up their turbopumps when there\u0027s no combustion going on, they just open the valves. For this reason, most orbital maneuvering engines are pressure-fed hypergolic engines, and pretty much all RCS is either that or pressure-fed monopropellant (needs at most catalyzing)--there\u0027s no real difference between, say, the Lunar Module\u0027s ascent engine and its RCS other than size and chamber pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines that don\u0027t have hypergolic propellants, even if they\u0027re pressure-fed, have to worry about ignition, either a limited supply of hypergolic ignition cartridges, or a spark plug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines that are pump-fed have to worry about somehow starting their pumps (which requires starting their generators/preburners) before fuel flow. That\u0027s possible, but it\u0027s much more complex than \u0022open the valves.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr lifter engines have 1 ignition except in rare cases; upper stages have 1-3 or so, or, if reused as orbital taxis, 3-15. Pressure-fed hypergolic orbital engines often have effectively unlimited ignitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENOTE: All the above are subject to ullage.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a myth that Just. Won\u0027t. Die. that pressure-fed engines don\u0027t have to worry about ullage. They do, except in the rare circumstances where their propellant tanks are small enough (and the need to have them work sans ullaging great enough), like RCS, that there\u0027s actually a membrane in the tank to separate the propellant and the pressurant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, the Apollo SPS (and the LMDE and LMAE) were subject to ullage concerns, despite being pressure-fed hypergolics. Their RCS were fed from tanks with membranes, and that\u0027s why the RCS didn\u0027t have to worry about ullage, not because of pressurization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe differences are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormal tanks (pressurized to around 2atm): needs ullaging, works only with pump-fed engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighly-pressurized tanks for pressure-fed engines (much higher pressurization): needs ullaging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMembrane (or surface-tension, another method) tanks with highly-pressurized propellants: small, heavy, but don\u0027t have to worry about ullage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T03:09:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 03:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NathanKell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allenby","CreatedById":144246,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T05:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried the suggested ModuleEngineIgnitor edit on a few of the Stockalike engines and can\u0027t seem to get ignition/ullage to appear in-game.
