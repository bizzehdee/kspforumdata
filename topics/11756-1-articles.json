I\\\u0027m no stranger to mods so any mods that could clean up its look would be awesome. also is there any parts pack that has a smaller rectangle/square piece fit for building, folding triangles isn\\\u0027t my thing. Also i\\\u0027d need such a piece to finish intake building as the stock parts are huge.\n\nhave fun flying and improving this f-14\n\nupdating craft files for .52. it seems i can get away with more wing folding now and less planes sinking into the runway or exploding on load\n\nas always I\\\u0027m looking for \u0027top men\u0027 \\*or women?\\* to improve this project."},{"CreatedByName":"Dobrodav","CreatedById":25028,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T14:50:13Z","Content":"Looks like it changes wing geometry - right ?\n\nI see - thats very cool.

As you can tell there\\\u0027s no clear way to push this project further \\*as far as i can tell\\* without finding A: Super glue for rotating parts B: Ultra light parts or C: smaller parts to combat weight distribution and the lever effect on joints.\n\ni did do some tinkering when i got home and found that the plane flies just as well without the front wing flaps. I also simplified the wings while still keeping its shape, managed to shave off 2 parts per wing (magic and spells I know). it seems like i should go on a mod shopping spree to find wings that fit my needs and smaller \u0027building blocks\u0027.\n\nanyways thanks for the feedback and I\\\u0027m looking forward to seeing some craft files."},{"CreatedByName":"zack2014","CreatedById":17837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T01:07:42Z","Content":"My original F-14 is somewhere here in the SE, but I\\\u0027ve been updating it slowly."},{"CreatedByName":"StelarCF","CreatedById":13985,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T12:31:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E there\\\u0027s a part in the damned aerospace mod that attaches between body and wings that allows the wings to change angle. so yup it changes geometry.\n\u003E \n\u003E the sacrifice for using such a part is that i cant use the stock kerbal glue on the wings\n\nCorrection: Damned Robotics\n\nCorrection: You can still use struts."},{"CreatedByName":"DYJ","CreatedById":8636,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T12:42:18Z","Content":"Double correction: The swingwing bit is indeed in the aerospace pack, although there are several parts in the robotics pack that could do the same.\n\nDouble correction: You can\\\u0027t really use struts on moving parts since that impedes the movement."},{"CreatedByName":"b0bl00i","CreatedById":1642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T14:54:33Z","Content":"Looks fcking epic ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"tadeass","CreatedById":16874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T15:10:56Z","Content":"I like that!"}]}
