Its possible I might have found a way past the issue. I do get the error while on the Launch Pad, but if I then go into the HECS module in the Parts Manager, and disable and re-enable it, the module status goes from \u0022No Commnet Connection\u0022 to \u0022Disabled\u0022, to All Good (dont remember the exact status name). So I think this is just a bug.
