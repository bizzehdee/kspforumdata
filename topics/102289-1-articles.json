I\u0027ve noticed that every time i quickload, my navball nodes do not match the actual direction of the craft. In other words, if i\u0027m pointing prograde, or radial etc, my ship will not actually thrust in that direction. I solve this by leaving the seat and boarding again after each quickload. That seems to reset the navball nodes to the correct orientation.\n\nI just wanted to bring attention to this little bug.\n\nEDIT:\n\nMy game just crashed with that same craft landed on minmus and my kerbal on eva. It\u0027s asking me to send you guys an error report.\n\nUpon reloading the game, the craft is still on minmus, but the kerbal has disappeared. When i reload the last quicksave, the game crashed again.\n\nhere it is:\n\n[my error report](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pnusu050bco4wpr/AAAKSPCPmmHuGN_A5cbRaNv9a?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-19T23:45:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2015 11:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hobbez**"}]}
