Scott Manley, Macey Dean, Matt Lowne all seem to have done this, so odds are it\u0027s a stock feature, but all of my scrounging around for it has been unsuccessful. When setting up a maneuvre node, they seem to be able to focus the camera on the celestial body that they\u0027re going to, and any adjustments they make will show the maneuvre\u0027s orbital path in relation to the planet.
