I hit the wall and mash the Kerb on the wall until he is hanging half out his seat. I recover the situation just before the bottom, then I thrust up and make good headway, running out of fuel just before the top. I have RCS in the Kerb so I try to get him to exit his seat to RCS back to the rover but he is stuck!! Eventually up motion turns to down motion and after accelerating to 100ms he smashes to death with me still trying to save him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I need to think about the third decent. I think I can get back up with only 30% fuel but I need a reserve for the refuel manouvre with the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y32/RusEvo/1MH_zpsf0e04765.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221MH_zpsf0e04765.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y32/RusEvo/2MH_zpse5c74e38.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222MH_zpse5c74e38.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y32/RusEvo/3MH_zps1d4e5c14.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223MH_zps1d4e5c14.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y32/RusEvo/4MH_zps56fe7d38.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224MH_zps56fe7d38.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rus-Evo","CreatedById":107004,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T15:36:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y32/RusEvo/5MH_zps0e95fa32.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225MH_zps0e95fa32.jpg\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T15:49:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI apologize, but shouldn\u0027t it be \u0027descent\u0027 rather than \u0027decent\u0027?
