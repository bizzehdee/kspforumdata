Considering one would be working on Minmus, the other ferrying fuel between Minmus and LKO, that was a reasonable idea. And since both were built similarly, identical \u0022chassis\u0022 and only different payload (one - extra fuel tanks, the other - big cargo bays filled with machinery, ore containers etc) it stood to reason that if I attach docking ports in respective places, I should be able to drive one up to the other and \u0022dock\u0022 to transfer the newly made fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept I hit some bug. I tested this on Kerbin, and the two vehicles would at first refuse to dock. Then docking happened... except control wasn\u0027t returned with both vehicles made one. I still controlled one, while the other would stay fixed to a place - that\u0027s an interesting notice, as when I switched vehicles, I could make the wheels bend and eventually even break off as they pushed against the ground while the vehicle stood fixed in place. I could start the engines, but they wouldn\u0027t move me. The docked vehicle would fight against the dock. Generally, while everything worked, one vehicle would remain in a fixed position in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s worse, that bug propagated onto later instances; suddenly it hit me mid-flight and left me stuck in one position in space, stopped in the orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this some known issue - just \u0022don\u0027t dock on the ground\u0022?

Partly because it\u0027s difficult to align the docks and you need a lot of field test and returns to VAB/SPH to correct dock position etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut a bigger problem is gravity. Fuel transfer, which is a major reason to use surface docking in the first place can cause docks to mis-align. Once you transfer fuel between craft and undock, you may find it impossible to dock them again because one of them is now heavier and it\u0027s dock sits lower than before. Similarly the other craft is lighter and it\u0027s dock moves up. This problem can strike even before you dock them. If you test docking on Kerbin and succed, you may fail at docking the same two craft on Minmus for example, because the gravity is much weaker there causing suspension to compress less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ideal way to perform temporary surface docking is to use a clawed tanker vehicle and design vehicles that will be targetted by the claw with enough clean space for the claw to attach. The claw doesn\u0027t like landing legs, sticcking batteries, panels or such small and fiddly parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, never driver a vehicle into the claw, as that is a surefire way to cause major issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to game limitations and my previous experience, i try to construct \u0022base\u0022 buildings as self sufficient, wheeled vehicles without any intention of ever docking them together. Wheels because it\u0027s easier to move it on it\u0027s own power once i decide it\u0027s not in the perfect location. I also keep the part count low at the expense of aesthetics and prefer to keep no \u0022buildings\u0022 closer than 3km to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been very strange bugs regarding craft docked on the surface. Going back 2 years i remember having problems and usually explosions. The game doesn\u0027t like having the ground nearby when calculating the new CoM of the combined craft. Even worse if one was substantially lighter than the other, or used lightweight parts between it\u0027s own CoM and the docking port (for example to extend or raise it\u0027s position, clear wheels/other parts). Kraken summoning almost guaranteed if one craft used clipping, even minor clipping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had a 5t rover flip and launch a 80t fuel tanker almost a kilometer high after docking. This was on Kerbin. Docking ports are weird and buggy. Juniors are worst offenders in my experience. So in the end i try to avoid docking altogether and use claws for surface refuelling. As wonky as claws are, they are safer!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T09:53:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Ferdoni: Launchpad, runway, field next to the runway... the results were the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@LBG: Yep, I don\u0027t know if it was the same bug or another but later on things took a turn for bizarre. I had sent a craft with a probe to Minmus to perform an orbital scan. My overly efficient launch platform still had enough fuel to bring my probe carrier to Minmus; they separated shortly before entering Minmus SOI, the launcher platform aligning for crash into Kerbin, the carrier entering polar orbit at 26km. Probe deployed, mission complete, carrier with 90% of fuel left, let\u0027s leave it somewhere where it would be usable later - just for fun I landed the carrier craft on Minmus (*almost* successfully; it broke in half but didn\u0027t fall apart; it stands vertically on its engine slightly misaligned in the middle, a Kerbal monument on Minmus.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must have angered some gods of Minmus. I struggled with constructing these two landers, performed some orbital science in Minmus orbit, reloaded several times (not the game, just save) until I gave up as the lander would freeze in orbit, and finally I realized on top of that one returning lander platform, I have 3 different crafts returning from Minmus. All they were the scanner probes still within carrier and the last stage of the launch platform attached. And as I\u0027d switch to any of them, it would explode within a minute or so, and not even show the common courtesy to turn into debris, but show up as 20 or so \u0022probes\u0022, including \u0022probes\u0022 that consisted of a single metal grider. And they kept floating in space refusing to move in the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA long time later I got the idea to quit and reload, and they all started moving, along their crash trajectory. Finally the sky is down to standard junk. And the lander (fuel truck) is unlocked.
