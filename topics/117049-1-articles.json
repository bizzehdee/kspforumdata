I have seen this too, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be causing any real problems and everything appears normal after leaving and returning to the craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T12:00:28Z","Content":"They are not separate issues.\n\nI thought I had made that clear in my original statement."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T19:21:14Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129800-Craft-exploding-while-passing-over-poles](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129800-Craft-exploding-while-passing-over-poles)\n\nSee my last post.
