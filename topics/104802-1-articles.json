Mem leaks, decoupler crap, map view bugs, kraken attacks, ect ect ect. While i am very happy for every single feature theyre adding, nothing beats actually FIXING whats broken!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm also hoping (there was a hint of this somewhere) that they actually made some performance improvements especially to loading times, memory useage, ect. Perhaps if we are very luvcky the entre game will run a little faster with more parts too, as my biggest annoyance is the utter unplayeability of over 1000 parts within the draw range. I do what i can to make all my ships below 400 parts, but its very tough to actually make a battlecruiser without going into 1000\u002B pats if only for the sheer size and amount of structural panels for the outer hull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, of the actual new features (i doubt bu fixes are technically a feature), i have to say the aerodynamics makes me most excited. While i was never big on making real world replicas oir realistic craft, i never understood why i could survive a 50km/s reentry straight vertical? Same with the atmo behavior being mass based drag (i can have a giant WALL of structural panels and itll fly fine provided enough lift/wings), so im hoping it at least makes the game more plausible, but at the same time doesnt necessarily limit absurd stuff, just makes them use more fuel to beat drag ect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the rest, its just additional stuff that i never thought would actually be in game, stuff like mining, not a feature i plan to go all out and abuse (i enjoy designing stuff for insane ranges without any refuel needs), is still welcome and something i have to try (and the 1st thing for mining is testing if its possible to mine a fuel tank or a kerbal even). Then there are female kerbals which will SO come in handy for my lunar corporation replica base. Given they only used female clones or something as soldiers, the maleish kerbals just dont fit there at all. And of theres the new landing gear, wings, ect. WIngs are most likely going to end up as low part count capital ship hull armoring, given that right now regardless of what you choose, be it wings, structural panels, or whatever, you just cant make low part count starship hulls in the scale that it can actually be called a starship when beside a fighter replica. landing gear is also nice, and perhaps we will get some way to actually work with largeish planes now both the landing gear as well as the wings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, aside from aerodynamics and bugfixes, everything here is at least in my opinion free extra stuff i never expected to get in the game stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wolfedg","CreatedById":58442,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T02:08:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy top 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
