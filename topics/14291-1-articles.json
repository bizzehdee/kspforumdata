Wow, am I impressed! I\\\u0027ve been building (and blowing up) rockets all day now! Great game, and it looks to have a great community as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked through one of the wiki\\\u0027s and I was pointed to a link for some Additional add-ons, which greatly helped. I was finally able to get something into orbit, and even got a Lunar module to crash land on the moon. Which actually brings me to my first question ... Is there any way of saving a game mid-flight, so after you botch a landing, or accidently activate the next stage prematurely, you can go back and practice it again? Would help my flight practice quite a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, any \u0027Must-have\u0027 add-ons that I should download? I got the one that gave me quite a few Atlas/Ares engines and builds plus some Lunar Module components. Any others I should get?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll be poking around more often, so great to be here! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-14T11:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have the paid version, you can quicksave and reload with F5/F9 like in other games. It also allows you to go back to the space center without ending the flight, the ship will be saved then (and continue orbiting if it\\\u0027s in an orbit). Only limitation is that you need to be on the ground and not moving if you are in an athmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-14T17:47:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPro Tip: Using the Stage Lock(ALT-L) will prevent accidental staging.

Every now and then the rocket just decides it wants to nose dive back into the ground. My most successful launches only seem to come from the pre-built add-on packages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
