Not sure how this one will go, but hopefully it will be fun!\n\nSo, the way it works is, someone posts any action, any daily task, pretty much anything that people do (appropriate please), and then the next poster tells them how to do it **the kerbal way.** Example:\n\n**Poster 1:** Brushing my teeth\n\n**Poster 2:** Brushing your teeth with rocket fuel, and rinsing your mouth with oxidizer.\n\nEating breakfast\n\n**Poster 3:** Eating a healthy balanced breakfast of perfectly balanced ball bearings and bolts.\n\ndriving a car\n\n**Rules**\n\nPlease Follow these rules while playing.\n\n1: Obey all Forum Rules\n\n2: Always post an action for the next poster to use\n\n3: Always tell how to do the previous posters action the kerbal way\n\n4: Have Fun!\n\nGet it? Got it? good! Lets have some fun, The Kerbal Way!\n\nI\u0027ll start us off.
