I would like it to base the time difference off of the returned funds so that, with kethane or karbonite, you could mine and recover the spoils of your expedition. I would also like it to make karbonite, if installed, to have a recovery value that is slightly lower than kethane, and kethane to be worth more than oxidizer and liquid fuel. I know that this is probably going to require some major permissions and might even require kerbal construction time to be downloaded in addition. If at all possible, I would like to have a link to a download sometime in the near future (before the summer of 2015). If not, that\u0027s okay; I don\u0027t want anyone to be overburdened. thanks for reading and I hope you will consider taking this project on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kesa","CreatedById":130333,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T00:47:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVessels/parts recovery is already very well handled by KCT (Parts and crafts inventories), but sure that\u0027s a very good idea, and KCT is a great mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDunno what do you mean with ressources. don\u0027t they already return funds? Would you like to use them directly for builing (not selling them and reducing time construction)? Imo the time to process raw materials into rocket should be the same, no matter if that materials come from the earth or from anywhere else (what\u0027s more, Kethane is meant to be a fuel like ressource, and already can be processed in situ).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
