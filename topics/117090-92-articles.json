And honestly, using the soyuz launcher and a *single* RL10-A-3 upper stage, I was having trouble making it small enough.  Even with a high liftoff TWR I ended up with over 1 km/s of leftover delta-v after making a 180 km orbit around Kerbin.  So I\u0027m entirely unsure of why you think more thrust is needed.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E E: Oh and [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) I think the Soyuz service module could have its thrust cut by at least a factor of 2 - It\u0027s like 0.66 with the orbital and descent modules as it is which is way more than necessary for orbital operations.\n\u003E \n\nNoted and added to the todo-list; you have any stats on what the real thrust of it would be?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E will be available through steam for anyone who bought it on steam, they will announce when the beta will start\n\u003E \n\nNoted, and good to know ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  I don\u0027t check the front page very often.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 23 hours ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe one of the Squad staff [@NathanKell](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75006-nathankell/) could get you early access, being a modder.\n\u003E \n\nThanks, but apparently I\u0027ll be able to get at least a bit of a head-start via the steam pre-releases; I\u0027ve still got plenty of stuff to finish-up in the mean-time, so no rush ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 hours ago, davidy12 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you could make a stock remake of re-adjusting the stock Mk1-2 CM IVA... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d ***DIE*** of happiness.
