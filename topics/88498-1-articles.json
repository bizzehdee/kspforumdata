It was flying very stable and nice and slow, say, 50 m/s, vertical speed very low, few meters above the ground. I crashed so I reloaded and upon reloading the crash is instantaneous. Every time I reload the speed and altitude seem to be random, I get for example 130 m/s. On every reload the crash seems more and more violent. In the last one the pilot survived and I saw he was clipped into the terrain, and saw in the map that debris had flown out of Kerbin orbit. When switching to them, the game crashed. Crash report attached. I suppose this is a game issue, not a mod issue, but I have fine print, mechjeb, toolbar, scansat, AGM, StageRecovery and SelectRoot.
