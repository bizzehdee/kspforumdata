Thanks to the new heat system you don\u0027t want to tweak the heat production (which is fixed and doesn\u0027t vary with the part temperature, which is the factor that determine when a steady state is reached) but the conductivity and the radiation constant in the .cfg. An engine as low conductivity since you don\u0027t want that heat to leave the engine up the stack (but if you want to give more option to the player this can be left unchanged and a separate part with low conductivity can be made) and an high radiation which abstracts both the fuel leaving the engine and blackbody radiation. If the parameters are correct the engine will get hotter and hotter, even in \u0022hoverheat\u0022 range until the radiation flux balances the heat production. Heat production in the end only determines the kinetics of the process: the higher, the faster the part will reach the critical temperature. It\u0027s easy to make passive radiators too, they are the same but with high conductivity and no heat production. What\u0027s not possible to do is an active heat exchanger, which needs a custom module. I think it would be suited for NFT, a simple inline part that consumes EC and sucks heat from its neighbors. Attach passive radiators to it you\u0027ve got yourself an active radiator \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this will be useful to decode the new thermal model, Nertea.
