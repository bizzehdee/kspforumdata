If the number is getting smaller you are closing, if it is getting bigger you are departing.

The regular sized docking port can dock with the shielded and the enclosed radial port since they are physically the same size, but the Jr. sized port can only dock with another Jr. and the same for the Sr.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E3 - What is a safe \u0027collision\u0027 speed?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe heavier the spacecraft the slower you need to go in order for the kinetic energy to be overcome by the docking port magnets. Little capsules can come in at 5 m/s if you are experienced, while big loads should be less then 1 m/s. The velocity vector also counts - moving straight in you can go faster then if you are coming in from the side. With very light ships you can practically \u0027strafe\u0027 across the docking port from the side and the magnets will be able to hold you long enough for the docking clamps to engage. With heavier ships you need to get rid of as much side to side velocity a possible. Again it\u0027s all about the kinetic energy of the ship vs. the fixed magnetic force in the docking port trying to cancel it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E4 - So far my spacecraft only have a single rear thruster - so for instance to slow down a bit I have to swing around 180 and hit the gas.

The normal way to dock until you get really good at it is to use RCS thrusters - at least 4 - so that you can thrust forwards, backwards and in all directions laterally without changing orientation. Usually they are placed with respect to the ships center of mass, so that you can fire them to translate (move side to side) without also inducing rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T23:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GungaDin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GungaDin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1 - The \u0027docking speed\u0027 display on the navball shows relative speed between the 2 ships but is there any way to distinguish between closing speed vs departing speed?
