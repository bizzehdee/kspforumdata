The members of the meeting where still talking. \u0022Everybody! Shut up and listen to me!\u0022 Shouted Alexander again out loud. The room instantly turned silent. \u0022Miss President gave us a message that we need to get back to the Moon before the century is out...\u0022 said Alexander to the people in the room until the people started talking again. This time he threw a hammer against the wall. Everybody looked at Alexander. \u0022If you people don\u0027t pay attention i will have to fire you all! This is really important!\u0022 shouted Alexander with anger. \u0022So we have to send a human on the Moon before 2100, we have quite a bit of time, but i want to start developing as soon as possible! Tommorow we will start designing our experimental spaceraft for testing all our equipment. We will all work together on this project!\u0022. Shortly after, a few people with questons started appearing. Anne Poets asked \u0022When will we start designing our Moon Lander?\u0022. \u0022You know what? I will split the design team for this project, they start designing every spacecraft we need for the project tommorow\u0022 answered. Dick Dickson asked: \u0022What is going to be the name of this project?\u0022 \u0022Project, eugh...

Jebediah Kerman, Alexanders son who also is a space pioneer of the new age, walked up to his dad. \u0022Now who is going to be the first one?\u0022 asked Jeb to Alexander. \u0022You always want to be first huh?

How can i help you?\u0022 said Alexander back. \u0022Euh... can i join your space program?\u0022 she asked. \u0022Haha, of course! Can i get your snail mail adress please?\u0022 asked Alexander to her. The girl gave her a piece of paper. \u0022So why do you want to be a part of our space program?\u0022 asked Alexander. \u0022I really want to be an Astronaut, i already have my flight license. I also read that you do not need any special education.\u0022 answered the girl, her name is Lisa Doya. \u0022Well alright, we will sign you up tommorow\u0022 said Alexander.

I suggest doing the same thing the Apollo did, \u00A0having 2 seperate spacecraft, one that lands and the other one that provides habitation and a way of returning back to Earth.\u0022 suggested Alexander to his team. \u0022Well we could just assemble the thing in Low Earth Orbit, so we so not need to design a new rocket, and then we can do the Apollo style thing.\u0022 said Johannes from the designer team. \u0022Who agrees with the two suggestions?\u0022 asked John Kerman, Alexanders twin brother. Everybody pulled their hand up, everybody agrees. \u0022Now how many people should we send there?\u0022 asked Alexander to his team. \u00222 in the lander and 1 in the command module.\u0022 said Herman, a spaceflight historian. \u0022No, just 1 in the lander and 1 in the command module, that would save alot more time and money. We will land 2 later on, but not now. We also have 4 avaiable Astronauts that are experienced enough to pioneer, and we need a backup crew, with 2 in 1 mission, it would be enough. We need 2 more Astronauts for a 3 man mission. Does any agree?\u0022 answered Anne Poets. Everybody pulled their hand up, even Herman. \u0022Ok people, so we have a plan for the crew and we know how tp get there, how about\u00A0life support?\u0022 asked Zara Bruin, a young spaceflight veteran. \u0022How much does an Meal Ready to Eat weigh?\u0022 asked Zara Bruin again. \u0022Like 500 gram?\u0022 answered Anne Poets. \u0022Ok so... wait give me a second... 24KG of food for 2 people on a 8 day mission with a regulair 3 meal day, does that weigh too much?\u0022 calcucates an asked Zara to the team. \u0022No, i dont think so, my rockets could handle that.\u0022 answered Alexander.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Ok people, i think we have discussed enough, the rest of the discussion will continue while designing. I will split the team in two, team 1 will design the expirimental vehicle and team 2 the lander. All the people sitting on my left is team 1 and the rest is team 2. Team 1 will go into design room 3 team 2 in design room 4, do your thing, i will take visits and checks\u0022 told Alexander to the team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-weight:700;\u0022\u003ETeam 1: The Expirimental Vehicle\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Ok so we need to design an expirimental vehicle, where should we start?\u0022 asked Johannes Pannes, to his team. \u0022I think the return module needs to be bell shaped, like the Soyuz and the Shenzou.\u0022 suggested Herman. \u0022And should it have a door on the side of the capsule? For orbital EVA\u0027s?\u0022 suggested Herman again. Everybody agreed with Herman. \u0022Where would all those computers be placed then?\u0022 asked Zara Bruin. \u0022Above the heat shield?\u0022 suggested Jeannette. \u0022No, the computers are the most important things we have, if we put them near the heat shield, they could be destroyed easily during overheating or during landing. We have to put them on the opposite side of the door so they can operate the computers too.\u0022 said Johannes. \u0022Agreed, we have to put the things we dont need after or while returning near the heat shield, but what?\u0022 asked Herman. \u0022Our food, water and life support. If our scrubber gets damaged during landing, we can just put pull open the hatch for air. The rescue team will get them out of there ASAP for food and water.\u0022 Suggested Zara Bruin. \u0022Should we just install the default command system in there, above the seats?\u0022 asked Jeannette, everybody agreed. \u0022So how about propulsion and power? How would we handle that?\u0022 asked Johannes. \u0022I think we should use our good old Aerozine and NTO as fuel for both the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and the main thrusters, i think we should use the VOM-D9 for the main engine. And the the propulsion and control module needs to be skirt shaped, so it would have more Delta-V. The upper part will hold the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, the batteries and extra fuel for the fuel cells., and the solar panels should be extendable. The left one has 2 panels and the right 1 with an antenna.\u0022 suggested Herman, he made a drawing of it. Everybody agreed. \u0022Now how about an additional habitation module? I would go crazy in a small capsule like that for 8 days!\u0022 asked Zara Bruin. \u0022I think we should do that\u00A0\u003Ci\u003Efairings are for sissies\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0thing again, with the habitation module as nosecone for the rocket.\u0022 suggested Johannes. The team thought about it, they will take it for now. \u0022You should go ahead and design that module on your own Johannes, we are not sure about it.\u0022 said Zara Bruin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:30px 0px;height:0px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px 0px 545.625px;text-align:center;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022^^The Modulair Expirimental and Testing Space Ship Design 1 with the habitation module designed by Johannes\u0022 src=\u0022https://em.wattpad.com/563432b4c8f06dc0053ebebe6caeecbdeec4999d/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f707565695f44467a7762705743413d3d2d3333363731353432312e313438613638386530643562633635363132353335373539383336342e6a7067?s=fit\u0026amp;w=1280\u0026amp;h=1280\u0022 style=\u0022width:720px;height:545.625px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n^^The Modulair Expirimental and Testing Space Ship Design 1 with the habitation module designed by Johannes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-weight:700;\u0022\u003ETeam 2: The Lunar Lander\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Hey people, don\u0027t tell Team 1 this but, i have already designed the Lunar Lander!

Alex and Lisa walked to a massive plane hangar, ah well, its filled with rockets so it is not really a \u0022plane\u0022 hangar. \u0022Look! This relatively small one is the Alexander 1, my first ever rocket that made it to space. This is the last real one of its kind. Right next to it is the Alexander 2C, its 2x times bigger and it brought us alot of science information about space. Right next to that i have the Alexander 3 rocket, it send our first satellite into orbit, it also put my son, my daughter and Zara, the first underaged and so far youngest astronaut in space. She was 8 years old, now she is 16 and also an experienced spacecraft pilot.\u0022 told Alexander. \u0022So whats with the graffiti on those rockets? It looks depressing.\u0022 asked Lisa. \u0022Well, a 7 years ago, when Lieke Naaktgeboren, our president, dissapeard, i had to move to Syria to continue the program. I worked there untill 2053, so i left the complex abonded for 3 years. We cleaned the graffiti in all the rooms expect the rocket hangar, some decoration could not do bad.\u0022 told Alexander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\nAfter the old hangar, they went to hangar 7, their most awesome hangar so far. \u0022Look! My favourite hangar! Where the big rockets sleep! This hangar is actually 3 massive hangars attached to each other. It is 300 meters long! Do you see that rocket there? Thats the Harman II, the heaviest rocket we have so far, it can carry 22 tons to LEO. That is the thing that is going to send us to the Moon soon! We have 3 of them in total.\u0022 told Alexander. \u0022So where are all the capsules?\u0022 asked Lisa. \u0022Well, those are all sold out to museums, that was the only way we could earn money when Lieke dissapeard.\u0022 Alexander replied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\nNext up was the production building, yet another hangar, but smaller. \u0022So here is where we build our tanks, engines, heat shields and other things. We have some HARE\u0027s here, the rocket engines used for the Harman II. And we also have some HTVE\u0027s here, the ones we will have to use for our lunar lander. We used them on previous lunar missions, like the Maan 7 mission, wich brought samples from the Moon back to Earth.\u0022 told Alexander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\nAfterwards, they went to the Astronaut training complex. 2 small hangars, one with a Zero-G plane and the other one with a capsule simulator, a vacuum room and a G-force simulator. \u0022So, this is where you will train, it is like a playground! Not much here is done now. Since we cancelled the manned program a few years ago, we are trying to clean it up now.\u0022 said Alexander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\nTheir tour was done, they was more to see, but Lisa said it was enough and they went back to the design room.\u00A0\u003Ci\u003EWhat have they talked about?\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-weight:700;\u0022\u003ETeam 2: Boredom\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\nAlexander and Lisa left the room for the tour. When the door was closed, there was an akward silence. \u0022Should we secretly design a Moon Rocket?\u0022 suggested Dimitri Pekar, Alexanders best friend. \u0022Do we have enough space? Resources? Money?\u0022 asked Bill Kerman to his team. \u0022We have enough space, Hangar 4, 5 and 6 can hold a Saturn V each. Resources and money? Well, lets wait when we finish the first mission so we got our money, so we can get our resources and stuff like that\u0022 answered John Kerman. \u0022You know what? Lets leave the rocket for later, im probably going too far.\u0022 said Dimitri. \u0022Ok, some what now?\u0022 said Bill. Bill took a closer look at the drawing of the lander. Bill is an experienced engineer, he needs to take a look at a design for at least 10 minutes, to see if it is plausible enough. After 10 minutes of akward silence, Bill finaly said: \u0022I see no flaws.\u0022. Nobody said something back. They where either brainstorming, sleeping or drawing random smileys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EAfter 3 hours of boredom\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-weight:700;\u0022\u003EChecking time\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Come on people, we are going to check your designs and see if they fit.\u0022 told Alexander. Both teams went to the meeting room. Alexander looked at the drawing of the METSS-D1. He shaked his head. \u0027\u0027I dont think its a good idea, the habitation module is too large and heavy and the small Soyuz-like capsule is too small for a 1-2 week mission, i don\u0027t think its a good idea.\u0027\u0027 told Alexander to Team 1. \u0027\u0027All that work for no reason? What are we going to do?\u0027\u0027 asked Zara Bruin. \u0027\u0027Tommorow \u00A0we will work on the METSS-D2 and the transfer stage all together, ok?\u0027\u0027 Answered Alexander. Team 1 was dissapointed. \u0027\u0027Ok then, sir.\u0027\u0027 said Johannes Pannes dissapointed. \u0027\u0027Now the lander is a pretty plausible design, but it can only hold 1 person, so we cant keep it for future missions, so we will work on our second lander also tommorow.\u0027\u0027 told Alexander. \u0027\u0027And i got to say, the thing with the teams was not a good idea, we wont ever do that again.\u0027\u0027 told Alexander. \u0027\u0027Okay people, you can go home now, tommorow we will be designing the second lander and a new and better METSS\u0027\u0027 reminded Alexander to the designers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\nAlexanders walked down the gravel path to his bicycle. Dimitri Petrov approached Alexander. \u0027\u0027Dimitri! How are you doing my friend!\u0027\u0027 said Alexander to Dimitri. \u0027\u0027Hello! Well i drew this thing while we did nothing for those 3 hours, it is a rocket we could use for our future missions, it could carry up to 130 tons into LEO. So its better than the Saturn V! You like it?\u0027\u0027 said Dimitri. Alexander looked at the drawing. A smile started to grow on Alexanders face. \u0027\u0027Awesome thing my friend. We can take a look at it later, but our first mission will be done with the Harman II, okay?\u0027\u0027 told Alexander to Dimitri. \u0027\u0027Yeah of course, thanks! Do svidanya! I have to keep care of the kids!

Will the experimental vehicle be the same vehicle used to get to the Moon?\u0022 asked Zara Bruin. \u0022Hmmm, well, yeah. We have to test everything we need for a Moon mission, and we might as well use the same thing to get there, maybe the only difference is going to be the size of the Service Module.\u0022 answered Alexander \u0022Does anyone else have something to say?\u0022 asked Alexander to everybody. \u0022I thought about the space assembly thing for a bit and im now 99% sure we need a single rocket in order to get to the Moon\u0022 told Anne Poets to everyone. Everybody started talking. \u0022Ahem,\u0022 the whole room turned silent. \u0022I know someone who is going to take care of the rocket problem.\u0022 said Alexander, he looked at Dimitri. Dimitri winked and smiled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Now lets get started on the Experimental vehicle. It needs to carry 2 people for the first few missions around the Moon, any suggestions?\u0022 asked Alexander. \u0022Well, i think we should use a capsule that is a little smaller than the Apollo capsule but simulair in shape, modern computer technology should scale down the volume and weight of the electronics alot more than used in the 70s.\u0022 suggested John Kerman. Everybody agreed. \u0022So how about habitation? Will the spacecraft have a habitation module?\u0022 asked Herman. \u0022No, due to the electronics that are lower in volume, the crew has more living space. Pooping and peeing could be done with good old diapers and a mini airlock to get rid of that dirty junk. Sleeping can be done in the main seats. Privacy could be provided with a blanket covering their seats, making them invisible to the \u0027public\u0027. A habitation module just adds in more weight, a higher cost and wastefull space.\u0022 answered Dimitri. \u0022Now should we store the food and life support like the scrubbers near the heat shield?\u0022 asked Johannes Pannes. \u0022Yes, expect for the air tanks, there is quite alot of air compressed in there and if it heats up, the thing will leak and that can cause....\u0022 Dimitri stopped talking. Someone knocked on the door. Alexander opened the door. \u0022Hello sir, we have some very important news for you.\u0022 said the person at the door, he was a messenger, someone else news. It was a paid job back when all electrics shut down during the Solar Storm in 2017, but some people still enjoyed it and the job was still a thing, even though talking via phone is possible. Anyways, back to the story. \u00A0\u0022Im sorry sir, but we are in the middle of a discussion.\u0022 told Alexander to the messenger. \u0022Im sorry, look, here are some files, bye.\u0022 said the Messenger. The Messenger gave him the files, closed the door and walked away. \u0022Okay, continue.\u0022 said Alex. \u0022Well, if we put the air tank near the heat shield, it might heat up, become softer and leak, and that would cause problems.\u0022 Continued Dimitri. \u0022But a heat shield is a heat shield, it protects the spacecraft from heat.\u0022 explained Anne Poets. \u0022Yeah, ur right, but would it be a problem if we put it not near the heat shield?\u0022 Asked Dimitri. everyone shaked their head. \u0022And how about temperature regulation? Should we do like the water thing, that pumps cold/warm water around to make the temperature of something nice enough to live in?\u0022 asked Zara Bruin to her team. \u0022Yeah, thats a nice idea, but first we need to perfect that technology because its known for bursting all the time\u0022 answered Anne Poets. Bill Kerman yawned. \u0022This is getting kind of boring, you know what, im going to design this thing at home, let\u0027s continue to the lander\u0022 explained Bill. \u0022So you... you want to design one of worlds most advanced vehicles at home by yourself?\u0022 Asked Johannes Pannes. \u0022Yeah, trust me! I am an engineer! And, we have the PDB (Precision Design Bureau)\u0022 answered Bill. \u0022Okay on to the next part!\u0022 Said Alexander Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Okay so how about the lander?\u0022 asked Alexander Kerman to his team. Lisa Doya walked in the room. \u0022Did someone say lander? I have an idea!\u0022 Said Lisa Doya. Everyone looked at her strange. She began to draw on the whiteboard. \u00222 of our first tier lander habitation modules, welded together, boom! Habitation module done! Now, the Ascent Stage, just rip away the lander legs, boom, done! Descent stage? Just the Service Module of the Expirimental Vehicle with lander legs. Boom! Clap! Done!\u0022. The room was silent. Zara Bruin stood up and started to clap. The rest started clapping too. \u0022Amazing! How did you come up with that? Thats freaking genius!\u0022 asked John Kerman. \u0022I played Kerbal Space Program!\u0022 Answered Lisa Doya. The whole room started laughing.

The political journal or the astronomical discovery journal?\u0022 Asked Alexander. \u0022You read the astronomy journal, and i read the politics journal\u0022 said John Kerman. They started reading. \u0022Oh this is not good, ah well.\u0022 said John. \u0022What is wrong?\u0022 asked Alexander Kerman. \u0022Annie Buckman, you know, the lady who wants to make peace by banning violence, is now in the hands of our country.\u0022 Answered John. \u0022Any astronomy drama?\u0022 Asked John to Alex. \u0022So apparently there is a small comet-like object orbiting Earth, lower than the Moon, and it looks like, its a permanent one too.\u0022 Answered Alexander. John Kerman takes a look at the Astronomy Journal. \u0022Screw politics, the discovery of \u00A0Minmus is much more important.\u0022 Said John.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px 0px 24px;font-size:18px;font-family:\u0027Source Sans Pro\u0027, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:24px;padding:0px;color:rgb(85,85,85);\u0022\u003E\n-\u003Ci\u003ETo Be Continued\u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
