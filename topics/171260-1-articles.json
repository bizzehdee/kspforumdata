It\u0027s very easy to model there that the only problem you will have is how to optimize your model making. There are free models in the 3D warehouse for reference if you\u0027re new\u00A0but not for redistribution. You can export into .dae and UV Map on Blender, which needs minimal studying to do so. It\u0027s a two step process but it\u0027s your choice, 3DS Max or Maya could UV Map and export straight up to unity but more difficult to learn than Sketchup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hraban","CreatedById":145453,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-12T08:38:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EFor the entrance I can recommend \u003Cstrong\u003EWings3D\u003C/strong\u003E in the version \u003Cstrong\u003E1.5.4\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EThe operation is clear, easy to learn and the UV mapping comparatively easy to accomplish.\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EFor the creation of models for KSP, the application is more than adequate, at least I can not complain.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EThe version 2.1.5 unfortunately has a bug in the UV mapping, so better keep your finger away.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-13T12:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best program is always the one you like the most. I work with Max \u003Cstrong\u003Eand \u003C/strong\u003EBlender in a professional environment and I like blenders streamlined UI much more than the hodgepodge UI Max uses where you have different UI styles cobbled together. Like there is a ribbon UI but there are also non-standard dropdowns and selection boxes etc etc. One of my collegues likes Max more, but even he hwas a hard time migrating from 15 to 17 as all the icons are different now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlenders UI philosophy is clearly shortcut based, you have a lot of shortcuts to learn, but the same shortcuts work on all objects. You scale objects with the same operation like you scale timeline events and material node ec. Also you can enter values as formulas. There is a 1024 in a value-field, but you want it to be 4098? just type *4 behind the 1024. Want to rotate a vertex so that it aligns with the vertices of a 24 sided cylinder? Just type r=360/24*x (with x beeing how many steps you want to rotate).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMax is much more Mouse based by default. You can use shortcuts but they tend to be different for every action. With max I use a spacemouse to navigate and a mouse to edit, but with blender the spacemouse isn\u0027t as effective (and needed) for me, as my hands are more focussed on keyboard and mouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWant to add some more edgeloops to a mesh?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlender: alt-r , hover over on of the edges and use mousewheel up/down to adjust the amount of new loops to add, then leftklick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMax: Klick on edge-selection mode in the edit poly mode panel, klick on an edge, klick on \u0022ring-select\u0022 in the selection-panel, klick on the settings icon of the connect-button in the edit edges panel, edit the amount of loops to insert in the popup menu that appeared, hit ok in the pop up menu. Yes there is a swift loop funtion (of cours it resides in the Ribbon Menu and NOT in the dropdown-field menu of the edit poly modifier), but it will only add one loop at a time and it doesnt half the distance automatically, so placing the loops is a bit harder or consists of adding the loop, selecting it and then moving it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are some things i like better in max, like the auto grid function and generally the grid (transform orientations in blender) handling, but I use blender whenever I can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-13T12:01:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2018 12:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by InsaneDruid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
