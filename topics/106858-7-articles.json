If you wanna create planets in 1.0, you must use one of the newest dev versions, or use Kopernicus from New horizonts or Kerbol Plus. Don\u0027t use OPM\u0027s one since, from what I understand, it is a bit different from regular kopernicus. Also, if you want to make an atmospheric planet like a gas giant, you should get in touch with KillAshley.

You just nead the Kopernicus folder from Kerbol Plus\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nHey dude I found your mistake: you are using Kittopia space to load planets. You should create them after how we did our planets. Just check our configs and folder placement, it should be preety easy to understand and clean to use as example. For example, for a basic planet, just use Ganag as model, to see how your config should look. Also, do not use Kittopia! We only used it to add that cryovolcano on Potatus and Corolet\u0027s comet. If you look in our confogs, the only things you should modify, are texture paths, name, flightGlobalsIndex, orbital caracteristics and deformity (sets how deforemd will your planet look and ot is under where you should specify height map texture path). You also nead a height map I suppose you have, but not used. If you want, I could help you with the textures! \n\nBTW, create a new dev thread for your mod so we keep this discussion away from Kerbol Plus. Cheers and send me a link to the new thread! I\u0027m right now improving the textures for you!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nHere ya go. The improved color map. For a height map, just turn the normal to greyscale. Also, you can use the same greyscale normal for height. \n\n![Wg9RVhB](http://imgur.com/Wg9RVhB)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T17:34:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 05:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by amarius1**"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T19:57:53Z","Content":"Alright, here\u0027s the link:\n\n[Astro\u0027s Kopernicus Planets](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123454-Astro-s-Kopernicus-Planets?p=1979121#post1979121)\n\nAlso, I didn\u0027t get the textures.\n\nThanks for helping!"},{"CreatedByName":"JaffaFediration","CreatedById":112619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T21:01:22Z","Content":"Vix, it\u0027s the new moo of Duna."},{"CreatedByName":"amarius1","CreatedById":111155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T21:11:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Vix, it\u0027s the new moo of Duna.\n\nYeah so what?"},{"CreatedByName":"FireFaced","CreatedById":141290,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T01:17:04Z","Content":"Is this compatible with OPM?"},{"CreatedByName":"amarius1","CreatedById":111155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T06:46:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is this compatible with OPM?\n\nIt is compatible but it may become VEEEERY cluttered and your computer will scream from hight memory usage, since this pack is bigger than OPM (adds double the solar system\u0027s number of planets)."},{"CreatedByName":"Postremus","CreatedById":135006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T10:08:20Z","Content":"Please add ckan support.\n\nfor me, no ckan means no install..\n\nsorry.."},{"CreatedByName":"timandy1","CreatedById":140459,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T13:28:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Please add ckan support.\n\u003E for me, no ckan means no install..\n\u003E \n\u003E sorry..\n\nCKAN is Horrible IMO.
