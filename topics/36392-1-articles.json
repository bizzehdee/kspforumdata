There spend million and million dollars with government funds to launch a new Dragon, a new Falcon 9 (and Heavy) rocket and maybe in the future even more rockets. Meanwhile, there will AGAIN have a new launchpad. First there was plans for launching Falcon 1 from Vandenberg, then it was that island somewhere by Kwajalein. Then there will go launch Falcon 9\u0027s from the Cape, then there will go back to Vandenberg, and now there got plans for a whole new launch site somewhere in Texas. And who going to pay that?

It would need to be 3 cubesats put together, with about 1.5 of them being taken up by the engine, fuel, and solar panels. So you would have 1.5 cubesats left over for the payload. Half a cubesat\u0027s worth could be a small heat shield, and you wouldn\u0027t need a parachute or retrorockets for such a small payload, just an airbag.

You might be able to use a smartphone for the computer and camera, but you would need to radiation harden it or have more than one for redundancy. You might need to do a lot of testing to make sure everything works right, but overall I think it might be doable for less than $1 million.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
