Different communication devices for spacecraft (hereby referred to as \u0027Antennas\u0027) were not for different ranges but different data types. in example, Voice/video transmissions had different needs than simple flight telemetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2.

At this point is when I thought of a different approach. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the game there are the following four definitions to be found in the cfg files of the \u0027Command\u0027 folder parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EvesselType = Ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EvesselType = Probe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EvesselType = Rover\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EvesselType = Lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What if an antenna was designated to be usable only for that type of part? Capsules would then need three types of antenna to cover all three range distances, probes, rovers and landers the same. This would give a reason to have more antennas other than just \u0027for looks\u0027 and would IMO add more flavor to a career progression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have been looking at the code (but my last coding days were 10 years ago in flash/php ) and am not sure at this point if the science experiments (which seem to be module defined) would have to check to see if the pod/probe/rover/lander they were a child to had the proper antenna for that root part. I have merely been looking at it in terms of a MM patch to make an antenna specific to vessel type. I also have been thinking that it might be advisable to make the three stock antennas usable to all four vessel types so players who do not add or add only a few favorite antennas can still play without undue complication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I respect the amazing work/skills/insight of all here on the KSP forums so I ask; Is it an interesting idea or just \u0027whistling in the wind\u0027?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toadicus","CreatedById":67745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T05:25:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ejpkerman\u003C/strong\u003E, I\u0027m still looking to foster a more-directed environment for user-contributed configs for part mods.

Go back a couple pages and check them out; see if you can use some of his rationale to help you with the AIES parts. I don\u0027t know anything about the AIES parts or what they look like and do, but if they line up well enough, you could pick three of them to patch the stock parts, and two to be longer range, or some other permutation on that idea.

When I first noticed the issue, it was an inability to transmit science. So I exited to the space center, loaded another ship, and from that ship put focus back on Duna. All ships (I currently have ships in orbit around Kerbin, Minmus, Kerbol, and Duna) had lines drawn directly back to Kerbin, ignoring any closer links.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe setup is: Probe on Ike with Comm. 16 -\u0026gt; Satellite in orbit of Ike with Comm. 16 -\u0026gt; Satellite in orbit of Duna with 88-88.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning the current version from Kerbalstuff, this is the communication path around Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen viewed from another probe, and previously from any ship, this was the configuration of paths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R4ODFr2m.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R4ODFr2m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022R4ODFr2m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen viewed from the Ike satellite, it connects normally (though had not before).

I\u0027m willing to concede realism to some degree, but since I\u0027m guessing the ISS blind spots are the fault of oceans or political gamemanship, and the latter isn\u0027t modeled in KSP, and since real-world space programs managed to negotiate nearly worldwide coverage at the very dawn of space exploration, it feels like a weak argument on its face.\u003Cp\u003EI strongly encourage you and other interested parties to make such cases.

I say keep on without making players do anything to create an infrastructure at Kerbin or, at most, make creating Kerbin infrastructure an option. I say so for the following reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EREALISM:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealstically, KSP is in another universe where all 4 of the fundamental forces are radically different than in this universe. As a result, nothing on our periodic table can exist in the KSP universe, and from there on all things diverge even further. Thus, all so-called \u0022realism\u0022 features and mods in KSP are actually exactly the opposite because they impose Earthly conditions and physical properties on a place where they can\u0027t possibly exist, or impose human biology on totally alien (from their very chemical elements on up) Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo not give in to this vile temptation. Denouce the false prophet of so-called \u0022realism\u0022 and accept the true reality of KSP. And that reality is that ultra-dense Kerbin provides grovides gravitational lensing to any ground-based antenna on its surface, so the tracking station at KSC can talk in all directions all the time, based on the KSP universe\u0027s theory of General Relativity, which naturally is totally different from ours. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the best argument I can come up with for this point, but iit\u0027s still true no matter how silly it sounds.
