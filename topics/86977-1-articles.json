However, there is a more efficient solution than just aerobraking if you want to go to Vall. If you aerobrake at Jool and set up a Tylo or Laythe gravity assist, you can reduce your velocity relative to Vall and therefore reduce the Delta V required for an insertion burn (since the orbit after a Tylo or Laythe gravity assist is more similar to Vall\u0027s orbit than the orbit after a Jool aerobrake. If that makes any sense). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to deal with gravity assists, then yea, in your case, aerobraking at Jool is the best way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T16:52:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used a combination of Jool aerobraking and Tylo assist before, and that might be your best bet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T16:54:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think aerobraking at Laythe may be get you the best of both worlds: it should get you captured into the Jool system for minimal dV without having a highly eliptical orbit around Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T17:37:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EComplicated, though ... aerocapture is easy, there are tools for it, gravity assists are a bit tricky, setting up the nodes can take some work, aerobrake into or during a gravity assist is effectively doing an unspecified burn during or before the assist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t MJ have a feature that could help with this?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-11T17:40:56Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2014 05:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kryxal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T19:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely aerocapture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a Jool aerocapture, this calculator is a big help, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/\u003C/a\u003E For a Laythe aerocapture, try setting a very high apoapsis in the calculator, then aim a little higher than it says for that and you should get a Laythe escape trajectory into a decent Jool orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn gravity assists, as an alternative to Laythe or Tylo you can use Vall itself, make an initial flyby that makes your Jool orbit more circular then come back round for another approach.

It takes about 1000 m/s or little more to brake staight on Vall\u0027s orbit. It takes more to accelerate ship to Vall\u0027s orbital velocity after Jool aerobraking. The most optimal way would be aerobrake in Laythe, but it takes so much time and maneuvers (and extra heat shields for DRE) that I do not normally use it to save couple of hundreds of meters per second. You can achieve a moon encounter by using about 10 m/s in mid course correction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
