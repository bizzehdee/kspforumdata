At the moment, I can barely reach 70k altitude with borderline legit rocket design using only KToys parts. The goal is to replace the first few nodes of the career research tree with those so the player starts by crashing unmanned toy-like rockets all around to gather the first few science points. To make this viable I have another project, Blackbox, that will add to the early science gathering but will (probably) require some coding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simple KToy rocket next to the MK I pot with the 1st SRB.
