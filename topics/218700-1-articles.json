Attempting to write anything even moderately lengthy, or with any meaningful attempt at formatting turns into an immensely frustrating exercise in clicking and arrow key tapping. Inputs register seemingly at random. If you write something too long the interface just gives up entirely and won\u0027t let you edit the description anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any mods that fix this? Or is this just something I\u0027m going to have to do outside of the game, with separate text files?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
