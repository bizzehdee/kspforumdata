It seems that the moment you have engines facing upwards, you cant launch, speed indicator above navball just shows \u0022NAN\u0022 instead of zero and thottle control doesnt work. Tried this with different crafts, and always had the same result. Without engines facing upwards, everything is fine. Same craft just with added upward facing engine wont work. I\u0027m using quite some mods, but i dont think its mod related, as this happens to stock-only vessels too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, this only happens with \u0022regular\u0022 engines, vernors seem to work fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETantalus\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
