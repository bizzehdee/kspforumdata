Nearly all Scott\u0027s videos are sped up 4x in post-production, with commentary added later, which is why his video looks so smooth. Additionally, many youtubers/streamers have extra-powerful hardware setups. Aside from having a really beefy computer, there\u0027s not much you can do besides turning the graphics down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T23:39:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECooling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing GTA4 lately. My FPS goes from slow motion to fast forward, depending on how warm the laptop is. If KSP taxes your computer like that, pay attention to cooling.
