Probably the most infuriating thing to do is docking parts of your spacestation together! Failing that, you can always build some wacky contraptions on the surface.

Mechjeb for those massive launches that murder my PC until orbit and a bit of other ship information. alarm Clock is really useful if you want to leave a ship on a trajectory and go away to do something else, just set the timer and bam, when it hits 0, you\u0027re immediately notified. Really good if you\u0027re dealing with multiple ships on the same trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unistrut","CreatedById":2229,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T01:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuna is probably your next best bet. It\u0027s got enough atmosphere to make a parachute helpful, but not so much as to make take off impossible. It\u0027s easier to land on than the Mun, but slightly harder to get back off of. You should also practice doing orbital docking as it makes getting Kerbals back from missions to other planets far easier. Stations and bases are interesting challenges, but not actually too useful as the game currently stands. If you can get the ISA Mapsat working then you get the goal of getting a mapping probe into orbit around every body and actually getting a useful map out of it as well. ISA Mapsat is seriously my favorite mod in this entire game, and I\u0027ve held off updating to the newest version due to reports that it doesn\u0027t work quite right under it...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T01:58:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStart sending small probes to planets to see how interplanetary flight works.
