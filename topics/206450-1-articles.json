At certain times it is far more efficient to go to Duna or any other planets. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis planner\u003C/a\u003E gives you the transfer windows or you can just eyeball it - Duna needs to be about 44 degrees ahead of Kerbin when you do your transfer burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have an intercept and are roughly half way there you should do a \u0027correction burn\u0027. This allows you to adjust your course precisely so that you arrive at Duna at the altitude and inclination you prefer (this allows you to plot a course that enters the atmosphere a little bit to benefit from aerobraking). Create a manoeuvre node about 10 minutes ahead of your present position, click on Duna and select \u0027focus view\u0027 - this will let you see your projected path through Duna\u0027s sphere of influence. Scroll out until you can see your node and adjust as necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have mastered mid course correction you can attempt \u0027aerocapture\u0027.
