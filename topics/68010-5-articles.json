The F-1A is a low-Isp first-stage engine (it\u0027s Isp is actually lower than Mainsail\u0027s), so it would make sense to reduce the Isp of the LFB. The real booster has TWR a bit over 1.6 at liftoff, which we could achieve with 1800-1900 kN of thrust, assuming that engine mass stays at 6 tonnes. So maybe the LFB part should provide 1900 kN of thrust with Isp 270/320.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SLS first stage uses high-Isp engines with moderate thrust. The engines are actually so weak that the first stage can\u0027t even lift itself. With the same 1:2.2 scaling, we can build the first stage as a stack of 3 big fuel tanks, the KS-25x4 engine cluster, and a decoupler. The stack has a total mass of bit over 250 tonnes, meaning that the thrust should be no more than 2400 kN. The vacuum Isp of real LOX/LH2 engines goes up to around 460 s, while KSP engines peak at 390 s.

It looks like the J-2X engine, but while the SLS upper stage will use 3 engines, the KR-2L is one big engine. Assuming that it should have similar performance to the cluster of 3 smaller engines, its vacuum Isp is about right. The engine, one big fuel tank, an ADTP-2-3 adapter, and a Rockomax decoupler make a reasonable imitation of the upper stage, with a total mass of around 90 tonnes. As the SLS upper stage should have initial TWR a bit over 1.1 without payload, we can reach it with 1000 kN of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is some need for fine tuning, as the boosters are now very lightweigth compared to the core, and the entire rocket can barely lift off with 40 tonnes of payload. In the real SLS, a single booster has roughly the same mass and twice the thrust of the first stage, which we can\u0027t really replicate with stock fuels. This perhaps justifies the higher thrust values of the first-stage engines, as well as lowering their Isp.

So, if we want to balance the SLS engines with the existing engines, while keeping the SLS feel, I would suggest the following changes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKR-2L: Thrust 1000 kN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKS-25x4: Fine as it is. Maybe lower Isp to 300/360 (or to 300/350 to match the Skipper).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELFB: Lower Isp to 270/320 or even to the real 270/300 values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like these changes. They would seem to balance things better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T04:33:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jouni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jouni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKR-2L: Thrust 1000 kN.\u003Cp\u003EKS-25x4: Fine as it is.

In SLS Block 2, the upper stage is roughly twice the size of the payload, making the combined TWR around 0.65-0.70. Considering that my SLS-style launcher lifts around 100 tonnes comfortably, and lowering the Isp of first stage engines would drop its capacity to around 90 tonnes, the upper stage engine would need 1200 kN of thrust for similar TWR. The KR-2L would still be clearly weaker than the Mainsail, while being useful as an upper stage engine for large payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally I don\u0027t care too much about sandbox balance, but I won\u0027t complain, if we get balanced engines by basing them on some real engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T04:49:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nemoricus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nemoricus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs an aside, would it be possible for someone to make charts like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/x4dIn#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethese\u003C/a\u003E that include the new engines and tanks?

The new parts make the game WAY to easy: on my first launch with them, I got an escape with 6Km/s... with what was meant to be the final stage of the launcher...

The new parts are far to similar to real life parts. Which in most games would be great, as it is realistic. The \u003Cstrong\u003Ebig\u003C/strong\u003E problem is that Kerbin isn\u0027t similar to earth. Low Kerbin satellites orbit at around 2.2 Km/s. This value is around 8 Km/s for Earth.
