Just... wow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For the record, I sent several emails to the designated support email address on the SpacePort website, all of which were ignored.

The problem is that WordPress changes that into a shortlink of \u0022Hyperedit-2\u0022 and the \u0022-2\u0022 part is how WP does paging. So WordPress thinks that it\u0027s page two and tries to load page one and fails.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Yea... um\u0027 date=\u0027 no. Actually, the site put that in on it\u0027s own when I created the new listing, and refused any changes. When I tried to remove the \u00222\u0022 or make any other change, it gave the all-too-common error with no information. The only way it would save, was if I completely blanked that box and let it auto-generate. Regardless, there are NO instructions of any kind regarding this on the site, and there was NO response from support. So, the problem doesn\u0027t actually stem from anything Ezriilc did, and Ezriilc attempted to use properly designated channels to report the problem, but Ezriilc was repeatedly ignored, until Ezriilc posted about it in the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI tried removing the 2 as this is how it was solved in the past, but the original listing is conflicting.

I am trying the best I can to assist you yet you continue to insist we are wronging you in some way.
