Kerbals do not seem war-like or territorial whatsoever like humans obviously are. There\u0027s no implication of any geopolitics or military existing whatsoever. Not to mention that an apocalypse wiping out most of civilisation is quite dark. Cool concept for a science fiction work, but not for kerbals. I suppose it explains the lack of buildings, but there aren\u0027t even proper urban ruins around besides the few abandoned launch sites on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-08-30T02:57:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2022 02:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by intelliCom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-30T03:58:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI voted no to both too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy own lore is that kerbals live in an unloaded dimension that is tied to kerbin.\u00A0 They left the planet to this realm an eon ago to view the planetary garden beauty they had made.\u00A0 But they dodnt account for the yearing of Experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPilots year to experience the thrill of movement and power and going to dangerous and new places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScientists year to experience data that comes from the collection of science in different places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEngineers year to experience the challenge of building craft that can overcome challenges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately there is a desire to understand the very nature of the universe The Code by going to new places and understanding how it all fits together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u0027s me.\u00A0 For others it will be different\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-30T08:19:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more \u2018official\u2019 lore that gets added, the less room there is for players to make their own.

Barely any personality going on with the Kerbals except for the splash screen images and confusing Kerbal \u0027emotion system\u0027. However, the descriptions for parts and celestial bodies add way more to the game\u0027s lore than you realise. Here\u0027s two examples to demonstrate what I mean:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u0027Pol\u0027 was originally thought to be a piece of pollen stuck on a telescope until the kerbal using it decided to track the \u0027pollen grain\u0027 and found it to be a moon. Demonstrates that Kerbals make discoveries on accident.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe XL3 rover wheel was built in total secrecy. When revealed to Kerbal Motion LLC\u0027s chairman, he died of a heart attack.

Coming up with your own ideas may not \u0027build\u0027 KSP\u0027s world, but fan-made ideas can flourish so much more without the restrictions of a main story. Take Brad Whistance\u0027s \u0022Odyssey by Bill\u0022 series. It\u0027s probably the best window into KSP\u0027s world even though it isn\u0027t canon, but it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0being canon means no one else\u0027s ideas get invalidated.

Lifeless worlds can tell just as much of a story as one\u2019s full of life, and cresting\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003Ea hill and seeing a thousand kilometers of unending basalt flats can create just as strong of an emotion as cresting it and seeing ancient crashed ships scattered around. Just because it isn\u2019t a positive emotion doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t a good story.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd, worlds and words are also two different things. Anyone who loves to read knows the value of when a book doesn\u2019t hand-hold its audience and does worldbuilding by revealing details and allowing the audience to fill the rest in. Finally, big stories and cohesive stories are also separate things. Minecraft is undoubtedly a giant exploration and adventure game, and it has lots of lore hidden in almost every feature. However, it is unclear whether this lore is cohesive, or if it is, what the story is. Despite this, it is still a great game with a strong, if open-ended, story.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-31T14:36:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224169213\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022209554\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221661932616\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vl3d\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Vl3d said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a creative content point of view KSP1 is an empty and lonely game which only hints at greatness but never fulfills its destiny.

KSP1\u0027s anomalies really were just easter eggs, a random assortment of cute/random things with no real integrated gameplay or thoughtful through-line. I\u0027d love to see the anomalies be a little less toy-like and a little more sciencey, like big unique features in the vein of Breaking Ground\u0027s surface features that become not just cool set pieces but important landmarks whose discovery and study helps advance your program. I don\u0027t think it needs or wants to be too descriptive about what your program is, dictating to the player for instance \u0022You are the United Kerbal States\u0022 or \u0022You are Private Space Inc.\u0022 and you have this and that competitor. Let players do that. But if the anomalies over time were an aid in understanding different planets formation and history and maybe started getting into a broader story about the search for life those themes could be interpreted by lots of players in lots of ways.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I guess I agree with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/209738-intellicom/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022209738\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/209738-intellicom/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@intelliCom\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0that the key word here would be \u0022subtext\u0022\u003Cem\u003E,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ea kind of background atmosphere and mystery that leaves lots of negative space for players to fill with their own stories.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-08-31T14:39:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2022 02:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
