You have to consider latitude, ocean/land, albedo, atmospheric conditions, etc. At the most basic level, solar radiation (insolation, shortwave) is absorbed by the surface of some non-atmospheric world, say... Mercury. The heat that Mercury has gained will be emitted again as longwave (black body, IR) radiation. Of course, if a planet has interior heat such as that of our own Earth, then there will be some emission of radiation from that source, too, but this is relatively slow acting in comparison to the former process.
