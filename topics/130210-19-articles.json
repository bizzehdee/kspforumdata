Back when that sort of thing had mattered to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThat seemed like a lifetime ago, now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe point was, that all of the old-timers who had worked hard to get us to space were being redistributed to new roles in airship maintenance and freight logistics. They were all being swept aside in favour of new blood, loyal and close to Trans Pacific.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAlmost all of the old-timers, that is. A few individuals were absolutely irreplaceable, thanks to their extensive knowledge and experience with the challenges of spaceflight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFroemone was one of these individuals, and the Trans Pacific Resource Company had therefore deemed him indispensable for the future of the space programme. Consequently, it was safe to assume that the Board would be on the look-out for any suspicious behaviour on his behalf. Which was why we had to meet in the Australian outback, far from anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWe could not be seen together, and Froemone had to squeeze these clandestine meetings into his back-breaking schedule without his absence being noticed. The only reason we could meet at all was because he had to pay regular visits to a supplier based in Woomera. I stopped my anxious dust kicking for a moment as a wave of guilt washed over me. He was taking all the risks here: I had so little left to lose anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter my brief spell in Omelek to assist the recovery of \u003Cem\u003ELaroque\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s crew, I had returned to Australia. Catbeth had kindly offered me use of her living quarters in Roxby, as she was rarely at home. I scraped a modest living as an odd-job kerb, repairing anything that the inhabitants of the village brought to me, from rover wheels to electric toasters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nA bit of a step down from maintaining the nuclear reactor of an interplanetary spaceship, or a mighty a polar delivery truck. But no job is beneath anybody, I suppose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI pulled a small canteen from my tattered backpack and attempted to quench my thirst with a few drops of water. I squinted up at the sun with one hand raised to avoid being blinded by its harsh gaze. It was well past noon, and still he had not come. I resumed my kicking of the dusty berm, fidgeting and nervous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFinally, the sound of a vehicle approaching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI stepped off the trail and waited for it to appear. There was no cover out here: just sand and the odd dead bush for miles around. Nowhere to hide if the secrecy of our meeting had been compromised and this had turned into a trap. I stood there in the brilliant sunlight and awaited my fate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe vehicle sprang into view above the ridge abruptly. It was an old flatbed truck that had obviously seen better days. It was the type of utility vehicle that was used to haul cargo pallets between settlements. Its driver was clearly not quite in full control, and the truck danced from one side of the trail to the other, kicking up waves of sand and grit as it swerved. As it approached, the truck made one final swerve and pulled off the road, tired brakes squealing in protest. It ground to a halt just a few metres short of mowing me down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FOGuGZ3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FOGuGZ3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe cab door opened slowly, and a Kerbal appeared, dropping heavily into the dust, mopping his brow. He was clearly relieved at reaching his destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CUhm... hello Camwise,\u201D he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CHello, SE,\u201D I replied. \u201CNice wheels, but you nearly ran me over.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFroemone trudged towards me through the sand, and pulled an envelope from his suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CSorry about that. It was all I could find for rental at short notice. Here, this is for you,\u201D he said. \u201CIt\u0027s official, now. You\u0027re... uhm... \u003Cem\u003Edead\u003C/em\u003E.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI took the envelope and tore it open, scanning the declaration rapidly. Commander Tirice had indeed made it so. Engineer Camwise had officially expired in Antartica two weeks ago after receiving a fatal dose of radiation while\u00A0performing routine reactor core maintenance. He had failed to comply with the proper safety protocols. The crew of the icecrawler \u003Cem\u003EMontbrun\u003C/em\u003E had buried him on the ice shelf at 68\u00B030\u002725\u201D South, 110\u00B020\u002750\u201D East and returned his personal effects to his family in western Europe. The former moonwalker and interplanetary traveller had met his end during a tragic accident. End of story. Sad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt was highly unlikely that Trans Pacific would open an inquiry or send a team down there to go digging for their deceased employee and find an empty grave. Such accidents were, unfortunately, far too commonplace to be subject to systematic investigation. Nevertheless, Tirice had put her reputation and career on the line so that I might be free. Once more, I felt humbled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThanks, Froe,\u201D I said, relieved of that burden, at least. \u201CSo... what\u0027s the latest news from the front?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s not good, I\u0027m afraid,\u201D he began. \u201COmelek is all but finished as a space centre. Even R\u0026amp;D is being moved out to Madang. In a few months, Omelek will be just another relay station for the long-haul airships. I\u0027m being relocated to Madang, too. Camwise, this means...\u201D he trailed off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201C...that you won\u0027t be able to visit me anymore. I get it. Don\u0027t worry about me, you\u0027re risking far too much as it is. Catbeth will keep me in the loop. Oh, was her candidacy accepted?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CNo, they\u0027re looking for grunts. Cat is too... uhm... experienced. Besides, they want new blood.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENew blood.\u003C/em\u003E The expression was fitting, perhaps in ways that Froemone had not intended. Trans Pacific had recently started a new wave of recruitment for the upcoming colonisation programme. The idea, Froemone explained, was to send numerous small teams of kerbonauts to Near Earth asteroids to extract large quantities of propellant and assess their potential for harvesting other resources. This fuel was then to be stockpiled in both Lunar and Low Earth orbits for the next phase of planetary exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd this time, Froemone had ensured us that the figures added up, thanks to his new engine. Of all the weird and wonderful forms of electric propulsion he had researched, this was the one that would allow us to become a multi-planetary species at last, he claimed. Powered by our latest nuclear reactors or even large solar arrays, it could use a variety of propellants to shift large ships with high efficiency. In fact, you could burn just about anything you could get your hands on with it, including raw resources mined directly from the asteroids themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe plan was to use plain old water mined from space rocks to power the Company\u0027s fleets. We would conquer the system with water rockets. The irony of it all...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe Company intended to begin with a complete exploration of the Moon, returning to the sites that we had always hoped to visit some day. The plan was to operate not from Drygalski Polar Base, but directly from orbit, thus avoiding the need for long and dangerous treks across the Moon\u0027s surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nPlans for the following phase of exploration were unknown beyond the walls of the boardroom, but judging from the hardware that he\u0027d been instructed to develop, Froemone had a pretty good idea of where they intended to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027ve been asked to over-spec the new Lunar lander,\u201D he said. \u201CThe thing is, the delta-vee requirements for Callisto and Ganymede are only a little higher. They haven\u0027t stated it officially, but I\u0027m building a lander for the Jupiter system.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI closed my eyes, remembering the data transmitted by the various probes we had already fired off towards the gas giant, \u003Cem\u003EMartel\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EFontanes\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cem\u003EThree\u003C/em\u003E. The insane levels of radiation around the inner moons. What if one of the Crew datacores was hiding down there? Would the Board balk at condemning a crew to certain death and ordering them down into Jupiter\u0027s seemingly bottomless gravity well?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nProbably not. It didn\u0027t bear thinking about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CDid \u003Cem\u003EFontanes Three\u003C/em\u003E see anything down there?\u201D I asked Froemone, who sighed and rubbed his forehead, his hair now plastered with sweat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI don\u0027t know, Camwise. I no longer have access to any of that data myself. Like you, I just get the beauty shots that are made public. The Board keeps all the raw data under wraps. They kept only one of the former Planetary Investigators on their team, and even if I managed to contact her, getting any sense from \u003Cem\u003Eher\u003C/em\u003E will be unlikely.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nDespite my grim mood and the blistering discomfort of the desert heat, I managed a dry chuckle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CSteledith...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYes, another one of the old-timers they couldn\u0027t do without.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe thought of the Board\u0027s suited thugs trying to extract accurate and useful information from our dotty Planetary Investigator was an amusing one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWhat I do know,\u201D Froemone continued, \u201Cis that we\u0027re launching a new series of probes to the outer system, beyond Jupiter and Saturn. They\u0027re smaller and lighter than the Fontanes class, same thruster type, even higher delta-vee but with a minimalist science package that emphasises surface scanning ability. Trans Pacific has signed for at least three of them, maybe more.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iDq10hA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iDq10hA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022h46KocY.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h46KocY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI let out a low whistle. That must have cost the equivalent of several top-tier executive pension schemes for the reactors and hardware alone, and the Fontanes programme had already used up nearly half the planet\u0027s reserves of xenon. It was a small wonder that there was any left, but it did explain why the headlights on the new rovers that I had repaired recently were of the older, halogen type.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWhat are the targets?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThe ice giants, and perhaps one or more of the KBOs. Some say the Pluto-Charon system, others say Orcus. Maybe both.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zjXD9bh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zjXD9bh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI gaped at Froemone, marvelling at the thought of hitting these distant bodies with probes fired from our little blue planet that huddled close to the warmth of the Sun. In the massive gulf that lay beyond the gas giants, the distances involved seemed immeasurable... However, in recent years, our space telescope had been scouring the skies along the ecliptic, and had found countless small icy bodies wandering along the edge of the Solar System, well beyond the most distant of the eight major planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSteledith had dismissed these new planetesimals as, I quote, \u201C\u003Cem\u003ELumps of ice... boring\u003C/em\u003E.\u201D She was more interested in their orbits. Many of them circled the sun in elongated ellipses, or at high inclination, which suggested that something was lurking out there, perhaps even more distant, and had messed with their trajectories. Something big.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nTrans Pacific however seemed to think that they warranted a closer look, despite the vast distances and long mission times involved. But surely the Crew weren\u0027t out \u003Cem\u003Ethere\u003C/em\u003E, were they? I mean, why cross the gap between the stars to find a planet like Earth, just to then go off and skulk on some distant, frozen comet? It made no sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFroemone interrupted my thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWhat are you going to do now?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MPf3zyg.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MPf3zyg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt was a simple question, but one charged with meaning.

I don\u0027t know, I...\u201D I trailed off. I looked pleadingly at Froemone for a moment. So far, he had said nothing about the only thing that really mattered to me. The real reason why I had insisted we remain in contact. It wasn\u0027t fair of me to press the matter, and I had promised myself not to ask, but I couldn\u0027t help it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CFroe, is there any news of Bartdon and his crew?

The official version of what happened hasn\u0027t changed since it was first reported. \u003Cem\u003EQuissac\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s circularisation burn was miscalculated and she re-entered over the Atlantic.

We both know that \u003Cem\u003EQuissac\u003C/em\u003E was designed to land on Mars, not on Earth. You have to let it go, now. They\u0027re gone, Cam. \u003Cem\u003EShe\u0027s gone\u003C/em\u003E.
