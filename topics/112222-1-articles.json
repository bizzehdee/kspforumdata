As of now, I have a cheap 700x60mm Refractor telescope, on a terrible and wobbly tripod mount, with a single 6mm eyepiece lens. Its enough to view the Moon (aside from its glaring brightness) and the other night I was able to see Jupiter and 4 of its Moons. And amazingly enough, after the vibration finally stopped, I was even able to clearly see both dark bands near the equator! This has made me want a better quality telescope for sure! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nand here is a picture I took through the telescope of some craters on the Moon.

Starfields are... problematic.\n\nLots of intermediate exposure lengths seem to have jitter, despite leaning the camera on objects, or setting it down with a 2 or 10 second exposure delay and then stepping aside. And of course, the sky glow can be nightmarish if there are thin clouds or lots of haze. Leaving the camera facing straight up when the plane of the milky way is overhead seems to be best. My biggest success would be:\n\n![19889501759_6c434baef3_k.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/463/19889501759_6c434baef3_k.jpg)\n\nThat building in the way is shielding the camera from a waxing gibbous moon. I *think* this *barely* detected M13, M92, M56, and M29. If [Source Extractor](http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor) can deal with JPGs it might be interesting to see if it can find them? The image also split the AB-CD component of \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B5 Lyr, but as I was at minimum zoom (f/2.8, 6.2 mm) to maximize light gathering, don\u0027t expect resolution beyond 1\u0027/pixel. At 51s, there are noticeable (12-13 pixel, I think) star trails. Given the amount of sky glow locally (Bortle class 8-9) I\u0027m not sure if a 5-30 minute exposure (for actual star trails) would be worthwhile.\n\nHow about something brighter?\n\n![VTBXY1DsZfNjwP5M1FLbZZCmNNJ-cGJX2RwklbwngAU=w483-h347-no](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VTBXY1DsZfNjwP5M1FLbZZCmNNJ-cGJX2RwklbwngAU=w483-h347-no)\n\n![Z2d1x2HeiS7TN8fhtr83NQE6Jl1_h3aE31pB-_F11Zw=w165-h168-no](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Z2d1x2HeiS7TN8fhtr83NQE6Jl1_h3aE31pB-_F11Zw=w165-h168-no)\n\nIt\u0027s certainly possible to get well exposed and in-focus images of the Moon, but with max zoom (f/4.9, 18.6 mm), the image scale appears to be ~20\u0022/pixel. This does not lead to an interesting amount of detail, and practically speaking makes Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn unresolvable. Also, the red bit in the lower right is as best I can tell a bad pixel. Avoidable provided I don\u0027t aim directly at anything.\n\nOkay, let\u0027s just have the Moon as a background object for a structure? Make the very wide FOV/poor angular resolution a feature instead of a bug?\n\n![20091850745_65dc85b3ea_k.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/548/20091850745_65dc85b3ea_k.jpg)\n\n![19903830720_6f662061ac_k.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/508/19903830720_6f662061ac_k.jpg)\n\nThe dynamic range just isn\u0027t there for both the Moon/lights and structure to be properly exposed.
