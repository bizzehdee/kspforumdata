Because your spacecraft is 119 Km from the surface of Jool (and however many more from the center), the local gravity is much less than you\u0027d expect. KER actually changes your TWR value based on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that even though Jupiter is more than 200 times more massive than Earth its surface gravity is only a little over 2g.

No need to guess at all, you should be able to set KER to Jool and atmospheric mode and then set the altitude slider to 119km. It will then do all the calculations for you, including accounting for the effect of the atmospheric pressure on the ISP, and hence thrust, of your engines...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T15:39:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
