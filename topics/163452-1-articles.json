Good morning everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m playing stock carrer and yesterday tryied\u00A0my first unmanned Duna launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA simple rocket, the same I was using to build a minmus station but with a lot less cargo. (for the station like 4.5t per launch on this less than 1t).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAparently it will do pretty good. Enought fuel to go and take the measurements I need to fullfill a contract. I didn\u0027t do calcs, playing on the try and error. I\u0027m an achitect, not a rocket cientist aahuahuahau.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave every building on level 2 and every tech to the lvl 5 by the wiki tiers. So I have only the basic antennas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point is, very little out of Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E I lost signal. With this tech I will have to make a manned mission or a complex satelite net? I couldn\u0027t launch a simple probe direct to Duna? Will need to open more techs or at least upgrade the tracking station? Researching a little It\u0027s sounding me I will cannot do without at least the DTS-M1 or RA-2 antennas. Had a HG-5 deployed on the probe. More antennas got more strenght? So I need to make my probe a hedgeohg of HG-5s? (and maybe a sat on Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E that\u0027s a hedgehog too).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s bugging me because I like to go slow on tech, and buildings. Not that\u00A0I can do caveman (some da will do) but I try to not hurry and open everything and ending do playing like sandbox. Have my firsts mun fly by with only lvl 4 techs, so no solar panels, only battery pack 1, and stayputnik, and every building on lvl 1, so no manueverig nodes and\u00A0little pieces count.\u00A0I didn\u0027t want to reserch more techs now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: Maybe I need to share with you my Minmus station. It\u0027s for a contract, needs to hold 5 kerbals, 4000 liquid fuel and land. Doing with only the dock port jr.

Lets see your options:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.Going for a kerbaled mission with a pilot will give you full control of the craft regardless of commnet coverage, the drawback is the added mass to support the crew. A orbit Duna and return mission requires less deltaV (but a bit more precision) than Land on Mun and return.\u00A0 In any case you should consider bringing more fuel so you can explore a bit, visit Ike and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.Upgrading the tracking station to lv3 and piling up15x HG-5 will provide a max range over 3Gm 20x will give 3,43Gm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.Unlocking the DTS-M1 (or RA-2, in the same tech node) will allow a range of 10Gm between the craft and a lvl2 craft station. Requires 160 science and unlock a few other parts (personally I find the HECS probecore\u00A0 and the TR-2V decoupler very handy)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.Just send the craft, you don\u0027t need commnet control for a flyby, and if Duna don\u2019t disturb the trajectory too much the craft will eventually come back near Kerbin to transmit the science. If you set a maneuver node and point the craft in the required direction with antecedence you will have no problem following it even with limited control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BjM","CreatedById":178695,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-20T16:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMade some tests yesterday after reading your\u00A0answers and narrowed my choices to either make a manned mission or get the tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately the contract I\u0027m doing needs to make more than one pass around Duna, it\u0027s the one\u0027s that you need to take temp from x points above x altitude, and\u00A0I can\u0027t do this with the limited control.
