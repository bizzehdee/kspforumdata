I\u0027ve been able to bump the clamps together several times but they will not latch. This last time, I was so precise that you couldn\u0027t tell by looking at it that the clamp wasn\u0027t engaged. Watching tutorials it seems you only have to be close and they will pull together magnetically. That isn\u0027t working for me. I just end up bumping the ships together endlessly until I run out of monopropellant. Is this a common problem? I am using the latest version of the game to the best of my knowledge. I have included a screenshot below, showing that I am indeed lining them up very precisely. In the screenshot, the ships are not latched. If I don\u0027t touch the keyboard, they will drift apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O9s8fSI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022O9s8fSI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T04:06:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo dock you will need to turn off your SAS as the clamps start to attract or get close and your confident with manually flying them.. otherwise your ship will try to straighten itself as its getting pulled in..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"babtras","CreatedById":57693,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T05:01:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs it turns out, the problem was because the docking clamp on the smaller craft was installed backwards.

That seems to be the common theme when clamps aren\u0027t trying to pull together, the magnetism is fairly strong and it\u0027s pretty obvious when they try to dock. Actually, the closer I look, the more I\u0027m certain that the Cricket vessel clamp is upside down. The \u0027outside\u0027 has a sort of \u0027finished\u0027 ring, and the \u0027inside\u0027 has a large skirt the is designed to clip inside your vessel. When your placing them, they clamping side by default is pointing up. If I was a betting man I\u0027d say you forgot to flip it before you placed it on the bottom of your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not strictly necessary to turn SAS/ASAS and RCS off while docking, but that seems to be the best practice.

Through review of records, the problem was later determined to likely be faulty wiring in the parachute control system. The fact that the chute opened at all was attributed to luck.[52][not in citation given] It is now believed that the accelerometer controlling the parachute\u0027s pyrotechnics was installed backwards. A similar defect affected the Genesis probe\u0027s sample return capsule when it returned to Earth in September 2004, causing the capsule to crash in the Utah desert.[53] \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T13:07:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sovek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sovek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAhem, pulled from the Wiki.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EURL?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought was, if NASA can lose a probe because their ground station was using imperial units while the probe itself was using metric units, (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_failure\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_failure\u003C/a\u003E) then anything\u0027s possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"babtras","CreatedById":57693,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T01:47:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe obvious question to follow up, is there any way I can rotate the port when assembling it so that it is installed the correct way?
