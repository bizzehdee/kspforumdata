I like to make it overshoot a little and then cancel my horizontal velocity as I cross over the landing spot. Then it\u0027s a matter of making a straight drop down, with a little thrust vectoring to land where I want. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thrust vectoring (or RCS use, if you are so inclined) isn\u0027t terribly hard, but it can take a little practice and requires a firm understanding of the attitude indicator and flightpath markers.
