I tried to create one for the last 2 days and all I have is a lot of dead Kerbals since the port refuses to move while the rest of the animation smashes into it and the whole thing spins itself apart.. It seems that the dockingNode gets rooted to the spot, even when I take an animated part and change it to \u0022dockingNode\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I wish to craft something like a centrifuge (basically a smallish cylinder that spins on the spot that I can dock things to in orbit). Is a rotating dockingNode possible? Im so conused as to how to accomplish this. I know I could use mumech or something like that to do it (the rotatron) but am hoping for a better animated solution to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be appreciated because I r confuse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ahappydude","CreatedById":458,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T15:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm..Ignore raycast?
