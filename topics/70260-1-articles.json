I have thrust curves based on time, not % of propellant expended), but I\u0027ll explain what currently happens:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Two PartModules, Nozzle and Segment. Nozzle is used similarly to a LFE, Segment to a LF tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Nozzle contains atmo curve for Isp, propellant type, and an ignition T\u002B counter. Pretty basic really. Segment basically stores an animation curve with keys containing Time, MassFlow (in tonnes per second), and in and out tangents. Each segment\u0027s burn profile can be edited in the VAB or SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The nozzle part creates a list of connected parts containing a Segment (using the topNode name). This can include itself (for one part boosters)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. On ignition, and thereafter, the Nozzle queries each Segment in the connected parts list to get MassFlow(t). It then subtracts that resource mass from the Segment and sums the MassFlows from all connected Segments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Nozzle then calculates thrust (constant flow, varying Isp makes thrust vary) and applies it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no set limit on the thrust a single nozzle can accommodate, and one can stack booster segments as high as one would like (well, limited to 250 times to help check against an infinite loop).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is tons more info at the release thread, linked in my sig.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T11:33:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you plan to add advanced nozzles ?
