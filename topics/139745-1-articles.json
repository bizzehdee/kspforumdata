in a capsule return, you stay on prograde (or retrograde) so your heatshield points directly into the oncoming blowtorch and keeps your pod out of the line of fire. \u00A0 Spaceplane is the opposite, you pitch up a bit so make a bit of lift or drag. \u00A0Lift keeps you out of the thickest atmosphere till you\u0027ve really slowed down, drag, well, slows you down so there is less heat. \u00A0 There\u0027s a lot of argument about the finer points of technique, some people say pitch up as much as possible for maximum drag, i say go for a moderate high lift position. \u00A0 In this video, shot in 1.0.5, \u00A0i open the cargo bay and lower landing gear for more drag. \u00A0 Not sure if that makes sense in 1.1.12 but we\u0027ll see. \u00A0 \u00A0 It might be a good idea to use inline cockpits so the bit with the crew isn\u0027t the hottest part of the ship. \u00A0 Consider putting a heat shield between the nose cone and the cockpit - it won\u0027t get ablated or create any drag in normal use, \u00A0but if you do come in too hot and burn off the nose cone, the heat shield starts to do its thing and save the ship. \u00A0 Finally if you really want to go health and safety on us you could put a chute in the cargo bay, in case the wings melt. \u00A0 Can be quite a small one, \u00A0since especially with gear down etc. the cockpit of a spaceplane will survive quite high ground impacts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, \u00A0i\u0027d generally use a higher periapsis for re-entry of an SSTO, since they are more fragile. \u00A0 The drawback is, less accurate landing point, however that\u0027s not such a problem in a spaceplane as they have greater ability to glide/fly back to the space centre than something coming down on a parachute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll stop being such a lazy #### \u00A0and upload an ascent video i shot of a recent design that i put on KerbalX.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T17:29:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasic rules\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. \u00A0Fuselage size - small diameter is best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStick with mark 1 fuselages if at all possible, they have so much less drag and weight. \u00A0 If the ship becomes too long and bendy with mk1, and a shorter, fatter type 2 fuselage will fit the same number of kerbals, or if you absolutely need a mark 2 cargo bay, only then consider type 2\u002B.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. \u00A0Parallel fuselages - minimise frontal area\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is closely tied in to the number of engines you are going to support. \u00A0 If you are building under 25 tons and are planning to use fuel and oxidizer, then you need only one engine (a RAPIER) \u00A0and it can be at the tail end of your only fuselage section. \u00A0No need for sponsons, engine pods, parallel fuselages or whatever to add frontal area. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf, like me, you are building an oxidizer-free long range spaceplane that flies to orbit on a combination of air breathing engine and nuclear rocket, \u00A0you\u0027re basically forced to have at least 3 parallel fuselages -
