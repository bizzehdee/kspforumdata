Also, germalto\u0027s model, while nice, was big and didn\u0027t fold up. The Launchpad module can be put into any part, I like the blast shield from HL. Lastly, not everything HAS to be in a fairing, I honestly use fairings for maybe 1/2 my launches, they just get in the way the rest of the time. Also its a little far fetched that something capable of building/launching rockets would fit ready to go in any reasonable sized fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKhaos, don\u0027t interpret as a complain, but as a constructive initiative. I know is under development. The thing about be able to put in a fairing, is better to have a one that fit in a big fairing, and think about to use or not, then to not even fit in. And Because a big part of the game is about to build, my sugestion is that you split in many parts as needed to be a contraction in space. so that way all will fit in fairings and will be more deligful and mission intensive to have a base to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers and grate work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(sorry my english)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SimpleMajority","CreatedById":68820,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T07:00:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnswer how to fix this on page 17 of this thread.
