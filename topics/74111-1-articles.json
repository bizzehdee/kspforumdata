I suggest that they should have a radial version, which would allow you to add them as \u0022support\u0022 almost to other stages. This way they can be useful with the long burn times, because you\u0027ll be using them whilst burning most of your other stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MC.STEEL","CreatedById":89456,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T19:36:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been in these sorts of situations where i was thinking \u0022How do i put more ions on this thing\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T20:20:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting fact: PB-ION engines are like RCS thrusters, in that their output cannot be blocked.
