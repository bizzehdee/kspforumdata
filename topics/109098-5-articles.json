I had an account on this forum a long time ago, but as I\u0027ve lost that email address and can\u0027t access the account (and because KSP is finally released ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) ) I decided that a fresh start might be good.\n\nThis is what I\u0027ve been working on for a few days. It\u0027s inspired really by attempts I had in 0.90 to use B9 Procedural Wings to create a weapon\u0027s bay for fighters. However, due to the way oldFAR worked this was fairly impractical. However, with the new voxel method you don\u0027t get wings stalling just because another wing leads onto them in a panel-like way. \n\nAnyway...\n\n![s9BtiMD.png](http://i.imgur.com/s9BtiMD.png)\n\n![e8kKQyUh.png](http://i.imgur.com/e8kKQyUh.png)\n\nShe performs surprisingly well, given that before embarking on this project my more conventional aircraft were rather uninspiring. At transonic speeds at sea level she\u0027ll turn while quite tightly, topping out the Gs and maintaining speed. At altitude she\u0027ll reach Mach 4 with only little nose dipping. So I suppose she\u0027s a kind of interceptor?...\n\n![qEgijcrh.png](http://i.imgur.com/qEgijcrh.png)\n\nI wanted to go with a sealed canopy design, partly because happing a bubble canopy sticking out of the top would ruin the appearance, and also because sealed canopies are cool. This led to a few issues with the earlier designs, where I made the roof of the canopy out of flaps whose spoilers would be activated to open it up. This design, though, made it incredibly difficult to get the Kerbal out of the cockpit, and meant that I had to have a series of ladders, which, again, ruining the aesthetics. So instead, I decided to have the seat descend out of the bottom of the frontal fuselage, which led to a rather sci-fi design that\u0027s sure to wow the public at airshows. \n\n![aYKEclBh.png](http://i.imgur.com/aYKEclBh.png)\n\nHer cross-section curves are a little wavy, but I can\u0027t think of any ways to improve it particularly without disrupting how she looks. Overall I\u0027m very happy with the initial prototype, and now I\u0027m just working on tweaking things to maximise its potential. I really need to say that FAR is the main thing that keeps me coming back for more KSP. I was more excited for the release of nuFAR than I was for KSP 1.0. The new voxel method is fantastic and very intuitive, and it\u0027s certainly opened up whole new possibilities. Now that I know that this construction method works I\u0027ve got loads of ideas that I want to test out, and I just wanted to float the method with you guys and girls to see if any of you have done anything similar.\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Traches","CreatedById":79229,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T05:22:27Z","Content":"Posting my SSTO spacetruck.

Look at the line for the D-9: It has one of those \u0027sawtooth\u0027 steps like the Mustangs do, but less drastic. The D-12 was a prototype, so I\u0027m no exactly sure of the details, but think that it had a 3-speed supercharger rather than the 2-speed design used on the D-9 and the Mustang. As a result there are 2 smaller drops in speed as you climb rather than 1 big one.\n\nI\u0027m inclined to add another \u0027high altitude\u0027 plane to your list- the Westland Welkin, with a service ceiling of 13 km. Service ceiling FYI is a measure of rate of climb at altitude- it is usually defined as the altitude where the aircraft\u0027s best rate of climb is 1 m/s. The Ta-152H is a special case because the GM-1 system is a nitrous oxide injection system- the engine can operate at much higher altitudes because it is carrying a proportion of its oxidizer in the plane.\n\n Subsonic, straight winged piston props had a very narrow flight envelope at high altitudes- The Welkin\u0027s stall speed at 13 km was only just below its critical mach number, so increasing speed would lead to a shockwave induced stall and decreasing speed would lead to a normal angle of attack induced stall.\n\nAs far as modelling the props is concerned, we really need a separate module with a power curve for the engine at different altitudes and a propeller curve that models how effectively the propeller converts that power into thrust at different speeds. \n\nSupercharged piston engines in general will have a \u0027sawtooth\u0027 power curve (as seen in your speed chart) due to gear shifts, turbocharged piston engines will produce the same amount of power all the way up to their full throttle altitude and then steadily lose power, and turboprops will produce max power at sea level and steadily less power as altitude increases."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T09:24:13Z","Content":"Large-payload finless FAR rocketry still very much doable:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

With the lander, concentrate as much mass as possible down low. As well as aiding balance during landing, it also keeps it aerodynamically stable flying engine-first while aerobraking. The engines serve as heat shields, and everything else is tucked away safely. The airbrakes help with keeping it online, too; they\u0027re set as control surfaces as well as drag brakes.\n\nTo fit in the bay, it will need to be skinny. Vertically-flipped radial tanks are useful, as are Oskar B\u0027s.

Use the FAR flight data window to angle you ship to produce as much lift as possible. Rather than flying down into the atmosphere steadily, you should descend until your lift reverses your vertical velocity and \u0027skips\u0027 you back up into the upper atmosphere. This will give your ship time to cool before you begin to fall down again. Rinse and repeat. With each skip you will lose speed and altitude until you are in air that is too dense for the skipping to work- from there you need to fly the ship like a plane. \n\nThe one thing you need to look out for is if your vertical velocity is too high after a skip you\u0027ll come back down too steeply, so its best to watch the vertical speed gauge and reduce your angle of attack once you\u0027re satisfied with your upward speed."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T00:49:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks, but I actually meant about the stability in launch without fins and such.
