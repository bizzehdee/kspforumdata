This brought my perihelion down to ~4,300,000 km to somewhat line it up with Moho\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I time warped to the Kerbin-Sun SOI transition with no change in my solar orbit once past it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I setup a mid-course correction at the descending node to finish my inclination change, and to get an encounter with Moho (a closest approach of ~4,000 km). This will occur about 80 Kerbin days later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I leave to go back to the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) In the tracking station screen, I see that my probe headed towards Moho is on track, and that the maneuver I had setup is correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) I proceed with working on another mission that lasts about 14 Kerbin days within the Kerbin system (this includes several fast time warps).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) I go back to the tracking station, and now see that the orbit around the Sun for my Moho probe is off, and that my planned maneuver no longer gives me the encounter with Moho...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) I go to the probe, and see that my perihelion is now over 5,000,000 km (about a 17% increase) and I have also gained ~300,000 km at aphelion. I try messing with the maneuver node to get an encounter again, but my solar orbit has shifted so much that I am now unable to get an encounter with Moho with a reasonable amount of fuel (i.e., if I create a maneuver to intersect Moho\u0027s orbit at the same position as the previous planned maneuver, Moho will be nearly a 1/3 ahead of my probe in it\u0027s orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing a programmer, I know how floating point errors can cause issues, especially with SOI transitions and encounter calculations within the game, but the orbit change happened when I was already in solar orbit, after the SOI transition from Kerbin escape but well before the Moho SOI, and it was not the active vessel. From my understanding of the game, the probe was on \u0022rails\u0022 at the time and there should have been no calculations that would have suddenly shifted the perihelion and aphelion like it did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have experienced this several times over the past few months, across several versions of the game, both modded and un-modded. It usually happens with Moho encounters, but it has happened with Jool a couple of times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThinkOutsideTheHangar","CreatedById":100722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T01:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the patched conics system isn\u0027t so accurate?

Maybe it came too close to an asteroid this time, which threw it off? I wasn\u0027t tracking any at the time though, and I would assume that the same rules for inactive vessels on \u0022rails\u0022 would apply to asteroids too... unless there is some sort of background interaction that inadvertently threw the orbit off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
