What if I ever decide to remove the mod, either because I don\u0027t want to use it anymore or other various possibilities. Now I don\u0027t usually use part mods (not that I have anything against them), but I\u0027m assuming if you have a craft with modded parts on it and then proceed to remove the mod the craft probably is removed and unloadable, correct? With that being said, that is probably the only reason I generally avoid part mods and tend to stick to using mostly plugins.
