Let\u0027s determine if the bug happens in the most minimal install possible.  \n\n1.Remove all of your mods.  \n\n2. Install only SVE and its dependencies (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and Scatterer)   \n\n3. Run the game. If you don\u0027t have the issue, great! Now add your mods back a couple at a time until you see the issue. This will help you narrow down which mod is the issue. Then make a bug report to that mod author.\n\n[@Kwebib](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/187180-kwebib/) Looking at your mods, you are using mods that are known to not work properly in 1.4.X. One being Reentry Particle Effect. That may not be your issue, but it makes it much harder for developers to debug issues when you are using outdated mods. I also recommend you follow my instruction above. \n\nMod authors don\u0027t have endless hours of free time, especially blackrack, who works full time and maintains scatterer in the little free time he does get, so when we have bugs, we need to be ready to present them with the quickest way to reproduce the issue. Reporting a bug without doing your due diligence just isn\u0027t fair.   \n\nPersonally, cannot replicate this bug, and I have tried for the last 2 hours. If it is a mod incompatibility, its on the user to narrow down what mod is causing this. Blackrack cannot download every part mod and test each part on the launch pad to figure this out. So, lets try to help him out, yeah?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-02T13:40:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2018 01:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Galileo**"},{"CreatedByName":"nebuchadnezzar","CreatedById":63794,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-02T13:40:14Z","Content":"Thank you for the continued updates and hard work, [@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/).
