I *believe* Rover mentioned working out the bees with the pre-releases and ScanSAT / USI would be fully compatible with each other as RELEASE this weekend. You can hit up Rover\u0027s USI mods on Dropbox ( just hit any of his threads and click the dropbox link in his signature ) to download the PRE-RELEASE versions. Caveat Emptor ... BACKUP your saves before installing pre-releases.\u003Cp\u003E ~M~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Current version of PRE-RELEASE Karbonite is 0.5.5, Regolith is 0.1.5, MKS is 0.22.6 ... if CKAN is showing older/different ( I don\u0027t use it, couldn\u0027t tell you ) then this is a possible source of bees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHanks for explaining all of that; on a phone no less!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will give this a go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOUTSTANDING!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest version of ScanSat and Karbonite do work together, the \u0022resources\u0022 radio button finally shows up in the lower lefthand of the big map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHooray!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T17:11:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Erequest: percent completion for the currently-displayed map type in the SC/TS map window.

The big map and KSC map will show scanning coverage (altimetry, both high and low, for the elevation and slope map, and biome \u0026amp; anomaly for the biome map) and if you have a resource overlay turned on it will take that into account too. The stock biome map thing is also simple to add, I\u0027ll probably add a global toggle to switch between that and the default style (which I want to improve a bit, too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/el9XKq1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022el9XKq1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Horus","CreatedById":99705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T18:35:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@DMagic, is it possible to introduce control for map overlays transparency.
