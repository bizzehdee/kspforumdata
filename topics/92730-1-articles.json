The lab would be similar to Tiangong-1 a small 8 tonne module capable of supporting a crew of 3 for a month or 2 crews half a month each (with a 1-2 year wait in-between the two crews). In fact the module could just be a slightly modified Tiangong or Tianzhou, the bottom of the structure would of course have a large landing system weighing perhaps 16 tonnes. The thing would be about 25 tonnes and would be launched on a 100 tonnes to leo rocket, it would land on the moon and wait until a 2nd launch would take the crew to the moon where they would land besides the lab and work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea\u0027s for what the crews would do includes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtra long exploration expeditions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch into using lunar resources\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch into building on the moon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall experimenting/preparing for the large base\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther science requiring micro gravity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any other ideas I would like to hear them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-13T18:31:25Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2014 06:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by xenomorph555\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T18:21:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think changing the crew out every two to four weeks would make it more expensive to run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, at least if you plan on it being continuously crewed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be cheaper in the long run to have enough modules on the surface to keep the crews there for six months at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T18:29:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tommygun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tommygun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think changing the crew out every two to four weeks would make it more expensive to run.\u003Cp\u003EWell, at least if you plan on it being continuously crewed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be cheaper in the long run to have enough modules on the surface to keep the crews there for six months at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry I didn\u0027t mean it like that, I meant a new crew would return to the lab 1-2 years later, not a direct swap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"trekkie_","CreatedById":36130,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T18:34:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main idea for a starter moon base is a large moving vehicle capable of housing several people.
