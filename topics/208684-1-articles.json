But at that point, you\u0027d might as well play Science mode instead, but then you lose money, rep, and facility upgrades.

really interact in the stock game, and while reputation does influence both, I have never felt the need to pay special attention to it.\u00A0 Of course, that\u0027s just a way of restating your point--if the science and finance systems were interdependent, then you wouldn\u0027t be able to cheat one out of existence and still have a meaningfully playable game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy general goal is to try to force the science and finance systems to interact more, mainly by making science points tremendously more expensive so that I have to spend more money to acquire them (and even more to use them--I have the game set to require Funds to unlock the tech in the various nodes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mod a few things, such as the big \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E converter, to work less efficiently (no self-powered \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E plants for me), or to die off, such as the RTGs which I mod to decay.\u00A0 I use an extended tech tree that costs more to unlock, and also spreads out the technology so that each node unlocks less.\u00A0 I also turn down the science rewards to the point that there isn\u0027t enough science in the solar system for me to unlock the entire tree without labs, asteroids, and contracts that award science outside of the fixed-value experiments on and around celestial bodies.\u00A0 I make labs a good deal less efficient, but I also massively increase their data storage because the alternative is needing to revisit them every five minutes to top them off--I prefer to macromanage those sorts of things, not micromanage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis approach generally forces a careful build-out, but it puts me in a position where I need to pick and choose what I am going to develop for missions farther afield.\u00A0 The contract system, then, helps to guide and direct those missions--whether I go towards Moho or Eeloo is often determined by the contracts generator--rather than serve as a way to make some quick money to use in the thing that I really wanted to do all along.\u00A0 The research choices are then informed by the contract destinations:\u00A0 I can invest in power technology so that I can charge a battery out near Eeloo, but at the cost of being able to invest in more powerful engines, for example.\u00A0 Or I can go the other way and use the basic solar panels at Moho, but not unless I have good enough engines and propellant tanks that I can actually stop there after I arrive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do make a couple of things \u0027easier\u0027:\u00A0 I set the temperature and pressure sensors (and any other sensor that only generates a number without handling a material) to fully return transmitted science, because why would it somehow be better to recover the sensor that reads \u0027173K\u0027 rather than just transmit the value?\u00A0 However, to balance this, I also generally make it so that it takes multiple experiments to fully extract the available science points.\u00A0 In other words, I\u0027m not going to land in the Badlands, take out a thermometer, and assume that that is the Universal Badlands Temperature.\u00A0 I\u0027m going to take several measurements, which means either staying a while or making multiple trips.\u00A0 There are exceptions:\u00A0 I don\u0027t need to take multiple pressure measurements in high orbit, for example.\u00A0 The overall idea is to make the science, research, and development sides have a little more to do with one another, and thus make the game a little more realistic without needing to go to the same extent as Realism Overhaul.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I can return the science that I gather and maybe unlock something that will ease the second trip.\u00A0 If this all seems very tedious to you, well, that\u0027s probably because it is.\u00A0 But it works for me.\u00A0 I will say that I try to balance it so that I unlock everything before I\u0027ve gone everywhere (that\u0027s where contracts and labs come into play) because it doesn\u0027t make sense to unlock that big, fancy engine only\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0you\u0027ve proven that you don\u0027t need it and can do just as well with something inferior.\u00A0 But I\u0027ve never liked the idea of being able to unlock the whole tech tree before getting beyond Minmus, either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-22T16:29:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got a better one.
