Of course some bugs were to be expected. My only issue is the lack of response we\u0027ve gotten as to when we can expect fixes. I\u0027m sure you guys are super busy, especially considering that you\u0027re actively hiring at the moment. We would just love to see something along the lines of \u0022Hey guys, we have acknowledged these issues and we\u0027re sorting them out asap. You can expect to see a fix in the next few days\u0022 or something along those lines. I live and breathe KSP and I personally, am unable to play on the PC,\u00A0so this is gut wrenching for me. I can handle a few bugs here and there but we have a game breaker on both Xbox one and PS4. We would just like a little peace of mind knowing that we haven\u0027t been forgotten and knowing that we won\u0027t have to sit here twiddling our thumbs waiting on a fix for our purchase. I feel that the\u00A0$40 we\u00A0spent on this game at least merits some response here and there. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027m no naysayer asking for my money back, just a (very) dedicated gamer waiting on my fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T14:52:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222685526\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144273\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469111509\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166608\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Homedawgian\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, Homedawgian said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n~snip~\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I noticed in a different post is that the console seems to be running a version of KSP that is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot \u003C/strong\u003E1.1.3. This might be where some of your bugs are coming from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d imagine that most of them can be fixed as soon as the consoles update to 1.1.3. This might be delayed, though, because of the console certification process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-22T16:10:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[redacted, done contributing]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-16T14:26:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2016 02:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Violent Jeb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Homedawgian","CreatedById":166608,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-22T16:18:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s one Squad staff member I was talking to for a while and I\u0027ve got in touch with Flying Tiger.
