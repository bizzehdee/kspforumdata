It\u0027s my first time posting (and building \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) a spacecraft that I thought was unique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntroducing Spaceship -1! Yes, before SpaceShipOne, our old buddy Burt had some kinks to work out and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esome theories to prove. What better way to do that than with \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ehighly expendable rocket fodder\u003C/span\u003E professional kerbanaughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ship consists of two stages, the first is the lifting stage which comprises 6 LFR and a ton of SAS and RCS modules. Once that stage is complete, it literally falls out of the bottom of the spacecraft to reveal the flight stage. (Shown in the attached pics)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETips for flying: It has a tendency to flip wildly if you use too much thrust. Take off at about 90% power then throttle back to around 75% to keep it under control. Once separation occurs, do whatever, buzz the tower, I don\u0027t care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods Required: Sunday Punch, the wings by Jaanus, the wings from C7-Aerospace, and the SAS modules by II Carnefice\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I just flew a pretty successful mission. Flew straight up until around 50000m, then flew level for a few minutes. I was able to turn around with what fuel I had left (not a lot) and from there fly/glide back to the launch pad. Burt would be proud.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"venku122","CreatedById":3217,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-09T07:06:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI prefer the mother of all flying objects myself\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iiXfP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iiXfP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor maybe you prefer the sleek high power type of spaceplanes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kShLD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kShLD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
