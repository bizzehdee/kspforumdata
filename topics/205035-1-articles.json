The trick to it is making it so it doesn\u0027t get annoying or repetitive - which it can (Fallout 4 battle music I\u0027m looking at you). Adaptive music could be most effective/emotive during the decent and landing phases of a mission to a new celestial body. Imagine a soundtrack that responds to changes in altitude, g-force, airspeed and estimated time to touchdown or impact. The musical tension builds as you get closer and closer to target coordinates and then when you touchdown,\u00A0\u00A0a \u0022\u003Cem\u003ETadaa!!!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 celebration track plays.

The same could be said for success and failure tracks. Depending the difficulty of the success or what the failure was, where and when it happened could all easily be dynamically reflected in the accompanying soundtrack. Easypeasy!

All we know is that they did in fact delay it a year from when they projected it should release, and that that happened during a world pandemic, which leads me to believe they did have a period of time where they were intentionally NOT working on the game in any significant way, in order to protect the health of the game developers (they\u0027re people too!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of that, I don\u0027t agree that they \u0022should add\u0022 anything \u0022because of the delays\u0022, that\u0027s just not at all how game development or anything works. You get a reason to delay the game, that doesn\u0027t mean you \u0022can\u0022 or \u0022should\u0022 add more features to the game. In fact, it might be a reason that you have to CUT features FROM the game in order to meet your new deadline (even tho that deadline has been pushed back). I sincerely hope nothing has been cut from KSP 2, and since I\u0027ve heard no news about it I\u0027m going to continue thinking that nothing has been cut until I hear otherwise from an OFFICIAL source. This is much more likely with games that have a release date dictated by the publisher, which is why I think that particular approach to game design is inherently flawed (or at least that\u0027s one of the inherent flaws to that approach to game design, but I really dislike it when publishers push around the actual game development studio into doing things that that game development studio otherwise would not have done, and the best examples of that that come to mind are \u0022Cutting/adding features without having a detailed knowledge of the game\u0022, and \u0022overly aggressive deadline placement for the sole purpose of beating a competitor to market\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelieve it or not, if push comes to shove one of the first features that I think will be dropped from KSP 2 is \u0022multiplayer\u0022. It\u0027s probably quite complex to get it working, and IMO it doesn\u0027t really add all that much to the game (or put more correctly, it\u0027s impossible to judge how much it adds to the game without having it in the game in the first place). Not to mention that the solutions to the potential \u0022griefing\u0022 problems are both critical and not easy to conceptualize in a way that either makes it harder to work together or makes it too easy to harm others creations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just want a working, playable game, even if it does have \u0022a few\u0022 non critical non save corrupting bugs like graphical glitches or potentially even parts that are just placeholders (or placeholder textures for those parts).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s what happened with KSP 1, and it turned out just fine in the end as far as I\u0027m concerned (yes, yes, there\u0027s still several massive issues with the core code of the game, but what I\u0027m saying is that KSP 1 as it is RIGHT NOW is in a very playable state, even if things could have been coded better had the original developers had more experience making video games, and that particular objection has been quite soundly removed with the developers of KSP 2).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe music, while important, doesn\u0027t have to be finished when the game comes out.

I do hope for more different tracks in KSP 2, but if we end up with 5 tracks at launch I\u0027ll figure out a way to live with it. Hopefully if that does come to pass, they\u0027ll add more music tracks later as the game becomes more feature complete if it\u0027s not launched in a feature complete state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-14T17:22:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2021 05:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-16T18:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224042993\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205035\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221634231877\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212748\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/14/2021 at 7:17 PM, SciMan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly my point. 2/3 people on a server is what most people would call a \u0022dead game\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly people that doesn\u0027t know how coop games work, I just finished playing an Enigmatica 2: Expert run (modded Minecraft) with my friends on a paid hosted server (a quite heavy modpack) and we had 6 slots for 6 people and usually were around 2 or 3 online only on the evenings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not a dead game, just a small server between friends, on Stellaris, Europa Universalis, Factorio or a miriad of other games it would be considered a crowded server.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Sea of Thieves each servers has up to 6 ships, every ship has a crew between 1 and 4 players, usually server aren\u0027t full and 4 people Galleons are quite a Rare sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot every game is about massive amounts of players, and I bet KSP2 won\u0027t be either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224042993\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205035\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221634231877\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212748\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/14/2021 at 7:17 PM, SciMan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI basically don\u0027t want it to turn into a 20 player server where the game becomes \u0022find the griefer before they destroy your stuff\u0022, and furthermore I hope that very robust moderation tools are available so that you can prevent the griefing from happening in the first place.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been part of a Minecraft Towny community for almost a decade, 6 years of which I was in the management staff of the server.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0its peak the server had hundreds of active players and 40 people online was considered a dead day, we were the most popular server in my country (while the popularity of Towny RPG server lasted).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all that time we got less than an handful cases of griefing (and it was in the middle of the Minecraft griefing YouTube craze) and all of them were quite limited in scope and solved with 2 commands, one to ban the griefer and the other to rollback the action of that specific player, leaving intact the rest of the server.

So most people simply took to figuring out how to cause harm to whatever someone else was doing, myself included on a few occasions (but I never griefed people without them griefing me first).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen maybe 5 years later, I started playing Space Engineers, and I never got the courage to go on a multiplayer server with that game because I saw so many videos of the same kind of thing happening as happened in Gmod (granted Space Engineers is a game about building spacecraft to fight each other, but that\u0027s not why I played it, so I never had a good reason to go online in it).\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I was playing Gmod, it got to the point where I couldn\u0027t play on any of my favorite Gmod servers anymore because if they were \u0022open\u0022 enough to be fun, they were also not locked down enough to prevent griefing, and the griefers were everywhere.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe it\u0027s just because most of the admins were teens that didn\u0027t know how to act towards their parents, let alone other people, so if you called an admin to report you got griefed, it was a 50/50 if they banned YOU instead of the griefer because the griefer was a friend of the admin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou know, now I think about it it\u0027s the same reason that makes high school such a common source of mental trauma for people that aren\u0027t the \u0022cool kids\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I guess what I\u0027m trying to say is that I hope KSP 2 doesn\u0027t become like Gmod or Space Engineers, not that it shouldn\u0027t have multiplayer. Not having any kind of real purpose-built weapons systems is a good start to that I guess. It would be nice (but probably not practical) if KSP 2 also had \u0022change roll-back\u0022 options available to the host and/or admins, as well as the ability for you yourself to turn on or off the ability for your vessel to collide and dock with other vessels from other players (or the admins would also be able to override that setting of course, if you\u0027re a griefer you get no service), that way if you expected to get griefed you could just basically turn off collisions between you and the griefer (or you and everyone else) and they wouldn\u0027t be able to harm you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kerbal","CreatedById":207217,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-19T00:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with this.
