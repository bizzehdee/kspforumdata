I am currently on the \u0022From the Mun\u0022 tutorial and the circularize objective appears to be bugged. I completed the maneuver and have less than 5km difference from apoapsis to periapsis, and am orbiting the planet, but the next option isn\u0027t available. I restarted the tutorial and tried again, and this time I only have a difference of about 500m, but it still isn\u0027t allowing me to continue. I have tried deleting the maneuver afterwards and leaving it, but that has no effect. Is there something I am missing or is it bugged?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-27T03:59:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see the same problem with the tutorial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I\u00A0let the tutorial stop my burn from the Mun when my apoapsis is 100km, \u00A0and then circularize near 100km above the Mun, \u00A0then I get the Next button and can continue. \u00A0So you could restart the tutorial and just let the tutorial auto-stop your burn (probably what the software testers did).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, you could ignore the frozen instructions and re-enter without the benefit of instructions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WolfWhiteFire","CreatedById":182397,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-27T23:06:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI attempted that, my apoapsis is now 101,674m, my periapsis is now 100,519m, unfortunately next is still not an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ravensierra","CreatedById":182380,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-28T08:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found the next button to appear only when executing the maneuver that\u0027s generated within 1.0m/s, so make sure you\u0027re doing that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WolfWhiteFire","CreatedById":182397,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-28T14:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you please clarify that?
