The plane\u0027s a wee bit underpowered IMO, but if I manage her climb angle she can make speeds/altitudes that I shouldn\u0027t have any problem turning into a successful orbit. But, when I get to the point where I switch my Rapiers to closed cycle, the plane\u0027s nose will start to pitch up and it ends up tumbling end over end.

When I first start to accelerate, it\u0027ll turn to the right, but fairly gently and I can turn back to 90 degrees if I do it gently and it\u0027ll stay once it gets up to speed. I tested it at 1/3rd throttle and if I keep the speed low the instability gets worse and worse.
