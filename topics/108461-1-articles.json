For only the Translate Down \\_secondary\\_ binding, when I set to to all modes, it saves as \u0022Docking (translation)\u0022 mode only.\n\nI can work around this, by just binding my gamepad button to the \\_primary\\_ binding, since I don\u0027t really use IJKL anyways, but I thought it might be worth reporting. It doesn\u0027t seem to matter what button on the gamepad I bind to it, and I haven\u0027t found any other bindings that this happens for (even the other secondary translate bindings)."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T17:00:50Z","Content":"Hi stampy, you may have to edit the settings.cfg to get the bindings you want, I don\u0027t think I can diagnose this much further without your game logs, please see the support stickies for more info ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
