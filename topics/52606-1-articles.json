The poodle is pretty bad at sea level, with an ISP of only 270. You might want to try using an aerospike, though I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027ll have enough thrust.

You wind up with a solid connection that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve found a workaround though, so that\u0027s just something to file away for the future. You\u0027ll probably have to build the bottom part of your craft as a subassembly if you try the docking port trick (or at least the bottom part of the engine \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esandwich\u0022). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others have suggested, you can use I-Beams to extend your lander legs to the point where they stick out below your engines.

Its a design for Duna being tested on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Anyway, something like that would work with nukes. If you don\u0027t have I-beams, you can try the long girder segments that become available with Advanced MetalWorks on Tier 6 (300 pts) of the tech tree.
