I\u0027m UpsilonAeropace.\n\nAs you\u0027ve probably seen, the [White Bar Group](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127476-Say-Hello-to-the-White-Bar-Group%21) has recently been approaching two dozen members, including many that were previously in the [Light-Green Group](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95623-Say-Hello-to-the-Light-Green-Group%21). Personally, I\u0027m not a fan of the White Bar Group: it seems like it will be no more than a silly passing fad for most. It does, however, bring up an interesting question:\n\nShould the Reputation System Exist At All?\n\n~~~\n\nThis is actually quite a complicated issue, and one that merits some further attention. So please excuse the following ramblings (I\u0027m very tired) as I discuss what the Reputation system is and how it affects the community.\n\n~~~\n\n**What is Reputation?**\n\nAccording to the official Forum page on Reputation:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The reputation allows you to give a compliment to other users who have made a quality post or have helped you. Giving a reputation point is generally considered a nice gesture.\n\nIt seems that Reputation is what you get when a person enjoys a post you made enough to click the little black star-shaped button. People with a lot of Reputation have made plenty of posts that many people enjoy (or helped lots of people). The posts may be in the Fanworks, in the modding subforum, on the Spacecraft Exchange, or on General Discussions, but the premise remains the same. *It\u0027s really as simple as that.*\n\n~~~\n\n**So, what benefits does Reputation have?**\n\nI can think of two. One, however, is a double-edged sword.\n\nOne of the benefits of Reputation is that it does provide new Forum-goers with a general sense of who is respected within the community. The only other basic statistics gleaned from someone\u0027s post is their join date and their number of posts. Neither of these do quite as good a job of indicating a person\u0027s status as Reputation does, in my opinion. I don\u0027t think you would disagree.\n\nWhen I first started the Light-Green Group in October of last year, it seems as if there was a strong correlation between respectability and Reputation. Over the course of the last year, this correlation has weakened. Perhaps this is because of reasons I\u0027ll discuss in a bit.\n\nThe other reason is that it\u0027s nice to receive Reputation. It makes everyone smile a bit. This reason, however, actually may have negative consequences for our Forum.\n\n~~~\n\n**Why would Reputation be a bad thing?**\n\nI\u0027ll start off with the other edge of the double-edged sword that I mentioned earlier. People really enjoy getting Reputation... but sometimes, this positive feedback can lead to negative consequences! Some people have gained Reputation by posting acerbic criticism of SQUAD or (shudder) other Forum-goers. The latter doesn\u0027t happen very often, but I\u0027ve seen it happen to others and had it happen to myself; the former has run increasingly rampant over the past several months. Giving positive feedback for doing negative\\* things really isn\u0027t great.\n\nTo clarify: **I know that the reputation system isn\u0027t causing people to bash SQUAD or anyone else.** SQUAD has made mistakes and trolls exist, and there\u0027s nothing anyone can do about that. I am, however, saying that giving a \u0027reward\u0027 for being scathingly critical encourages the process to continue. It also makes highly critical people seem more reputable in the minds of some Forum-goers. In short, while Reputation isn\u0027t the cause of such behavior, it does play a role in allowing it to flourish.\n\nThere are other negative consequences to the Reputation system as well: people can, for example, try to speak with authority on matters that they don\u0027t know enough about and be lent a bit of false credibility by their Reputation levels. (Perhaps that\u0027s what I\u0027m doing right now!) There\u0027s also some people out there who want Reputation enough to post their good ideas and craft in far too many places on the Forum, practically spamming the system. Finally, there are threads that exist for the sole purpose of asking for Reputation; I fear the Light-Green Group may fall into this category, and I can\u0027t say that I\u0027ve been above asking for Reputation myself. All of these problems are threats to idea of Reputation as it stands, though the first one certainly has the biggest potential to negatively affect the Forum.\n\n\\*I\u0027m just going to put this out there: some people have crossed the line between \u0027constructive criticism\u0027 of SQUAD and \u0027bullying.\u0027 The former is *absolutely* needed in this Forum, but the latter is both intolerable and frequently rewarded by the Reputation system. Different people draw the lines in different places, but some of the snark and bile I\u0027ve seen on the Forum is inexcusable... and it is often rewarded with some handsome Reputation as well.\n\n~~~\n\n**Is there a way to circumvent this problem?**\n\nSure! It\u0027s quite simple.\n\nOne thing to do is stop giving Reputation to people who are being scathingly critical of SQUAD, instead diverting it to people who post constructive criticism or who are otherwise being helpful. I want to link here to Deddly\u0027s [Positive Forum Movement](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111773-The-Positive-Forum-movement); it does a pretty good job recommending the same general plan laid out here. \n\nThe problem is, while many people posted on Deddly\u0027s thread saying that they would try to be nicer, the balance of the Forum *still* shifted strongly into the negative after the release of 1.0, and a great many chunks of Reputation still went to people claiming that the game was broken and that SQUAD had done an awful job with the new update. Even today, the Forum is still not as cheerful a place as it was a scant six months ago... could this be due, in part, to the distribution of Reputation? Maybe.\n\nOh, and it would also be nice to only give Reputation to people who have made a worthy post in general. Sadly, I\u0027ve created a thread or two that asked people to deliver Reputation just for the heck of it. I really regret doing that - it\u0027s further eroded the Reputation system - but hindsight is 20/20, unfortunately.\n\n~~~\n\nSo, addressing the original question:\n\n**Should the Reputation System exist at all?**\n\nI personally like the Reputation system. Maybe that\u0027s because I have more Reputation than most people on the Forum, or maybe it\u0027s because I know it\u0027s great to get rewarded for the cool stuff people create. **But I feel as if people should know that Reputation is not as important as some may think.** There are many reasons for this, and perhaps if people did not place this system in such high regard, they would be a tiny bit less critical. It\u0027s funny to be saying that a system originally designed to be spreading niceness and encouraging positive, constructive ideas now seems to be doing the exact opposite...\n\n**So, in short, I would make it clear somehow that Reputation is a very worthy thing to give and receive, but that it\u0027s not worth the emphasis that some place on it.**\n\nI\u0027m sure you have some good ideas of how to change the current Reputation situation.\n\n~~~\n\nPardon my rambling. I just realized that this was a *really* long post! I think I\u0027m done now. Thanks for reading this thread. I look forward to your discussion (please keep it rational and civil, as always).\n\n-Upsilon\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T12:50:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 12:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by UpsilonAerospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T22:41:48Z","Content":"Rep should only be for the nice and helpful people IMO."},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T22:43:18Z","Content":"Honestly chap, you\u0027re worrying too much about something that really doesn\u0027t matter.

Different people draw the lines in different places, but some of the snark and bile I\u0027ve seen on the Forum is inexcusable... and it is often rewarded with some handsome Reputation as well.\n\nIt\u0027s only you that thinks harsh criticism of Squad is \u0022bullying\u0022. This harsh criticism is only because Squad hasn\u0027t listened to our criticism in the past, so we\u0027re resorting to harsher means in the hopes that they\u0027ll listen to us (which they aren\u0027t). It\u0027s also because of the fact that people warned Squad about the dangers of going to 1.0 and predicted what the finished product would be like, and when Squad pushed ahead and the product was indeed half-glassed and alpha-quality it resulted in this harsh criticism. Also, your last sentence suggests you\u0027re feeling less special with your high amount of rep and hints at the underlying reasons of why you made this thread.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps that\u0027s what I\u0027m doing right now!)\n\nYes\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Should the Reputation System exist at all?\n\nNo\n\nI think you\u0027re just envious that a bunch of people are nearing you amount of rep, so you want the entire system removed or devauled to a miniscule point so that you don\u0027t have to worry about it anymore.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The EVE: Online forums studied this issue and decided on a pure \u0022like\u0022-only system - for individual posts. Anyone can see your total \u0022like\u0022 counter, similar to this forum\u0027s Rep count - but it\u0027s default-hidden. In that system, your name, post, and its total \u0022like\u0022 count, takes center stage. The white bar group is saying something similar: judge me based on the words in this post, not my green bars.\n\nSeems like a better system.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I could care less about reputation. I don\u0027t give two \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. In fact, if you gave me a vast quantity of \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, I wouldn\u0027t give any of them to the Rep system. I care more about the quality of the posts and writing in a person\u0027s piece rather than their reputation. I (at least) try to write posts that will accomplish the goal of being written well and with a clear, concise voice rather than posts that will accrue reputation points. If I see a post that I think is excellent, I\u0027ll remember the person\u0027s name, and when I see their name as the author of a post or comment I\u0027ll be more likely to read it than if I don\u0027t recognize their name. If I really like it I might give them a reputation point, but usually I\u0027ll give one to thank them without replying in the thread and thus cluttering it with something off-topic. If I canvass a thread and just look at the reputation bar, It\u0027s a crapshoot whether or not I\u0027ll like the post or comment.\n\u003E My view is rep on any forum is just like Facebook friends. Some make a big game out of seeing who can accumulate the greatest amount, some don\u0027t ever want to accumulate any at all. Some think it\u0027s a great feature, Some think it\u0027s a horrible feature. Some have a little, some have a lot. Some use it usefully, some use it outrageously. But ultimately, it means absolutely nothing and is probably a waste of time.\n\nAgreed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T16:49:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Master Tao**"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T04:18:15Z","Content":"I would like to say I am on another forum that uses a like based system, and it works well.
