I\u0027m wondering what is the most efficient way of getting into orbit for a spaceplane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay my target orbit is 150kmx150km. During the initial climb into space, if I aim for an apoapsis of 71km, then I\u0027m minimising the amount of time my plane is unpowered and slowing down. However, the lower your altitude, the higher your orbital velocity, so I might have a longer circularisation burn to perform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand if I shoot for an initial 150km apoapsis on the initial climb, I\u0027m losing a lot of speed coasting up to that height, but it might be partly offset by the lower orbital speeds at the higher altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy instinct is to shoot up to an initial 71km apo, then do an orbital burn that results in an apoapsis of 150km and circularise from there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T16:28:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the 71km one is best. Assuming you are using air jets first, it is easier to get a 71km apoapsis than 150km. Then you can use your rocket engines out of the atmosphere which means they have a higher ISP so they are more fuel efficient. Also you will have less loss due to gravity. The orbital velocity is lower the higher up you go but it requires more fuel to reach that high first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T16:48:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s always better (more energy-efficient) to go for the high apoapsis right away, rather than circularising at a lower altitude first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of jet-driven vessels: if you can produce useful thrust at very high altitudes, you can use that to raise your apo to well above 100km basically for free -- go for it. If your jets no longer work at high altitudes, you want to get out of the atmosphere quickly; going for a 150km apo will lead to a steeper ascent and gets you out of drag sooner.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaRocketeer","CreatedById":103193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T16:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut wouldn\u0027t a steep ascent mean that I don\u0027t accumulate much speed on the jets, and have to rely on the less efficient rockets more?

Either way, you have to raise your periapsis to 71 before you can raise it to 150. The question is likely about optimising the ascent to get to vacuum as quickly as possible without pitching up so hard that your forward velocity falls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, with FAR, I pitch up to about a 200-250m/s ascent once I\u0027ve reached maximum speed and altitude on jets and cut the rockets in (usually 30km). Seems to clear the worst of the drag (below 50km) pretty readily and results in a periapsis that is often positive by the time my apoapsis is 100km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPitching up harder for a faster ascent tends to cost you forward momentum, since your putting the broad side of your wings against your prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
