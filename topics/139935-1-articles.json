After a long time, I finally decided to launch a ship to Duna (manned, of course. I can\u0027t risk my unmanned probes\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) I wanted some help landing on Duna. The most trouble I seem to get is to get an intercept to Duna by Hohmann transfer. What is the ideal relative position of Kerbin and Duna, to get a nice trajectory? Also, are 19 radial drogue parachutes, 9 radial parachutes, and 1 main parachute enough for landing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T08:44:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the launch window, there are some good planning tools out there; my personal favorite is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz.\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the parachutes: it totally depends on your ship design. However, in general, the solution to landing on Duna is generally not to spam parachutes; it\u0027s just not efficient use of mass. My own preferred choice: add just a couple of drogues and a small number of regular chutes.\u00A0 That\u0027s enough to slow down to a few dozen meters per second. Then use a brief burst of retro-thrust to slow down just before impact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt only needs a smidgeon of fuel, which weighs much less than tons of parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gojira1000","CreatedById":152681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T19:12:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceplanes are a nice option as well, for Duna - then you only need a pair of chutes for final stopping power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T01:48:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo find a nice transfer window, the first thing you need to do is to be able to approximate it by eye. Then you can refine it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo: the first nice thing is to accept a contract early that asks for sending a probe\u00A0on an escape trajectory out of\u00A0Kerbin. Once it\u0027s in orbit around Kerbol you can set up test maneuver nodes on the probe\u00A0to find\u00A0good transfer windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second thing is that your window will happen approximately when Kerbin\u0027s tangential velocity is pointing right at Duna. (I find that it actually happens just a bit before that.) So that\u0027s when you start looking hard for a window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I agree with Gojira1000\u00A0about spaceplanes --\u00A0you can have even more fun if you don\u0027t put on any chutes and land the jet vertically on its rocket engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
