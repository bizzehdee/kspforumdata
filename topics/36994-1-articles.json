I\u0027ve run into a bunch of issues with parts not working, due to a great many changes in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying to find out what has changed and what needs to be done has become increasingly frustrating. The wiki is horribly out of date, with a lot of sections as old as early 2012. Every time I try to search for topics, I get led (via a terrible forum search) to a 40\u002B page thread, in which ONE of those pages has what I searched for. Alternatively, I get told to \u0022look at other configs\u0022 to see how things work. Again, this is a pretty bad solution. Looking at a config tells me nothing of specifics or how/why it works. I\u0027d be relegated to copying/pasting and then testing over and over again to see what does what. It\u0027s a HUGE time waste for someone with limited free time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I\u0027m personally finding little info on are part types (why are some fairings listed as module \u0022DecouplerGUI\u0022, \u0022Decoupler\u0022 and others just \u0022Part\u0022, for example), or what the heck part modules are that are nestled in the MODULE{} parts of configs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I know is, my addons worked prior to December and now they\u0027re kaput. I\u0027ve slowly been getting them working again, but it\u0027s taking way longer than it should and there are sooo many new problems that I can\u0027t find information on. I don\u0027t mean to sound bitchy, I\u0027m just frustrated. I\u0027ve spent several weeks trying to get my stuff working again and it\u0027s in nowhere near proper working order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anybody has the time, \u003Cstrong\u003Eplease\u003C/strong\u003E, update the wiki documentation.

This wasn\u0027t a very good system because it didn\u0027t allow you to have per part configuration of those functionalities and you absolutely could not have multiple functionalities tied to one part. So they came up with MODULE{ name = ___ }, you can have as many as you want, you can contain variables inside it to define behavior, and now you have certain amounts of leeway in the structure of your models. That eventually lead into PART{}, which is the same thing only up a tier, now you can have any number of parts in your file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emodule = settings are largely depreciated except for a few things like command modules, ASAS and SAS, but other than those key things everything you make should be using MODULE{}s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T18:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E0.18 did transfer a lot of the stock parts over to new stock modules, and all of the forum information about that was lost in the forum crash in April so that\u0027s most of the cause of your difficulties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you\u0027re not familiar with the PartModule system it sounds like you\u0027re troubleshooting GameObjects and config files (as it was common in plugins long before November) so answers will tend to be fairly simple if you go ahead and ask the questions here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know the difference between Decoupler and DecouplerGUI, both are legacy part-derived classes.
