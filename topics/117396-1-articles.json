Then (when i have all the data from all bioms) i fly my lab home and get the data to Kerbins surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding as usual in 1.0.4 poses a little problem now tho: i cant transfer the mystery goo and materials bay experiments anywhere. I just noticed that there is a \u0022collectable\u0022 flag not checked with those two. So am i correct that there is no way of retrieving the data to its full potential without landing the Container itself?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf thats the case: if i am, say around Tylo right now, my mission-science ratio will take a serious hit, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you guys handle that change?
