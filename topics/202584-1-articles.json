I beleive it is caused by renaming a .craft file, but not editing the name contained in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BP9Sb0U.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/BP9Sb0U.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually, the game does a pretty good job at guessing, but in a few cases it seems to be doing strange things. e.g.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022y34R4Ok.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/y34R4Ok.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe root part in this case is the probe called \u0022R5 Angara\u0022. Why does it want to rename it to the rover core (RedAnt) and how do I stop it from doing that? The craft file\u0027s internal name is set correctly as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\nship = R5 Angara\nversion = 1.11.2\ndescription = Angara R5 powered Red Ant bound for Dres.\u00A8\u00A8 This is also the development craft for the R5. Real max. payload is 25t. Copy to Subassembly.\u00A8\u00A8 Due to kerbal scaling, if this were to scale, it would have waaaay too much fuel, so we had to shorten it. It\u0027s also only supposed to carry 25t, but this one can carry much, much more.\u00A8\ntype = VAB\n\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy google searches returned nothing about this relatively new feature so I ask here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should point out that this craft file was pretty old and still uses some of the archived parts (they are still in the game, but not in the \u0022Filter by Function\u0022 section of the part list). Not sure if that matters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nN.B. As the \u0022Insert image from URL\u0022 part of this forum is broken, I was unable to test before posting if they work. I\u0027ll try to fix in edit, but as I write this, I can only see the URL and can\u0027t check if the forum can access them. If not, the two images are of the rename ship message being displayed and the 3 probe PAWs showing vessel renaming properties. I see nothing unusual about them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-25T02:06:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2021 02:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by surge\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emaybe images fixed now?\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"surge","CreatedById":136150,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-22T11:39:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, figured it out: I misread the priority thing and had them the wrong way around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll leave this post instead of deleting it before anyone has read it because there is so little information about this topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
