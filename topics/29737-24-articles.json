Not entirely sure which mods the culprit but if i describe the issue you might be able to shed some light. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short is that if i die from re-entry heat (which i have been doing deliberately to test) the end of flight report screen (showing the events leading up to death etc) doesnt show but i can press escape and revert flight, however after dying by re entry heat clicking anything doesnt seem to work... Like if i go back to Kerbal HQ i cant click any buildings but i can click the back button, if i go back to main menu i simply cant click anything its becoming bothersome to say the least if i die i would like to know why whether it be excessive G\u0027s or Rentry heat. I would like to add that i tested by dying normally crashing into ocean and the end of flight screen DOES appear.

Ive been trying to figure out a sure fire flight plan to get destroyed by heat but i cant do it... Ive tried fast and shallow re-entry and the heat gets up to 1300 degrees but it doesnt damage anything, when i try a quite steep and fast entry i get destroyed due to excess g\u0027s. If someone can give me a simplistic sure-death by fire scenario that i can use to test this error im having it would be much appreciated, or simply a screenshot of the planet view so i can see apoapsis height and the general steepness of the descent.

I don\u0027t remember the exact details, but I have a shot of my capsule doing 3061 m/s at about 31 km. The orbit is 10000x10.3 km at this point, and the heat shield just lost 22 units (out of 1000). To bad I don\u0027t remember to what I set the periapsis, but I guess 15 km, or a wee bit more?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next shot 36 s later shows me at 15.8 km, with a periapsis of -3.5 km, half the heat shield is gone and I\u0027m still going 2450 m/s. The temp is 880 at the shield and I\u0027m pulling ~4 g. In the next shot, 10 seconds later, I\u0027m at 13.1 km with 2000 m/s, pulling 5 g and the heat shield is pretty much gone, but the heat is down to 470\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Two seconds later, the shield was spent and heated up to 1470\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. At this point I\u0027m still pulling 5 g at 12.5 km, 1820 m/s. At 2.5 km, the three radial chutes can be seen partially deployed, I was doing 245 m/s with 2 g.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was propably the hottest reentry I ever did with DRE\u002BFAR, maxing out both the g-margin and the heat shield. Riding the edge, a real nailbiter! I guess I came in at the typical speed for munar returns of about 3150 m/s. If you bleed off some speed with an aerobrake at 35--45 km, you won\u0027t loose much of your heat shield and get more elbow room with the g-loads.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-02T00:10:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2013 12:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Lexif\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jrandom","CreatedById":74522,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T00:16:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E15km?

But then I was at 13 km, and heat dies down fast below that, but g-force gets a serious problem. That\u0027s kind of the point, I could also burn off the shield with some orbits at high altitude and have nothing left to get me through the thick layers below 25 km (with FAR). Look at your g-force indicator when you are at 30 km, for this reentry it was maybe 0.2 g at 31 km. You\u0027re starting to lose your shield, but you\u0027re barely losing speed.
