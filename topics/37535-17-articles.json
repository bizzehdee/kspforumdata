Look at the hierarchy on the right and check it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the image above, the red are dummy collision models on top of the graphics 3d model. Each button on the MFDs have their own collision mesh as well, although you probably won\u0027t use ILS, AP, DTV1-2, DCK (although eventually we\u0027ll want to implement those modes). Note that the mfd\u0027s are named from LEft to Right with A being the left most, and A on the right being the right most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe switches on the overhead panel are for the light system. The only switches we\u0027ll be using is lightswitch_panel, lightswitch_fd1 and 2. Lightswitch panel controls the emissive (on or off) for the entire cockpit backlights. Unless you want to leave the cockpit panel backlights always on. Lightswitch_fd1 or 2, will control and interior light source. How do I add that lightsource? Does a light added in max work?

If you have a part that cannot be accurately represented by a convex mesh, you can split its collision mesh into multiple convex parts.

Also, collision meshes should be as simple as you can make them without compromising on gameplay. Collision detection is the most expensive part of physics simulation.

This shrink wrap mesh if a Physics Mesh Collider in Convex mode. So get around this, you need to either split a mesh into lots of smaller meshes, or swap them out for lots of box colliders. Box colliders are the lowest work for the game, but it depends how accurate you want to be with these, especially on exterior surfaces. (don\u0027t bother trying to be too accurate on interior curves, you\u0027d need a mad ammount of collision meshes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could likely get away with two mesh/box colliders for the doors. Obviously a mesh collider will provide better exterior impact characteristics, Interior you could perhaps get the box collider to work a bit better, since its easier to tweak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Cargo bay I\u0027d likely go for splitting your model mesh into FIVE meshes to use as colliders. two end caps, the lowest end of the wingbox, and two sides (which are cut quite a lot shorter than they really are, since they will expand when \u0022shrink wrapped\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing gear you could get away with only two mesh/box colliders. One for the lower section of the gear, one of the landing gear casing. I used to add lots of colliders, but I found the behavior can be buggy when colliding with the craft. Basically, anything you animate through another part\u0027s collider CANNOT HAVE A PHYSICS COLLIDER. It can have a wheel collider I beleive - that doesn\u0027t seem to cause problems. Infact for the complexity you have here, I think you\u0027d be better off making the lower gear collider an entirely seperate object that isn\u0027t tied to any rendered mesh, animated entirely seperately to the rest, so it never clips into the spacecraft body (animate the scale, leave it outside the landing gear case) as that\u0027ll stop clipping errors with the rest of the craft, as the landing gear will be sitting inside of the collider for the spacecraft body.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Czosnex","CreatedById":38038,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T13:06:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe cockpit looks absolutely stunning, great work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helldiver","CreatedById":74755,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T13:18:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZRM\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZRM\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe landing gear may take a bit of fiddling to get to work correctly, for example.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWoah woah, landing gear is already animated.

How far that goes I would have no idea at the moment. My goal is to make the shuttle functional in a one stop solution. I don\u0027t want to fidget was stuff, even if it means it requires a mod solution to be a part of it. Its flight characteristics as well as the engine numbers are all bound with the assumption of ZRM\u0027s avionics mod.\u003Cp\u003EIt was one reason why earlier on I had asked ZRM in his thread if his mod could be integrated into a part. For purposes of this mod it would have been integrated in the avionics portion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZRM will be taking over that portion of the project (coming up in the next few days). I asked him specifically to integrate it all with his mod. The goal is (my goal is) that the average user can download the mod and in just a few minutes with basic KSP launch, orbiting, maneuvering, and decent skills be able to fly this thing. That is my top priority and I\u0027m not deviating from that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout his mod (and without proper numbers and flight envelope parameters) people are going to have a nightmare flying, launching, and putting this in orbit.

I do know, and I have asked ZRM to use something similar (or the same) to wire the KSO so that it flies properly both atmospherically and in orbit in a space shuttle (piggy back) configuration. He might end up programing an FCS using his KCA mod, I don\u0027t know. The ultimate goal again, is for the average non-advanced user to be flying this thing successfully 5 minutes after installing it. Maybe later we\u0027ll release a bare bones version without an FCS for advanced users of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want my work and his work on the project to focus on cool add-ons to the shuttle; functional MFDs and IVA components, a mini rover, a mini roving vehicle, docking accessories, space station components that fit the cargo bay, alternate cargo bay segments like a crew module, expansion of the mission deck with lab stations, lift vehicle, and so on.

Though the severity of this seems to vary. a very small, barely colliding collider doesn\u0027t seem to cause too much trouble. Big or multiple ones is a serious problem. Turning off some mesh colliders by plugin is something I\u0027ve considered trying, but after trying out another method (a single, smaller collider that intersects as little as possible) I found it was effective enough to not need to do so.
