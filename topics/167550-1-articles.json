But I have what I think is a cool idea for a Mod if anyone wants to take a stab at it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom what I have seen of other mods and what\u0027s been done, it shouldn\u0027t be too hard and not too involved.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are mods out there that work with the stock recovery and change it. I saw one which limits your recovered funds and such only if you land within X range of a beacon, etc...\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther Mods work with the recovery process itself such as \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EStage Recovery\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E and others.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I envision is a mod which will make you take care that your discarded stages are not dropping into populated areas.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat it would do is penalize you in funds and reputation if your debris strikes certain areas.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn a Stock Game this would be:\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo penalty hitting water.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nPenalty if your debris strikes land.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis would be for anything labeled as debris (No Crew or probe core), or has become uncontrollable (Out of power or no parachutes)\u003Cbr\u003E\nConfig settings could let you allow/disallow the penalty by Biome. After all, what is there to hit in the Desert or Ice Caps? It could be limited to only penalizing for Grasslands and Shore, etc..\u003Cbr\u003E\nA Hard mode would set the safe drop area to offshore only by X number of km (outside of territorial waters/shipping lanes), thus limiting you to drop only in deep open ocean waters (no inland lakes either)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith certain Mods, this Mod could be seriously enhanced.\u00A0 Mods like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E or Stock Visual Enhancements... Those which add City textures.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn this case there could be different levels of penalties depending on where you hit.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nHitting land by itself results only in a small penalty,\u00A0but dropping one in the middle of a city results in a severe penalty.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRight now, every Mod dealing with recovery only deals with trying to get a little back. If you don\u0027t oh well. If you have a recovery mod and don\u0027t recover... nothing happens other than you don\u0027t get some funds back that you would not have gotten anyways.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis would force you to take care where your unrecovered boosters and other debris winds up or get penalized.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyone remember SkyLab?\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe don\u0027t want Kerbstralia suing Werner Von Kerman and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E now do we?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhatcha think?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-15T04:33:37Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2017 04:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CG-23 Sailor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
