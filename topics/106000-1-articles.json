Bill \u0026 Bob Kerman looked scared\n\nGene Kerman explains to the journalists at KSC: \u0022The throttle-valve stuck. Jebediah lost his de-orbit fuel, and was in the wrong orbit.\u0022\n\n\u0022He was grazing the atmosphere, and came down eventually, but we couldn\u0027t predict the landing. We got a lot of Science.\u0022\n\n\u0022As planned, Valentina Kerman will fly the next mission. She insists we find room for Snacks. And a proper survival kit.\u0022\n\n^Kerbin News Network^\n\n^With dusk arriving in the predicted landing area, the air-search for Jebediah Kerman\u0027s capsule will cease. Kerbin is a nice bijou planet.^\n\nAt the Astronaut Center\n\nBill and Bob Kerman were lucking worried. \u0022Valentina,\u0022 said Bob, \u0022How sharp was the LOS?\u0022\n\n\u0022It wasn\u0027t sudden...\u0022\n\n\u0022It was the battery.\u0022\n\nGene Kerman nodded. \u0022It\u0027s possible,\u0022 he agreed. \u0022It\u0027s enough to move some of the search, but where to?\u0022\n\n\u0022There\u0022 said Valentina\n\nHer finger pointed at the map. \u0022The radar track is a good line. Trust that. Jebediah just flew further than we thought.\u0022\n\nThe High Plains of Kerbin\n\nThe sunlight was putting a streak of light into the capsule, and the scratching at the hatch had stopped. Jebediah was hungry\n\nJebediah looked at the illicit Duna Bar. Not yet, he thought. And then he heard an engine, and the beat of kopter rotors.\n\nHe opened the hatch. It looked as though more than one something had been scratching. He threw out a smoke candle. Rescue!\n\nThe Voyager\u0027s Return\n\n\u0022Good bread, and a little salt. It is a tradition,\u0022 said Valentina. \u0022I baked the bread,\u0022 she added proudly.\n\nJebediah sniffed the bread. It smelled of sun and open skies and Kerbin. \u0022Gene, Valentina...\u0022 He broke the bread into three.\n\n\u0022Share with me,\u0022 he said, passing bread to his Cap-com and Mission Controller. \u0022You travelled with me.\u0022 So Jebediah came home.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T04:49:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde**\n  \nFont size made more manageable."}]}
