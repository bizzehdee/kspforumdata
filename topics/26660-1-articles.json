I could not believe it I was on KSP last night and it was 18:30 and next time I looked at the clock it was 22.50. Not been on a Game (SIM) that long since FSX and that\u0027s been a while. Any way I have finally figured out why my AP and PE are way off when I finally do the last burn to get into orbit. I have been going up way too fast from blast and not slowing down in time until last thing last night and now done it many times with the same rocket and a better shape. The only thing is that it is different with each rocket you make due to the weight on how much or less the rocket weighs as to how fast or slow you go up. That\u0027s my next thing. lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Custard Donut (In Space)","CreatedById":58058,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T12:03:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations mate, Kerbal Space Program really rewards the player and i share your happiness in finally managing to achieve your goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a lot of trouble when i started the game, i found it hard to understand, but these video tutorials helped me very much indeed:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEm5nyZU3a-O2ak6mBYXWPAL\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T12:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no real trouble with getting an Ap and Pe that aren\u0027t close. It has no impact on anything if your orbit isn\u0027t circular. As long as your Pe is above the atmosphere, you can circularize later if you really want to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skipper8472","CreatedById":64001,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T13:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah but when first started and only to last night the gab was way too big for my liking but now I can get it down now. At the moment I have a pod up there and its at AP 91,918 and PE 66.595. But I have just launched my 1st satellite with batteries and solar panel and a communication and thermometer that is AP 86.037 PE 71.154 which im happy with. The thing is thouh my rocket started at 180 degrees instead of 000 but I still managed to get it right like it started at 000 degress and pointed it to 90 on the nav ball. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T14:32:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to raise your Pe, just burn prograde when you are at you Ap. If you want to lower your Ap, just burn retrograde when you\u0027re at you Pe. It\u0027s as simple as that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your heading problem, all you need to do is to lean your rocket sideways, towards the east, during the launch, and use ASAS to maintain the heading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
