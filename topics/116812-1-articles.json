I have a launch to Minmus and when I look at the path from the SC, it shows the path as yellow. When I select it, it is blue with the yellow and purple lines showing when the craft returns to Kerbin, orbits and intersects with the mun in 14d. I need to edit the current path so I enter into the Minmus SOI but it won\u0027t allow me to add a node in the blue.\n\nIs this yet another in a long line of annoying bugs or another in a long line of things I am ignorant about?\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T14:20:41Z","Content":"You\u0027ll probably have to update the tracking station and/or the mission planning building.

Usually happens after a while. Especially in the case you\u0027ve described. Sometimes you can work around it by trying other camera angles, or zooming in or out. Or you might be able to drag the node from the wrong color orbit onto the correct one, using the central circle of maneuver node.\n\nBut the only workaround, that works semi-reliably for me is to return to space-center and go back to your ship again. OR restarting the game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T14:36:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 02:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Val**\n  \nAdditional info"},{"CreatedByName":"Iam aspaceman","CreatedById":144531,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T14:40:42Z","Content":"The strange part was, I created a MN so that I was not only in the SOI of minmus but was going to pass within 7.5km, I stopped the burn so that I was going to pass within 5km (I am trying to land another portion to a base there), eliminated the MN, increased time (warped) to get close to fine tune final approach and not only did it show me no longer close but also no longer in the SOI on minmus and it is showing me eventually entering into the Mun SOI. \n\nSo with a heavy sigh, I stopped warp, and tried to add a MN to allow me to land and this is where I am now - not able to add a MN till I get to the Mun\u0027s SOI in 14 days...vs passing just outside Minmus\u0027 SOI in a day or so.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nre Val\u0027s comment...tried both and still cannot do anything."},{"CreatedByName":"Iam aspaceman","CreatedById":144531,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T15:20:31Z","Content":"So - embarrassing work-around was I used MechJeb to create a node for me...but still doesn\u0027t change the relative bugginess of the whole process..."},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T15:30:28Z","Content":"Yeah, they are really strange sometimes. I was making a shot to Jool, and once I got the trajectory into the SOI, it plotted a return tracetory that saw me orbiting almost along the same line. The result was, since my blue (current) and purple (the eventual path) lines were so close, it would only let me put a maneuver node on the purple line, so I could only plan maneuvers years ahead as opposed to in a few days."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T18:55:44Z","Content":"I usually find, if this is happening, that I can\u0027t place a node before I reach one of the apses of the orbit.
