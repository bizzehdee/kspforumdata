Is this possbile, or do I have to lock everything too 100% and arrange the thrust limiters every time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimon\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T16:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can search your vessel for parts implementing a module. Look for the names of rocket thrust modules (i don\u0027t know them off the top of my head) then use the method FindModulesImplementing in the part property of your module. Then look for the field for the thrust limiter in those modules and set the value of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used that method to implement the networking feature on my mass accelerator module and yes, you can search across multiple vessels as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
