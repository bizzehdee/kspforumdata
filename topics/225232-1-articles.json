The only safe means to give gimbal to a ship equipped with this is to redistribute mass and very precisely shift your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E out of alignment with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E...Or just have really powerful \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E so you can rotate quickly before or after a single pulse. Anything you try to use as thrust vanes or gimbal flaps (in a real world build) would realistically either get blown off quickly or require actuators that compromise quickly. Deliberately deflecting the pulse itself could quickly compromise the shock absorbers or the joints between them and non-engine body.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFortunately, the go-to mod for Orions does exist. It\u0027s KSP 1.8\u002B compatible, it has proper pulse physics and the yield can be changed in the editor and in flight. Its parts are rather heavy on junkyard style, though, and aren\u0027t attractive if you\u0027re particular with clean or Restock-alike looks.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022143878\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7273113351\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/192855-18x-111x-stockish-project-orion-v182-update-12292020/?do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:197px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
