I have downloaded the new DLC and whenever I try to launch from the Island Runway\u00A0or Woomerang, they will not show up under the launch icon when I hover over it. This is a science save from 1.3.1 and I have the entire tech tree unlocked. I flew to Woomerang with a drone to make sure it was there, and it was. The Island Base is there also. Along with that, they both appear as launch sites in the tracking station. If I could get an answer that would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: This has been solved!
