The basics of shuttles haven\u0027t changed too much from 0.90, keep your thrust centred with your mass, etc., but the new aerodynamics will make things funkier when launching or trying to land.\n\nI suggest you do what Scott Manley does in this video:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/-JmOQ5lqUsk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n . Don\u0027t follow his build instructions, but simply experiment to find the best design which glides well (or semi-well, the real Space Shuttle flew like a brick, apparently), and progress from there to putting it on a launcher stack."},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:29:22Z","Content":"I\u0027 ve made one, however, I had to tweak the gimbal range on the Mainsail.
