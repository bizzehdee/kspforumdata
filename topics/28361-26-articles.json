As far as I\u0027m concerned, it\u0027s definitely the hatch/docking mode toggle - I suspect this is because the associated collider is part of an animation, and so KSP has to store/recall its animated state whenever a vessel is loaded.

Personally, I\u0027m of the opinion that since any given FusTek\u0027d station would have any number of IACBMs, it becomes impractical to set up RPM displays for every single one of them.

Would also make compatibility updates slightly easier, if compatibility with newer versions is dependent on Firespitter being updated. Case in point, B9 doesn\u0027t technically support .23, but since both Exsurgent and Firespitter have been updated to .23, just updated the two plugins fixes the incompatibility. Granted this wouldn\u0027t be the case with every update, but in this situation it was convenient because Bac9 is fairly busy if I recall correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDude","CreatedById":45158,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T23:48:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreetings,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would make it a dependency.

I had a station with 12 habitat modules that I wanted to finish off with Kupolas. 12 kupolas later the game was just crawling along at about 8 FPS while I\u0027m still in the SPH. I never launched because if I\u0027m getting 8 FPS in the SPH then it\u0027ll be a slide show in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, as I removed the kupolas one-by-one the FPS would increment upward until it was back to normal. (60\u002B FPS.) It was a bit of a disappointment as I really like that module but the FPS hit was just brutal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it helps - I went into the config file for that part and removed everything except the actual kupola model. The modules, bottom ring, hatches... everything.
