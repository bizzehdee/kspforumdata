You know how if your in a train and you jump you wont move.\u0026lt;-- if you get what i mean. Well lets say you in a space craft with lots of room orbiting earth. You go to the centre of mass moving yourself away from everything so you are \u0027floating\u0027 \u0026lt;-- scientific i know! But you are \u0027floating\u0027 at the COM. What would happen if the craft was given some thrust to set it in a spin? Would you spin with the craft or would you watch the craft spin around you? If it spun around you that would be quite a weird experience and wpuld probably be very confusing for you mind and would make you feel quite sick.

But as the craft spins the air inside will too. So eventually, it might take quite some time, you would start to spin with it due to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake an old fashioned record player, put a bucket of water on it and float a cork in the water. If you now switch on the record player the bucket starts to rotate but the cork does not.
