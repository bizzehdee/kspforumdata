But there are a few things the game doesn\u0027t tell and it is for that reason there is even discovery at all. After a while with the game it becomes addicting as you try to push your rockets further and further. The UI is simple enough not to create confusion. Altimeter, Speedometer and thrust level indicator. Other lights let you know if your RCS or SAS is enabled. The top of the screen in the upper right gives you a few statistics on your fuel and battery levels. Since the game takes a bit of a comical simulator approach resourses is important. No diffrent than the sims where feeding them keeps them from starving. Electricity is need to keep your kerbals from not going anywhere. Fuel and other sourses as well come to play but isn\u0027t hard to understand as all the capasities are labeled when you create your vessel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreating is one of the major areas this game shines as you just build and as the game doesn\u0027t always have goals other than exploration. You can go wild Unless in career where there may be contracts but even there you can go wild! All parts are listed on the left of the screen as you are taken to the vehicle assembly building or hanger. It is just a matter of picking parts then arranging them. If you can play minecraft then you can build in this game and create. The limits is in the physics if it will fly like a rocket, plane or just make pretty fireworks. Either way it isn\u0027t hard to do either and many tutorials are build in the game to help out with any new players. Wernher von Kerman is a very insightfull man when it comes to new players as his tutorials will help you get off the ground easy. In career mode the contracts also simplify things by starting small and allowing only afew parts this makes it easier to learn by building up to bigger things. In the end it still is up to you how you want to play and if you wish, you might just like the fireballs left on your runway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[h=1][/h] Jump to: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Wernher_von_Kerman#mw-navigation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enavigation\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Wernher_von_Kerman#p-search\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esearch\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T20:00:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, the best way to learn the game, are putting your face on, and try and error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep doing things and watching the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T01:56:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I agree with Climber.
