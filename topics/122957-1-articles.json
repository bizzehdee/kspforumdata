That is the usual cause of a lawn dart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost some pictures with CoM \u0026amp; CoL visible in the SPH. If you can, use RCS Build Aid and show us DCoM as well, because sometimes the effect only occurs when it is out of fuel (i.e. Dry). You typically will have no fuel by the time you land so you need to make sure it is balanced in that state. Also, you typically won\u0027t have payload when landing so make sure that is gone too. With a shuttle, this is even easier than a SSTO. You really only have to balance it one way because the external tank and SRB\u0027s usually bring the CoM forward and you don\u0027t have to worry about just how far behind the CoM your CoL is because your thrust to weight is so high.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-13T19:11:59Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2015 07:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T19:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is one with empty tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jPHTngo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jPHTngo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull one looks like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R8XfIHA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022R8XfIHA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T19:16:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI edited above but you came back too fast, does that have a payload?

Look at where all your control surfaces (including airbrakes) are located, and look at where your center of mass is. They\u0027re really close together (especially when empty). That means that you have very little torque to work with, so they can\u0027t steer much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: Stick some control surfaces up at the front of the shuttle-- for example, a couple of AV-R8 winglets on the sides of the cockpit up front. Not only will that shift your center of lift forward (thus making it less nose-heavy), but also those winglets are very far from the center of mass, meaning that they\u0027ll generate a lot of steering torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on the mass of your shuttle, a couple of AV-R8 winglets might not be enough, but it\u0027s a start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also try scootching your wings forward a bit-- that would help move the center of lift forward a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T21:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so I did what you suggested, and...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Gp7spID.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Gp7spID.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/adventuretimewithfinnandjake/images/4/49/It\u0022 alt=\u0022It\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least they survived. \u0022touchdown\u0022 speed was reduced to ~70m/s, angle was better too.
