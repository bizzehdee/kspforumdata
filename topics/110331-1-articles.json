Leave the VAB and then come back to it, and VAB symmetry will be restored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, directly attaching things with VAB symmetry to planes made in the SPH still doesn\u0027t always work due the planes not being symmetrical to start with (like with rudders sticking up on the top, not the bottom. So in general, it\u0027s best to attach something inline to the rear end of the plane, then build radially off of that instead of off the plane itself. And if you then have to put some struts between the rocket and the plane, put them on 1 at a time instead of using symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T03:13:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPressing R will toggle between mirror symmetry and radial symmetry\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
