Some like it and some don\u0026#39;t. This particular day, the day that the landing unfolded, Randall updated the strip as the events took place. He was watching the live stream and creating the comic on the fly. I remember observing the comic and the live stream at the same time and feeling that it was in fact fairly accurate (minus some of the jokes and such).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe site devoted to this strip is still being updated periodically.
