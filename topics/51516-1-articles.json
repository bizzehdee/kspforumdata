You\u0027re lucky you can get anything out if it. But at high speeds an altitudes it is a golden god among jet engines. It\u0027s niche, if you will, is after your other engines cease working, to push you even closer to the edge of space without needing rocket engines or air hogging. Of course you still need rocket engines to circularize, but this should be able to push you out into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis engine only really starts to shine once you hit Mach 4, before that it can only provide limited thrust. But once you get above Mach 4 it starts to being able to produce usable thrust, hittings its peak at 1700 m/s. But even then its not even half the thrust of the standard Jet Engine. It\u0027s real benefit lies in its ISP at high altitudes, at about 8000 meters its ISP starts to sky rocket, allowing it to function at altitudes that your other engines couldn\u0027t hope to even with 4 times the intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, as soon as you hit about 20 km and over 1350 m/s this engine starts to be somewhat useful, you have to find some other way to get it to that point however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine is far more useful at 30 km and above 1500 m/s, as this is the point most other engines start to fail on standard intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/rz1q0bvg6ko8al4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EDownload from Mediafire\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/gs0i8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The problem is that at nearly all velocities the stock Turbo jets are higher thrust and they peak out at 2400m/s vs. the scramjet at 2500. There\u0027s very little advantage to carrying this with you. I would suggest upping max Thrust to 90-ish and bumping mass to maybe 3 or 4 which will make the TWR closer to the real thing (but still balanced for KSP) Also make the effective velocity range a bit wider maybe 1250m/s to 2800m/s. Those are my recommendations pick and choose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
