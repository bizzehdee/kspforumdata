I\u0027m submitting it here and the Fanfiction thingy. So don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m doing both. Just doing it here first because more people might be interested in reading it.

I opened my eyes, revealing my room. The blinds were open and shining bright sunlight into my room. I got up and waddled awkwardly to the blinds and closed them, the bright sunlight dimming and than hiding itself behind the blinds. I turned around and went for the door. I felt something at my feet. Furry and fuzzy. Soft. I looked down. My cat Melina was curling herself around one of my legs. Melina is a black cat, with white spots here and there. She started playing around my feet. I took a step forward, and she jerked back and looked up at me. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CShe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s hungry,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I thought. I quietly cursed myself for not feeding her the night before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMelina than scrambled away. I followed her through my hall, filled with about 2 doors and tons of pictures of my brother Jebediah. Than, she came to a stop and turned into a door. I followed, and the smell of washed clothes and cloth filled the air. There was a table there, with her food and water bowl on it. Melina jumped onto the table and started meowing. I grabbed the food bowl and turned around. The cat food was there, and when I turned to it, the smell of it grasped my nose like a dog on a piece of steak. I grabbed a small cup inside it, and filled the food bowl with the food. I turned around quickly, almost dropping the food bowl.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I handed the food to Melina, who was trying to reach to the food bowl, as if thanking me for bringing it to her. I put the food bowl down on the table, and she scurried quickly to it and starting eating like a tiger. I left her there, and quickly retreated back to my room to change to my suit and tie. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was done, I snatched up my phone and entered the password. It than went to a KASA Welcome screen. I looked at the clock on my phone. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CT-2 hours, 3 minutes, and 20 seconds and counting until launch\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I muttered to myself. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI better head to work\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 or Jeb will kill me for not being there in Mission control while he was launching.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I whispered to myself. I went into the living room. The room was shining with light, and the TV was on, announcing the launch today. I quickly grabbed my suitcase and lunchbox, which were both sitting on a table. I jogged toward the door. When I reached it, I opened it and went outside. My car was welcoming me with a glint in the window, which revealed a seat in the car. I went to the side, and opened the door. I quickly slid the key into place, and twisted it, the car roaring to life, the loud music pounding in my ears. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t wait for Jeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s launch today.
