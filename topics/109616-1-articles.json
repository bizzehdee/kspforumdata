Is your savegame a new 1.0\u002B game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second option is that you might be able to work around it by putting all your tourists inside a pod, launch, and recover to see if the contract check is fixed this time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anrui","CreatedById":144249,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T05:09:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe same thing is happening to me.
