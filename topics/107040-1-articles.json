It gives you a rather large lump of cash at a cost of a TON of reputation. This will make it so that you both get money and are given easier to complete contracts (at least until your reputation builds back up)."},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T02:37:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You get an advance on new contracts, and with the exception of tourist contracts I think all the advances are more than you need to complete the contract (tourist contracts just suck all around)\n\nNot all around, but you\u0027re right that the tourist contract advances don\u0027t cover the cost (in fact, I\u0027m not sure those contracts even have an advance), but I have yet to get one that doesn\u0027t pay close to twice the craft cost on completion. As long as you start doing them while you can still afford the craft, they\u0027re a decent income, on normal at least. For a suborbital tourist mission that pays about 12K funds if I remember right, the craft costs 7K if I do them before getting the stayputnik, and 4K once I\u0027ve got it. For an orbital tourist mission that pays about 20K funds, the craft costs about 12K funds.\n\nI\u0027ll admit that these aren\u0027t huge funds, but two tourist contracts can let you launch a mission to the same general place."},{"CreatedByName":"tatmanblue","CreatedById":142811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:12:13Z","Content":"is there some documentation or guide on strategies for using the administration building? \n\nI started a new career.

In the game reputation is pretty easy to come by so long as you aren\u0027t killing your Kerbals and failing a lot of contracts. For the most part the strategies let you make one type of resource (Science, Reputation, Funds) easier to get at the cost of another. Most people find science pretty tight in the early game (at least until you are able to get to the Mun/Minimus) and while you can gain funds fairly easily by gaming the contract system a bit to take very easy and cheap contracts in order to build up cash most people don\u0027t enjoy grinding out missions that way. In contrast Reputation is pretty readily available and only affects what type of contracts you get so most people are willing to trade that away in favor of more science/money."}]}
