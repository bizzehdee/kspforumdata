It seems that no matter what, at around 1400 m/s a pod will flip, without exception. I tried this while coming in at different altitudes ranging from 26km to 33km. Someone said to rotate the capsule during re-entry, which did nothing. Eventually I edited the CFG so that the physics on the heatshield would be calculated (if I\u0027m understanding it properly). This time, coming in at 30.5km, I was able to keep the pod under control, but just barely. It still tried to flip, and I really had to wrestle the controls to keep it straight-ish. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it supposed to be this way? Is it a bug? Is there a better fix?
