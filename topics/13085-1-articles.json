Attach the payload on top with a secondary fuel tank and engine in between the payload and first stage. Make sure you have an advanced sas system on board to reduce wobble.

Those six radially attached rockets sent the vessel from the surface of kerbin, to a kerbin escape velocity with some fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain: Payload on top. Next stage down is your landing engines and tank if not already integrated in your payload. Next stage down is your orbital engine and tank that has the job of circularizing your orbit and doing your transfer burn. don\\\u0027t be stingy with this stage cause your first stage is massive! The final stage down, or first stage is a 3 meter tank with bertha engines with 4 other 3 meter tanks with bertha engines radially attached to that. Its job is to get you out of the atmosphere and into your target altittude. ASAS should be attached either on your payload, or landing engines with some regular SAS integrated on all staging. If you need rcs, you only need it from your orbital engine and tank and up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my personal rocket design which has no faults. Its stable cause its very bottom heavy and symmetrical. Its powerful with all those 3 meter tank and bertha engines. And its wobble proof thanks to its squat design and ASAS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-23T04:28:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E... or, you could always download or mod yourself and do one little engine with enormous push. I mean Duck, honestly... doesn\\\u0027t it seem to you that these mods are beginning to defeat the purpose? How about a heavy lifter with default tanks/engines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to answer the OP:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what i narrowed down my vehicles to, trying to keep a reasonable budget and only use the minimum needed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA stock parts munar heavy(ish) lifter would be a 3-stager with boosters as a 4th stage. As the worst part of the lift is the first couple of minutes, at the start you should fire 6 non-thrustvectoring engines with the force of 200 - those are boosters, they each have 3 tanks on top, control surfaces on sides (1 each) and will detach when they run dry. Also at the start fire the 3 thrustvectoring in the central column, which should have 3 tanks for each engine. Detach the boosters (should happen during the gravity turn), then the central column (3 tv engines and the tanks). The next stage is the same as previous central column - 3 tv engines, 9 tanks. This one will probably stay in an annoying orbit. Next stage is payload - with its own small engine and 3 tanks of fuel, rcs and 8 rcs blocks ( 4 top, 4 bottom), an asas and a mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to admit, I have not tried this design (hopefully today). What I do though, is use a slightly lighter version of this design for keostationary launches (which are about halfway to the Mun) with final stage of over 10 tons. I only use 1 tank on top of each booster (but as we all know it can hold up to 3 effectively), and only 2 tanks on the last stage. In my case that\\\u0027s enough, with an added advantage that the second stage also returns to Kerbin and does not litter my space : )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oops, looks like I described my previous design. Sorry. Skip the middle stage altogether, you shouldn\\\u0027t need it. Just 6 boosters, central column and payload ship on top of that. And if you do add the middle stage, this should be enough to launch a whole house up there. I\\\u0027ll give it a try soon : )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Me","CreatedById":29791,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-23T18:30:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis rocket will do nicely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/bGd_BFu9e10?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Candre","CreatedById":15181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-23T18:41:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also try the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=14326.msg217147#msg217147\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFalcon 33. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E I once landed the entire second stage on Minmus.
