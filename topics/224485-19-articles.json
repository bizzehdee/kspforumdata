A new world to explore, new fun mechanics, new gameplay elements ... \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E must be new for players to invest more of their money on a product similar to the one they already own. Even if it is something as marginal as whatever EA does to their licensed football games every year. Novelty is the key to engagement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as far as I can tell, as a reluctant consumer who decided to wait and see with KSP2, the game has ended up as a better-looking, but ultimately inferior copy of the first game. It features the same planets, the same gameplay loop, the same mechanics ... except for being a buggy and unstable mess. It has better visuals that require a beefier computer to run, but lacks a \u003Cem\u003Edraw\u003C/em\u003E compared to its predecessor. As a consumer, I look at what\u0027s offered and ask myself \u0022why should I want to buy this?\u0022 It appears to offer nothing more than I could already do with KSP1, except bugs and performance issues. It appears to feature the same world, explored in the same way. I was waiting for some novelty to hook me and drag me in, but it just never happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunny thing is, the people who marketed the game seem to have understood this. Look at the initial announcement trailer. It features new technologies. Never-before-seen ship parts. Orbital construction yards above the clouds of Juno. New planets. Colonies.\u00A0 Multiplayer.The people who made that trailer understood that they needed to show off things KSP1 couldn\u0027t do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut all those years later, precisely none of it came to fruition. The developers never got further than trying to make a KSP1 copy work. None of the features we were waiting for were implemented. Or for that matter, featured in the development updates. The whole fan base sat waiting for news on the new star systems, new mechanics, new \u003Cem\u003Estuff\u003C/em\u003E, and what they showed was \u0022here\u0027s the daily life of the community manager\u0022 and \u0022look, we made exhaust plumes nicer!\u0022 Sure, there were interesting visualizations of how features like drag or heat build-up worked, but I doubt anybody held out their purchase waiting for a more detailed heat management system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, those new features were always on the roadmap. The concepts were frequently discussed on the \u0022some day, in the finished game\u0022 level. But we never saw any sign of their implementation (which, in hindsight, invites a few \u0022interesting\u0022 conclusions ...). For whatever reason, they never got as far as letting us play with any new toys in this game. What was actually in the game strikes me as \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E than what was in KSP1. If that sentiment is common, it\u0027s no wonder nobody bought it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven putting a new planet in the Kerbol system would have been a decent first taste of that sequel feeling. Just swap out Juno and its moons for Sarnus, or something like that. Mechanically, it wouldn\u0027t be anything different than the planets that were already there, but it would add some much-needed novelty to justify buying a sequel. But they never got around to that. It seems like the development priority was all about creating a stable copy of KSP1 in the KSP2 engine first, then expanding later. Perhaps that\u0027s the \u0022correct\u0022 and tidy way of doing something like this, but a KSP1 copy isn\u0027t going to draw any customers who are interested in more than KSP1. Even something as nice as volumetric clouds is ultimately just garnish on the same, boring dish. I really can\u0027t understand how they chose to disregard the important concept of novelty for so long. Sure, adding new planets or features wouldn\u0027t do anything to get the game finished faster, but it would potentially have drawn more customers to keep the game funded during development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-04T20:06:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224386262\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224485\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221714853024\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022200426\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KincaidFrankMF\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, KincaidFrankMF said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a slightly optimistic note...
