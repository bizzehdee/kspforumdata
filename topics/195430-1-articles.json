So today after recovering a mission I saved only to find an error. Apparently this default name quicksave shared the and name with another one. The save file in question was displaying an error massage. I deleted the quicksave in question and tried to save, only to find the same error and a new bad file (I know this sounds like a console thing but it was on PC!) So then I tried to load persistent and nothing happened. However what\u0027s funny is that I could still interact with the game. I checked my output log and sure enough there was an error every time I tried to load a save or leave the load save box (can\u0027t tell you what the errors were, because I did not write down my log, but it appears to be failing to access files.) So then I proceeded to try and launch a vessel. But then the game got stuck in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E (hard to describe) so I was forced to alt \u002B f4 it. My only hope now is that persistent loads because it seems fine. This whole thing happened in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E screen so it was probably stupidity on my part, and I\u0027m also not asking for help, just trying to get my voice heard, but I have been saving in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E screen after a play session every time since 2015 when I started playing and this has NEVER happened before. I love 1.10, but the collaborative station I\u0027m part of is probably the only thing preventing me from reverting to the better performing and more stable 1.8.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust so you know, in 1.10 the game has crashed 20 times randomly, meanwhile 1.8 installs with many mods only crash when you would expect them to (loading a 4000 part vessel that blows up in the pad.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong story short: I have never had to fear for my progresses safety more than in 1.10\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m super lucky that I did not care about this save, never saving in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E screen again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: wow, ranting about an issue really does get it off my chest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-08T03:00:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2020 03:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by catloaf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EIf this happens again I will post a log.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruedii","CreatedById":57704,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-08T15:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick question, do you have mods installed?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMany times unsupported mods will soft-fail leading to lag, bugs, and save file breaks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"catloaf","CreatedById":204108,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-08T15:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do... But most (correction: all) of these mods are visual so I don\u0027t think they could damage a save. As for the crashes, I was referencing one\u0027s that have happened in pure stock installs. It\u0027s actually been crashing less now that I know what causes the crashes. Also some of these crashes were my pc\u0027s fault not 1.10\u0027s. I was more ranting about how unstable this update is in general. But I will take your advice and uninstall the mods if I\u0027m doing something in a save I care about.
