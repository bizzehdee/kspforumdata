A pod re-entering practically straight down from orbital height (if you have cancelled out a lot of horizontal velocity) may need some extra drag to help slow it down, and you found one good method in drogue chutes. Next time, (without drogue)\u00A0try not cancelling out so much of the horizontal velocity, and let the air do it. Re-entering at a shallower angle\u00A0(and higher speed) exposes you to more linear distance travelled through air, more heating (what the head shield is for), time suffering under drag effects, and hopefully a lower velocity closer to the ground than you saw before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T10:34:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222554888\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137335\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462170314\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002254104\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JeanHavoc\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, JeanHavoc said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would appear that nowadays the most difficult mission profile possible is a simple suborbital launch from KSC itself. ...

I have a good bit of experience with 1.0.5 with the identical capsule (parachute, Mk 1, heat shield) and never had trouble slowing down with all kinds of different trajectories. The ship seemed to have tons of drag once it got down to 20000m or so. In 1.1.2 I just barely am able to get the chute deployed in time--speed drops to safe deploy speed about 4000m or less and with chute deploy time, it does not start braking seriously until 400m from sea level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is very different from 1.0.5. So my question is, I have seen in previous posts that it is claimed that there were no changes to the atmosphere and its effects. But some ships are less draggy. So is the heatshield less draggy? Or is it just not true--that the atmo effects have changed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Kramer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T19:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure which parts specifically are less draggy, but it sounded like some(all?)

I also found the sub-orbital mission difficult, mainly for not taking these things into account.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to pass the mission you need to reach 70km up. even if you just scrape that point you need a serious amount of horizontal thrust to make up for it.

I must say that I am quite impressed by the improvement in frame rate with the combined upgrades to Unity 5 and 64 bit, but\u00A0even after\u00A0the two patches\u00A0there still seems to be a host of weird little bugs. Toggling back and forth between the orbital and staging views has been a particularly consistent\u00A0cause of problems for me (playing 64-bit Windows 10, unmodded, flying a fairly simple LOR-type Mun landing\u00A0mission). Sometimes it just won\u0027t let me go back to the staging view, sometimes it only lets me go back after I click on the orbital view button a second time, and sometimes going to the orbital view (so far always while under acceleration in the 40-70km range above Kerbin)\u00A0seems to cause\u00A0a brief but strong phantom rotational impulse, resulting in the end that should not point towards space suddenly\u00A0pointing towards space. I\u0027d be interested to know if anyone else is seeing that behavior, as I did not note anyone talking about it in the bug forum. The game also seems to fully crash significantly more often, but I haven\u0027t been able to discern yet if there\u0027s a consistent gameplay circumstance involved. Overall, I think this upgrade was much needed to make the game more playable, but I also think it\u0027s going to be a long haul to iron out all these glitches. Anyway, based on comments above I\u0027m eager to see if my Mk1 spaceplanes can once again get the same level of performance they had before the nerfing of 1.0.5!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222559174\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137335\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462306673\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022130681\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Violent Jeb\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 minutes ago, Violent Jeb said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOfc, there\u0027s always the possibility of launching [almost]\u00A0straight up, touching 70, and burning retrograde to survive the return trip.

Just a capsule and 2 staged boosters gets you to 150km but you never survive the reentry, you fall through the atmosphere like a rock and when u hit about 20 km you start slowing down a little but still not enough and you hit the ground with 1 km/s.
