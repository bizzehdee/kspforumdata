When i right clicked the docking clamps i had \u0022decouple node\u0022 and \u0022control from here\u0022. So my question is what am i doing wrong? is there a different way to build the rocket so that i can deliver space station modules to LKO, even if the module has to have docking ports on both ends as it is going to connect two parts in a straight line?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T02:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDecouple node is basically the same as undock, but only applies to ports preattached in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T03:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERryy is right. When docking ports are attached in the VAB, they are treated like connected parts, as though they\u0027re decouplers (hence why you can attach them to anything, not just other ports). It\u0027s not until you decouple the connection that they act like docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-24T17:08:04Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2013 05:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kimberly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Adrigaar","CreatedById":80064,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T15:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh thank you, i tried this before using the set of four clamp-o-tron\u0027s and always wound up having them disconnect from both parts and float out into space but when i tried it with the Clamp-o-tron Sr. it worked perfectly.

This resulted in only one port being attached to both the quadcoupler and its opposing port while the rest were only connected to their opposing ports. If you want to use a tri- or quad-coupler setup (no reason for that now that we have big docking ports) you have to connect the docking ports to the quadcoupler first then attach the whole thing to the other set of docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
