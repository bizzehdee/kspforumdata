You need to be approaching half orbital velocity if memory serves in order to get red flames. 400-500m/s I\u0027d consider realistic with a super steep trajectory, but a thousand? That doesn\u0027t sound right. I could be wrong, of course, since I didn\u0027t see your descent, but it just doesn\u0027t sound right. The service bay isn\u0027t nearly heavy enough to ruin your ballistic coefficient that much, especially not with barely anything in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps you will be able to get a proper reentry with the advice you\u0027ve gotten here. With that kind of craft, you should be able to safely open your chutes at at least 4 kilometers up, even without the silly \u0022open service bay doors for drag\u0022 trick. Aerodynamic effects should be completely gone by that point too, even the white ones. If you can pull off something similar to that, then everything is fine and I\u0027m just interpretating your words wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if your craft still goes way faster than that, something isn\u0027t right with the drag on the way down. Check the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Make sure nothing you put into your service bay clips through the bottom floor too much. Parts have a tendency to attach partially clipped into the floor of service bays. You don\u0027t want the part to sink in so much that its collider (which you can\u0027t see) extends below that of the service bay, making that part become the primary drag inducer on your way down. And that part is definitely gonna induce less drag than the much larger service bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Did you do a straight reinstall, or did you upgrade KSP from an older version? Sometimes, especially in older days, KSP just doesn\u0027t like upgrading, and something with the physics might get screwy. If you updated, try backing up your save (if it\u0027s even worth it if you are so early in the playthrough) and installing the game from scratch. If it\u0027s already a fresh installation, nevertheless delete physics.cfg and partdatabase.cfg in your KSP root directory. They will be recreated the next time you start the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MoridinUK","CreatedById":110633,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-18T10:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002298962\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Streetwind\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u00A0Me? \u00A0me??
