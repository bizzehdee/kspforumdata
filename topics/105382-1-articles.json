The obvious one is to get the lengths of parts to match. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA slightly less obvious one would be to modify the black beveling such that it only extends the edge as far as the edge is thick, so that attaching parts at angles will not result in any protrusions. And further, to change the edging from a \u0022double angled\u0022 bevel into a single 45 degree bevel. If this is done, it may also be worthwhile to edge all sides of all pieces instead of having some sides edged and some not edged.

The problem with wings in KSP is that nothing you can build can withstand the weight. Massive wings just don\u0027t have the internal support real aircraft have. So they collapse under their own weight when far enough away from the fuselage- regardless of struts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal life aircraft- such as the Spruce Goose (current record holder for longest wingspan of an aircraft that was flown- also made out of wood hence \u0022Spruce\u0022) have materials that are either lightweight enough to support its own weight as it gets further away from the fuselage- or the wings have internal structural devices to keep the wing straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.zenithair.com/design/stol-wing-skeleton.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022stol-wing-skeleton.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs shown here- the wing has a main bar going through the wing to keep it straight along with several pieces going down from the front to the back of the wing to keep it straight. KSP simply just doesn\u0027t have that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only solution is to make single part wings and the issue is there are too many different styles of wings. For example- there\u0027s the Boeing 747 style wing, then there an Antanov-225 wing, then there\u0027s a AC-130 wing... There are too many types of wings for there to be any simple solution...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso- proceedural wings although a good idea- come at the cost of ruining the fun of MAKING aircraft. If I can get whatever wings I need the way I need them then KSP becomes too easy. However if you WANT that then you can download the mod. What I said is my own opinion but what I can say is that the devs likely won\u0027t go for it as it removes several key elements of the game that make it what it is. Such as being able to make your own fuel tanks and engines for rockets- it ruins the whole \u0022engineering\u0022 challenge and going anywhere becomes simplistic and easy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I hope this helped and spread some light on some things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BoomShroom","CreatedById":124216,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T15:57:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was honestly expecting something closer to stock-a-like B9 wings.
