A larger number of sections decreases the amount of texture warping, but increases number of texture seams, which can sometimes be problematic. This is personal preference but I think 8 sections is a good balance. Here I\u0027ve also kept the middle two face loops completely connected and edited those UVs to be a perfect rectangle, in case I want to easily add a horizontal texture later on, like text or a straight line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis model is unwrapped without any overlap but you can bake AO on models with overlapping UV. Whether or not it looks good depends on two things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWhether the overlapping islands are the same and in the same place, which will happen if you duplicate a mesh. This will allow the AO to look the same for all duplicates.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhether the overlapping islands receive the same ambient light. This means the surrounding geometry must be the same and in the same place with respect to all duplicates. This precludes the AO artefacts which are the result of the program fighting over which light intensity to choose.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth of these must be true if you want good looking overlapping AO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind that overlapping UVs might (depending your your model) make it more difficult to remove texture seams with texture paint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen choosing your texture size, which can be done at any point before you baking AO, you should keep in mind pixel density. \u003Cstrong\u003E128px/m\u003C/strong\u003E is probably pushing the boundaries of what looks good and it\u0027s the minimum you should be aiming for. \u003Cstrong\u003E256px/m\u003C/strong\u003E is roughly the pixel density of B9 parts and it\u0027s a good balance between memory usage and good looking parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pixel density in the example above is a little under 128px/m. This is partly because of the large amount of empty space between the UV islands. You will have a lot of fun optimising texture space usage especially if you decide to keep rings intact. Blender has tools for automatically equalising pixel density and for optimising texture space usage, but it works best with convex UV islands. It will not place smaller UV islands inside enclosed islands like a ring or even concave islands like something in the shape of a \u0022C\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe example above is only one part, but if you have a project with more than one .mu files or parts you can save memory by filling in the unused texture space with UVs from more than one mesh object, but remember that each mesh object in a .mu file can only have one material applied to it. Sharing a texture between meshes can save memory, but doesn\u0027t necessarily save HDD space. In order to keep your textures as small as possible in terms of disk space, make sure that the unused space in a texture is all a single colour. This helps with compression of some file types.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also see here the Ambient Occlusion map with the settings I used. The default settings make AO really blurred, so I decreased the Attenuation distance to 20cm. I think that\u0027s more realistic that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ring tops and bottoms are continuous, again to keep texture seaming to a minimum. It\u0027s not the most efficient but it makes for nicer textures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s very difficult to predict the amount of time you\u0027ll spend unwrapping a model, since it\u0027s directly linked to the complexity of the model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EImage #2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis shows the way I\u0027ve unwrapped that bent pipe section. This way isn\u0027t always necessary, but keeping all the UVs parallel and perpendicular allows you do easily make textures that look like they\u0027re made of interlocking rings (like those shower head bendy hoses for example). This works best when the pipe was made mathematically perfect, with a bezier curve for example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3366cc;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETexture foundation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EImage #3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI downloaded a scratched metal texture from a free website, and decreased the contrast so it\u0027s not as noisy.

Blender allows you to export the \u003Cstrong\u003EUV layout\u003C/strong\u003E in SVG format, which you\u0027ll need to open in Inkscape and merge all the objects into one. This can then be imported into GIMP as \u003Cstrong\u003Epaths\u003C/strong\u003E. If you don\u0027t merge all the faces in Inkscape then each triangle will be imported as a separate path. You can of course merge various groups of faces into separate objects in the SVG file, and each merged object will be imported as a separate path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EImages #9, #10, #11, and #12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my experience (and I have no professional training) there are three main way of applying colour to a texture. They are done using the various \u003Cstrong\u003ELayer Modes\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMultiply\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E (\u003Cstrong\u003E#9\u003C/strong\u003E). This is to make an existing texture have a different colour while keeping the the noise underneath similar. This is good for making the texture look like it\u0027s made of a particular material, like the copper pipe.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOverlay or Hard Light\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E (\u003Cstrong\u003E#10 and #11\u003C/strong\u003E). This is to make a surface look like it has paint on it. I used this to \u0022paint\u0022 the tank grey, and add the stripes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENormal\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E (\u003Cstrong\u003E#12\u003C/strong\u003E). This is best for adding something that\u0027s meant to be a decal, like the warning labels.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of these should be between your AO Multiply layer and your background layer. You can obviously experiment with other layer modes for colours, but I think these three are the most important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should mention that the less UV overlap you have, the more varied your texture can be. My way of unwrapping allowed me to add two different warning labels and leave all other sides grey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EImage #13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the result. I literally did nothing except what I described here. It\u0027s starting to look good, but there are still three main things to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis took me a couple of hours but I spent most of that time experimenting with what looks best.

I looked for a metal texture with lots of scratches, and edited it to be greyscale, with a white background and prominent scratches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll you need to do is desaturate, and adjust levels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EImage #15\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarting with a white background I painted the mask to a new image using Texture Paint as before, very roughly. I fix it later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EImage #16\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn GIMP you need to invert it. As a mask, the black parts determine what\u0027s invisible, and white determine what\u0027s visible. I edited everything to be more subtle in terms of size, dabbed away a lot with a dirt brush and increased the contrast a bit. The resulting mask is applied to a bright metal texture, which is placed right under the AO layer, because the scratches should affect paint and decals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI keep a backup of the mask because I\u0027ll use it later for the specular mask.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EImage #17\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nResult. I\u0027m pretty sure I didn\u0027t place the damage in all the right places, but this kind of thing is way beyond me. It would take some kind of simulation to determine realistic damage placement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can be done in about 30 minutes conservatively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpecular Map and Normal Map\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is probably the simplest part of this texture so I did them all in one go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EImage #18\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the specular map. It\u0027s composed of the layers from the colour map. All you need to do is copy all relevant layers, lock alpha of each of the layers and bucket fill each layer with an appropriate grey colour. All colours need to be greyscale. For parts like the copper pipe, I kept the noise, desaturated and adjusted levels.

Something I\u0027m going to start doing (and I\u0027d also recommend) is to keep a 1m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E box in my default blender file, with a colour grid applied to it with a pixel density of 256px/m. This is roughly what B9 parts are (I haven\u0027t played KSP in a while, so that may have changed) It\u0027s a good enough density as a minimum. With that cube in your scene you can then unwrap your actual models while keeping the pixels looking the same size.
